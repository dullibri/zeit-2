Securities Industry Pushes To Limit State Enforcement
Some members of the securities industry have started lobbying Capitol Hill to stop states from bringing enforcement actions against brokerage firms. A proposed amendment would shut down state investigations into conflicts among analysts and restrict states' enforcement of securities laws.
 State regulators say they have a duty to protect investors. The question, they say, is whether to stand with millions of investors or a handful of Wall Street firms. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Energy Call to Action 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Missing from David Gergen's laudable call to action for Americans after Sept. 11 is an appeal to urgently address our country's energy challenge ("A Nation in Search of Its Mission," Op-Ed, June 17). 
 Sept. 11 was as much of an alarm as the 1973 oil embargo. 
It is imperative that we respond this time by making sure that America will not be held hostage by unfriendly oil suppliers who finance terrorism and teach hatred of the West.
In 1973, America imported 28 percent of its crude oil. Today, the figure is 59 percent, and 30 percent of it comes from the Persian Gulf, principally Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and yes, Iraq.
Increasingly popular S.U.V.'s are subject to laxer mileage standards than cars. Even for cars, fuel economy standards have not been raised since the 1980's.
There are no simple formulas for developing a national energy policy, but the high stakes should jolt us all into action.

HEADLINE: Notes From Tysons Corner; 
A Suburb All Grown Up and Paved Over

BYLINE:  By David Plotz; David Plotz is the Washington bureau chief of Slate.

DATELINE: TYSONS CORNER, Va. 

 BODY:
The first commandment of the suburbs used to be Not in My Back Yard. Apparently now it is Not in Your Front Yard -- at least here in Fairfax County, Va., just over the Potomac from Washington.
 Earlier this month the county council passed a law forbidding homeowners from paving over their front yards to create extra parking spaces. This legislation is directed not at the mansion-owners of Reston, who have ample room for their fleets of Beemers, but at the immigrants sardined into houses in the county's less tony neighborhoods, like Groveton. There has apparently been a rash of yard-paving: the owners of these houses have asphalted the lawn so they have a place to put the three, four or six cars that their sisters and husbands and cousins need to get to work. 
 Fairfax isn't the only jurisdiction that is fighting yard-paving; Boston and San Francisco are, too. But there is something absurd in the idea of Fairfax trying to limit car ownership. Like most suburbs, Fairfax County owes not just its existence but its prosperity to the automobile. Its major landmarks are intersections (Bailey's Crossroads, Tysons Corner, Seven Corners and so on). And there's something equally silly in the notion that stopping pave-overs somehow preserves Fairfax's natural beauty -- as if any remained. One councilwoman said she supported the bill because pave-overs had "nibbled away" at Fairfax's green space.
Nibbled is right: When you add up the malls and highways and condos and office parks and malls and malls, what's left is enough greenery for a side salad. Every neighborhood in Fairfax is named after the nature that was destroyed to build it: Rose Hill, Blueberry Farm, Sycamore Lakes -- every place but Money's Corner.
The paving regulation stems partly, of course, from the usual paranoia about property values. Grass sells better than asphalt. But the regulation may succeed only in moving cars from the front lawn to the front curb. As soon as the pave-over law passed, at least one resident griped that it would encourage people to park on the street. No doubt the council will be weighing street parking bans next. 
The true cause of the pave-over law, however, is not parking. It's Fairfax's midlife crisis. Fairfax County, which strutted and preened through the 1990's, is having some bad years. America Online, which was born and raised here, married Time Warner and moved its headquarters to New York City. Michael Saylor, Fairfax County's very own Internet billionaire, has become a pariah, his crippled company, Microstrategy, a symbol of all that was wrong with the tech bubble. The richest county in America according to the 1990 census, Fairfax discovered a few weeks ago that it has now dropped to No. 2.
Yet the roots of the crisis here go even deeper. Since the 1970's, Fairfax has morphed from a bucolic exurb into its own metropolis, a hotbed of industry and commerce. The typical lazy comforts of the distant suburb have vanished; the danger and disorder of the city always seem to be encroaching. The county's population will top a million any day now -- nearly twice that of Washington itself.
Growth is not new to the county, but immigrants are. The number of immigrants in Fairfax jumped 86 percent in the 90's, to nearly a quarter of the population. (Essentially all the population growth came from immigrants and their children.) A third of county residents now speak a language other than English at home, more than twice the national average.
Fairfax is the very model of the benefits of immigration. Southeast Asians, Indians, Arabs, Pakistanis, West Africans, East Africans and Latin Americans have all settled here in huge numbers, but the county remains wonderfully mixed up. It lacks ethnic enclaves. Immigration has accomplished the impossible in Fairfax: it has made the county interesting, with the area's best and oddest ethnic restaurants and stores.
Fairfax's high-tech industry has relied heavily on highly educated foreign workers. At the same time, though without the same eagerness, Fairfax has accepted tens of thousands of low-skill immigrants. They are the backbone of the county's service sector. Working-class immigrants move to Fairfax because that is where the jobs are. They pack houses because rents and home prices are so high they can't afford to live in less cramped conditions. They buy cars because that's the only way they can get to the jobs that everyone wants them to do. And so they pave driveways.
Poverty rates have climbed with the arrival of these immigrants, and middle-class neighbors feel squeezed. The pave-over bill is only the most recent manifestation of their worry. Last year a state senator from Fairfax introduced a bill to the Virginia Legislature that would forbid Virginians from sleeping in living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens and closets. The measure was withdrawn immediately after loud complaints from civil libertarians and immigrant groups.
Fairfax is growing up faster than its residents can adjust. Like many sprawled suburbs, it has consumed its youthful vim and isn't quite sure what to do now. In the space of a generation, Fairfax lost its rural character and its middle-class white identity. In exchange it has won jobs, businesses and bustling, hustling immigrants.
The pave-over battle is a small rearguard action to preserve some vision of a Fairfax past, and in a way it's oddly encouraging. It signals the success of the American melting pot: Fairfax County has undergone great change, causing enormous upheaval, and all anyone can find to fight about is parking.

HEADLINE: Retirement Rules Gone, the Ivory Tower Goes Gray 

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
At 78, Robert G. Shulman remains an active and distinguished member of the academic community at Yale.
 Holding the title of Sterling professor, Yale's most prestigious rank, in the department of molecular biophysics and biochemistry, Dr. Shulman still goes to his laboratory every day, where he conducts research on brain metabolism while teaching advanced biochemistry to M.D.-Ph.D. candidates at Yale Medical School. 
 Until the end of the spring semester, when he finally decided to give it up, Dr. Shulman was also a team teacher of an undergraduate seminar on science and literature. 
"There are things I've wanted to do and I can do them here," he said, explaining why he continues to work full time when other colleagues have long since retired.
Eight years after Congress put an end to college regulations that forced faculty members to retire by 70, a growing number of professors have begun working past that age.
This is particularly true at some premier Northeastern institutions like Yale, Columbia and New York University, but at other leading research universities, like the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins, faculty members also remain highly motivated and working conditions are close to ideal.
Some college administrators continue to argue, as many did before the retirement rules were changed in 1994, that the new workplace environment encourages professors protected by tenure to stay well beyond their prime. This, they say, prevents promising younger scholars, particularly women and members of racial minorities, from gaining permanent positions.
Other administrators say they are losing the energy and ideas that younger professors bring to their fields. 
"The problem is double-edged," said Jonathan R. Cole, provost of Columbia. "Chronological age is not always a good indicator of research and teaching ability, and some of the most cherished members of our faculty" are older than 70.
But, he said, a major research university "always needs to revitalize itself with new ideas and new perspectives and those more often than not come from younger faculty members."
Still, the evidence suggests that although many faculty members may indeed be putting off retirement, a great majority of them are still retiring by their mid-60's, and the trend of working longer has not been a major factor in the overall decline of employment opportunities at most colleges.
Ronald G. Ehrenberg, the Irving M. Ives professor of industrial and labor relations and economics at Cornell, noted, for example, that while the number of full-time faculty jobs shrunk significantly over the last decade, the primary reason has been fiscal. Teaching jobs have been eliminated or converted to part-time positions to save money. "The vast majority of American faculty are going to retire before age 70, so lifting the age cap is not going to be that important at most institutions," he said.
The exception, he and others say, appears to be at the nation's elite private research universities, where professors tend to work longer than their colleagues at other institutions, and where there is more pressure to remain productive and stay in the forefront of scholarship.
"These are people that are just so tied to their jobs they cannot conceive of doing something else and they want to keep working," said Dr. Ehrenberg, who is chairman of the committee on retirement for the American Association of University Professors.
Exactly how many faculty members are now working past 70 is not known. David Card, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a co-author of a major study last year on changing retirement patterns in academia, estimates that perhaps as much as 1.8 percent of the faculty members at the nation's four-year colleges and universities are now 70 or older, whereas eight years ago, virtually none were. But he noted that data in his study, done with Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton, showed there was much variation among institutions and that the percentage of older faculty members appeared to be significantly higher at some of the nation's best-known institutions.
Calls to several universities seemed to confirm that. At Yale, almost 9 percent of the 370 tenured faculty members in core arts and sciences faculty are 70 or older. At Princeton, 4.9 percent are; Columbia, 7 percent; Harvard, 7 percent; New York University, 7 to 10 percent; and Johns Hopkins, about 10 percent.
For the last few years, Columbia has offered a $30,000 financial incentive to professors who retire before the age of 70. But the steady rise in the ranks of older professors -- and complaints by department chairmen that they were losing flexibility to hire new teachers -- prompted the university this year to offer members of the arts and sciences faculty who were 70 or older a one-time offer of a full year's paid leave if they retired by June 30. To date, 14 faculty members have accepted the offer, according to David H. Cohen, vice president for arts and sciences.
A trend seems to be growing among colleges and universities to offer retirement incentives. It began building in the early 1990's when it became clear that Congress would eliminate the exemption universities had under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
"Before the early 90's, most universities could rely on mandatory retirement rules to eliminate any uncertainty they faced about planning," said P. Brett Hammond, co-editor of a book about retirement policy and practice in higher education. "A faculty member turned 70 and that was it. 
Or, if a professor was felt not to be pulling his weight, "a dean might put his arm around a guy and ask what it would take to get him to leave," Mr. Hammond said."
But taking their cue from the University of California, several big public universities began offering buyouts, in which faculty members received cash payments or pension enhancements for agreeing to retire in a certain time period.
Another popular plan is a phased-in program under which professors have a chance to acclimate themselves to the idea of leaving by allowing them to teach reduced course loads for a fixed period of time at lower pay.
Yale has a phased-in program with two options. Under one, a faculty member between 59 and 67 with at least 15 years of service can reduce his administrative responsibilities, including supervision of doctoral dissertations, while keeping his full-time responsibilities for teaching and research for up to three years, and still receive his full salary. 
Under the second option, the faculty member can reduce his teaching and research load by half for up to three years, but he would receive half his salary. Under both options, Yale permits the faculty member to begin receiving his pension.
Although experts say that the problems created by the lifting of mandatory retirement rules are limited in scope thus far, they also say it is difficult to say if they will stay that way. 
Most of today's professors were hired during the heyday of university expansion during the 1960's and 1970's. Statistics show that almost half of the tenured professors in the country are 55 or older, and it is hard to tell whether retirements will continue at the current rate.
Other variables are economic conditions. Mr. Hammond, who is director of portfolio studies for TIAA-CREF, the giant fund that manages the pensions of more than half the nation's faculty members, said that under the bull market conditions of the 1990's, the average retiring faculty member had a good chance of receiving at least 70 percent of his final year's salary from his pension account combined with Social Security.
But if the recent downturn in the market continues, he said, that could change a lot of minds about retirement.
"If market conditions are not as robust as they have been, one option is to keep working longer, and professors have that option," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Gauges Are Mixed in an Up-and-Down Day on Wall St.

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks closed narrowly mixed, fluctuating throughout the session as investors cashed in some profits from a rally on Monday. A revenue downgrade for I.B.M. reminded investors that an economic recovery was not assured.
 The news on I.B.M. was offset somewhat by an upbeat housing report. Analysts said investors who felt more optimistic on Monday about a business recovery seemed less willing to commit to stocks until the rebound in earnings and the economy was more of a sure thing. 
 "Most of our customers are waiting for a time when they feel more confident about doing something," said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
After shifting between gains and losses through the day, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 18.70 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,706.12. The advance was slight compared with the 213-point surge on Monday when the Dow claimed its biggest daily point gain since May 8, when it rose 305.28 points.
Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.97 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,037.14, having climbed nearly 29 points on Monday, its best daily advance since May 8, when it rose 39.36. The Nasdaq composite index declined 10.33 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,542.96, after rising 48.55 points on Monday to achieve its best one-day gain since rising 66.51 points on May 14.
Analysts said the fluctuations also had to do with its efforts to find a normal trading range after more erratic sessions, the rally on Monday and big losses last week, when the Dow had two triple-digit declines.
Investors seemed encouraged by a report from the Commerce Department that said housing construction rose 11.6 percent in May, the largest increase since July 1995. Home builders advanced on the housing news; Lennar rose $1.80, to $57.30.
But I.B.M. was the weak spot, and its shares fell $1.20, to $75.94, after Morgan Stanley lowered its revenue outlook for the second quarter as well as 2002 and 2003.
Over all, technology stocks were mixed. Shares in Intel fell 54 cents, to $22.02, while shares in Microsoft rose 31 cents, to $55.99.
Investors punished companies that said profits continued to languish. Shares in the electronics retailer Best Buy sank $2.51, to $39.75.
The market was uninspired by the Labor Department's report that consumer prices were flat in May. That was the best showing in inflation in five months and an improvement over the 0.5 percent increase in April.
Still, analysts said the market's lackluster performance was not surprising given the strides the market made Monday after four weeks of selling on concerns about earnings, the economy and conflicts overseas. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Treasuries rebounded from early losses to stand mostly firmer yesterday, encouraged that equities lacked the strength to support a second day of hefty gains.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased 3/32, to 100 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 4.83 percent from 4.85 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond increased 2/32, to 98 25/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.46 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.868
High Rate: 1.695
Coupon Yield: 1.723

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Making Waves on Air: Big Radio's Bad Boy

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
Wall Street admires the nation's largest radio broadcasting conglomerate, Clear Channel Communications, as a fast-growing, profitable multimedia empire. It includes the largest chain of radio stations -- five times the number of its nearest rival -- and the biggest collection of billboards, as well as growing collections of television stations and concert halls.
 Among its competitors and some cultural critics, however, Clear Channel is referred to as "the evil empire" -- or worse. They complain that the company, based in San Antonio, has made its money by filling its broadcasts with prefabricated nonlocal programming or with tasteless fare that hit bottom last year when one of its disc jockeys in Tampa, Fla., had a wild boar castrated and killed in the parking lot of his station while he described the scene and added recorded pig squeals on the air. 
 But in some ways, many rivals of Clear Channel -- including Cumulus Media, the Infinity Radio unit of Viacom and Citadel Communications -- are increasingly copying it. They are courting advertisers and listeners with moves that come directly from Clear Channel's playbook -- even if they do not involve livestock. They are also scrambling to acquire more stations, to come closer to matching Clear Channel's huge audience. 
The reason is simple. Clear Channel, in the last two years, has acquired enough stations of its own -- it now has 1,200, about one-tenth of all radio stations -- to dominate the industry. It ranks No. 1 in 5 of the top 10 markets and No. 2 in four others, sometimes commanding more than a third of all listeners. In some top-25 markets, like Denver and Cleveland, about half of all listeners tune in to Clear Channel stations. Inside Radio, an independent industry newsletter, estimates that Clear Channel has a larger national audience than the four next-largest broadcasters combined.
"Being up against those guys is forcing us to become more resourceful," said Lewis Dickey, chairman and chief executive of Cumulus, the No. 2 radio broadcaster as measured by number of stations -- it owns 248. "They are very aggressive, so now we're more aggressive. They've set the standard that we're responding to."
Clear Channel's aggressive approach includes cost-cutting -- it has replaced many local radio hosts, for example, with recorded music programs spiked with local color for individual stations, or with syndicated talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlesinger. But with 770,000 billboards, 135 concert halls and 19 television stations -- and 18 more being acquired -- Clear Channel also has the resources to undercut competitors on price while wooing advertisers with cross-promotion over many different media. Few rivals, for example, can promote a music group on their stations, book the act in their clubs and amphitheaters, then advertise the tour on their billboards.
"There is a very strong sentiment that they have done a disservice to broadcasting, by using their clout in a way that makes it difficult for smaller companies to compete," said Reed Bunzel, chief editor of Radio Ink, a trade publication. "A lot of people in the business really hate Clear Channel."
None of this has stopped other broadcasters from adopting many strategies pioneered by Clear Channel, including million-dollar contests for listeners and attractive package deals for advertisers that cover many stations. Some competitors have started working together to ask advertisers to place ads with them as a group, to counter Clear Channel's new push to entice advertisers to sign exclusive deals to pitch products across its empire.
Competitors are also bulking up, aiming to meet Clear Channel head-on. Mr. Dickey said Cumulus, which is based in Atlanta, would try to double or triple in size over the next three to five years through acquisitions. "The one thing we've learned from Clear Channel is the advantages of size and scale," he said.
Beyond the big companies, thousands of one- and two-station broadcasters are hunkering down in their markets. Lacking the capital to grow but mindful that radio is a local medium, these smaller companies are working to counter Clear Channel's national reach by appealing more to local advertisers -- sending D.J.'s to car dealership promotions and high school football games, for example.
Clear Channel itself started small -- with a single FM radio station in San Antonio in 1972, when L. Lowry Mays, a former investment banker, was stuck with the station after a partner backed out of a deal to buy it. The company grew slowly, to 36 stations by the time the landmark federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 loosened station ownership restrictions. That set off a wave of consolidation and reshaped the industry.
Led by Mr. Mays as chief executive -- he has installed two sons, Randall and Mark, in senior management positions, and family members own or control more than 33 million shares of Clear Channel, or about 5.5 percent of the company -- Clear Channel gobbled up broadcasters from coast to coast, growing into a behemoth in the late 1990's. It vaulted into the No. 1 position two years ago, when it bought what was then the largest radio broadcaster, AMFM Inc. of Dallas, for $23.8 billion.
Competitors like Cumulus, Infinity and Citadel, which is based in Las Vegas and owned by Forstmann Little, went on smaller buying sprees. Still, they created a tiered industry with a few large conglomerates and scores of smaller players.
With its size and muscle, Clear Channel has prompted complaints from rivals that it resembles a monopoly. The Federal Communications Commission has said that it is investigating the company and other broadcasters to see whether consolidation has resulted in less diversity in programming. Senator Russell Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said last week that he was preparing a bill that would impose restrictions on the radio and concert industries, in part because of Clear Channel's tactics. An Illinois woman filed a class-action lawsuit in United States District Court in Manhattan last week, accusing Clear Channel of using its market power to inflate the price of concert tickets.
On its Web site, the company says its share of all radio advertising dollars is around 20 percent. For 2001, Clear Channel's radio business had revenue of approximately $3.4 billion, or 43 percent of the company's total. The company reported a first-quarter loss of $17 billion, to reflect changes in how it accounts for good will and other intangible assets. Without those one-time changes, it showed a profit of $73 million, about what Wall Street analysts had forecast.
Many brokerage firms, like Merrill Lynch, are bullish about the company's prospects as the economy picks up. Its stock has fallen about 11 percent this year, hurt recently by a competitor's challenge to Clear Channel's attempt to buy the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation, while shares of competitors like Cumulus and Radio One Inc. have risen 10 to 20 percent or more.
Clear Channel already uses its size to promote "cluster" sales of ads. Some are across geographic areas, while others may include all its stations with a particular music format, like hip-hop. Others are "cross-platform" sales that give advertisers access to different types of media, from radio to billboards. "We try to adapt our assets to whatever trading area you, Mr. Customer, might have," said Mark P. Mays, the president and chief operating officer and the older son of Lowry Mays. The younger son, Randall T. Mays, is the chief financial officer.
Now that advertising rates are firming as the economy emerges from recession, Clear Channel is flexing even more muscle in the scramble for ad revenue.
It recently persuaded Arbitron Inc., the listener ratings agency, to lump Clear Channel's eight stations in Florida into one customized "trading zone," with a single rating for the entire group. (Stations have traditionally been rated according to set geographic areas, usually broken down by county.)
The new system, which will take effect later this year and supplement the traditional system, may give Clear Channel a competitive advantage by making it look as though it has strong listener ratings across Florida, not just in particular counties. Advertisers use Arbitron ratings when deciding where to buy ads and how much to pay.
The move will put smaller broadcasters with fewer stations at a disadvantage before advertisers, said Warren S. Lada, the senior vice president for operations at Saga Communications, a broadcaster based in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. Saga owns 61 stations, none in Florida.
Even some much smaller broadcasters are trying to use some Clear Channel tactics.
Last month, Clear Channel sought to scoop up all the dollars that a major advertiser was planning to spend on radio in Philadelphia, said Chuck Fleming, who oversees the national media business at the McGavern Guild, a company in New York that represents radio stations to national advertisers.
Fighting back, three smaller broadcasters with a total of five stations in Philadelphia -- Greater Media, based in New Brunswick, N.J.; the Beasley Broadcast Group in Naples, Fla.; and WEAZ FM Radio of Bala Cynwyd, Pa. -- matched Clear Channel's bid.
Broadcasters are finding other ways to fight for revenue. The Susquehanna Media Group, which owns 29 stations in eight markets, plans to start selling access to its database, with profiles of 1.6 million listeners gleaned from contests and other promotions, for advertisers' direct-mail campaigns, said Peter Brubaker, Susquehanna's chief executive and president.
On another front, smaller competitors that once offered only modest contest prizes like restaurant gift certificates are increasingly staging million-dollar cash giveaways. 
The contests, which Clear Channel pioneered on the national level, have been criticized in the past as not making clear that the same contest runs on many stations simultaneously and that listeners are competing with audiences from stations around the country. In 2000, the Florida attorney general fined Clear Channel $80,000 for misleading listeners about one such contest and ordered it to clearly promote its future contests as national, not local.
For its part, Clear Channel appears to regard its rivals' me-too moves with a characteristic brash confidence.
"When you're a pioneer, you get a lot of arrows in your back," said Pam Taylor, a spokeswoman for the company. "But then people pick them out and say, 'Oh, that's not so bad.' "

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Wednesday about the dominance of Clear Channel Communications in the radio industry referred incorrectly to the company's relationship with the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation. It owns 26 percent of Hispanic Broadcasting; it has not tried to buy the entire company.

HEADLINE: Home Building Is Up Sharply; Price Index Flat 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18 

 BODY:
Home construction grew sharply in May, increasing at the fastest rate in nearly seven years, the Commerce Department reported today.
 The number of projects started last month rose by an unexpectedly high 11.6 percent in May, after two months of declines, the report said. 
 "The housing market suggests the economic recovery is on track and not as weak as the market perceives it to be," said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist for Global Partners Securities. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that consumer prices, a measure of inflation, were unchanged in May, leaving Federal Reserve interest rate setters with few worries of mounting price pressures. 
"Inflation is not a threat at this point," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "Policy makers are going to want to make sure the economic recovery is sustainable before they raise rates." 
The housing market, aided by the lowest mortgage rates in decades, continued to turn in a strong performance last month. 
"Housing starts confirm that low mortgage rates continue to keep the housing market strong," said Edgar Peters of PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. "Rising housing prices are offsetting the negative wealth effect from the stock market so that consumers continue to feel as if their financial situation is stable." 
Groundbreaking for new houses jumped to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.733 million from a downward revised 1.553 million pace in April, the biggest rise since July 1995, the Commerce Department said. Starts of single-family homes, the largest category of activity, jumped 9.6 percent, an increase also unmatched since July 1995. 
Many economists had thought that last year's torrid pace of housing construction was ready to slow, but the sector has proved resilient with mortgage rates below 7 percent. 
Consumer prices in May were flat. Held down in part by declining energy and food prices, the Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation barometer, was flat in May after a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent rise in April. Excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core price index rose 0.2 percent, after gaining 0.3 percent in April. 
"It's still too early to make firm predictions, but we may be heading for one of the better-case recovery scenarios -- an economy growing moderately and creating new jobs but not strong enough to generate worrisome inflationary pressures," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services.

HEADLINE: Albany's Work Is Not Done 

 BODY:
In a State Legislature as addicted to behind-the-scenes dealmaking as New York's, it's possible to accomplish a great deal very quickly. As the lawmakers in Albany move into the final days of their official session, there is plenty of work still on the table. Some important proposals, such as reorganization of the jumbled judicial system, can't be jump-started at this late date. But others are close to resolution. If officials don't get them done, they should be ashamed to face the voters this November. 
 Reform of the state's arcane Rockefeller drug laws, which impose cruelly long prison terms even for nonviolent offenders, is one priority that appears to be in danger of falling through the cracks. Prosecutors prefer the current system of mandatory terms because it gives them most of the real sentencing power. This is an area where Gov. George Pataki should show his leadership and negotiate a decent compromise between his own narrower bill and the Assembly's already modified offering. 
 For wage earners, the Legislature should raise the state's minimum wage, now only $5.15 an hour, and pass an extension of unemployment insurance for as many as 100,000 New Yorkers who are about to run through their benefits.
Resolving three environmental issues should also be within the Legislature's reach. Superfund, aimed at cleaning up highly toxic industrial sites, ran out of money long ago and needs to be reactivated. A brownfields program, which deals with less dangerous sites that can more easily be reclaimed, can be started at little cost since much of the money would come from developers. The law on siting of power plants expires this year, providing a golden opportunity to preserve the best features of the present law while closing loopholes that allow utilities to build small but dirty plants as long as they fall below a certain generating threshold. 
Once again the Legislature threatens to adjourn without approving basic civil rights legislation barring discrimination against gay people in employment, housing and public accommodations. The opposition lies in the Republican-majority State Senate, and Governor Pataki should persuade fellow party members to take action. Senate Republicans are also blocking a reasonable proposal by the Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, to create a new sewer and storm water authority to help close a budget deficit that was built up under Mr. Suozzi's irresponsible G.O.P. predecessor.
A promising statewide ban on smoking in restaurants has stalled, under lobbying pressure from the small-restaurant owners who can now permit smoking in many parts of the state. Surveys show that bar and food revenues are not affected by smoking bans, and that they are popular with most customers. This is an election year, and if there's any time that Albany should be listening to majority sentiment rather than special interests, this is it.
There are other issues that the Legislature could still tackle if it really had the will. Despite much hand-wringing, nothing has been done yet about auto insurance rates. There is also time to pass a law giving customers more protection against predatory lending practices. This "sub-prime" or high-interest lending has ballooned in recent years, too often trapping borrowers who lose their homes.
Despite the long list of undone work, the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has vowed to close the session tomorrow. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has declared that his house will continue working. Mr. Silver has the right idea. The Legislature has hardly covered itself in so much glory this term that it can afford to walk away from so many important priorities.

HEADLINE: Governor Could Hold Up A Deal on Minimum Wage 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18 

 BODY:
The Senate and Assembly have reached a consensus on raising the minimum wage to $6.75 an hour from $5.15 over the next year and a half, but officials said today that resistance by Gov. George E. Pataki was keeping the Senate from closing the deal.
 Legislators and top aides sent conflicting signals today about whether the two houses actually have an agreement on the issue. A top member of the Senate's Republican majority said a deal was at hand; the Assembly's Democratic leadership confirmed that, then the Senate Republicans insisted that there was not. 
 "Unless we've got something that looks like it'll get signed by the governor, we don't have anything," said Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader. "Hopefully, we can get something together tomorrow."
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has said that he does not favor raising New York's minimum wage above the federal minimum of $5.15, which went into effect in 1997, arguing that it would put the state's businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Business groups, an important constituency for the governor, have fought hard against an increase.
"We continue to believe that an increase at the federal level would be preferable to taking action at the state level," said Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor.
Vetoing a minimum wage bill would be an unpopular move in many quarters, particularly among the labor unions that Mr. Pataki has ardently courted as he runs for re-election this year. It would give his Democratic opponents a potent issue to use against him.
Republican Senate officials have said they want to raise the wage, but the governor has expressed reservations, and they are reluctant to put Mr. Pataki in a position of having to sign or veto such a bill. "We're not going to jam the governor," one said.
The state A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Working Families Party, a labor-backed group, have campaigned hard this year for a minimum wage bill, suggesting that passage could mean endorsements for some Republican senators in tight races for re-election. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the bill would mean increased pay for 600,000 workers who now earn less than $6.75 an hour.
When asked late this afternoon how things were progressing on the issue, Senator Guy J. Velella, the chairman of the Labor Committee and sponsor of the bill, said: "I think it's pretty well resolved. Everybody's on the same page, conceptually. All that's left is working out the language."
But, he cautioned, "It could all blow up in the next minute."
When asked to confirm that, legislative aides put it more strongly, saying that a deal had been struck by the two houses.
"We've done this bill for three years, and I'm glad that the Senate has finally seen the wisdom," Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said.
But tonight, Mr. Bruno insisted that there was still no agreement. To support that argument, he handed his phone to Mr. Velella, who described the situation much as he had originally.
The tentative deal officials described would raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6 on Jan. 1, 2003, and to $6.75 on Jan. 1, 2004.
That would put New York in a tie for the second-highest minimum in the country, after Washington state, whose minimum is $6.90 and indexed to inflation, so that it automatically rises every Jan. 1. Massachusetts and California have $6.75 minimums now, and Connecticut is next, at $6.70. In all, 10 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum, according to the United States Department of Labor.
In other business today, the governor and two legislative leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on changes in requirements for teenagers to get a driver's license. Under the agreed-upon bill, a teenager could still get a learner's permit at age 16, but would have to complete 20 hours of driving over a six-month period with supervising adults before being allowed to take a driver's test. That would qualify the teenager for a junior license, which would be valid for driving only from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.
To resolve complaints of rural legislators who have teenage constituents who need to drive to work, the legislation would create a limited-class license for minors with a learner's permit, letting them drive to school, work, medical appointments and day care. The Senate passed the bill today, and the Assembly could take it up as early as Thursday.

HEADLINE: Some Neighbors Seek Greater Voice on Plans For Sept. 11 Memorial 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Nearly everyone who has addressed the subject agrees that a memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11 attack should be central to the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site. But few people agree how to proceed -- or even how to get started.
 Downtown residents and civic groups say they are worried that the early planning for a memorial is being left behind or closed to public input. Meanwhile, the official rebuilding effort is hurtling toward a master plan for the site. Work on transportation projects has already begun in the pit, and an urban planning and architectural firm hired by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation will unveil six proposals for an overall design within the next month. And while an advisory committee of family members of victims has begun memorial discussions, few if any others have been invited to the table so far. 
 "The more the planning for the site goes forward without an integrated memorial process, the harder it will be to integrate the two and come up with a comprehensive plan," said Jill Lerner, a co-coordinator of the memorial process committee for New York New Visions, a civic group that has worked on recommendations for the redevelopment of downtown. 
Development corporation officials disagree, saying that planning for the memorial should begin with the families. They add that the memorial is dependent to a large extent on options in the master plan proposals being put together by Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural and planning firm working on the initial six designs for the site.
"Some people have said that they don't feel included, but it seems to us that the families is the logical place to begin," said Louis R. Tomson, president of the corporation. 
Questions about the memorial process came into stark focus last week after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others made comments about the memorial and plans for the site. Mr. Bloomberg, in response to a question, said that a small, graceful memorial would be most appropriate. He also said that the process of creating a memorial was likely to be marked by much "yelling and screaming" and that few people would welcome the idea of turning the site into "a cemetery."
John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation, and Mr. Tomson each said last week that it was likely that the memorial would be in the southwest quadrant of the 16-acre site, in a parcel created by reinstating Greenwich and Fulton Streets through the site. Such a parcel, measuring up to seven acres, would include the footprints of the twin towers, which many family members have said they would like to have as part of the memorial.
But Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, which represents Lower Manhattan residents, said residents were concerned that a memorial planned without input from many different sectors would cast a pall over an area that needs to be vibrant once again.
"People in the neighborhood want to see a memorial that honors all of the people who were lost in the attack, but one that also honors the people who survived it," said Ms. Wils, who is also a member of the development corporation's board.
"It is very difficult to live and work in an area that other people consider a cemetery," she said. "I can understand how the families of victims feel that way. But this isn't Gettysburg; it isn't Normandy Beach. This is a place that is vital and one that wants to be vital again."
One thing that has held back planning for a memorial, even as the planning for the site has accelerated, is that relatives of many victims of the attack have not even been able to bring themselves to visit ground zero, much less talk about what should go there. 
The Families Advisory Council of the development corporation has started that discussion, said Nikki Stern, a member of the council. The group's 25 or so members have divided into two committees, one to focus on how to develop a memorial design and the other to discuss the content.
The development corporation is also planning to appoint someone to oversee the memorial process, but does not yet have a timetable for doing so, Mr. Tomson said. Ultimately, a competition is likely to be conducted for the memorial's design.
In mid-July, according to the development corporation's schedule issued in May, a memorial design process will be announced. Yet participants say that the location and size of a memorial plot will not be known until the end of the year at the earliest, because only then will a master plan for the site be chosen, under the corporation's schedule. 
"We need to be establishing benchmarks and integrating the memorial process with the planning effort," said Marian Imperatore, chairwoman of the memorial process committee for the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, a group put together by the Regional Plan Association and other civic groups. Ms. Imperatore's family owns NY Waterway, the ferry service that shuttles people between Lower Manhattan and New Jersey.
Not least among the planning considerations for a memorial is the need to accommodate millions of expected visitors each year, and the tour buses that bring them, in a heavily trafficked business district.
Holly Leicht, a co-director of Imagine New York, the largest effort so far to include the general public in discussions about the rebuilding, said the 4,000 participants in its forums were passionate about their desire to be included in the memorial discussion.
"They made clear that the public participation element had to become more prominent," Ms. Leicht said.
At a seminar last week sponsored by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, some designers who have worked independently on ideas for the site said that limiting the memorial to one corner of the site precludes more attractive options for the development as a whole. 
Such options include, for example, creating a memorial plaza extending westward along the northern border of the site from St. Paul's Chapel on Broadway, which became a temporary shrine to the victims and rescuers, to the World Financial Center on West Street.
Others say they believe the memorial should occupy some central portion of the site, drawing visitors in through a corridor, similar to the way the entrance to Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue draws in visitors to the central plaza. Hundreds of ideas have been floated already, including placing a memorial on the roof of a tall tower or forming a memorial's perimeter from the outlines of the towers' shadows at the times they were struck.
Until a memorial is completed -- likely to be several years -- the entire site is expected to be surrounded by a viewing wall, which will allow the site to be seen at ground level.
"I think it would be short-sighted to say that one quadrant needed to be the memorial, without considering something that in the long run might be more successful," said Margaret Helfand, co-chairwoman of the executive committee for the New York New Visions project. 
Ms. Stern, whose husband, James E. Potorti, was killed at the trade center, said that in the advisory council's discussions, many family members said they were counting on the footprints of the towers being part of the memorial. 
"I have to believe that is being taken strongly into consideration," she said.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER IS SELLING A PLANT IN CORINTH, N.Y.

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Citing a sluggish economy and reduced demand, the International Paper Company said yesterday that it would close and put up for sale its Hudson River mill in Corinth, N.Y., in the fourth quarter, eliminating 290 jobs. The company said on Monday that it had scrapped plans to sell two businesses as part of a revamping. International Paper, which has sold $3 billion worth of assets during its revamping, said it would not pursue the sale of its Arizona chemical business and its industrial papers business. The company announced plans in November 2000 to sell the Arizona business, which supplies the adhesives, inks and coatings markets. The unit employs 1,800 people and is based in Jacksonville, Fla. The industrial papers unit, which makes paper products for food packaging and hygiene markets, among others, was put up for sale in November 2001. In announcing its decision to scrap the sales, the company said it would support both units and focus on making them more profitable. Shares of International Paper, which is based in Stamford, Conn., closed at $43.89 yesterday, up 58 cents.

HEADLINE: Electricite de France Buying Seeboard, a British Utility 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 18 

 BODY:
The American Electric Power Company said today that it would sell its Seeboard regional power utility in Britain to the state-owned French power monopoly Electricite de France for $975 million in cash and the assumption of $1.05 billion in Seeboard debt. 
 The move raises the possibility of European regulatory difficulties because the French market remains closed to similar deals. 
 Electricite de France, Europe's biggest power company, already owns London Electricity and Western Electricity.
The acquisition of Seeboard's two million retail customers will give Electricite de France "a large share of the competitive market" that is developing, said Mark Robinson, a utilities analyst with Commerzbank here. 
Earlier this year, RWE of Germany bought Innogy, Britain's biggest electricity retailer, while E.ON of Germany is close to acquiring Powergen, another utility in the fragmented British market that has emerged from the privatization of electricity and gas businesses since 1990.
Seeboard was the last remaining independent energy supplier in Britain.
With the acquisition of Seeboard, Electricite de France will have about five million customers -- regarded by analysts as sufficient to establish a critical mass. 
"Once you get north of four million customers you are most of the way there," Mr. Robinson said. The deal puts Electricite de France in a position to catch up with rivals like RWE and Centrica of Britain, each of which supply power to around five million customers.
Like its rivals in the United States, American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, the biggest domestic electricity generator, is selling overseas assets to cut its debt as credit rating companies scrutinize energy companies more closely after the bankruptcy of Enron. 
In a statement, American Electric said it would use the proceeds of the Seeboard sale to cut its debt.
"The risks inherent to the competitive retail energy business are best undertaken by consolidators like London Electricity Group," said E. Linn Draper Jr., the chief executive of American Electric. He has said that he wants to cut the company's $15.8 billion debt through asset and securities sales.
American Electric said London Electricity would also assume obligations valued at $146 million related to a power purchase agreement with Medway Power of Britain. Seeboard has a 37.5 percent stake in Medway. 
In bidding for Seeboard, Electricite de France was up against three other competitors -- E.ON, Scottish and Southern Energy of Britain and the TXU Corporation of Dallas. 
The deal raised speculation that other combinations could follow, including a merger of Scottish and Southern with Scottish Power or an attempt by E.ON to bid for Scottish and Southern.
Some analysts said, however, that a more likely next step was a share buyback by Scottish and Southern to reduce its cash reserves, which could tempt a hostile bidder. The company has a reputation for hard-nosed management and a refusal to overpay for assets.
In its statement, American Electric acknowledged that the Seeboard deal was "conditional only on the European Commission approving the transaction under its merger regulations."
Mr. Robinson of Commerzbank said: "We shouldn't dismiss regulatory concerns. You can't go and compete in the French market the same as you can in the U.K." This, he added, would lead European regulators to "look to see whether this is in the public interest on the basis of nonreciprocity."
The newly elected center-right French government has promised to oversee a reduction of the state presence in the economy. The government has lagged some of its European neighbors in selling stakes in businesses like telecommunications and power.
But that is likely to be a slow process and deals like today's revive complaints that Electricite de France has an unfair advantage over publicly owned companies because it uses government funds to outbid rivals that have no access to the French market.

HEADLINE: Battle to Beat Schroder Finds Hope in Europe's Tilt to Right 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 18 

 BODY:
The conservative challenger for the German leadership, Edmund Stoiber, made an unusually emotional and bitter attack today on the current chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, and promised to oust the current government in elections Sept. 22.
 Often considered dry and pedantic, Mr. Stoiber, who is from Bavaria, hopes to ride the rightward mood in Europe to victory, concentrating on issues like economic competence and stricter controls on immigration, which have been important in recent elections in France and the Netherlands. 
 Today he made a fiery speech to a conference of the Christian Democratic Union in Frankfurt that was dotted with emotional references to his wife, his children and his country. 
Mr. Stoiber, the joint candidate of the Christian Democrats and his own Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, has maintained a lead in the opinion polls over Mr. Schroder's Social Democrats, who are in alliance with the Greens, a so-called "red-green coalition."
"In 96 days, this red-green nonsense in Berlin will be over," Mr. Stoiber told delegates as sweat stained his collar. "We believe it and polls show most Germans believe it, too. In 96 days, Germany starts moving again."
Mr. Stoiber urged Germans to shift to the center-right, as the French have just done. Mr. Schroder and Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, are among the few leftist leaders remaining in Western Europe.
Mr. Stoiber, who is running on a reputation for economic competence, called Mr. Schroder the "chancellor of broken promises" for having failed to get unemployment down to below 3.5 million -- a Schroder vow -- and presiding over a Germany that has the lowest growth rates in Europe.
"With these red-green troops, Germany has lost economically compared with France, Italy, Denmark and even Portugal and Greece," Mr. Stoiber said, pointing to high bankruptcy figures and unemployment, currently hovering about four million.
"Years ago," Mr. Stoiber said, "Schroder rattled the gates of the chancellery and said, 'Let me in.' My dear friends, now it's time to kick him out."
Mr. Stoiber, 60, has benefited from a new media consultant -- Michael Spreng, a former editor -- and he has pushed a slogan of "40-40-40," promising to cut the top rate of tax, social security contributions from salaries and the level of public spending in the economy all to under 40 percent.
But Mr. Stoiber has not challenged Germany's powerful unions very strongly, talking of fewer structural impediments to hiring and firing while always repeating that "the American system" is not appropriate for Germany.
But he has also promoted a respected "competence team," a kind of cabinet in waiting, to reassure voters on areas where Mr. Stoiber is not so strong. 
They include Wolfgang Schauble, a former Christian Democrat chairman entrusted with foreign and security policy, and Lothar Spath, a former prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg who now heads a successful high-tech company in eastern Germany called Jenoptik.
Mr. Stoiber also returned today to what has become a familiar theme, calling again for stricter controls on immigration. He has tried to block a Schroder-drafted law that would allow more immigration from well-educated workers, especially in computer sciences, that the aging German population needs to compete.
The president of the Federation of German Industry, Michael Rogowski, told the delegates today that the conservatives should be "more reasonable" on immigration. The country needs more skilled workers and soon, he said, to promote economic growth.
But the likely finance minister in a conservative government, Friedrich Merz, said Germany could not make room for immigrant workers until it found more jobs for Germans, and he and others said immigration would remain a central issue.
"Our central aim must be to integrate four million unemployed into the labor market," he said. "There is no room for immigrant workers from outside the European Union until we have filled the 1.5 million vacancies in Germany."

HEADLINE: Agreement Is in Sight on City's Budget Gap 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council edged closer to an agreement last night on how to close the city's nearly $5 billion budget gap, after the mayor agreed to restore some proposed cuts and the Council scaled back its demands.
 Peace began to break out between the two branches of city government around midday, as the rising tensions of the past few days ebbed. Although both sides cautioned last night that there was still plenty of work to be done, and details to be hashed out, they said they could reach an accord on the city's nearly $42 billion budget as early as today. 
 "I would say we have an agreement in principle," David Weprin, chairman of the council finance committee, said last night. "Anything can fall apart, and it's not in writing on the mayor's side either, but we have an agreement in principle." 
Marc V. Shaw, the first deputy mayor, said: "I think it will come together tomorrow. At the end of the day, both sides had a desire to reach a negotiated budget."
Officials said that the agreement closely resembled the mayor's executive budget proposal, but offered partial restorations of some of the most onerous cuts, including those that had been planned for centers for the elderly, libraries and child care programs, and that it would probably contain a compromise to save part of the city's recycling program.
This has not been an easy budget to agree on. The slumping economy, the economic fallout from the attack on the World Trade Center, and the bill coming due for the heightened government spending during the Giuliani years all left New York City with a nearly $5 billion gap in the fiscal year beginning July 1.
How to close that gap left the mayor and the Council at odds on a number of issues. 
The Council originally wanted to raise taxes to avoid service cuts, while the mayor opposed most tax increases, saying they would be bad for the economy and unlikely to win the approval of the State Legislature. The mayor wanted to suspend the recycling of glass, metal and plastics, while the Council wanted to preserve the program. Most of all, though, the two sides differed on cuts: the Council wanted to restore many of the mayor's budget cuts, while he argued that there was simply not enough money to go around.
"Nobody likes to have any services cut or removed," Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday, before the breakthrough. "On the other hand, we just don't have the money."
Last night officials offered few details on how the two sides were overcoming their many differences.
Forrest R. Taylor, chief of staff to Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, said last night, "Some of the issues that have been playing out previously -- recycling, education, those sorts of things -- we are trying to finalize those details on those issues."
But Council officials said the administration had made overtures to meet them part way, and last night the Council leadership and the members held a series of meetings to decide how to scale back the list of restorations they had been demanding -- deciding, in effect, which cuts they could live with and which they could not. Lobbyists descended on City Hall, and made a series of last-ditch efforts to save their programs.
The late flurry of activity came after the Council postponed a vote that had been designed to pressure the mayor. It was a threat of sorts. 
Yes, the Council said, it would ask the Legislature to approve the fees, taxes, surcharges and other budget actions that Mayor Bloomberg was seeking. But they also planned a second vote to ask Albany to do two things the mayor opposes: reinstate the commuter tax and add a tax on some absentee landlords. 
Neither tax had much chance of succeeding, but they put pressure on the administration, signaling that the Council was still thinking about passing a budget of its own, over the objections of the mayor's side. 
Mr. Bloomberg has long opposed most tax increases. Asked about the Council's plan to vote to ask Albany for both his package and their package, the mayor said bluntly, "One of them, I think, makes a lot of sense, one of them does not."
The vote was set for 3:30 p.m. The Council was summoned. And then, around 2 p.m., the vote was abruptly postponed until today. Both sides reported progress.
"There's a possibility that we may reach an agreement by tomorrow, and as a result we agreed to postpone our stated meeting," Mr. Weprin, the Council's finance chairman, said. 
Council officials said that when they convene today, they expect to send only one message to Albany, asking for actions both the mayor and the Council are seeking.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Aid to Insurers On Terrorism 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18 

 BODY:
The Senate passed legislation today requiring the government to pay the overwhelming majority of financial losses in a major terrorist attack, though the measure takes a markedly different approach from one approved by the House.
 The Senate measure, approved 84 to 14, provides for the government to pay 80 percent of losses resulting from a terrorist attack up to $10 billion -- after insurers have absorbed a portion of the losses based on their share of the market -- and 90 percent of all losses after that. In contrast to the Senate bill, the House measure on terrorism insurance, adopted last fall, provides mainly for long-term low-interest loans to help insurers cope with claims from a major attack. 
 Despite the differences, both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate said they expected to reach a compromise with the House and come up with a bill that President Bush would sign. 
"The president wants this very badly," said Senator Harry Reid, the majority whip from Nevada. "We want it. The House wants it. It's ripe for compromise."
Senator Trent Lott, the Republican minority leader from Mississippi, said that while he thought the bill had some shortcomings, "I think they can be worked out."
Faced with the difference in the Senate and House versions of the bill, some Republican aides suggested that a compromise was far from certain. "It's not impossible," one aide said. "But it's going to be hard."
Senators said they had become convinced that government intervention was necessary to ensure that terrorism coverage becomes widely available at affordable prices, thus eliminating what many of them said was an increasingly significant drag on an already sluggish economy. The bill provides government help for up to two years.
Insurers have contended that they could not offer blanket terrorism coverage without assurances from the government that their maximum losses would be limited. Under the Senate bill, insurers would be required to provide the coverage.
Despite the measure's strong support, some Republican leaders had said the measure was too generous to insurance companies and also opened the way for "predatory lawsuits" by victims of terrorism. 
The bill stalled in the Senate last December over restrictions on lawsuits by victims of terrorism. The Republicans, strongly backed by the White House, contend that neither the government nor businesses should be held legally responsible for damages caused by terrorists. The Democrats have agreed on limiting suits against the government. But they say that eliminating lawsuits against businesses diminishes their incentive to try to prevent attacks.
Until Sept. 11, terrorism insurance was provided as a part of most general commercial insurance policies. The insurers agreed to pay losses estimated at up to $50 billion in the attacks but immediately withdrew coverage for further strikes. 
Within a few weeks, though, some insurers began offering up to $25 million in coverage at several times the cost of an equivalent amount of general commercial insurance. 
Prices have fallen sharply since then, and brokers say up to $1 billion in coverage is available. But owners of skyscrapers in New York and other big cities say that the costs are still staggering and that they cannot obtain what they regard as full coverage against a terrorist attack.
The White House has been one of the strongest advocates of government intervention, along with lobbyists for the insurers, banks and real estate companies. The proponents have cited only a few examples of harm to the economy: construction projects being stalled or lenders trying to cancel loans or raise interest rates because of inadequate terrorism insurance. But they contend that the prospects for a crisis are increasing each month as more commercial policies come up for renewal.
It was clear today that the lawmakers preferred to err on the side of caution. Several senators suggested that the bill might change significantly in the give and take with the House and in their own chamber.
For example, responding, to criticism from Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that the measure provided too much government money to insurers and failed to provide an incentive for them to take back responsibility from the government eventually, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut suggested in an interview that the threshold for the government's payment of 90 percent of the losses in an attack might be raised to $15 billion from the proposed $10 billion.
As a result of an amendment by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, the bill provides for the government to intervene on behalf of individual companies when their losses in an attack exceed a percentage of the $10 billion, based on their market share.
For some companies, Mr. Gramm said in the debate, that would mean the government's payments would start after losses of tens of millions of dollars rather than billions. "The taxpayer is exposed very, very early in the process," Mr. Gramm said.
By raising the threshold to $15 billion, the losses based on market share would also rise, Mr. Dodd said.
"The caps are going to have to be higher," Mr. Lott said.

Overcoming fierce lobbying by the accounting industry, the Senate Banking Committee approved legislation today that would ban accounting firms from selling many forms of consulting services to their audit clients, limit the time an individual partner could review one company's books and create a regulatory board made up mostly of people outside the industry.
 The measure, a response to the collapse of Enron and to accounting scandals in other industries, was approved 17 to 4 in committee. But despite that unexpected level of support, its fate remains unclear. Assuming it is passed by the Senate, the legislation will go to a conference committee to be reconciled with a substantially different proposal, already passed by the House, that is favored by the accounting industry. 
 "We still have to go to conference so there are plenty of hurdles ahead, and I don't think there ought to be any element of overconfidence that we will get this process to completion," Senator Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey and a former co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an interview. "We will have to work very hard to do that." 
Consumer groups and many of the lawmakers who backed the measure said the bill would go the furthest toward preventing future financial meltdowns. The proposal is the only legislation that would help end the "systemic problems in the accounting profession involving conflicts of interest and lax oversight," Consumers Union said today. "This bill would definitely fix some of the accounting problems that we've seen crop up in the daily news over the last six months."
If no measure makes it out of Congress, there may still be change coming. The Securities and Exchange Commission is already working on its own proposal for an accounting oversight board. Like the bill in the Senate, the proposal by the S.E.C. would require the board to have a majority of members who are not current or former accountants.
Also, the members of the board with accounting backgrounds would not play a role in determining disciplinary actions or sanctions against firms. The S.E.C. plan would also force publicly traded companies to comply with any review or proceeding undertaken by the board.
The Senate bill approved in committee makes some concessions to the accounting industry. But it keeps many provisions that just a month ago had engendered such a furious reaction from lobbyists that its sponsor, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the committee, had to postpone a vote on the measure for fear that it might be defeated. 
But three days after the guilty verdict in the obstruction of justice trial of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, the committee passed the bill, with 6 Republicans and all 11 Democrats voting for it. Four Republicans voted no: Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, John Ensign of Nevada and the former committee chairman, Phil Gramm of Texas, who had led efforts to defeat the measure.
The wide vote came after a deal on Monday night by Mr. Sarbanes and Senator Michael B. Enzi, a Wyoming Republican who is an accountant, that gave ground to the industry in some areas but kept the most significant parts of the bill. In addition to the regulatory board and the ban on many forms of consulting, the bill also requires that every five years, publicly traded companies change the individual lead audit partners who review their books.
It also prohibits investment firms from retaliating against research analysts who write negative reports on the firm's clients. And it forbids investment bankers to supervise research analysts or clear their reports.
The deal by Mr. Enzi and Mr. Sarbanes added provisions ensuring that two of the five members of the regulatory board have accounting backgrounds and also that disciplinary proceedings by the regulatory board be kept confidential unless the parties agree otherwise. 
While the bill specifically prohibits accounting firms from selling eight types of consulting and other services to publicly traded companies that they audit, the legislation does allow auditors to provide certain tax services and other services -- so long as the company's audit committee approves the arrangement in advance. 
Under the Enzi-Sarbanes deal, minor services that require prior approval but are initially overlooked can be retroactively approved by the audit committee -- as long as they account for no more than 5 percent of the auditors' fees.
Some lawmakers said the continuing discovery of accounting problems at large corporations, and the flight of some foreign investors from the United States, had helped create more support for the measure. Speaking to reporters after the vote, Mr. Sarbanes also suggested that the fierce lobbying efforts by the accountants had backfired and cost the industry some credibility. 
"Some of the lobbying was really over the top -- scare stuff," Mr. Sarbanes said. He also credited comments recently from some leading figures in finance, especially a speech by Henry M. Paulson Jr., chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who criticized American corporations and said that to avoid the appearance of a conflict, companies should not buy consulting services from the same accountants that audit their books.
Before the vote, Mr. Gramm offered a competing proposal that was defeated. It would have created a regulatory board with a higher portion of members with accounting backgrounds and would have let the board resolve on its own some issues explicitly addressed in the Sarbanes bill.
In an interview tonight, Mr. Gramm said that while the bill had improved somewhat, its fundamental thrust had not changed, and he was not sure why support for the measure increased so quickly. Mr. Gramm said it would have been smarter policy to give the new board more leeway and not legislate so many specific rules.
"This is one of those things people want to be on record as being for," Mr. Gramm said, adding that he hoped that the bill could be amended when it reached the Senate floor. If not, he said, there is little chance it will make it out of conference committee in its current form. "There's no doubt," he added, that the final bill will be different.
The current atmosphere in Congress, Mr. Gramm said, "is a little bit of the environment of 'let's just go out and beat up a bunch of accountants, that way we're tough on accountants'; that's not what I'm looking for."
The accounting industry's main lobbying group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said this afternoon that both the Sarbanes bill and the S.E.C.'s proposal raised concerns about how the industry would be regulated.
Both create "uncertainties about whether auditing professionals will continue to remain actively engaged in setting auditing standards and that auditors will have sufficient latitude to respond to the needs of both investors and public companies," the organization said. 
Mr. Enzi, who said he had been meeting frequently with accounting representatives, said the industry was still concerned, among other things, about being protected from what he characterized as frivolous lawsuits. "I'm not sure anybody on any side of this issue likes" all the Sarbanes bill, Mr. Enzi said.
Lawmakers today did not try to amend the bill with a provision that would derail investigations into the securities industry by officials in various states, including Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York. An official close to the industry, however, said that Wall Street firms hoped to raise the issue when the bill arrived in conference committee, where they believe Republicans from the House will have some sympathy for the initiative.
This evening, an aide to Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, said the accounting bill would most likely be brought up on the Senate floor in September, after Congress returns from a monthlong recess. Mr. Daschle would usually bring up the bill much sooner, the aide said, but he remained focused on legislation to create a new department and other antiterrorism measures.

Senate Panel Approves Strict Accounting Measure
The Senate Banking Committee has approved accounting legislation that would impose tough measures to limit the lucrative consulting that accounting firms can do on companies they audit and would put the industry under a regulatory board composed mostly of people outside the industry.
 Despite a 17-to-4 vote in committee, the bill's fate remains unclear. Assuming the measure passes the Senate, it will go to a conference committee so it can be reconciled with the House bill, which is favored by the accounting industry. If the bill dies, the Securities and Exchange Commission is working on its own proposal for an oversight board. Page A1.

In a NoHo Penthouse, Economy of Function on a Grand Scale

BYLINE:  By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
"Everything had to move and retract," Suzan Wines said of a 3,000-square-foot, two-story penthouse she and Azin Valy, her partner at I-Beam Design, created in NoHo. The penthouse, a loft intended to be playfully minimalist, was for Ted Petroulas, a founding partner in the Clinton Group, an asset management firm in lower Manhattan; his wife, Nasim Alikhani; and their 7-year-old twins. Nothing -- kitchen cabinet, bathroom sink, or bathroom window -- wound up with only one function, if it could have two or three. 
 The stainless-steel steps, left, that lead from the kitchen to the children's playroom, are part staircase, part storage, part countertop -- and can be moved around. "They use the steps to reach high, upper cabinets," Ms. Wines said. The master bedroom has a sink behind the headboard and retractable mirrors that pop up at the push of a button. In the master bathroom, an aquarium window facing a corridor uses electric current to change a liquid crystal film inserted between two panes of laminated glass from dark to clear. "When you turn the power off, it goes almost opaque," Ms. Wines said. 
 In the guest bathroom, the secret lies in the glass counter, which extends through a slit in the corridor wall and acts like an "occupied" sign. "If you turn on the light in the bathroom," Ms. Wines said, "it illuminates at the edge and indicates someone is in there." The children's bathroom vanity, above left, is made of fluorescent-colored acrylic in orange, yellow and blue, and is illuminated from within, so it acts like a multicolored night light.
In the living room, a mahogany mantelpiece, above, wraps around the slate hearth and hides storage cabinets for CD's and tapes. A low cabinet has drawers to store Ms. Alikhani's antique jewelry and textiles and the couple's collection of ornamental metalwork. The total cost was $500,000. I-Beam, (212) 244-7596. ELAINE LOUIE

HEADLINE: Gucci Posts 42% Decline In Net Income 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 19 

 BODY:
Dragged down by the painfully slow recovery of the global economy, Gucci said today that its income in the first fiscal quarter -- February to April -- slumped 42 percent.
 The only bright light in its otherwise grim results was a 63 percent revenue increase at Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion and perfume business that the Gucci Group bought for $1 billion in 1999 and has been painstakingly rebuilding. 
 Analysts said the news shed little new light on a possible revival of the luxury goods market, which investors have been watching intently, particularly in light of plans by two big European fashion houses, Prada of Italy and Burberry of Britain, to sell shares this summer in initial stock offerings.
Gucci said that first-quarter net income fell 42 percent, to 35.5 million euros ($34 million), or 0.35 euro a share, from 61.4 million euros, or 0.61 euro, last year. Revenue fell 1.5 percent, to 607.6 million euros. 
The chief executive of Gucci, Domenico de Sole, said that sales in destinations that rely on tourists from East Asia, notably Japan, were weak. Revenue from retail sales in the United States fell 26 percent in the quarter, he said. Mr. De Sole said he expected the difficulties to continue through the rest of the first half. He said he hoped for a rebound in the second half of the year.
Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said Gucci's results were no surprise. "I don't know that it changes much," she said of the decline.
Investors appeared to agree, bidding up Gucci's shares at one point by as much as 1.5 percent, largely because of the positive results at Saint Laurent.
In April, the market leader, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, reported sluggish sales in the first quarter; earlier this month, Richemont of Switzerland, which is second to LVMH, said revenues from retail sales remained flat in April and May.
Despite the slump, Great Universal Stores, which controls Burberry, said in May that it planned an initial stock offering by mid-July. Earlier, Prada announced it would offer shares on the Milan stock exchange by the end of summer, after canceling two previous offerings. Both companies are betting that a recovery in luxury goods after the Sept. 11 attacks will attract investors, despite the shakiness of global stock markets. Neither company would comment today, citing regulatory restrictions.
Anne-Catherine Galetic of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney noted that shares in groups like LVMH and Richemont dropped 10 percent to 15 percent in the last several weeks. For Prada and Burberry that meant, she said, that, "some investors are not going to be willing to pay multiples of one month ago, when the whole market is penalizing the sector."
The sole bright spot in the Gucci report was Saint Laurent, apparently buoyed by successes like the deer-bone-handled Mombasa bag, a hot item in the United States, where it sells for more than $700, and by the spring and summer selections of Tom Ford, the Gucci star who designs for Saint Laurent.
"They've done a very strong job in a very short time in a very difficult environment," said Armando Branchini, president of InterCorporate, a Milan fashion consulting company. He added that he considers Gucci's overall results "quite good for a year that's not been so good."
Mr. De Sole said there had been no sign as yet in the three months to April of a revival of retail sales at destinations, like Hawaii and Las Vegas, that are favored by Japanese tourists, who are heavy purchasers of luxury items.
Mr. Branchini said that "for the first time ever, the condition of the general economy is strongly influencing luxury goods." He said that was because as luxury goods conglomerates broadened their customer base in recent years from the particularly well-heeled to average consumers who occasionally indulge their taste for luxury brands, they have made themselves vulnerable to factors like the travel market.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Mark McDonald; 
Mr. Modernism Leaves Town

BYLINE:  By DAVID COLMAN 

 BODY:
ARE you just starting to explore midcentury style? Seduced by magazine spreads of plate-glass-walled bungalows in Palm Springs, Calif.? Browsing on eBay, perhaps, for the groovy molded plywood work of the famous Eames brothers, Charles and Ray?
 If so, Mark McDonald wants nothing to do with you -- or anyone else who still needs to be told that Ray was Charles Eames's wife, not his brother. 
 Not that Mr. McDonald ever suffered amateurs gladly. For 20 years, he has sold some of the most exalted pieces of midcentury modern design ever to come up for private sale (a lot of it at exalted prices). Along the way, he straightened out plenty of neophytes and dabblers and answered thousands of questions -- usually dispensing about four times as much information as the asker anticipated. 
Now, two decades after opening his influential first gallery, Fifty/50, this walking, talking 20th-century-design database is going off line -- to the great disappointment of collectors and connoisseurs, for whom he was an invaluable storehouse of both objets d'art and encyclopedic knowledge about them.
"I'm gone, and they won't be able to ask me!" Mr. McDonald said with a triumphant whoop colored by his faint Texas lilt as he shut down Fifty/50's successor, the Gansevoort Gallery, for the night a couple of weeks ago.
At the end of the month, Mr. McDonald, 51, will permanently close his gallery, which he opened seven years ago on a forlorn (now fashionable) stretch of Gansevoort Street in the meatpacking district.
"I have to cut the cord," he said while sipping coffee recently at his home in Germantown, N.Y., a small, bright, two-story house perched on the side of a gully over a creek's churning rapids. Having opened a small gallery, 330, in nearby Hudson in November, Mr. McDonald said he plans to spend less time in his small Manhattan apartment and more at his new base of operations.
The design world may be sorry to see him retreat, but many colleagues are not surprised. High-end shops that specialize in midcentury furnishings are falling victim to a sluggish economy; others have been wounded by competition from Internet sales and encroaching auction houses.
The race to find the best mid-mod design has become fierce. Form and Function, a midcentury design store in SoHo, closed three months ago.
Troy Halterman, owner of Troy, another high-end SoHo design emporium, said he was steadily phasing out midcentury pieces in favor of new design.
"It's just gotten too difficult to find interesting vintage pieces," Mr. Halterman said, "and I've been finding young designers more stimulating, which didn't use to be the case."
Mr. McDonald may have been the only game in Eamestown 20 years ago, and he still ranks as one of the country's leading dealers of modernist design, but there is now an onrushing pack of young dealers, like Evan Lobel of Lobel Modern in Chelsea, or Kim Hostler and Juliet Burrows of Antik in TriBeCa, who are willing to hustle for inventory.
"I just don't have the 24-hour energy it takes to keep a retail business going in Manhattan," Mr. McDonald said with a trace of melancholy.
"I really do feel that that era is over when you can assemble a great collection without spending a fortune. Today, it would cost probably 10 times as much as it did 10 years ago." (Gansevoort Gallery's remaining inventory will be sold at 330.)
Determined to go out on a high note, Mr. McDonald has mounted an exhibition called "Highlights: Collecting Modern 1982-2002." Open through the end of the month, the show includes more than 125 of the most rarefied and exemplary pieces of modern design Mr. McDonald has sold since he and two partners opened Fifty/50 in 1983.
The show includes silver jewelry by Alexander Calder and Harry Bertoia; furniture by Gio Ponti, Gilbert Rohde, Donald Deskey and Frank Gehry; ceramics by Stig Lindberg, Berndt Friberg and Axel Salto; glass by Venini, Barovier & Toso, Carlo Scarpa and Bianconi; desk clocks by George Nelson -- all of it borrowed back for the month from his customers. Together they amount to an impressive illustration of the broad and crucial role Mr. McDonald has played in the cult of modernism that has grown up around him.
Even today, serious collectors and design purists credit Fifty/50's trinity of owners -- Mr. McDonald, Mark Isaacson and Ralph Cutler -- with blazing the trail. "They invented the whole thing," said the architect Lee Mindel, an early customer. "Now midcentury is today's Chippendale."
A nearly instant success, Fifty/50 fired interest in the look that would later become known and fetishized as "midcentury modern." It was also a crucial Saturday-afternoon stop on the art-world itinerary; frequent customers included Robert Mapplethorpe, Francesco Clemente and Julian Schnabel.
Terence Riley, the chief curator of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was a practicing architect when Fifty/50 opened at the height of postmodernism. He remembers its opposition to that reigning style as having a subversive edge -- the design world's answer to a speak-easy.
"Going to Fifty/50 was like belonging to a secret club where you didn't have to pretend you didn't like this stuff," he said. "By reinventing a love for modern furniture, which was less threatening to people than the architecture, they paved the way for the demise of postmodernism."
While many a serious design collection started with something bought out of Fifty/50's window, many a design connoisseur was educated in the store's back room, which was lined with an enormous library of design reference books that even today Mr. McDonald calls his biggest and most serious investment.
"It was one thing to buy something from the store, but the thing was to get invited into the back to talk and look through the books," recalled Murray Moss, the owner of the popular design store Moss in SoHo, who was then the owner of a fashion company.
But the modernist past shone brighter at Fifty/50 than its future. Mr. Cutler, who was Mr. McDonald's personal as well as professional partner for 13 years, died of AIDS in 1989. Mr. Isaacson died of the disease in August 1993; Mr. McDonald closed the store within a month.
Mr. McDonald said that he has been H.I.V.-positive himself since 1985, staying healthy in recent years with protease inhibitors. But while his business life was turned upside down by the deaths of his partners, Mr. McDonald felt his loss most acutely when visiting the Germantown house.
"When we bought the house in 1980, there was really no one else we knew up here," he recalled. Then a gay couple with whom they were friendly bought a place nearby; then another couple did the same, and another, and another.
"There were 10 of us up here, five couples," he said. "Every single one of those people died. I had no friends here. No one was left."
As a result, he said, the country house and its grounds, which had been Mr. Cutler's project, came to seem almost unbearably bleak.
But as the 1990's wore on, Hudson's emergence as an antiquing destination brought new friends to the area. After he closed Fifty/50, Mr. McDonald, a contractor's son who grew up doing carpentry as a hobby, threw himself into gardening, picking up where Mr. Cutler had left off years earlier. Today, every square inch of ground, just under an acre, is painstakingly planted and landscaped, overflowing this month with irises, poppies, clematis and allium -- no small feat, considering that a good part of the lot tumbles down a cliff, and that when he and Mr. Cutler first happened upon the place, he said, "there was nothing but trees and poison ivy."
Gardening might seem to clash with Mr. McDonald's obsession with midcentury design, much of which has a cosmopolitan, machine-made edge. But it is the organic and crafted aspect of modernism that he has always favored.
One case in the Germantown house is crowded with Scandinavian pottery by Stig Lindberg; a nearby shelf is covered with Japanese bronze vases. Other rooms contain a mix of Arts and Crafts furniture from the early 20th century, 1950's and 60's ceramics, and personal, idiosyncratic mementos from travels. Much of the artwork is by friends like William Wegman and Lynn Davis. Many things in the house are of anonymous design but captivated Mr. McDonald with their modernist feel, like the stained-glass window and the brightly colored geometric-pattern Danish wool blankets that adorn the beds in the two bedrooms.
"His interest in midcentury stems from that craftsman, hands-on quality that most people don't identify with the period," said Thad Hayes, an interior designer and longtime customer.
"Of the pottery he gets," Mr. Hayes continued, "what he keeps for himself are the things that are very tactile, with beautiful glazes, with an almost Woodstock-hippie Arts and Crafts edge."
Mr. McDonald has always tried to find pieces that have not been restored but are in nearly their original condition, a reflection of his uncompromising, sometimes obdurate, attitude about the purity of what he sells. Likewise, he has limited patience for midcentury amateurs who complain that his rarefied inventory is too expensive, and even less with the clueless newcomers who want information about those Eames brothers. Mr. McDonald has come to see himself as a kind of custodian for modernism, and on this subject his sense of humor evaporates.
So if he spends more time upstate and less time dealing with the business of modernism, his views on the sanctity of the subject aren't going anywhere.
"Mark's modernism is the modernism of an existence -- he does have a mission, with a high moral tone," said Mitchell Wolfson, the noted design collector who created the Wolfsonian design museum in Miami Beach with Mr. McDonald's help. "He has a missionary's zeal which is very focused."
And none of that will change just because Gansevoort is closing, Mr. Wolfson said. "When you're the head of a church, you know who your congregation is. He doesn't need new converts."

Country Decor With a Bit of an Edge
MARK McDONALD'S new store, 330, in the relaxed town of Hudson, N.Y., will have a looser mix than he offered in his New York shops, although his current inventory includes pieces from Fifty/50 and Gansevoort Gallery. "I want to be a little bit broader," he said. "I'd like to have some slightly funky things that don't necessarily have a designer's name attached to them. And vases you can use, that aren't just museum-quality collectibles. I want it to be more country friendly, and slightly more affordable."
The store offers an unsigned stainless-steel serving cart from the 1950's for $700, and anonymous American and Finnish rugs from $400 to $4,500. For the devout modernist's front porch, there is even an Eames rocking chair. People looking for Mr. McDonald's brand of connoisseurship can be satisfied too. There is a Donald Deskey table for $22,000 and an Aalto table from a Harvard library for $25,000. 
The store will also be a bookstore of sorts, carrying a wide range of new titles on design, fashion and photography. And in the back room, Mr. McDonald sells a large selection of out-of-print and rare design books -- in homage to the famed office of Fifty/50, where many design aficionados first perused the owners' library. The store, at 330 Warren Street, is open Fridays through Mondays from noon to 5 p.m., or by appointment; (518) 828-6320.

HEADLINE: Goldman Profits in Sale of Korean Bank Stake 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 19 

 BODY:
In a long-awaited move for maximum profit from one of the largest foreign investments in the Korean economy, Goldman Sachs sold about 60 percent of its stake in the Kookmin Bank for $633.6 million today.
 The sale of 13.2 million shares in Kookmin, by far Korea's largest bank, netted Goldman Sachs three times the price that it paid for the shares when it invested in the bank three years ago. 
 Goldman sold the shares, valued at 59,200 won apiece on the Korean Stock Exchange, for $48 each in exchange for American depository receipts eligible for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Officials at Kookmin, who are in the process of modernizing and overhauling the bank after merging it with the Housing and Commercial Bank last November, denied that Goldman's sale of shares reflected any lack of confidence in the bank's future.
"Goldman had been planning the sale for a year," said Donald MacKenzie, executive vice president for risk management at Kookmin. "Goldman was here for financial purposes," he added. "There's nothing here that concerns me."
If there was any surprise, it was the size of the sale. Goldman had originally planned to sell about 11 million shares, half the 6.82 percent stake that it bought in 1999, but wound up with 2.66 percent of the bank's shares after selling 4.16 percent of the total shares in the bank.
Goldman sold the shares with the strong support of Kim Jung Tae, the bank president, who came to Kookmin from the Housing and Commercial Bank with the mission to get tough on risky loans to corporations while greatly expanding the bank's retail loan business. Mr. Kim, the former chief of a securities firm, returned today from a trip with Goldman executives to help promote the sale.
Underlining the success of the sale -- and of the bank -- was that stock in Kookmin rose 1 percent, closing today at 60,700 won ($49.67) on the Korean Stock Exchange, while the market over all fell 4.1 percent, to 776.37, down 33.03 points, the largest daily drop in nearly eight weeks.
The broad market downturn came after news that the United States Justice Department was investigating Micron Technology on suspicion of collaborating with other manufacturers -- including two Korean companies, Samsung Electronics and Hynix Semiconductor -- to fix the price of memory chips.
As for the Goldman sale, Mr. MacKenzie said, "Goldman wanted to sell, and there were buyers." The sale of more shares than anticipated, he said, showed the popularity of the stock.
"It wasn't a distress sale," he added.
Mr. MacKenzie, who came from the ING Group of the Netherlands to work on bringing Kookmin to the level of banks in the United States and Europe in technology and efficiency, compared Goldman's motive for investing in the bank with that of ING, which owns a 4 percent stake.
"ING is here for the long run," he said. "It's a strategic investment." The Dutch bank, he added, may increase the size of its investment.

HEADLINE: ...In Manhattan, A Lust for Large 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
LIKE their suburban brethren, New Yorkers have been struck by the urge for big, with sales of larger apartments surging, even as prices continue to rise.
 The average apartment sold in Manhattan since May 1, whether a condo loft in TriBeCa or a three-bedroom on Park Avenue, is 21.4 percent more expensive than before Sept. 11, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm that handles 4,000 appraisals a year. 
 The rise in cost is largely a function of square footage. The average apartment sold from May 1 through June 18 is a lot bigger than in the month before the terrorist attacks: 1,263 square feet versus 1,101 square feet in August 2001. At the same time, the price per square foot has been edging upward, confounding those who last fall predicted a dive in real estate. 
"The recovery is now across the board; our sales of apartments over $5 million are up 300 percent," said Paul Purcell, president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate company.
Mr. Purcell said the company sold three grand apartments -- co-ops and condos -- in April and 11 in May. 
"We sold them to families and to foreign investors," he said. Such mega-sales took place at 845 United Nations Plaza, 65 Crosby Street in SoHo, 920 Fifth Avenue, 1185 Park Avenue and 1965 Broadway, among other addresses, he said. Scott Durkin, chief operating officer at the Corcoran Group, a large Manhattan broker, said that "people are trading up to bigger apartments." He said brokers were seeing a sudden release of cash after a pent-up urge to buy. "They've been keeping their money under the mattress for quite a while because the stock market is so volatile, and gradually they're spending it," he said.
Hall Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, which specializes in higher-end real estate, said that although the general residential market has been "hot, hot, hot" since January, the hottest properties had been the smaller apartments: those under $1 million. That changed, he said, at the beginning of May.
Since then, he said, the biggest, most expensive apartments -- particularly those over $7 million, the firm's bread and butter -- have found buyers.
"In May, we sold more units than ever before, including some from the highest end," Mr. Willkie said.
In this steamy market, buyers are finding it difficult to find a bargain, even if they're looking for a studio or a one-bedroom. Taken by the square foot, the cost of an apartment in Manhattan is higher than it was just before Sept. 11. Miller Samuel said the properties it has appraised have shown a rise in the sale price per square foot from $728 in August to $770 now, or almost 6 percent.
"People forget that the market was already dipping before the World Trade Center attacks," said Mr. Miller, whose statistics measure his company's appraisals from Battery Park City to 116th Street on the West Side and 96th Street on the East Side. 
"In August of last year," he said, "the market was slowly eroding. We were seeing a drop in volume and a modest drop in prices, attributable to the recession gaining momentum."
Since January, the market has rebounded, he said, "not unlike most real estate markets in the country."
When viewed through a slightly longer lens, the recovery is even clearer.
Compared with the May 1-June 18 period a year ago, the average sale price of a Manhattan apartment has risen 9.8 percent, from $885,911 to $972,807. The square-foot price has gone up, too, from $669 to $770, a whopping 15.2 percent, according to Miller Samuel.
After a dismal season due to the economy and post-Sept. 11 shock, things started to move in January.
"January was psychologically important," Mr. Willkie said. "It was like a hurdle, like a birthday. People had been waiting to buy, and they decided they couldn't delay it any more."
Because of the rise in prices, New Yorkers have started seeking innovative ways to get the most square feet for their dollar. Some are looking for apartments that need work. Diane Ramirez, president of the Halstead Property Company, said some were also trying to obtain the studios or one-bedrooms next door to their apartments or in the same building rather than hunt -- and pay for -- a bigger apartment elsewhere. Others, when buying anew, start off looking for two adjacent apartments they can combine.
If a building's rules allow it, buyers of adjacent apartments may decide to rent one out while they build up their stock portfolios, or just take their time fixing them up. By buying now, they can take advantage of the low mortgage interest rates (some of the lowest in 40 years).
"Buyers are getting more creative, trying to find the biggest apartments, at the lowest prices," Ms. Ramirez said. 
In all this real estate giddiness, there is one contradictory note.
Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg, says that in the last two weeks his brokers have noticed a chill. "There are fewer people coming to the open houses," he said. "One broker had 10 people last week, and she got over 30 for an apartment in the same line a month ago." This perceived leveling off of the market has not yet shown up in statistics.
Ms. Ramirez has also noticed it, but attributes it to a normal June. "The kids are out of school, packing off to camp; everybody's taken a breather," she said. There has not been this kind of breather in the last two or three Junes, she said, but they occurred for decades before then.
"Since January, the market has been too hot," she said. "It's been a tough market for buyers, and now they're taking a breather. They'll be back in the fall."

HEADLINE: The Enforcers Of Wall St.? Then Again, Maybe Not 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Owen Cheevers, 51, was head of high-yield bond research at the Bank of Montreal in New York when he wrote a cautionary report on companies in the radio industry. An experienced analyst, Mr. Cheevers was asked by investment bankers at his firm to make his report more glowing. He refused and pleaded with the bank's compliance department to intervene. He received no help. Two months later he was fired. 
 Joseph M. Mulder, 59, was a brokerage firm auditor with decades of experience, including identifying two money launderers who later went to prison. But soon after Mr. Mulder alerted his superiors to what he said were serious violations by a broker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Mr. Mulder was fired. More than a decade later, the broker in question was accused by regulators of stealing $3.2 million from clients. 
 It has become a well-worn refrain after scandals at Enron and other companies that if people want to deceive accountants, employees or shareholders, it is awfully hard to stop them. But even though both the institutions involved deny wrongdoing in the terminations, the stories of these two men, although very different, raise an even more troubling proposition: What if the people who want to do the right thing can get no support, especially from executives hired to make sure regulations are followed? What if people like these are in fact punished for speaking out? 
Federal regulators are asking such questions as they undertake a series of examinations of brokerage firm compliance departments. After several prominent cases in which illegal activities of brokers slid past compliance departments, the Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing compliance at firms from the top down, not the bottom up, as has been its custom. 
The new focus comes not a moment too soon. Investors' faith in the financial markets has been shaken by failures in safeguards intended to protect the public. As a self-regulated industry, the brokerage business employs cops inside its walls as a first line of defense for investors. But regulators and investors are wondering if those cops are encouraged to identify wrongdoing by an individual or group that produces significant revenues. 
"If you are a revenue producer or your importance to revenue production exceeds that of the compliance component that is dealing with you, it's very likely that compliance is going to be secondary," said Jeffrey L. Liddle, a lawyer at Liddle & Robinson in New York, who often represents brokerage employees in wrongful termination cases and who represents Mr. Cheevers. 
Compliance professionals on Wall Street number about 150,000, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers. These people are charged with scrutinizing the activities of 650,000 securities representatives in 90,000 branch offices at 5,500 firms.
An especially embarrassing breakdown came to light earlier this year when Frank D. Gruttadauria, a branch manager and producing broker at Lehman Brothers in Cleveland, was sued by the S.E.C., which accused him of stealing more than $40 million from 50 clients over six years. 
But equally disturbing is that compliance executives at major firms under investigation for conflicts of interest were apparently unable or unwilling to prevent investment banking executives, eager to drum up new offerings with upbeat research reports, from interfering with analysts.
Industry guidelines say firms "should emphasize the high value of their reputation and interest in contributing to enhanced investor protection and the integrity of the securities industry."
"Therefore," the guidelines continue, "they should be committed to high standards of conduct and to support the positive and unique role served by those at the firm whose responsibilities are related to compliance or legal functions."
Brokerage firms must have a system of supervision "reasonably designed to prevent and detect violations by their employees." If they do not, executives can face action from the New York Stock Exchange, the N.A.S.D. or the S.E.C. for a "failure to supervise."
Dan Scotto, a bond analyst at BNP Paribas Securities in New York, was fired late last year after writing a negative report on Enron bonds in August 2001, just as the company began to unravel. Mr. Scotto, who had been an analyst for 25 years, said he had seen a deterioration in compliance in recent years.
"Twenty years ago, firms worried more about their reputations," he said. "Research wasn't a sales job. But as the commission structure broke down, there was a shift in compliance departments to be more sensitive to the revenue side of things, or the 'deal' side of things. That accelerated in the '90's." 
A BNP Paribas spokeswoman said the bank's personal issues with Mr. Scotto "resulted from longstanding deficiencies in his performance as a manager and were unrelated to any research recommendations he made." 
Now that revenues and profits are down, regulators worry that compliance departments will come under even more pressure to look the other way when big producers stray. 
It was in just such an economic environment -- 1991 -- that Mr. Mulder was fired from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, shortly after he told superiors that R. Christopher Hanna was routinely violating brokerage firm and New York Stock Exchange regulations intended to protect customers. Mr. Hanna, a big-producing broker, was left in place at the firm, which was later bought by Credit Suisse First Boston, and apparently continued to violate regulations. He was fired in May 2001, and in February, 12 years after Mr. Mulder identified his questionable practices, the S.E.C. sued Mr. Hanna, contending he stole $3.2 million from clients. That case is pending.
"If they had listened to my first report in September 1990, they would have stopped him right in his tracks," Mr. Mulder said. The firm's response struck him as "a willful blindness."
Mr. Mulder took his report to his supervisors, but nothing was done. Six months later, he was fired. He had worked for D.L.J. since 1978. Mr. Hanna remained at the firm.
The reason D.L.J. gave for the firing was that the firm was downsizing. But Mr. Mulder sued the firm and won $114,000. He never got another job on Wall Street.
A Credit Suisse First Boston spokeswoman said two arbitration panels rejected Mr. Mulder's claim that he was fired for making these allegations. "At the time these allegations were raised D.L.J. conducted an internal review and retained outside counsel to fully investigate this matter," she said. "After those internal reviews and external reviews were concluded, Mulder's allegations were found to be without any support." 
Mr. Hanna could not be reached for comment. 
Les Trager, a lawyer at Morley & Trager in New York, represented Mr. Mulder. He said his client had been let down not only by his firm, but also by the S.E.C., which he had told of Mr. Hanna's violations. 
An official at the S.E.C. declined to comment.
Although Mr. Cheevers declined to comment on his termination from Bank of Montreal, his wrongful termination case states his side of the story. According to the complaint and internal e-mail messages from the bank, Mr. Cheevers was asked by Michael Andres, an investment banker, to make an extensive report he had written in March 2001 on the radio industry "more bullish." Mr. Andres wrote: "We accomplish nothing marketing-wise by being negative about prospects for industry." He added: "Our research should have a stronger positive emphasis on medium-sized radio operators as these will ultimately be our high-yield clients."
According to his complaint, Mr. Cheevers declined to comply and complained to his boss, who did not respond, and to the bank's compliance department. In April, the bank's investment bankers killed Mr. Cheevers's report, and Robert Bade, head of United States compliance for the bank, asked Mr. Cheevers what happened. In an e-mail message, Mr. Bade wrote, "There may be some serious securities law considerations here." 
But by the next month, nothing had been done, and on June 7, 2001, Mr. Cheevers was terminated. The reason given, as in Mr. Mulder's case, was downsizing. But according to his complaint, Mr. Cheevers was the only person fired and a person who reported to him was given his job.
Gary D. Friedman, partner at Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw in New York City, represents Bank of Montreal in the matter. He said that Mr. Cheevers's allegations were thoroughly investigated by the company after his termination and found to be meritless. "Bank of Montreal Nesbitt Burns Corporation intends to defend against them vigorously," he said. 
Mr. Trager said one way to ensure that companies could not fire compliance employees for pointing out violations was to require the S.E.C. to interview every compliance professional who is fired. "If the guy is no good, then that's the end of it," Mr. Trager said. "But people should feel that Big Brother is watching them."
Mr. Scotto said that in his experience, compliance officers at most American firms try to do a good job keeping people in line. "Some firms made more of an effort, they had dedicated people who resided in a department," he said. "They can serve as the perfect shock absorber between the firm's interests and those of an individual analyst.
"But there again," he added, "who do they work for? They can't keep saying, 'There was a breach of the wall here and a breach of the wall there, let's scrap this deal.' They keep doing that often enough and they'll find themselves unemployed."

HEADLINE: 15 Are Accused of Defrauding Sept. 11 Charities 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
In several cases, people who had been unemployed for weeks or months lied that they had lost work because of the attack on the World Trade Center, officials said yesterday. Others were still collecting their regular paychecks when they filed similarly false claims, investigators said. 
 At a news conference, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, announced that 15 people had been charged in the latest wave of arrests in the investigation into theft from charities and government agencies that help people who suffered losses in the attack. 
 The charges, which include grand larceny and falsifying business records, among others, are felonies, and each defendant could face up to seven years in prison.
In total, Mr. Morgenthau alleged, 10 of the defendants, working independently, stole more than $52,000 from the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The other five people arrested were caught before they received any funds, Mr. Morgenthau said.
The defendants were expected to be arraigned in Manhattan late last night or early this morning.
Among those arrested were four employees of the New York City Housing Authority.
Some of the claims resulted in immediate cash payments, while others were paid in the form of checks to landlords, officials said. 
While noting that the amount of money involved in each case was relatively small, given the millions of dollars paid out in relief since Sept. 11, Mr. Morgenthau said he wanted "to get the word out that if you defraud the government or charities, you'll be prosecuted."
The arrests announced yesterday bring to 91 the number of New York City defendants charged with financial schemes associated with the trade center attack. In one of the most audacious cases, a Michigan man was charged with claiming that his brother had died, and he was flown to New York and put up in a hotel by the Red Cross. Officials said he received more than $272,800 from Safe Horizon and the Red Cross days after submitting false affidavits to them. Officials later determined that no brother had existed. 
Mr. Morgenthau and Leroy Frazer, the bureau chief in the office of special prosecutions, said the fake claims likely slipped through because of the speed at which the agencies and charities distributed funds.

HEADLINE: Masses in Transit, to Anywhere but Work; 
Riders Like a Safer, More Reliable System, With MetroCard Discounts

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It has been many years since the image of New York City's transit system was one of a crumbling and dangerous place used with grim determination only by those who had no better way to get to work.
 But a study of newly released transit data from the 2000 census has found a remarkable reversal: with the huge improvements to subway and bus service in the last decade and discounts introduced for riding it, mass transit is now used less frequently as a way to go to work than it is to go everywhere else in the city: shopping, eating, to the beach or to see your grandmother in the Bronx. 
 The trend is one that transit officials have long seen in their own statistics, with weekend ridership climbing rapidly in the last several years and many subway stations crammed even in the middle of the night. In the 1990's, that kind of growth helped push subway ridership up by 34 percent and bus ridership by 27 percent, and combined bus and subway weekday ridership topped seven million last year. 
But the census numbers show exactly how profound the shift has been in New Yorkers' perceptions about mass transit as a reliable and cheap way to go not just where they need to go but also where they want to go.
Bus and subway ridership for nonwork trips -- shopping, recreation and personal business -- increased by a surprising 62 percent in the 1990's, according to the analysis by Bruce Schaller, a consultant on urban transportation issues, who examined the census numbers, along with other transit statistics. By contrast, work-related trips on mass transit increased by 6.7 percent.
As a result of that divergence, work trips now account for less than half of all subway and bus trips, dropping to 44.1 percent in 2000 from 54.5 percent in 1990.
The shift helps explain why transit ridership has continued to increase in 2002 despite falling employment in New York City in the last year, Mr. Schaller said. 
But more significantly, it shows that the city seems to be in the midst of a return to the kind of relationship it had with mass transit several decades ago, before the Robert Moses era and the rise of the automobile.
"What has happened here is that the transit system has essentially been reincorporated back into people's life outside of work," Mr. Schaller said.
"You would have to look back to the 40's and 50's, I think, to find the last time it was like that." (In fact, he pointed out, the car was long such a minor player in city transportation that until 1950, it was illegal to park overnight in Manhattan.)
While the rebuilding of much of the subway system and the purchase of new trains and buses has made mass transit cleaner and more reliable, 
Mr. Schaller said that probably the strongest motivator moving people back to transit was the MetroCard, which was introduced in 1994 and began to offer discounts in 1998.
Now, according to New York City transit officials, 40 percent of MetroCard users buy one-day, 7-day or 30-day unlimited cards, which can reduce the price of their trips to significantly below the $1.50 fare if used frequently.
Mr. Schaller believes that the unlimited cards have transformed the mental calculations New Yorkers make when they think about mass transit, especially for discretionary trips.
"You don't think about a trip costing something in the way that you thought with a token," he said. "There's this sense of freedom now that you can hop on a bus to go just 10 blocks and you don't feel like you're getting ripped off."
Regional transit figures show that, five years ago, the frequency of trips of any kind -- by car or mass transit, even by foot -- were relatively low in the city compared with the suburbs, probably because of differences in the way suburbanites and city dwellers perceived the cost and ease of traveling.
If the tank had gas in it, a hop in the car for a quick spin to the suburban mall could feel as if it cost nothing. Driving was more difficult in the city, however, and subway and buses had a definite cost that, even though small, could discourage a whim to travel. The MetroCard, Mr. Schaller said, has changed that.
"The way you can look at it is that there was a kind of pent-up demand for travel in the city that's now able to express itself," he said.
That kind of expression, on subways and buses, has been considered a major public policy victory in New York, undoubtedly good for the environment and one that other cities are trying to emulate.
The downside is that, even though transit service has been increased significantly on the weekends and in off-peak hours in the last several years, it has yet to catch up with the demand in many parts of the system.
As Mr. Schaller put it, "It's always hard to find a seat on the subway during the rush, but now it can be hard to find one on Sunday mornings, literally."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Microsoft, ChickenDelight and competition for an imperfect world.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies" and is writing a book on the increasing importance of aesthetics in the economy and society. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
THE biggest antitrust case in recent years is drawing to a close. Yesterday in Washington, lawyers for Microsoft and the nine states pursuing antitrust action against it completed their final arguments. In addition to ruling in the states' case, Federal District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly must decide whether to approve the settlement Microsoft reached in November with the Justice Department.
 The Microsoft case showcased recent economic scholarship on imperfect competition, which uses mathematical game theory to understand the strategies companies might pursue to gain advantage in markets that depart from the abstract notion of perfect competition. 
 In perfect competition, many indistinguishable and anonymous buyers and sellers trade a homogeneous good at the price at which supply matches demand. No buyer or seller can influence that price individually. 
While the perfect-competition model offers useful insights, away from the blackboard it is more the exception than the rule. It is not surprising that economists are interested in more complex and realistic arrangements. Hence the growth of theories of imperfect competition, in which companies' strategic choices affect market outcomes.
Under the right conditions, some theorists argue, it's possible to sustain and extend a monopoly that would break down under idealized competitive pressures. Often the way to do this would be for the monopolist to use exclusivity clauses or other "nonstandard" contract provisions.
This theory helped give intellectual impetus to the Clinton administration's antitrust activism, including the Microsoft case.
As economic theory, the work is sound. But if applied naively to antitrust policy, it "is likely to lead to poor legal rules and remedies," argues Paul L. Joskow, an M.I.T. economist, in The Journal of Law, Economics and Organization. He points to a different strand of economic research -- "transaction cost economics" -- that also needs to be taken into account.
This work begins with the insight, first made by Ronald H. Coase in a 1937 paper that would help win him the Nobel in economic science 54 years later, that making and enforcing contracts isn't cost free.
Professor Coase argued that reducing transaction costs helped explain why companies exist in the first place. Some exchanges might be easier and cheaper to manage if the parties are within the same organization.
In the 1970's, the economist Oliver Williamson began to develop this idea into a detailed program of research, with implications for antitrust policy as well as business management. Many economists have since done empirical and theoretical work on how organizational governance can lower contract costs.
Just because a contract is unusual or exclusive doesn't mean it hampers competition. The important question is whether competition existed before the contract. The unusual terms may provide a way to avoid enforcement problems.
Consider Chicken Delight, a franchise operation that was the subject of a 1971 antitrust case. Instead of collecting a percentage of store revenue, Chicken Delight required franchisees to buy all supplies from the parent company. From a transaction-cost perspective, this was an elegant solution to a basic problem: in a cash business, it is easy to lie about sales.
Supplies made a good proxy. If business was good, a store would need more supplies, and it would be harder to cheat.
Some franchisees sued, and a federal appeals court ruled that Chicken Delight had engaged in an illegal so-called tie-in arrangement.
But, Professor Joskow notes, the franchisees didn't have to sign up with Chicken Delight in the first place. There was plenty of competition. He teaches the case as an example of bad antitrust policy.
Or consider vertical integration, in which a company owns its supplier or customer. Despite the suspicions of antitrust regulators, in some cases integration may be the easiest, or only, way to benefit from long-term investments.
"The classic example is when you build a power plant next to a coal mine," Professor Joskow explains. "Before you make the investment in either the coal mine or the power plant, you have lots of choices. You can build a power plant almost anywhere. You can use coal, gas or oil. But once you sink the investment, you're locked into the relationship." The coal mine can exploit the power company by breaking its contract and jacking up prices.
"What my work showed," he said, "was you were more likely to get vertical integration in those cases, and if you don't, you get very, very detailed contracts with specific provisions for how to resolve disputes."
An antitrust lawyer who looked only at the situation after the plant was built might question whether the mine had been illegally tied to a long-term contract. A transaction-cost approach demonstrates why such a contract, or an acquisition, would come out of a competitive marketplace.
The imperfect competition school's "possibility theorems" make good social science. But they create too much uncertainty to make good law.
"They show that it's possible under some set of conditions this could be a bad thing, but it's also possible, maybe even probable, that it could be a good thing," Professor Joskow says.
As for Microsoft, he declines to weigh in on the merits of the case. But his article criticizes the original breakup order, noting that it didn't consider the costs or benefits or even how the divestiture would be done.
"This approach reflects the inaccurate assumption that organizational design does not matter for economic performance and that restructuring complex firms is a 'piece of cake' without the need for careful analysis or any significant economic consequences," he writes. "It ignores everything that we have learned from theoretical and empirical work" in transaction cost economics.

HEADLINE: American Troops Will Begin Tighter Operations With Filipinos 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19 

 BODY:
Army Special Forces soldiers will soon begin training Philippine troops in smaller units than they do now and will join them on some jungle patrols to hunt a dwindling band of Muslim guerrillas linked to Al Qaeda, Pentagon officials said today.
 But the Americans will accompany only 20 to 25 Philippine companies that have mastered certain combat skills, and only on tightly defined missions, the officials said. 
 The conditions appear to have satisfied the concerns of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that training at the company level would expose the Americans to greater risk without increasing the likelihood of killing more Muslim extremists. 
Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, and nearly all of his senior military advisers recommended the smaller-unit training as an important step toward enhancing the Philippine Army's ability to fight terrorists, including the small Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippines. The 160 Special Forces soldiers on Basilan Island are currently confined to training at the larger battalion level and do not patrol.
Mr. Rumsfeld has also been reluctant to commit a large American force to an open-ended training mission in the Philippines. As a result, a formal six-month training mission on Basilan Island will end as scheduled on July 31, and most of the 1,300 Americans supporting it will gradually return to their home bases.
But a small contingent of American military planners, less than 100 people, will remain to help share intelligence information and coordinate a long-term security assistance and counterterrorism program with the Philippine Army, officials said.
If the Philippine military requests that the company-level training be extended beyond July 31, President Bush has authorized Pentagon and State Department aides to negotiate a new timetable, officials said.
That is important because American and Philippine commanders on Basilan said in recent interviews that American advisers could accomplish only limited goals in the mission's six remaining weeks.
Apart from the Special Forces advisers, about 350 Navy and Marine Corps engineers are on Basilan rebuilding nearly 40 miles of roads, digging new wells and clearing a vine-covered airstrip for cargo planes. Military construction projects, which would provide long-term benefits to the small island's 300,000 residents long after the troops leave, would likely continue after July 31, officials said.
Mr. Rumsfeld has said that an overarching issue has been how current and future training missions would fit the Pentagon's longer-term goals in the Philippines, an important ally in Southeast Asia. He has also said he needed to weigh the commitment of resources in the Philippines against other priorities.
Mr. Wolfowitz, an Asia expert, favors deeper engagement in the Philippines. He has argued that to fight terrorism successfully, Western nations need to bridge the gap with tolerant Muslim nations and their people. Nearly 10 percent of Filipinos are Muslims, most of whom live in the more economically depressed areas in the south, like Basilan, that have been considered crucibles for terrorist groups.
For that and other reasons, American officials said today that the current training mission will be replaced by a long-term security assistance and counterterrorism plan.
President Bush has already committed $100 million in assistance to the Philippine military. That includes a C-130 cargo plane, two Coast Guard cutters, 8 UH-1 Huey utility helicopters and 30,000 older-model M-16 assault rifles that the Pentagon no longer needs.

HEADLINE: One Man Stands Watch On Billions In Farm Loans 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
Behind the door of Room 3300 at the Farm Credit Administration in McLean, Va., sits Carl A. Clinefelter, director of the Office of Secondary Market Oversight, and his lone employee, an administrative assistant.
 The responsibility for overseeing the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and its billions of dollars of potential government obligations rests largely on this man. "It's really an agencywide effort," Mr. Clinefelter said. "I happen to be the focal point." 
 But the fact that so much rides on the judgment and drive of one person speaks volumes about the oversight of a program that, when it was formed, Congress said would not create risk to taxpayers. 
The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, a government-sponsored enterprise, was formed in 1988 to develop the secondary market for farm loans, much as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two other government-sponsored enterprises, did for home loans.
For many years, Farmer Mac, as the program has become known, did this by buying farm loans outright. More recently, its business has come mostly from guaranteeing loans on other companies' books. Both methods are intended to encourage lenders to keep making fresh loans.
The Office of Secondary Market Oversight, part of the Farm Credit Administration, has monitored Farmer Mac for financial safety and soundness since 1992. Its director can draw on other farm credit employees, including examiners, as needed -- one reason that the Farm Credit Administration estimated the cost of regulating Farmer Mac at $642,500 last year.
But the responsibility for Farmer Mac rests mainly on Mr. Clinefelter, who reports to the three-person Farm Credit Administration board.
That may have been sufficient when Farmer Mac was small. In fact, its first director, Suzanne J. McCrory, said in an interview that she thought it was almost "extravagant" to have a full-time government employee monitoring Farmer Mac when she had the job from 1992 to 1996, especially since Farmer Mac was then barred by law from doing anything very risky.
Besides new powers, Farmer Mac now has roughly $5 billion in outstanding loan guarantees -- far more than the $1.5 billion of emergency funds that the government might make available if Farmer Mac could not make good on its guarantees. For the last three years, its book of guarantees has been growing at 34 percent compounded a year, as management's ambitions and its allotment of stock options have swelled. 
In an interview -- monitored by a lawyer, a spokesman and a spokeswoman of the Farm Credit Association -- Mr. Clinefelter brushed aside any suggestion that his office might need reinforcement. "The agency has all the resources we need to examine Farmer Mac," he said. 
When pressed, though, he acknowledged that he had recently proposed adding one person to his office to ease the load. "It just didn't work out," is all Mr. Clinefelter would say, adding that he would try again in the coming year.
Others suggested that he and Michael M. Reyna, the chairman of the Farm Credit Administration board, had clashed over who that person should be. Mr. Reyna declined to be interviewed.
Over at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a regulatory body that Congress created in 1992 to review the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such requests would be considered rounding errors. It has 115 employees and a $27 million budget at its disposal, nine times its original budget.
Several people have led the Office of Secondary Market Oversight. After Ms. McCrory came Larry W. Edwards, a former fingerprint technician for the F.B.I., and George Irwin, a Ph.D. in agricultural economics. Mr. Clinefelter, the current director, has extensive experience dealing with troubled institutions.
Beyond a question of resources, there are other structural reasons a lone employee of the Farm Credit Administration, even a dogged, independent-minded one, might be hard pressed to police Farmer Mac.
Forty-two percent of the business that Farmer Mac has booked over the last six years has come from guaranteeing loans made by other parts of the farm credit system, itself a government-sponsored enterprise. That climbed to 70 percent last year.
There is nothing wrong with one so-called government instrumentality shifting risk to another. But it accomplishes very little, critics say, since they would both be likely to turn to the same lender of last resort -- the federal government -- if they ran into trouble.
More worrisome is the way the system shunts the riskiest loans to the most rickety part of the network, according to an analysis published by the Department of Agriculture in February.
To hold a farm loan that is not guaranteed, farm credit banks and other lending institutions that make up the farm credit system are required to have nearly 10 times the regulatory capital that Farmer Mac must have to guarantee the same loan. So, a kind of arbitrage occurs, in which credit risk migrates from the well-capitalized farm credit banks to the more thinly capitalized Farmer Mac.
"Relative to the farm credit system, Farmer Mac has less capital and may not be able to withstand a shock to credit quality and farm asset values," the report said. 
As of the latest public filings, the farm credit system had $16.3 billion of equity, equivalent to 16 percent of its assets, money that would be at risk before a taxpayer bailout might be required. Farmer Mac, in contrast, has $169 million in shareholder equity, barely 3 percent of its assets and guarantee obligations.
Confidential examinations by the Farm Credit Administration, copies of which The New York Times obtained, raised many issues and areas for improvement. But the system is essentially pass-fail. Short of bringing an enforcement action or putting the institution into conservatorship, both drastic steps, or writing new regulations, which often takes years, the regulator has few ways to force change. And because the details of the reports are not routinely made public, shareholders and taxpayers simply see that the company's regulators have signed off.
For instance in 1996, Mr. Edwards sharply criticized the lack of diversification in one of Farmer Mac's loan pools as violating company policies and lacking appropriate documentation. He recommended eight changes to "assure that risk concentration in future pools are reduced to more prudent levels."
Farmer Mac's nine-page reply, signed by Eugene Branstool, its chairman, was polite, but dismissive. It explained that in each case, it was the board and management's "belief" that the company was not taking on excessive risk. 
"The board will continue to monitor" and "take action as necessary," Mr. Branstool promised. 
Mr. Edwards lasted one more year before leaving the government. He declined to discuss much about the experience other than to confirm that he later did business with Farmer Mac, assessing loans that he was helping sell to Farmer Mac. Mr. Clinefelter and the other Farm Credit Administration employees at the interview said Mr. Edwards's subsequent work, which does not appear to violate any government ethics rules, was news to them. 
There are signs, though, that the office is working to stay ahead of the news. On May 28, Mr. Reyna sent a confidential memo to Mr. Clinefelter urging him to accelerate this year's scheduled examination of Farmer Mac, along with a demand that he answer 33 questions about Farmer Mac's business practices by July 1. 
The questions, obtained by The Times, range from an inquiry over Farmer Mac's statutory authority to guarantee loans on other companies' books to whether Farmer Mac's officers have "undue influence" over the board's nomination process.
In light of the questions being raised about Farmer Mac, Mr. Reyna promised Mr. Clinefelter that "the board stands ready to provide you with whatever resources you need to get us this information in a timely fashion."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY BUDGET: RECYCLING; 
No to Plastics And Glass; Yes to Paper And Metal

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
New Yorkers will no longer recycle glass or plastic, at least temporarily, but will continue bundling paper and separating metals from their garbage, under a tentative city budget deal. 
 Originally, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had argued that recycling glass, metal and plastic was too expensive and inefficient, and should be suspended until the program was overhauled. But the City Council -- which had proposed creating a separate authority to fix the problems and to jump-start a successful market for other recyclables (like the one that exists for paper) -- argued that if the program were interrupted, New Yorkers would abandon the hard-won habit of sorting their trash. 
 In a compromise, the two sides agreed to continue recycling metal, but to suspend recycling plastic for one year and glass for two years. Mr. Bloomberg said that the suspensions would save the city about $40 million, in part because of reduced sorting cost. But advocates maintain that what New Yorkers will do with their glass and plastic trash could wind up on the street. City officials say that nonrecyclables thrown into garbage could provoke bottle collectors into ripping open garbage. Or sanitation workers will just keep carting it away, if residents keep placing their nonrecyclables with metal trash. 
The statewide 5-cent bottle deposit law remains in effect, and city residents will still be able to redeem their bottles at various outlets. Mr. Bloomberg earlier proposed changing state law to allow the city to keep the 5-cent deposit on carbonated beverage bottles to help finance a new program, but as of last evening, that was no longer part of the plan. 
Even within the Council, which lobbied hard to save the program, recycling faced steep opposition from members who could not rationalize fully restoring a flawed environmental program while cutting human services, they said. But they did not want to let the administration appear to ride roughshod over a law the institution considered a laurel. Metal became the material of compromise, officials said, because there is a clearer market for recycled metal than for that of glass or plastic. 
But recycling advocates, many who had hovered and lobbied and rallied at City Hall in recent weeks, appeared distinctly unmollified. "It's an irrational process with a stupid outcome," said Laura Haight, a senior environmental associate at the New York Public Interest Research Group, arguing that there was no economic rationale for the compromise, which she called the result of a power struggle between the mayor and the Council.
"The metals recycling staying is great, but as long as you've got those trucks tooling around picking up blue bags of recycling, there's no reason why they can't collect plastic, for which there are many markets," she said, adding that glass was more difficult to recycle than plastic. 
Mark A. Izeman, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resouces Defense Council, agreed. "Significantly, recycling will continue for paper and metal, which are the two most valuable commodities in the waste stream," he said. "But the rash decision to suspend recycling for glass and plastic is short-sighted and not in the city's best longterm economic interests." 
While advocates said they were hopeful that a task force, to be appointed in the wake of the agreement, could help fix the program, they also voiced concern that the suspension could spell the end of glass and plastic recycling. 
Whatever ultimately happens, how the new plan will play out on the streets remained unclear. "What's the city going to do, ticket them for having the audacity to throw a ketchup bottle in the recycling bin?" asked Ms. Haight, noting that Mr. Bloomberg's proposed budget raises the penalty for recycling violations. It was not immediately clear last night whether or not that would remain in the agreed-upon budget. 
But Catherine Collins, director of development at We Can, a redemption center on the West Side that works with poor and homeless people, said the suspension would not have a deleterious effect on her organization, especially if the State Legislature expands the 5-cent deposit to noncarbonated beverages.
"There's going to be a huge influx coming our way, since people will still be able to collect the plastics and glass and bring them to us," she said. But in the city, "there's going to be that much more litter, and that much more that's not going to be recycled." 
"It's going to be confusing to New Yorkers to have to deal with new information on what they can and can't recycle," she added. "It took so many years to get people to separate their trash, now it seems that a lot of people just won't want to participate."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Once Again, Bloomberg Displays His Power as a Rainmaker

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is not responsible for the rain. But since he sat down in his bullpen six months ago, most of what he has wished for has come his way. He has gained control of the city's public schools, settled a protracted contract dispute with teachers and cobbled together two major social policy initiatives. Even the drought emergency seems as if it might end, thanks to a series of downpours.
 By shaking hands with the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, on a deal that largely reflects the budget proposed by a mayoral team this spring, Mr. Bloomberg appears to have scored his latest big victory at a time of great fiscal uncertainty. 
 The administration restored about 25 percent of the planned cuts to favorite City Council programs -- about the same percentage usually restored during boom times -- and compromised on the mayor's controversial retrenchment on recycling. But Mr. Bloomberg otherwise managed to persuade Mr. Miller -- who in turn brought around his members -- to see the balance sheet the mayor's way.
"When you are new to a job, you find out what can't be done," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday during an informal chat in the rotunda of City Hall. And then, he reasoned, you take it on. 
Mr. Bloomberg was aided greatly by his first deputy mayor, Marc V. Shaw, and other staff members who once worked for the City Council and know intuitively which programs the body cannot live without. Further, the gravity of the budget gap -- at nearly $5 billion -- did not delude anyone into wishful spending.
By allowing the Council to lay claim to the same amount of restorations enjoyed during a strong economy, and by giving the members credit for enriching the budget of schools and other high-profile areas, the Bloomberg team shrewdly paved the way for the rest of his agenda. That agenda includes heavy trimming to almost every agency and one costly pet project, a new 311 caller system for people to contact city government.
When Mr. Bloomberg met resistance and harsh words from the East Side of City Hall, he did what he always does with adversaries: he ignored them, and talked blandly about mutual concessions. 
Or, he fed them. In the last two months, Mr. Bloomberg has invited six council members to his East Side town house for six different dinner parties, where they shared potpies with famous authors, actors and other notable New Yorkers. Mr. Miller was one such government guest. 
Although Mr. Bloomberg said from the day he was inaugurated that posturing and dancing would not be part of the budget process this time, dance he did. In fact, the entire budget process resembled many sessions of the last eight years, with perhaps fewer verbal grenades lobbed from the west side of City Hall to the east.
The mayor's side proposed tough measures that they were never going to get -- the closing of senior centers and the scrapping of child care programs -- and the City Council threatened to pass its own budget and did not even come close to doing so. Both said they would not budge. They budged.
So while many experts surmised that a largely freshman City Council -- there are 38 new members this year because of term limits -- and a novice mayor could only spell disaster when it came to the budget, yesterday's deal suggests that may not be so, perhaps largely because the City Charter confers far more powers to the mayor than to his legislative partners. A Council can pass its own budget, but the mayor can then essentially impound city funds. 
"The process is more important than the individuals," said Joseph J. Lhota, who negotiated six budgets during his time as budget director and deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration. "Mayors come and mayors go, and now we know that councils come and councils go. But that process is the process." 
But Mr. Bloomberg also brings a certain personality to that process, one that is informed by his years running a private media company and not by serving in government, which until this year, he never had. Like a chief executive trying to close his deal, Mr. Bloomberg has relied on hiding his cards and keeping a smile on his face as he negotiates his way toward what he wants. 
Further, whether it is gunning for control of the school system or putting together a welfare policy, the Bloomberg administration is careful to invite dozens of people who have a stake in the issue through the doors of City Hall to provide input, even if it then ignores them. "It has been the normal democratic process of back and forth," Mr. Bloomberg said last night, when the budget agreement was announced. "That's why the public should feel that everybody was represented. And while everybody isn't going to get what they want -- some people aren't going to be happy -- they at least know their issues, their interests were discussed."
Because Mr. Miller has had fewer challenges to his leadership since he was elected, yesterday's announcement did not solve the mystery of how he would ultimately lead this Council. Was Mr. Miller bringing a sage hand to the process by declining to take the city through a rancorous budget process at a raw time in its history? Or did he fold under the polite pressure of a mayor who is nearly twice his age and who is surrounded by old budget hands like Mr. Shaw?
Last night, Mr. Miller said: "It's not what the mayor got; it's what the people of the city of New York got."
Either way, council members seemed pleased. "What we see here is $175 million in restorations, which is one of the greatest victories the Council can have," said Councilman Joel Rivera, the majority leader. "These could not have been put back in if the Council was not united, and I think the speaker did a very good job of making sure we stayed focused and on point."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY BUDGET: THE DEAL; 
Bloomberg and Council Agree On Budget to Close Big Deficit

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council agreed last night on a budget that would close New York City's worst deficit in decades by going into debt, cutting many city services, suspending recycling of jars and bottles and raising the tax on cigarettes.
 Both sides expressed relief that they had reached an amicable accord on closing a nearly $5 billion deficit in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, but there was little celebration. The budget will shrink the Police Department through attrition, cut nearly $60 million from education, cancel some ambulance shifts and scale back social services. 
 "It is an agreement that we all feel is in the best interest of all eight million people that live in this wonderful city," Mr. Bloomberg said last night, as he and City Council Speaker Gifford Miller met under the rotunda of City Hall to announce the accord. Mr. Miller called it a budget that "reflects the priorities and values of New Yorkers." 
Officials know that if this year's budget is a bitter pill to swallow, next year's will be a bitter horse pill: the city's budget gaps are projected to widen to $6 billion in three years as the city reels from the economic aftershocks of the national recession and the attack on the World Trade Center, and struggles to bring its spending in line with its revenues. While Mayor Bloomberg has repeatedly contended that it would be politically unrealistic to ask Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature to raise various taxes in an election year, he has pointedly refused to rule out tax increases next year.
The $42.3 billion budget accord hewed closely to the proposal Mayor Bloomberg outlined in February, a little more than a month after he took office. It calls for no layoffs and very little in the way of new taxes, instead relying heavily on a fiscal practice that is frowned on in normal times: borrowing $1.5 billion to help pay the city's operating expenses.
But if the Republican mayor could point to the plan as substantially his, the overwhelmingly Democratic Council could point to a number of concessions it had won as well.
The Council persuaded the mayor to restore $175 million that was to be cut, ensuring that no centers for the elderly would be closed, libraries would remain open six days a week, the city could add some day care slots, some cuts to cultural institutions could be restored, and 40,000 summer jobs for teenagers would be saved. Council members could also claim a measure of victory for the mayor's decision to restore nearly $300 million out of the $358 million that he had proposed cutting from education, though the restoration was made possible largely by an increase in school aid from Albany.
Mr. Bloomberg said last night that the city would be able to pay for the restoration of the $175 million because the city would close the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, with more money that it had expected. The mayor did not say how big the surplus would be, but said that the city had spent less than it had planned and saved some money on pension costs and debt service.
On recycling, the mayor met the Council a third of the way. The mayor wanted to suspend recycling of metal, glass and plastic to save roughly $50 million; the Council wanted to preserve the program, arguing that it had taken years, and millions of dollars, to teach the public to separate its trash. In the end, the two sides agreed that the city would keep on recycling metal, but would suspend recycling plastic for one year and glass for two years. Environmentalists criticized the deal, which the mayor said would still save roughly $40 million a year.
The budget contains a number of risky assumptions. Mr. Bloomberg said he was confident that Albany would approve actions worth more than $400 million to the city, including permission to raise the cigarette tax by $1.42 a pack (bringing the cost of a pack to more than $7) and the monthly surcharge on phone bills by 65 cents. But the budget still depends on nearly half a billion dollars in help from the federal government and the city's labor unions that has not yet materialized.
When Mayor Bloomberg presented his executive budget plan in April, he outlined $500 million in contingency cuts that were to be put in effect in the event that the state, federal or union aid failed to fall into place. But those contingency cuts were not included in the budget yesterday; Mr. Bloomberg said he was still optimistic that the aid would come.
"We're halfway, roughly, with the federal monies, and we're more than halfways with the help that we've asked from the municipal unions," the mayor said last night. "So I'm optimistic that we'll get full ways with both of those."
That strategy of waiting for the aid to materialize is not without its drawbacks, though, because the longer the city waits before making a cut, the deeper the cut will have to be in order to yield the desired amount in savings by the end of the year.
Even the help from Albany proved harder to get than some city officials had expected. The city's final agreement was held up for much of yesterday by disagreements in Albany, where state officials differed over what they would approve for the city and Republicans and Democrats feuded about matters altogether unrelated. One of the sticking points there was whether to approve a $17 million program for teacher recruitment and retention. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said the city's package "had things in it that we had not agreed on."
So last night's tentative deal came after a long day of hurry-up-and-wait at City Hall.
Although aides to the mayor and the Council announced that they had a tentative agreement in principle on Tuesday evening, the final handshake on the deal remained tantalizingly elusive for most of the day. The morning began with Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw and Forrest R. Taylor, the chief of staff to Mr. Miller, the Council speaker, taking a stage-managed stroll through City Hall Park so that news photographers could get shots of the two sides acting warmly toward each other (and, as it turned out, images of a man on a nearby bench berating them for the city's homeless policies).
But the formal announcement of a deal did not come. Aides spoke of staging handshake ceremonies at 2 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., postponing each time. City officials said they were waiting on the State Legislature.
Mayor Bloomberg, apparently unperturbed, left City Hall in the evening to throw out the first pitch of opening day for the Brooklyn Cyclones in Coney Island.
Finally, the long-awaited handshake ceremony was scheduled for 8:30, but even that was delayed until around 9:45 p.m. The mayor began the news conference by announcing the score of the ballgame.
For all the work that went into yesterday's agreement, the budget is only a starting point, a best guess as to how much money the city will collect in taxes and aid, and how much the city will need to spend on services. Some budget watchdog groups have already warned that its basic forecasts are too optimistic.
Looking at the mayor's budget plan last month, when it contained even more cuts, the New York State Financial Control Board, which took over the city's finances during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's and now monitors its budgets and financial plans, warned that "2003 budget balance appears to be in jeopardy" and added that "additional action on the city's part is necessary." The city and state comptrollers pointed to risks as well.
But the city, which is required by law to end each year with a balanced budget or risk a takeover by the comptroller, typically modifies its budgets several times in the course of the fiscal year to make sure its spending and revenues remain in line.
Mr. Bloomberg said he was confident that the plan was prudent. "It is the best compromise given all of the needs to this city," he said, "and it sets the stage for us to deal with our economic problems down the road."

HEADLINE: A Buoyant Karzai Is Sworn In as Afghanistan's Leader 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 19 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's new president, Hamid Karzai, was in an ebullient mood this evening after being sworn in as president for the next two years. Just minutes before, the grand council had approved his new cabinet and the appointment of several vice presidents. 
 Mr. Karzai had tried to appoint a balanced cabinet to ease ethnic divisions in the country and to weaken the power of the warlords by drawing them away from their power bases to the capital, but his first steps appeared tentative. 
 The day had been exhausting and difficult, he said in an interview afterward in the gardens of Kabul's old royal palace, adding, "I never want to have to pick a cabinet again." 
But Mr. Karzai said he hoped his new legitimacy would strengthen his hand in securing peace for Afghanistan and winning the country much-needed international aid.
Mr. Karzai's main difficulty was finding a balance in the cabinet that would satisfy the country's powerful factions and ethnic groups and ease the tensions that have brought them to war in the past. He was under pressure to reduce the power of Tajiks, who dominated the interim cabinet, holding the powerful defense, foreign and interior ministries. Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, in particular have demanded more representation in the government.
Mr. Karzai opted for a halfway step, retaining the defense minister, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, but appointing a Pashtun, Taj Muhammed Wardak, an elderly former governor, as interior minister. Delegates approved his cabinet, but few saw Mr. Wardak as a serious counterweight for Marshal Fahim.
Dr. Abdullah, another of the influential Tajiks, will remain foreign minister, and Yunus Qanooni, who resigned as interior minister, will be minister of education.
Mr. Karzai said he was looking further than just a balanced distribution of posts. "We have to have technical people in the interior ministry, to take away the political character of this ministry, and we need a technical and professional minister." 
Of Mr. Wardak, he said: "He is a man who has experience of provincial matters, who has governed before. Let's give him a chance."
Mr. Karzai defended keeping Marshal Fahim, saying it would maintain continuity in the campaign against terrorism. "He's the minister of defense," he said. "He has people that he has, the coalition is working with him and we have an antiterrorism campaign to complete. We cannot just turn things upside down and bring changes overnight." 
Mr. Karzai said a new defense commission would oversee the building of a national army, which Marshal Fahim has not always supported, and he emphasized that the institutions would become more important than individuals.
In a clear attempt to strengthen his central government and to loosen some of the warlords from their power bases, Mr. Karzai appointed three of them vice presidents this week: Marshal Fahim, the Hazara leader, Karim Khalili, and Haji Abdul Qadir, the Pashtun governor of Nangarhar. They would move to Kabul to take on portfolios yet to be announced. The aim, Mr. Karzai said, was to create "a national effort to bring more security and safety to the Afghan people, and to bring institutions to Afghanistan." 
But in this plan he was also only partly successful. Two of the most powerful regional warlords, the Uzbek general from the north, Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Ismael Khan, from Herat in the west, declined to be take vice presidential posts unless they could maintain their regional interests. He said he would keep talking to them and would continue to offer posts in hopes of bringing them in. 
Another warlord, Padsha Khan Zadran, who has openly defied Mr. Karzai and attacked his own town with rockets to try to seize power, was effectively sidelined by the loya jirga, or grand council of 1,600 delegates. "The loya jirga voted overwhelmingly for me," Mr. Karzai said. "And he was there. And he campaigned." 
Mr. Karzai also removed Mr. Zadran's brother, Amanullah, from the cabinet, complaining that he had attended only two cabinet meetings.
"Stability, security, peace, economic well-being of the Afghan people, reconstruction" were his aims for the next six months, he said.
Mr. Karzai said he would not hesitate to implore the United Nations to expand the international security force now patrolling Kabul to other cities if violence erupted there. But he said he did not see an immediate need for that, though there have been recent reports of lawlessness and factional fighting among warlords in the Mazar-i-Sharif area. 
Mr. Karzai also said that he did not believe that the remnants of Al Qaeda and their Taliban supporters posed a serious threat to his government. 
But he insisted that the United States and its coalition partners should maintain their current forces in Afghanistan -- more than 12,000 soldiers -- to finish the hunt for those Al Qaeda fighters, most of whom are thought to be operating along the Pakistan border. 
"Let me be very blunt: there is no mercy there," he said. "They are criminals who have killed people. In Afghanistan they have killed people, they have killed people in America. They must be found, they must be taken to court and societies must be free from their menace."
Asked if he thought that Mullah Muhammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban, was still in Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai said he did, and that Mullah Omar was probably moving from sanctuary to sanctuary in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar.
"He is around," Mr. Karzai said. "Eventually, we'll find him." 
During his speech before the loya jirga and again in the interview, Mr. Karzai called for the immediate release of more than 600 Taliban soldiers being held by commanders in the north. Many of those soldiers are from the south, and Mr. Karzai's call for amnesty is clearly intended to foster regional reconciliation and national unity.
"We must have a distinction between the Taliban and terrorists," he said. "The common talib, he can go home." 
The loya jirga, which has been meeting for nine days, drew to a close today. Still unresolved are the powers and membership of a parliament, but Mr Karzai asked representatives from each electoral zone to remain behind for 20 days to work things out. In the interview, he said he supported the creation of a legislature with the power to enact laws and approve budgets, rather than just the advisory body that some delegates advocated.
"There are lots of things that will come to me and burden me and consume time without a legislative body," he said. "A legislative body will take a lot of my problem away from me."

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW; 
An Edith Wharton Novella, Set to Music

BYLINE:  By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
For 20 years the Center for Contemporary Opera has been making the case that there are new operas out there, and that even if most of them are unlikely to find a place in the standard canon, the least they deserve is an occasional hearing. On Wednesday evening at the Kaye Playhouse, the company closed its season with the New York premiere of Stephen Paulus's "Summer," a work that was given its world premiere in 1999 by another small but enterprising company, the Berkshire Opera.
 Mr. Paulus knows his way around the stage: "Summer," which has a libretto by Joan Vail Thorne, based on the novella by Edith Wharton, is the seventh of his eight operas. His writing for the voice is streamlined and attractive, and if the score does have passages in the awkwardly angular style common in contemporary opera, that style is by far outpaced by straightforward, inviting lyricism. 
 His orchestral writing is equally striking, not least because Mr. Paulus is adept at finding exactly the right coloration and textures -- anything from lush strings or solid brass choirs to delicate harp and percussion tracery -- to underscore what is happening in the drama. Richard Marshall, the company's general and artistic director, was the conductor, and he had a responsive orchestra at hand. Only an occasional brass figure gave the musicians any trouble. The string playing, in particular, was strikingly beautiful.
One thing that Mr. Paulus's music accomplishes is a softening of the current of New England dourness in the Wharton story, which is about Charity Royall, a young woman who was born in the Berkshire Hills but raised in the town of North Dormer by one of its prominent citizens, Lawyer Royall. When the opera begins, Charity is an adult, and her guardian wants to marry her.
The prospect doesn't interest Charity. Not much else does either, certainly not her job in the town's musty, rarely visited library. But when a newcomer arrives -- a young architect, Lucius Harney -- she is immediately drawn to him. Charity has become pregnant by the time she learns that Lucius is engaged to someone else, and at the end of the work she agrees to marry Royall.
The production, directed by Charles Maryan, with a spare set and 19th-century costumes by Lana Fritz, is an economical and attractive frame for the two-hour work, which also benefited from an able, well-balanced cast.
Jessica Grigg did a fine job of bringing to life Charity's variety of conflicts -- everything from class insecurities because of her mountain origins to more commonplace adolescent angst -- while making her essentially likable. She also sang the role with an attractive fluidity, a quality matched by Richard Lippold, who sang Lucius. He shares the stage with Charity much of the time, but he is not as vividly drawn a character. If Charity has a true male counterpart in complexity, it is Lawyer Royall. Michael Lofton sang the role vividly and conveyed Royall's essential kindness as well as the authoritarian streak (and even occasional drunkenness) from which Charity hoped to break free.
The singers in the smaller roles -- Tracy Bidelman as Miss Hatchard, Jody Sheinbaum as Ally Hawes and Joanna Mongiardo as Annabel Balch, Lucius's intended -- all made solid contributions.

HEADLINE: The Treasures of a Private Collector, From Copenhagen 

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
"I might just as well confess now rather than later that I have been rash and made substantial purchases," Wilhelm Hansen (1868-1936) wrote to his wife, Henny, in 1916. "I know, though, that I will be forgiven when you see what I have bought; it is all first class with honors."
 Hansen, a Danish insurance magnate whose inspired acquiring was enabled by his cleverness at business, had just bought the beginnings -- two landscapes by Sisley and one by Pissarro, a Monet cathedral and a portrait by Renoir -- of what was to become the most important collection of 19th-century French paintings in northern Europe. An acute and dogged planner, he got together the Impressionist part of it in only two years, from 1916 to 1918; lost much of it later in business reversals and then managed to rebuild it. 
 The collection, along with a fine group of paintings by Danish artists of Hansen's day and earlier, was given a handsome setting at his 14-acre country place in the town of Ordrupgaard outside Copenhagen. After his wife's death in 1951, the house and the paintings became the state-owned Ordrupgaard Museum. Now, while the museum undergoes expansion, a touring show of its holdings, "The Age of Impressionism: European Paintings From the Ordrupgaard Museum, Copenhagen," is summering at the Metropolitan Museum.
Its 84 works make a splendid display, what with eight paintings by Gauguin (tying in handily with the Met's current show in another gallery, "Gauguin in New York Collections: The Lure of the Exotic"); eight by Degas, six by Pissarro, five each by Monet, Renoir, Sisley and the Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershoi, and treasures by Cezanne, Corot, Courbet, Delacroix, Ingres, Manet and Matisse, among others.
Hansen's maneuverings as a collector were certainly cued by his commercial know-how. A huge success in business at an early age, he turned from an avocational interest in developing a new universal language known as Volapuk (superseded by Esperanto) to art collecting shortly after his marriage in 1891.
At first he and his wife filled their Copenhagen home with Danish art of the early 19th century, by so-called Golden Age painters like C. W. Eckersberg (1783-1853) and his pupil Christen Kobke (1810-1848); romantic landscapists like P. C. Skovgaard (1817-1875); and contemporaries like the Symbolist-oriented realists Hammershoi and L. A. Ring.
But later, visiting Paris on frequent business trips, Hansen began to dream of a significant collection of French art, specifically a dozen paintings by each of the great 19th-century artists important to the rise of modernism. His interest may have been triggered by a 1914 show of 19th-century painting in Copenhagen that was stranded there by the outbreak of World War I.
Prices for art were lower during the war, when Americans were absent from the European market, and Hansen made his first purchases in 1916. Although he, too, stayed away from Paris for the next few years, he was in touch with scouts and advisers there, particularly an important critic, Theodore Duret, a friend of Manet and an Impressionist advocate.
Duret recommended that Hansen buy Manet's "Basket of Pears" (1882), a small, quiet, almost sculptural still life, on view in the show, that was to become one of the businessman's favorite works. After a dinner at his home in 1917 he showed the painting to guests as "an extra dessert." 
Predictably, prices rose immediately after the war, with the advent of an economic boom. Joining a Danish fellow collector and two art dealers, Hansen formed a consortium. Their aim was to obtain "good and outstanding art for Scandinavia," and each contributed money for purchases en bloc, or wholesale, with the idea of keeping individual works and selling the rest.
They bought the Montaignac collection of 233 works before its scheduled sale at a Paris auction, from which Hansen got Daumier's poignant view of a broken-down fighter, "The Wrestler" (1852), and Delacroix's small but feisty "Lion in the Mountains. Lion Attacked" (1851), a king of kings whose body reflects the surrounding landscape. Both paintings are in the show. 
They also got the holdings of a Paris dentist, George Viau, which included more than 200 paintings; part of Degas's collection and studio, sold at his death; and 28 pictures from the well-known French collector Alphonse Kann. Buying from dealers, too, they secured three Degas works from Ambroise Vollard, among them the late pastel "Three Dancers" (circa 1898) -- also in the show -- depicting ballerinas onstage in a whirl of colors. 
By 1918 Hansen could announce the completion of his plan. A three-floor picture gallery was added to the house at Ordrupgaard, designed to showcase his 156 French pictures, ranging from David and Delacroix through Realism and Impressionism to Matisse as the first Fauve. 
At the Met, the Danish and French collections are separated, a good thing, as showing them together would invite unnecessary comparisons. The most interesting of the Danish artists is unquestionably Hammershoi, the last of the great 19th-century Danish painters. His spare, somber interiors and portraits had no traffic with the developing language of modernism (his work in fact is reminiscent of Vermeer), and for years he was ignored. 
But its elegaic moodiness, touching on symbolism -- sometimes suggesting the work of the Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman -- has recently brought it back into critical consciousness. A Hammershoi retrospective, organized by the Ordrupgaard, actually found its way to the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1998. 
The larger French section of the show has true delights, among them a lively Fauve still life by Matisse, "Flowers and Fruits" (1909), and a brilliantly colored Symbolist rendition of still-life components by Redon, done in 1901. Two Gauguins especially stand out, the 1896 Polynesian-flavored "Portrait of a Young Woman (Jeanne Goupil)" and his pre-Fauve masterpiece, "Your Turn Will Come, My Beauty: The Blue Tree Trunks, Arles" (1888). Degas's great portrait of his New Orleans cousin, Mathilde Musson (1872-73), dazzles, as does a bold likeness by Renoir of a Romanian woman, Madame Iscovesco (1877). 
Sisley's strongly composed "Flood, Banks of the Seine, Bougival" (1873), depicting a rather pretty factory and its smokestack reflected in water, comes off as a fine example of Impressionism even though its basis was probably drawing, rather than brushwork improvisation. A great Pissarro representation includes that artist's powerful evocation of springtime, "Plum Trees in Blossom, Eragny, the Painter's Home" (1894), a light-struck tribute to the fecundity of the season.
But back to the collector for a moment. Disaster struck in 1922 with the collapse of a bank that had made heavy loans to the consortium. To pay his debts, Hansen had to sell a number of works, including seven masterpieces by Cezanne. Eventually, he recouped substantially, adding works by Delacroix, Courbet, Daumier, Corot and the Degas portrait of Mme. Musson. He mourned the loss, but what's here is banquet aplenty. 

"The Age of Impressionism: European Painting From the Ordrupgaard Collection, Copenhagen" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 8.

HEADLINE: TV WEEKEND; 
So Much More Than Just a Bodily Fluid

BYLINE:  By Julie Salamon

 BODY:
In the same way that people lined up to donate blood after the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans felt compelled to send blood to Britain during the London blitz of World War II. The man responsible for organizing the American Red Cross's Plasma for Britain campaign was Dr. Charles Drew, an African-American physician. 
 Yet when the United States entered the war, Dr. Drew couldn't donate blood himself because he was black and the country's white policy makers were afraid of "contamination." Later in the war, blacks were allowed to donate blood to soldiers overseas, but the African-American blood was segregated (just as African-Americans were in the United States Army). All the while, the Allies were supposedly combating Nazi bigotry built on notions of racial purity derived from bloodlines. 
 Dr. Drew's story appears in the second episode of "Red Gold: The Epic Story of Blood," a four-part PBS series beginning on Sunday night and concluding the following Sunday. It was inspired by Douglas Starr's book "Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1998). 
While watching, it's worth being mindful of the business interests of the program's sponsors, Chiron Blood Testing and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, a Johnson & Johnson affiliate. These companies have a stake in the series's ultimate conclusion that dire mistakes in the handling of blood have been made in the name of technological advance, but things are better now -- at least for blood-transfusion recipients in the United States. 
"Red Gold" covers obvious blood-related crises like AIDS, but it is most interesting when delving into blood's historic importance in war, commerce, literature and religion. Count Dracula rates barely a mention, but the significance of bloodletting is expounded on at length in the opening episode, "Magic to Medicine." The practice, which helped kill George Washington and gave barber poles their striped design, continues in many places, including India.
Intelligent and enjoyably kaleidoscopic, the series covers the poignant moment when scientists declared that the heart was just a pump, not the seat of the soul. (Couldn't it be both?) It celebrates the volunteers who created blood banks after World War I, solving the problem of finding donors in emergencies. It explores the way plasma became mired in politics in the 20th century, as American drug companies profited mightily from blood donations from prisoners and people in third-world countries. "America was the OPEC of plasma," says Mr. Starr, the author, who appears as a commentator.
The program deals with the fatal mishandling of the AIDS crisis and the consequent contamination of the world's blood supply. (It includes striking images of unrepentant French officials and of Japanese executives bowing in apology to families of people infected with the virus through blood transfusions.)
The producers value braininess over style, and sometimes the programs can be downright fusty. In Episode 2, "Blood and War," after describing the Soviet practice in the 1930's of using cadavers as blood donors, the narrator intones, "In Britain, cadaver blood was nobody's cup of tea."
That quaint word play leads directly, however, to one of the series's strengths: its small portraits of individuals whose practical notions on how to solve problems resulted in profound transformations. One was Percy Lane Oliver, an English Red Cross worker who recognized the need for systematic blood donations in 1921, when a hospital called and asked if he could find a volunteer for an emergency transfusion.
The technology for blood storage hadn't developed yet, so hospitals were always looking for "donors on the hoof," as walk-in volunteers were called. Mr. Oliver realized that serendipity wouldn't do, so he began organizing volunteers who agreed to register their blood types and be on call for emergencies. He ran this operation from his parlor, expanding from that first lone call in 1921 to 7,000 in 1938.
The theory and practice of blood transfusion courses like you-know-what throughout the series, beginning with early calf-to-human experiments conducted in 17th-century France. (A contemporary French physician wonders wryly why this seems so untoward, since people eat animal meat full of blood.) "Red Gold," referring to the economic importance of blood, makes an unusual and unusually clinical history lesson -- fascinating rather than gross or gruesome, though it helps to be able to stand the sight of the stuff.

HEADLINE: Uruguay Lifts Limits on Peso to Assist Economy 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 20 

 BODY:
The government of Uruguay announced today that it would allow the country's currency, the peso, to float freely against the American dollar, in an effort to soften the blow of a deepening regional economic crisis.
 The change in policy, though not unexpected, immediately unleashed a heavy demand for dollars, with Uruguayans rushing to exchange houses in Montevideo, the capital. In the first few hours of panicky trading, the value of the Uruguayan peso dropped by nearly 20 percent against the dollar. 
 In the last decade, the government of Uruguay, South America's smallest country, has let its peso trade within limits set by the Central Bank. But largely because of the current crisis in Argentina, Uruguay's foreign reserves have dropped by more than 40 percent this year, to $1.8 billion, and its bank deposits by 20 percent. Those changes have made the peso vulnerable to market speculation and the support of the trading limits increasingly costly.
"The Central Bank is going to limit itself to assuring that the transition is an orderly one," the president of the bank, Cesar Rodriguez Batlle, said this morning. "Other than some very precise interventions, this is going to be a clean float."
The economy in Uruguay is strongly linked to those of two much larger neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, and depends heavily on agriculture and tourism. Those segments of the economy, already weakened by four years of recession, have suffered severely because of the collapse of the Argentine economy six months ago and recent market turmoil in Brazil.
The Argentine peso has lost more than 70 percent of its value since it was freed from a one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar in January, while the Brazilian real has weakened by more than 15 percent in the same period. As a result, Uruguayan exports like meat are less competitive, and Uruguay's hotels, beach resorts and restaurants have become more expensive for Argentine and Brazilian visitors.
"The changes in the two neighboring countries are adding a very strong element of uncertainty for us," the economy minister, Alberto Bension, said in announcing the new currency policy. In the first quarter of the year, the Uruguayan economy contracted 10 percent, causing bond prices to drop sharply and credit agencies to downgrade ratings of the once-solid Uruguayan economy.
In an effort to halt the slide, the International Monetary Fund recommended on Tuesday that Uruguay's credit line be increased by $1.5 billion. That action came on top of a two-year credit package worth $769 million that the I.M.F. approved in March and the additional assistance of $500 million from the Inter-American Development Bank and $400 million from the World Bank.
"The crisis affecting the region has had more adverse effects on the Uruguayan economy than previously anticipated," Eduardo Aninat, the deputy managing director of the I.M.F., said this week.
Mr. Bension said Uruguay decided to float the peso after consulting the I.M.F., which strongly encourages developing countries to follow that approach. On Tuesday, the government also said it would ask Congress to approve 50 new measures meant to reduce state spending sharply, one condition demanded by the monetary fund in return for the additional aid.
"We are not attacking superfluous expenditures, we are proposing fundamental reforms," Carlos Ramela, an adviser to President Jorge Batlle, said in announcing the austerity package, which he estimated would save the government $260 million. In May, Congress approved a tax increase, mainly on salaries and retirement benefits, that is expected to increase revenue by $230 million but has led to protests and strikes.

HEADLINE: European Summit Talks Open Today; Focus Is Immigration Control 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: SEVILLE, Spain, June 20 

 BODY:
The European Union is at an important crossroads, 15 countries looking to enlarge to 25 while transforming its own ponderous procedures, trying to become both efficient and democratic. But the Union's summit meeting here Friday and Saturday will barely make a dent in the organizational problems. 
 Instead, stung by a political shift to the right in Europe, the leaders have turned this meeting into one dominated by immigration, which was shoved onto the agenda only after the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen did so well in the first round of the French presidential vote in April. 
 The meeting will also face the now common demonstrations against globalization and Europe's confusion in pressing for open trade while continuing to subsidize its own businesses, including an outdated and wildly expensive system of farm subsidies that takes up 45 percent of the European Union budget. 
In fact the host, Jose Maria Aznar, the conservative prime minister of Spain, which is ending its six-month presidency, had to postpone the beginning of the meeting by several hours on Friday to allow his colleagues to arrive. There was a general strike today in Spain, which left few open businesses and no taxis. 
The strike was about domestic changes to social security, but it has made the leaders ever more sensitive to the political backlash from voters concerned about their living standards, crime and foreigners. 
Immigration as a general issue has been roiling Europe and providing votes for right-wing and populist candidates. It has become a major election issue in Germany, with its stagnant economy, high unemployment and history of generosity to refugees.
In Germany, as in France, Britain and Spain, the issue of immigration has also become associated with a perception of rising crime and has taken on a tinge of terrorism. Muslim immigrants in all four countries have been linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.
Urged on by Mr. Aznar and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the leaders will debate how to press other countries to stop the flow of illegal immigrants to a Europe grown wealthy and attractive. 
Britain has suggested economic sanctions or reductions in aid, but other countries, like France and Sweden, are looking for softer solutions, arguing that punishing poor countries will only generate more illegal migration.
But the leaders are expected to endorse plans to increase the number of border guards and to set a timetable to work out a common asylum policy and rules on how applicants are treated. 
The European Commission, the Union's executive body, estimates that half a million illegal immigrants enter each year, almost as many as the 680,000 legal immigrants. But most of the illegal immigrants are believed to be economic migrants who overstay their visas, not people abusing the asylum process. In fact the number of people seeking asylum in Europe has dropped steadily since the end of wars in the Balkans.
Prime Minister Aznar has rejected allegations that Europe is seeking to seal its borders to anybody from outside, which the candidate countries of Eastern Europe fear also means them. "I have said it clearly and I want to reiterate that debates about a 'Fortress Europe' make no sense," Mr. Aznar said. "Europe is not going to be a fortress, nor do we want it to become one, but it will not either be a chasm where anything can pass through."
But both the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, and its High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, have warned European leaders not to toy with people's fears. 
"There is a kind of public mood which unfortunately is not being addressed by political leaders with sufficient leadership," Ms. Robinson said. Efforts to seal borders must be coupled with clear legal channels for immigration, Mr. Lubbers said.
The leaders are also struggling with Europe's economic downturn and the requirement that all countries balance their budgets by 2004, and keep budget deficits less than 3 percent of gross domestic product in the meantime. 
Germany was warned for approaching that ceiling, infuriating Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who faces a tough election fight. So his government has leaked figures showing that France is coming close to the ceiling now.
Finance ministers are trying to soften the 2004 target, making it subject to "growth remaining in line with forecasts," a Spanish official said, one more example of how reality often undermines European Union commitments.
Similarly, Mr. Schroder has said that unless Europe's agricultural policy is reformed, his country cannot afford to pay farm subsidies that would be due to new, poorer members when they join.
European leaders want to keep new members from getting full benefits right away, but that would only postpone the real problem, which is to change a subsidy system that hugely benefits the 5 percent of European workers who are farmers. The 10 candidate countries will more than double the number of farmers and increase the amount of land under cultivation by 42 percent. 
The leaders will also work to resolve another embarrassing problem: The Union wants to have a first real task for its own security and defense program, which is formally separate from NATO. 
The current NATO peacekeeping force in Macedonia is only about 800 troops, and the Europeans want to take it over as a European Union project. But they still need the use of the larger group's equipment, and squabbles between Greece and Turkey -- a member of NATO but not of the Union -- has blocked this small effort to project European power. 
The leaders will also discuss proposals from the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to create an "inner cabinet" to work more efficiently, especially once the Union enlarges. But all such proposals are complicated, touching national interests and even affecting political coalitions within states.
So as usual, major structural change will be put off for another time, awaiting the results of a "convention" talking about a new constitution for the new, larger European Union.

HEADLINE: Fears for Jobs Could Bring Shutdown of West Coast Ports 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., June 19 

 BODY:
For decades, the West Coast longshoremen's union could boast that its members had some of the highest-paying blue-collar jobs in the nation. Workers who unload ships commonly earn more than $85,000 a year.
 But now the longshoremen fear that their jobs -- and those of future generations of longshoremen -- are under siege. 
 Those fears could lead to a shutdown of all seaports from San Diego to Seattle on July 1, a move that could send shock waves through the nation's already fragile economy. 
In the giant Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, by far the nation's largest port, burly longshoremen complain that the shipping companies want to install more computerized technology that they fear could throw hundreds of union members out of work -- and take away jobs for future dockworkers.
Officials with the shipping companies insist that their role is to run an efficient port, not to protect the jobs of the unborn. 
The shipping companies complain about work rules from the 1940's and argue that more modern rules -- and more modern technologies -- are needed or the ports will choke on their own inefficiencies.
These clashing views could lead to the biggest work stoppage on the waterfront since 1971, when the longshoremen staged a four-month strike. While officials with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union say they have no plans to call a strike, the shipping companies fear a crippling job slowdown if no contract is reached by July 1. 
Union members say they worry that management will beat them to the punch and lock out the 10,500 West Coast longshoremen, who load and unload cargo from ships and record all merchandise that goes in or out of the ports.
"If you have a shutdown of these ports, it would be devastating," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. "It's not just what it would do to the West Coast economy, it's what it would do to the U.S. economy."
A study by Stephen S. Cohen, a professor at the University of California, estimated that a five-day work stoppage would cost the nation's economy $4.7 billion and that the cost of a 20-day stoppage would be $48.6 billion. The West Coast ports handle more than $300 billion in goods annually.
Department stores, car dealers, hardware companies and many other businesses fear that a shutdown of the ports could quickly interrupt their supply lines. 
That explains why business groups across the nation are pressuring the union and the management group, the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping lines and stevedores, to reach a settlement before July 1. 
But not much optimism is heard about the negotiations, and that, economists say, is one reason Wall Street has slumped in recent weeks. Not surprisingly, some business groups are urging President Bush to use his powers under the Taft-Hartley Act to order a cooling off period to prevent a strike or lockout.
"It's hard to think that all this is being managed in a way that it will be resolved by July 1," said Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents a variety of companies, including shipping lines, retailers like Target and automakers like Toyota.
For months before negotiations officially began on May 13, management officials said the crucial issue was technology. They said greater use of technology would save money, reduce the two-hour lines of trucks waiting to enter the ports and increase security in cargo-handling when the nation fears new terrorist attacks. 
Management dislikes rules like the one that requires clerks in the longshoremen's union to type in information about all arriving merchandise when that information was already typed in when ships left Asia. 
A study by Michael Nacht, a public policy professor at the University of California, found that not using technology more efficiently cost the shipping industry at least $1 billion a year.
"We cannot avoid the issue of new technology," Joseph Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, told the union when negotiations began last month. "Currently, the West Coast is behind. We must see to it that the West Coast moves to the forefront."
While acknowledging that technology might reduce the number of jobs, management negotiators promised that it would not cause layoffs for any current workers. Many longshoremen are unimpressed by that promise because they do not trust management. But that is not the only reason union members fear more technology. 
"The union doesn't look at these jobs as jobs to trade away," Steve Stallone, the union's spokesman, said when the negotiations began. "We hold these jobs in trust to pass down to other people in the community. We negotiate for the next generation of longshoremen."
Union officials insist that theirs is an enlightened union that has often entertained the greater use of technology. They point to the landmark agreement 40 years ago that allowed ports to handle cargo in large containers. In return, the union shared in the rising profits -- in the form of unusually high wages -- made possible by modernization.
Some union officials acknowledge that the focus on technology has put them on the defensive. They point to other important issues in the talks, among them management's proposals to require retirees and current workers to begin contributing toward their health insurance.
"It's not fair that all these foreign-owned shipping lines want American workers and elderly American retirees who live on a fixed income to pay more for health coverage," said Ramon Ponce de Leon Jr., president of the largest longshoremen's local for the Los Angeles-Long Beach port. 
In a brief interview, Mr. Miniace and James Spinosa, the union's president, defended the pace of the talks. They said in a joint statement that the two sides had successfully negotiated contracts over the past 30 years, and that "we are confident that we will succeed again."

HEADLINE: 2 Columbus Circle Will Be a Museum Again 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The long-abandoned marble-clad confection of a building at 2 Columbus Circle that New Yorkers loved to hate -- but hated to let go -- will be reborn as what it was intended to be: a museum.
 Ending seven years of uncertainty about the structure, originally Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern Art in 1964 but more recently a city office building, the Bloomberg administration said yesterday that it would sell 2 Columbus Circle to the American Craft Museum, now at 40 West 53rd Street. The price was not disclosed. 
 The museum plans to spend at least $30 million to renovate the building as its new home, said its director, Holly Hotchner. Galleries will be used again for art, the underground auditorium for performances and the penthouse restaurant for dining. (It was once the Gauguin Room, specializing in Polynesian cuisine.)
Ms. Hotchner said she hoped for 600,000 visitors a year. "There's a tremendous amount that we'll bring to the mix at Columbus Circle," she said. "We will return it to the full glory of being a museum. We think that's important to everyone in the neighborhood."
Andrew M. Alper, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said the museum would complement the array around Columbus Circle: the AOL Time Warner Center, now under construction; the Central Park gateway; and the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
(Donald J. Trump's bid for the 2 Columbus Circle site was turned down by the city, as was a bid from the Dahesh Museum of Art.)
The sale will be subject to the city's uniform land-use review procedure, which requires public hearings, Mr. Alper said. "This is an important project and we think it's worthwhile getting public comment," he said.
The new craft museum will have more than three times the space of the current one, which also specializes in decorative arts, architecture and interior design.
It is too early to tell whether the almost windowless facade of 2 Columbus Circle will end up still recognizable as a "die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops," as Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic of The New York Times, described it in 1964.
Though the museum has not yet chosen architects for the renovation, Ms. Hotchner said the facade would almost certainly be changed. "We'd like the museum to add to the architectural landscape of New York," she said.

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits A 2-Year Low Against Euro 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
The dollar, after rising sharply in value for years in a reflection of American economic might, is weakening markedly, mirroring concern about the fragility of the economic recovery and the nation's financial condition.
 The dollar fell to a two-year low against the euro today and also edged down against the Japanese yen, continuing a months-long slide. The decline came after new data showed that the United States trade deficit had widened to what some economists said was a worrisome level. 
 The monthly trade deficit in goods and services rose in April to $35.9 billion, a record, as rising exports were swamped by an even bigger increase in imports. A broader measure of the country's international financial standing -- the current account balance, which measures investment flows as well as trade in goods and services -- also posted a record deficit of $112.5 billion for the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported. 
In late trading today, the euro was worth 96.52 cents, up from 95.67 cents a day earlier. The dollar was worth 123.37 yen, down from 123.82 yen.
Since January, the dollar has lost 7.8 percent of its value against other major currencies, according to an index compiled by the Federal Reserve, after rising 33 percent since the mid-1990's. While the dollar is still strong or even overvalued by some measures, its downturn has become pronounced enough that many economists judge it to be at the start of a correction that could continue for some time.
A declining currency would have both positive and negative effects. It would help American manufacturers by making their products less expensive in foreign markets, thereby increasing exports, and could allow domestic manufacturers to recapture sales in the United States by making competing imports more expensive.
But a steady fall in the dollar could put upward pressure on inflation by pushing up import prices, and would make foreign travel more expensive. If the fall in the dollar led investors from abroad to stop putting their money into stocks and bonds in the United States -- and there is already evidence of such a pullback -- interest rates could rise and stock prices could fall further.
Analysts said the dollar's decline appears to have been driven in large part by concern among investors that the United States is not bouncing back as strongly as first hoped from last year's recession. 
But they said it was accelerated by other factors, including fear of terrorist attacks and concern after the Enron scandal that more companies will turn out to have overstated their earnings and hidden their liabilities. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates at very low levels has also held down returns on dollar-denominated investments.
While sticking to its official position that it supports a strong dollar, the Bush administration has shown no inclination to intervene in currency markets to support the dollar's value. As a result, investors have concluded that the administration is content to allow the currency to slide, at least for a while.
The crucial question for the economy is whether the erosion in the dollar, should it continue, will be gradual and orderly, as it has been so far, or whether it will turn into a rout that could destabilize the financial markets and endanger the recovery.
"We're probably going to see a substantial decline in the dollar over the next 12 months," said Robert D. Hormats of Goldman Sachs International, the investment firm. 
"A gradual decline in the dollar shouldn't be surprising and shouldn't be disruptive," he said. "It would be helpful in improving the outlook for the U.S. economy by boosting U.S. exports. But a very sharp decline would induce foreign investors, and indeed U.S. investors, to get out of U.S. financial assets."
When countries run large trade and current account deficits -- in effect consuming more than they produce -- they must make up the gap by borrowing and attracting investment from abroad. 
History suggests that no country can go on financing an expanding trade deficit forever. And though there is a spirited debate among economists about when the United States might reach that point, the dollar's current slide suggests that foreign investors are already scaling back the flow of capital into the United States and putting more of their money into stocks, bonds and business ventures elsewhere.
One outcome, economists said, is a cycle in which a growing current account deficit spurs an exodus by nervous foreign investors, pushing up inflation and interest rates and putting the already weak economy into a stall.
But even a more benign result, in which the dollar remains under pressure but does not collapse in value, could still leave Wall Street on edge.
"Let's be clear: the ballooning trade deficit is reason to sell the greenback," said Kenneth T. Mayland of Clear View Economics, a consulting firm in Pepper Pike, Ohio. "We risk seeing a flood of dollar selling as everybody tries to get through the door at the same time." 
Jay H. Bryson, an economist at Wachovia Securities, said there were signs in today's report on the current account deficit that the pace of foreign investment in the United States was slowing substantially. He said that private foreign purchases of American securities ran at an annual pace of about $260 billion in the first quarter, compared with $400 billion last year, a 35 percent decline.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research organization, said it was impossible to know for sure how lengthy and pronounced a slide was in store for the dollar.
"But we've known for a long time that the dollar has been at the way upper range of its value," Mr. Prestowitz said. "We've known for a long time that the trend of the current account deficit is unsustainable, and we've known that the longer it goes on the greater the chance that the adjustment could be disorderly. Now we're at the beginning of an adjustment and we have to hope it's an orderly one."
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor, said the currency's strength was likely to be influenced mostly by whether the American economy rebounded convincingly this year. 
"It's not that there's a better place to invest right now," he said. "It's just that people are concerned about the vulnerabilities of the U.S. economy."

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators' Rise Is Above Expectations 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
A crucial index of United States economic activity rose in May, signaling that the economy could pick up momentum in the second half of the year, a business research firm said today.
 The research firm, the Conference Board, said its index of leading indicators rose 0.4 percent in May after posting a revised 0.3 percent drop the previous month. The board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said the data pointed to a slow recovery with strength in consumer spending and investment. 
 The April decline, originally reported at 0.4 percent, was the first since September, while the increase last month surpassed the expectations of Wall Street economists, who had forecast a 0.2 percent increase. 
"What we have in the first half of the year is a weak recovery with pockets of strength," Mr. Goldstein said.
"There is no risk of a double dip," he said, but added, "we are not looking at a roaring recovery yet."
The Labor Department reported today that first-time claims for jobless benefits declined slightly last week, suggesting only modest improvement. The claims remained below 400,000 for the third consecutive week, dropping by 2,000, to 393,000, in the week ended June 15 from a revised 395,000 the previous week. This was not as low as Wall Street expectations for a fall to 387,000 from the 390,000 originally reported for the week ended June 8.
Among the leading economic indicators, 5 of the 10 rose in May -- led by money supply, weekly jobless claims and consumer expectations. 
Four components -- including stock prices and new orders for consumer goods -- fell. The average workweek remained unchanged for the month. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for most of the gross domestic product and has fueled the first-quarter bounce in the economy, went through a "temporary moderation" in recent months, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America.
Yet despite this, "the recovery is already unfolding," Mr. Levy said. 
The question, Mr. Goldstein said, remains how much of a recovery will occur in the vital area of capital investment and when. 
He minimized the impact of Wall Street's ups and downs on a broad economic recovery. "We could see an economy improving without an improving stock market," he said.

HEADLINE: Charitable Contributions in 2001 Reached $212 Billion 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The bleak economy and the shock of terrorism failed to appreciably depress charitable giving last year, the latest annual survey by a major fund-raising group shows.
 Americans contributed $212 billion to charity in 2001, a 0.5 percent increase over the previous year when they gave $210 billion. 
 But adjusted for inflation, giving fell 2.3 percent, roughly twice the drop experienced in recent recessions. 
"I'd call that a modest drop," said Leo P. Arnoult, chairman of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel Trust for Philanthropy, which compiles the survey, Giving USA. "Don't lose sight of the fact that it's the largest amount of money ever given by Americans, in spite of two big reasons for uncertainty."
Charitable giving represented 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product, up from 2 percent last year. Before 1999, when it reached 2.1 percent, it averaged 1.8 percent of economic activity, Mr. Arnoult said.
Giving by individuals accounted for roughly three-quarters of charitable contributions, or $160.72 billion in 2001, a 1.7 percent decrease when adjusted for inflation. Personal income, which has a significant influence on individual giving, grew at the slowest rate since 1993.
Corporate giving, which accounts for 4.3 percent of total contributions, plummeted 14.5 percent when adjusted for inflation, reflecting the 18 percent average drop in corporate profits. United Way campaigns around the country have reflected this decline, though over all, United Way contributions are up.
The impact of a volatile, falling stock market was reflected in the amount of giving derived from bequests, which fell 7.1 percent adjusted for inflation to $16.33 billion last year, and in a 2.3 percent inflation-adjusted drop in giving to educational institutions, which tend to receive a lot of appreciated stock as gifts.
Foundation giving was up to $25.9 billion, a 2.5 percent inflation-adjusted increase, which reflects the peculiarities of the foundation budgeting process. Foundations set their budgets a year in advance and are required to pay out at least 5 percent of the value of their endowment to retain their tax-exempt status.
If the value of their endowment falls because of a decline in stock prices, foundations often stick to their budgets and adjust for the lower value the next year. Thus, experts contend foundation giving will fall this year, reflecting the shrinking of foundation endowments in 2001.
The biggest surprise in the Giving USA report was the sharp increase in giving to human services agencies, which received $20.71 billion, or 11.9 percent more on an inflation-adjusted basis than in 2000. 
Mr. Arnoult said the preference for giving to human services agencies reflected their increasing sophistication with fund-raising and heightened public awareness of the sector after Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: Panel to Look for Banned Corn 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 20 

 BODY:
An environmental commission set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement said today that it would investigate reports of transgenic corn growing in southern Mexico. 
 The commission is responding to concerns that imported transgenic corn has contaminated native crops. 
Scott Vaughan, head of the economy and trade division of the panel, the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, said genetically modified corn was a "huge issue" for Mexico and warranted additional investigation. 
 The results of the inquiry, in the southern state of Oaxaca, could come in nine to 10 months, he said. 
The commission is an environmental body set up under Nafta, which joins the United States, Mexico and Canada. Commission scientists from the three countries are to begin the investigation in mid-July. 
The cultivation of transgenic corn was banned in Mexico in 1998 amid fears that it would contaminate the hundreds of wild creole varieties growing in Mexico, believed by many to be the birthplace of corn. 
But scientists from the University of California at Berkeley published studies last year saying they had found transgenic corn, also known as genetically modified corn, in the mountains of Oaxaca.
The results from Berkeley have been challenged since then, though the scientists and local groups maintain that the mutated corn is still spreading in the Oaxaca Sierra.
Genetically modified crops are plants spliced with foreign genes to help them resist drought and pests. No health risks have proved to be linked to the consumption of transgenic corn.

HEADLINE: With No New Taxes or Emergency Cash, Albany Won't Play Hero for City 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN

 BODY:
When local governments complain of financial burdens too heavy to bear, Albany often comes to the rescue, plugging budget holes with millions of dollars in state money. But for New York City, the pumping heart of the state's economy, that has not held true.
 The new state budget has given New York City little more than permission to sink deeper in debt. And Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been quick to acknowledge that he does not want to be unrealistic in his requests to Albany. 
 But fiscal analysts say the state has actually helped worsen the city's finances, through actions taken both before and after Sept. 11.
In October, in one of their first actions after the terrorist attack, Albany leaders finalized a budget that eliminated a $114 million payment the city had gotten every year starting in 1978.
"There's no two ways about it," said E. J. McMahon, a budget expert with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research center. "It's little short of amazing how little the state has done for the city."
Albany officials protest that charge, saying they lobbied hard in Washington to win $21.5 billion in federal aid to the city. The governor has committed $40 million to promoting tourism; the first ad featured himself. He takes credit for persuading the federal government to pay for 100 percent of the disaster cleanup costs, instead of the usual 75 percent, said a spokesman for the state budget office, Kevin C. Quinn.
"Despite its own unprecedented fiscal challenges, the state has been working every day since 9/11 to help the city recover both fiscally and economically," Mr. Quinn said.
Yet the state has increased its overall spending by 6 percent, including a health care package that requires the city to raise wages for its employees. Critics have complained that the health care deal was politically motivated to help Governor Pataki in an election year.
"I would have more sympathy for the state saying 'We have our own fiscal problems' if they hadn't done a multibillion-dollar health deal a week before the budget came out," said Elizabeth Lynam, a senior research assistant at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission in Manhattan. "The state is not acting like it has a fiscal crisis."
Some state measures related to 9/11, like refunding income tax to the families of victims or extending Medicaid coverage, will actually cost the city. But there is some good news in this year's budget: the city got a slightly higher percentage of total school aid than in the past.
The percentage of state school aid the city receives figures in a longstanding contention that New York City gets less than its share of state funds, for everything from economic development to environmental cleanups. But in the late 1990's, when the city was running a surplus, the argument that the city should get more carried little weight.
In 1999, the Legislature abolished the city's commuter tax -- it would now be worth an estimated $500 million a year -- pointing to the city's robust finances. Although the economic picture has changed drastically, no one is hustling to restore that revenue stream.
The big-ticket items on the state's list of relief for the city involve nothing more than permission: to borrow $435 million against money the state has owed the city for years, to collect a business-investment tax that the state and federal governments have chosen to forgo, to refinance debts and to raise the cigarette tax (with Albany taking half the proceeds).
By contrast, the state bails out other local governments with cash, albeit much less than a city the size of New York might require. This year, under a program once known as aid to distressed cities, Buffalo will receive $49 million. Yonkers gets $47 million. The city of Auburn, population 28,500, gets $1.1 million. Nassau County, which was on the brink of self-inflicted bankruptcy, will get the second of five $20 million installments. New York gets nothing.
Some fault Mayor Bloomberg for not asking for more, particularly in a year when the city could make a strong case for sympathetic ears. The mayor asked Albany for $400 million from a menu of requests, many of which, like debt refinancing, would cost the state nothing.
Democrats have complained that the Republican mayor has protected the Republican governor by not making difficult demands. Mr. Bloomberg, who has argued that new taxes would be impossible for Albany in an election year, did not ask for an income tax surcharge, as the City Council had suggested, or restoration of the commuter tax. (He did, however, ask for the $114 million back. The answer was no.)
William Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, said the modesty of the mayor's requests was born of pragmatism. "The goal was to close the gap," he said. "It was not to drive an agenda. It was not to look valiant carrying a banner that you knew would never get over the line."
Yet the package of benefits, which passed in Albany last night, falls short of the $400 million -- by some estimates far short.
State officials say the difference has been made up by other measures, like a tax amnesty program that is expected to reap $20 million. Another $50 million is a loan purchase, a short-term windfall. The costs of one stimulus measure, nine days of tax-free shopping in Lower Manhattan, will be borne by both city and state.
Albany could have provided much more help, say critics like Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan policy research group. 
"The city's facing a structural economic problem, including the loss of half a dozen companies, and the best they can come up with is a couple of tax-free holidays and allowing the city to raise its cigarette tax and parking fines?" Mr. Bowles said. "That's pathetic."

HEADLINE: In Albany, Compromise Proves Elusive 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 20 

 BODY:
Clergy members would be required to report allegations of child abuse to the authorities under a tentative agreement between the Senate and the Assembly today, one of the few compromises lawmakers forged on the last official day of the legislative session.
 But as the day wound down, it became clear that the Republicans in control of the Senate and governor's office would not reach agreements with the Assembly's Democratic majority on a host of significant bills. 
 So little progress was made by the evening that the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, reversed his longstanding opposition to extending the session and said he would call back the Senate next week if agreements could be hammered out with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver.
Deals were scarce today. A tentative deal reached last week on a bill to ban smoking in restaurants across the state fell apart after the Republicans insisted on carving out an exception for small restaurants. Lawmakers also failed to resolve differences over how to reduce the state's lengthy sentences for drug crimes enacted in the 1970's under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican seeking a third term, also could not find common ground with the Assembly Democrats on how to change the clean-up standards for toxic waste sites. Neither could he persuade the Democrats to pass a raft of bills aimed at giving state and local police greater authority to investigate terrorist organizations.
All day, the halls of the Capitol were jammed with well-dressed lobbyists, advocates and protesters. Senior citizens in red T-shirts, wheelchair-bound protesters and former inmates jailed for drug crimes swarmed through the Capitol, buttonholing elected leaders and urging them to forge compromises on bills.
Late in the evening, the two houses passed a bill that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had requested to help the city close a $5 billion budget gap. The bill saves the city $125 million by allowing it to collect taxes on business investments that the state and federal government have agreed to forgo this year as part of an economic stimulus package.
The mayor had asked for an additional $400 million, but the package is worth between $300 million and $370 million, depending on whose estimates are used. The measure gives the city the authority to raise taxes on cigarettes and telephone service, both wireless and conventional, as well as increases fines for parking violations. The bill would also provide money for recruiting teachers and let the city refinance some of its debt.
The Senate Republicans held the tax package up for a day after the governor and the Assembly Democrats tried to tack on a $17 million appropriation for training teachers in the city. The bill finally passed after the Assembly Democrats agreed to add a sweetener for the Senate Republicans -- more aid for school districts upstate and on Long Island.
The Assembly and Senate also passed a bill sought by the rental-car industry that would allow companies to again charge customers a $9-per-day fee to avoid liability for any damage to the car from a collision. New York State banned the fees, known as collision damage waivers, in the late 1980's, after a scandal involving rental car companies charging customers for bogus repairs. 
Proponents of the bill said that forcing companies to absorb the costs of damaged cars had put many small rental companies out of business. They also argued that most people were covered under their private car insurance or through their credit cards.
But critics characterized the fees as a lucrative giveaway to rental-car companies without exacting any promise in return that rates would decline or the companies would stop what some call discriminatory practices. "This gives away the store to companies that will pocket the difference with no commitment whatsoever to clean up their business practices," said Assemblyman Alexander B. (Pete) Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan who led the fight against the bill on the floor.
Governor Pataki has not said whether he will sign the bill. "We're going to take a look and review the details," Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor, said.
Perhaps the most important bipartisan agreement reached today adds priests and other clergy members to the list of professionals, like teachers and doctors, who must report credible allegations of abuse within a family. More than 20 professions are now on the list.
Under the tentative agreement, the new law would also expand what these professionals must report. Not only must they report allegations of abuse within a family but abuse by others as well. Family abuse would be reported to social workers in the State Office of Children and Family Services. Abuse by others must be reported to the police.
The bill calls on religious organizations to review the last 20 years of their personnel files and to turn over any old allegations of abuse to the authorities. Failing to report an allegation would be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Prosecutors could only press charges for incidents of abuse within the last five years. Clergy members would not have to report anything they learned during sacred confession in a church or some other temple.
The bill was sparked by the scandal over the sexual abuse of teenagers and children by Catholic priests, though it covers all religious groups. Legislative leaders and the governor had agreed in principle to the bill last night, but lawyers were haggling over some of the language.
One worry was that the bill's provisions were too broad and would force, for instance, a doctor or social worker to report teenagers who are having consensual sex to the police. Those flaws were expected to be ironed out on Friday, and the legislative leaders said they hoped to pass the bill as early as next week. The Assembly will return on Tuesday, and Senator Bruno said tonight the Senate would return once final agreements were reached on several bills.
Late in the evening, Mr. Pataki and the two legislative leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on legislation to create the crime of identity theft, punishable by up to seven years in prison. The bill would make it illegal to steal Social Security numbers, addresses, drivers' license numbers, credit card numbers or codes for automatic teller machines with the intent to commit a crime. Some criminals use this information to apply for credit cards, take out loans or raid bank accounts.
The deadlock over how to shorten the state's lengthy sentences for drug crimes seemed only to worsen today. A group of former inmates who had received 15-year-to-life sentences under the Rockefeller-era laws met with the governor to urge him to work harder to find a compromise with Mr. Silver.
Afterward, some blamed Mr. Pataki for the impasse. On Wednesday, the governor and Senate Republicans passed a bill that only reduced sentences for Class A offenders, who currently receive 15 years to life. More than 200 people in prison would be immediately eligible for release if the bill passed.
But family members of prisoners and former inmates said the bill was a cynical attempt to get them to choose between possibly freeing their loved ones or holding out for a more comprehensive overhaul of the laws.
"We hold Governor Pataki responsible for the breakdown in negotiations," said Elaine Bartlett, who served 16 years in prison for delivering 4 ounces of cocaine to a dealer in Albany. "They need to go back to the table. People are doing crazy time for small amounts of drugs."
Mr. Silver reiterated his position that he would not pass a law affecting only the top category of offenders. He said it would give the governor the ability to say he had reformed the laws during the election campaign without doing anything for the majority of inmates, who are charged with Class B offenses.
For his part, the governor put out a statement casting the blame on Mr. Silver, saying his legal team "has been waiting for days for the Assembly to come to the table."
The legislature passed hundreds of minor bills as well. One bans the use of the fur and flesh of dogs and cats in manufactured goods like clothing and coats. The bill passed both houses overwhelmingly, much to the delight of animal-protection groups.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Disney marshals its parts into a new kind of advertising deal.

BYLINE:  By Eric Garland 

 BODY:
THE $1 billion deal recently struck between the Walt Disney Company and OMD USA, the media arm of the Omnicom Group, has become a subject of much controversy in the clubby world of media advertising.
 The far-ranging pact, considered the largest of its kind, represents a critical shift in the way media will be bought and sold, said Joe Uva, president and chief executive of OMD Worldwide, parent of OMD USA. 
 "We're moving from deals to relationships," he said. Instead of striking individual deals for the different advertisers it represents, OMD has decided in this case to pool its clients' power and buy them ad time, ad pages, promotions and a host of other benefits across all divisions of a media giant like Disney.
But competitors at other media agencies question whether Mr. Uva has delivered anything quite so revolutionary. Even if the deal is done as advertised, there are doubts about how well such grandly designed schemes can work in an increasingly volatile media marketplace, where network audiences continue to shrink and attention spans are carved up thinner than a Zabar's lox. 
In its scope and complexity, the deal between OMD and Disney would be a landmark in an era of frenzied media consolidation. OMD, which represents clients like PepsiCo, Visa, McDonald's, Nissan and Gillette, will be able to tap into trophy ABC properties like the 2003 Super Bowl, the Academy Awards and the National Basketball Association games, as well as Disney's radio, magazine and Internet units.
OMD clients will also get favored access to cable networks in which Disney owns large equity chunks, like ESPN, A&E and Lifetime. (Disney's theme parks and filmed entertainment group are not involved, nor are the cable channel E and Us Weekly, the Wenner Media magazine in which Disney has a 50 percent interest.)
The one-year deal, which starts Oct. 1 and has renewal options for both parties, essentially guarantees Disney a secure revenue stream in an uncertain economy (and may keep some advertiser dollars from flowing into rival pockets), while OMD's clients get flexibility and choice in their use of Disney properties.
"We finally pulled off the first one," said Mike Shaw, president of sales and marketing at ABC Television Network. "This has real heft and weight."
Skeptics in the media-buying community say that although many agencies were exploring large cross-platform deals early in the year, the surprisingly strong upfront sales market (when the bulk of television network time for the fall is committed) caused them to put their plans off, in part because fast-moving negotiations left little time to work out the intricacies.
Meanwhile, they suggest, OMD simply threw together some separate Disney ad buys and tied a glorified multiplatform ribbon around the package to get attention.
"Is this is a real deal? I'm not sure it's happened," said David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, part of the Aegis Group, which is the largest remaining independent ad buyer.
Another top media buyer said, "The claim that there is a billion-dollar deal is absurd; this is categorically not an agency deal," implying that the advertising was bought piecemeal in the name of specific clients, rather than by OMD in one fell swoop. 
Mr. Uva denied such assertions. "This was always a multiplatform package," he said. As for timing, Mr. Uva said discussions began in January between the principal deal makers, Bill Bund of ABC and Dan Rank of OMD, and a deal was concluded before the upfront sales started in late May.
Another media agency principal, however, pinpointed May 31 -- the heart of the broadcast network upfront negotiating period -- as the date when OMD secured its ad time on ABC's television network for the coming fall season.
At the least, Mr. Uva, 47, knows how such packages work from the inside. As head of sales and marketing for the Turner Entertainment Group for six years, he was the point person on stitching together AOL Time Warner properties for clients like I.B.M. and Coca-Cola.
In November 2001, Mr. Uva was recruited to run OMD, which was late to the game of combining the various media planning and buying units of Omnicom's creative agencies, which include BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide.
By bulking up, OMD could come to the bargaining table in 2002 with the kind of influence that the other big agency holding companies -- the Interpublic Group of Companies, the WPP Group and the soon-to-merge Publicis Groupe-Bcom3 Group -- wield. Collectively, these four entities control about 85 percent of American television ad spending, according to OMD estimates.
Such power is now the price of entry for dealing with media giants like AOL Time Warner and Viacom across their vast range of holdings. In the media world's version of an arms race, both sides have been acquiring assets and probing each other to come up with pacts that assure mutual satisfaction, rather than gouging or recrimination.
"It was clear someone was going to do a mega-deal" this year, said Christopher Dixon, who oversees global media coverage for UBS Warburg. "The issue was: Is a network willing to transfer its wholesale pricing to a media buyer?"
That is what Disney has effectively done by casting its lot with OMD, rather than having each of its business divisions sign contracts with individual OMD advertisers. Previous cross-platform deals have been done on a smaller scale and on behalf of a single client, like a reported $300 million pact between Procter & Gamble and Viacom last year that was brokered by the MediaVest unit of Bcom3. (That deal was recently renewed.) 
What raises eyebrows about the OMD-Disney package, along with its dollar size, is the presence of multiple clients.
"What it comes down to, from the standpoint of the advertiser, I don't think they get real value," said Michael Drexler, chief executive of Optimedia US, a media agency owned by the Zenith Optimedia Group, which in turn is owned by Publicis and the Cordiant Communications Group.
Without knowing the specific components offered by Disney, Mr. Drexler said: "When you do a multiclient corporate deal, you're committed to that inventory. And how can that inventory be the best for every client in the deal? You're limiting their options."
Both Mr. Uva and Mr. Shaw insist that having multiple clients involved simply allows for more leeway on both sides.
"Yeah, this would have been a lot easier to do if it was just about discounting," Mr. Shaw said. "But this is about what's best for OMD's customers. They now have a menu that has 15 platforms. It's a huge banquet. Maybe eight of them work for one client. Maybe another wants to buy everything on the menu."
Whether those clients walk away with a four-star meal or a bad case of indigestion will not be known for another year. The challenge now for OMD is to deliver on its promise as a sophisticated arbiter of audience tastes and preferences. 
Mr. Uva knows that the reviewers are waiting to pounce, but he is convinced that OMD has gotten a head start on the media future. "We don't feel we have to justify anything to our competitors or naysayers," said Mr. Uva. "We only have to justify it to our clients. And we believe it's a good arrangement."

HEADLINE: Fear Of All Sums 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"It is difficult to get a man to understand something," wrote Upton Sinclair, "when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." To make sense of what passes for debate over Social Security reform, one must realize that advocates of privatization -- of replacing the current system, at least in part, with a system of personal accounts -- are determined not to understand basic arithmetic. Otherwise they would have to admit that such accounts would weaken, not strengthen, the system's finances.
 Social Security as we know it is a system in which each generation's payroll taxes are mainly used to support the previous generation's retirement. If contributions from younger workers go into personal accounts instead, the problem should be obvious: who will pay benefits to today's retirees and older workers? It's just arithmetic: 2-1=1. So privatization creates a financial hole that must be filled by slashing benefits, providing large financial transfers from the rest of the government or both. 
 During the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush was able to get away with the nonsensical claim that private accounts would not only yield high, low-risk returns, but save Social Security at the same time. For whatever reason, few reporters pointed out that he was claiming that 2-1=4. But when it came time to produce concrete plans, the arithmetic could no longer be avoided.
Sure enough, the plans laid out by Mr. Bush's Commission to Strengthen Social Security, though presented as confusingly as possible, involve both severe benefit cuts and huge "magic asterisks," infusions of trillions of dollars from an undisclosed location. The extent of the damage is documented in a new Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report by Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution. (Mr. Diamond, who is one of the world's most eminent economists, and is arguably the world's leading expert on retirement systems, was my colleague when I taught at M.I.T.) 
The Diamond-Orszag report is informative; even I was surprised by a couple of revelations. For example, the mystery money infusions that the commission assumes will somehow be forthcoming are almost enough to preserve Social Security exactly as it is, with no benefit cuts, forever. Also, the commission's plans include severe cuts in disability benefits, a crucial part of Social Security that privatizers have a habit of overlooking.
But in a way, the most interesting thing about the new report is the administration's reaction. Charles Blahous, who was executive director of the commission and is now on the White House staff, quickly responded with a memo best described as hysterical. The number of non sequiturs and misrepresentations Mr. Blahous manages to squeeze into just a few pages may set a record. Among other things, he angrily accuses Mr. Diamond and Mr. Orszag of failing to address issues they cover quite clearly. Of one such accusation, Mr. Orszag remarks drily that "in his haste to issue a response to our paper, the Executive Director appears to have overlooked the final box . . . which addresses precisely that issue and provides the comparisons he requested (though he may not be pleased with the results). We direct his attention to that box."
A sample of Mr. Blahous's tactics is his insistence that private accounts don't weaken Social Security, because diverting money from the trust fund into those accounts doesn't reduce the total sum of money available -- if you still count private accounts as part of the total. As they say in the technical literature, "Well, duh." Of course the money doesn't disappear -- but it is no longer available to pay benefits to older Americans, whose own Social Security contributions were used to pay benefits to previous generations. 
As the facts about Social Security privatization gradually emerge, the general strategy of the privatizers seems to be to keep the public confused as long as possible. Indeed, Republicans are now being told to deny that personal accounts -- which expose their owners to all the risks of any private investment -- constitute "privatization." "Do not be complicit in Democratic demagoguery," urges one party memo. So it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, but it isn't a duck -- not until after the next election.
But whatever they say, it is a duck. And the administration economists who claim that privatization will strengthen Social Security are, more than ever, revealed as quacks.

HEADLINE: Watch What You Say 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: RAWALPINDI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Before recounting how President Clinton burned alive dozens of Christians (this feint is known in the column trade as baiting the right), let me offer a quick historical quiz: What religion were Muhammad's parents?
 You might think that they, like most people in Arabia in the sixth century, probably worshiped tribal gods and idols. It might seem difficult for anyone to have been a Muslim before Muhammad. 
 If that's what you think, bite your tongue -- if you visit Pakistan. 
Dr. Younus Shaikh, a teacher at a medical college, sits in a brick prison here, after being sentenced to death for blasphemy last year. I couldn't interview him because the warden caught me trying to slip into the prison as a visitor (I didn't look like a family member). But the issues are clear.
During a lecture, Dr. Shaikh digressed and allegedly speculated that Muhammad's parents may not have been Muslims, and that before receiving God's revelations at the age of 40, Muhammad might not have shaved his pubic hair.
That was a scandalous charge: pious Pakistani men shave their armpits and pubic hair but not their faces. As for the speculation about Muhammad's parents, that was held to be blasphemous because of Koranic verses suggesting that prophets like Abraham (and thus why not others?) could be considered Muslims, in the literal Arabic meaning of the word, which is people who submit to God.
Dr. Shaikh is one of several hundred people facing execution in Pakistan from this modern Islamic Inquisition. Many are religious minorities who sometimes are sentenced to death simply for using the standard greeting of the Islamic world, "as-salaam aleikum." That means "peace be with you," but militants say the phrase is reserved for Muslims.
The West is full of irresponsible vituperations about Islam being no more than a religion of violence and hatred. The vitriol amounts to an unrecognizable caricature to anyone who has lived in the Islamic world, enjoyed its hospitality and admired the dignity it confers on its humblest believers. Yet the bottom line is that nobody so distorts, denigrates and defames Islam as radical Muslims themselves, particularly the mullahs who try to have people executed for saying "peace be with you."
Abdul Rashid Ghazi, a thoughtful, well-educated imam in Islamabad, asked me why the fuss over Dr. Shaikh, one man, when America has killed thousands in Afghanistan. I replied that blasphemy raises a larger concern for Islam itself: like Christianity in the Middle Ages, the Islamic world today suffers from a stultifying closed-mindedness and intellectual rigidity that impoverishes Muslim countries and in some cases endangers their neighbors.
Fundamentally, Pakistan's biggest problem today is not India but this close-mindedness. Pakistan has an industrious and often entrepreneurial people, a well-educated elite, a modernizing leader who could be another Ataturk -- and mullahs who try to block discussion about emerging from the Middle Ages.
Most Pakistanis would like to see blasphemy laws repealed and seem aghast at the mullahs' effort to cripple the Pakistani economy by banning interest payments. But while the religious parties win less than 5 percent of the votes in elections, they command huge influence because few dare disagree with them publicly.
One of the few public figures who took on the fanatics is Moinuddin Haider, the interior minister. The radicals responded by shooting his brother to death. So while there are many sensible Pakistanis, few pipe up to counter the weird lies, conspiracy theories and claptrap that ensnare Dr. Shaikh -- and all of Pakistan.
That leads me to how I heard about President Clinton executing the Christians. One of the mullahs I interviewed, Abdul Wahid Qasmi, asked: Since America executes blasphemers, why shouldn't Pakistan?
After what happened to Daniel Pearl, journalists these days try not to be too impertinent when interviewing Pakistani clerics. But I politely suggested that he might search his belfry for bats.
Mr. Qasmi still insisted that America burns heretics. As evidence, he plucked an Urdu book and began reading aloud about the Clinton administration burning scores of Americans after they blasphemed Jesus.
"The leader of the heretics," he said, "was named David Koresh."

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes Doubling U.S. Support for Education in Africa 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
President Bush tonight proposed doubling the amount of money his administration spends on education in Africa, to $200 million over the next five years.
 Mr. Bush also said he intended to visit Africa next year, which would be his first trip to the continent. 
 The president made his announcement five days before he is scheduled to attend a summit meeting of industrialized nations, in Canada, where development in Africa is to be a central part of the agenda. The Bush administration has been under growing pressure to show a commitment to Africa, particularly after a much-publicized visit there last month by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Bono, the Irish rock star who has become an advocate for the poor. 
In addition, White House advisers see Mr. Bush's planned trip to the region as a chance to extend the president's "compassionate conservative" agenda internationally and show that his administration is interested in more than war and the campaign against terrorism.
"America will not build this new Africa," Mr. Bush said. "Africans will. But we will stand with the African countries that are putting in place the policies for success." 
Mr. Bush spoke at a dinner at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in memory of the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, the clergyman and civil rights leader who drafted guidelines for American businesses operating in South Africa under apartheid. 
Under Mr. Bush's proposal, the additional $200 million will provide training for 420,000 teachers and pay for 4.5 million textbooks and 250,000 scholarships for African girls. White House officials said the new money would bring the administration's total spending on education in Africa to $630 million over the next five years.
Development experts generally praised the broad ideas of Mr. Bush's speech, saying that it reflected a new and significant political judgment within the administration of the need to do more in developing countries. But they also said that the money was wholly inadequate to make a great deal of difference.
"I give the administration credit for having turned the corner," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the development economist. "The levels of assistance, though, are incredibly low and insufficient relative to our capacities and our wealth and the needs of these countries. Inside the administration there's been a political judgment to do more, which I applaud, but there has not been an analytical definition of need or a budget planning process that could meet it."
Mr. Bush also repeated his commitment tonight to spend $500 million to prevent expectant mothers from passing the virus that causes AIDS to their babies. He said that the new money would provide treatment to a million women a year over the next five years. 
"One of the greatest obstacles to Africa's development is H.I.V./AIDS," Mr. Bush said. "The world must do more to fight the spread of this disease." The United States, Mr. Bush said, will take the lead.
White House officials hope that Mr. Bush's announcements of more aid to Africa will temper the criticism of those who say the United States is a rich nation that is shirking its responsibilities to help the world's poor. The $10 billion American aid budget is the lowest among rich nations as a percentage of the total economy.
Among those at the head table tonight were three members of the administration who have advocated doing more in Africa: Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Mr. O'Neill and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. Mr. O'Neill recently briefed the president about his own trip to Africa last month.
Mr. Bush also said it was essential to increase trade between the United States and Africa. "Africa is a continent where promise and progress are important," Mr. Bush said. "And we recognize they sit alongside disease, war and desperate poverty -- sometimes in the same village."
The president said there were only a few African nations that aided terrorists, and he gave some praise to Sudan for supporting the United States in its campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda last fall. But Mr. Bush also said Sudan must end its 19-year civil war, allow in food shipments and end slavery.
"Sudan can and must do more," he said. "Ending its support for terror outside Sudan is no substitute for efforts to stop war inside Sudan."

Court Upholds State Review Of Health Care Decisions
The Supreme Court has upheld the states' authority to protect the rights of patients in disputes with managed care companies over denial of recommended treatments. Such protections, guaranteeing outside review of a health plan's refusal to pay for a procedure, are the centerpiece of the federal patients' rights bill that has passed both houses of Congress in different versions but remains stalled there.
 Patients' advocates said the 5-to-4 decision did not eliminate the need for Congressional action because state laws excluded millions of people who could be protected only through federal legislation. Page A1.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Moviegoers AreFlocking To Forget Their Troubles

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 20 

 BODY:
At a time when viewership and attendance are either flat or shrinking in virtually every form of pop-culture entertainment, Hollywood is enjoying one of the biggest bursts of popularity and profitability in its history. 
 Box-office revenues for the first five and a half months of 2002 are up at least 20 percent over that period in 2001, which was already a record year. Even taking slightly higher prices into account, the number of people actually buying tickets and going to movies is up around 16 percent from last year. 
 Meanwhile, the major broadcast television networks are attracting fewer eyes. Magazine subscriptions are down. Single-copy sales are plummeting. Consumer book sales? Down. Spending on CD's and other forms of recorded music? Waning. Even rental and sales of videos and DVD's are off. Most major theme parks have seen sparser crowds, as have many major sporting events. 
The movie surge has left Hollywood executives, marketers, analysts and theater owners searching to explain their sudden, unexpected bounty -- and why it seems to be affecting the movies almost exclusively.
"The usual answer when there's an upturn is that it's good movies and good movie houses," said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners. "But when you look back, the truth is that Hollywood always does well when people feel unsettled or challenged. For whatever reason, Americans seek comfort in the movies."
The 2002 boom was fueled first by movies released during last year's holiday period. Those movies, like "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," made much -- in some cases, most -- of their money this year.
But it has continued, week by week, with a string of hits like "Black Hawk Down," "Ice Age," "Panic Room" and, more recently, "Spider-Man," "Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones," "The Sum of All Fears" and "Scooby-Doo." 
Many point to factors outside the movie industry, from the sluggish economic recovery to lingering anxiety about the state of the world. Others cite the proficiency of Hollywood marketers at turning almost every weekend's opening into a major pop-culture event. Still others mention new multiplexes with stadium-seating, digital sound systems and other bells and whistles designed to make a trip to the movies more enticing.
"You know, it's air-conditioned," said Terry Press, the marketing chief at Dreamworks. "The seat is comfortable. You can sit there and eat candy. And it's still a very unifying experience."
So why don't they go out and sit with other people at the ball game? 
"Sports is not a fantasy, it's reality," she said. "At certain times, people want to be told stories and they want it to happen outside the house, in a communal setting." 
Some even maintain -- with straight faces -- that this upsurge must mean that the movies themselves have gotten better. 
"That's a hoot," said George F. Custen, a professor of cinema studies at the City University of New York.
The consensus is that, on average, Hollywood studio movies have gotten demonstrably worse in recent years -- safer, more predictable, more likely to be sequels, franchises or some other form of risk-averse pablum. 
"Everyone is doing a lot more prequels, sequels and introducing already branded elements like Spider-Man or Scooby-Doo," said Amir Malin, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment. "It makes the job of marketing so much easier. But the fact is, when we are making films the audience wants to see, they show up."
This is what frightens many filmmakers and critics -- that the recent box-office rush shows that these are exactly the kinds of films that today's audience, in its heart of hearts, is looking for. 
"At times of stress and transition, we go to the cinema not to escape, but to be reassured," Professor Custen said. 
Television doesn't serve this function because it's not communal, and because of the myriad distractions of the home, whether a ringing phone or the newspaper on the coffee table. 
"At the movies, people are brought together for a specific, temporary purpose," Professor Custen said. "You sense that there is a sort of connection between you and the other people in the dark. And at the same time, you are declaring by the movies you choose to see, and the way you react to them, exactly where you stand, politically and within society. It's a ritual we engage in to declare what kind of Americans we are."
While it is true that movies almost always do well during economic downturns -- they are, after all, inexpensive compared with other forms of entertainment outside the home -- David Davis, a box-office analyist for Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, an investment banking firm, found a closer parallel to the current boom in the years immediately following Pearl Harbor.
"In 1940, movie attendance was at 3.1 billion," he said. "By 1943, it had risen to 4.3 billion, an increase of about 40 percent in just three years of war. And it wasn't caused by a drop in ticket prices, either. The average ticket cost 24 cents in 1940 and 29 cents in 1943. Box office revenues went from $735 million to $1.3 billion. It almost doubled in three years. Maybe it really is that simple: people like to escape during a crisis."
Still, this doesn't entirely explain why the pop-culture boom seems to be so movie-specific. Why aren't people watching more television or buying more escapist literature? 
PricewaterhouseCoopers' recently published "Global Entertainment and Media Outlook: 2002-2006" has dreary news for nearly all forms of popular entertainment. 
Consumer spending on recorded music was down 4.1 percent in 2001 and is predicted to fall another 1.1 percent this year. Ratings for the major broadcast networks were down 4.8 percent last year and are expected to fall another 5.3 percent this year. Even increased viewership on basic and pay cable channels has been insufficient to do more than keep overall television viewing essentially flat, only 0.8 percent over last year. 
The printed word was hit even harder. The overall United States magazine market fell 10.9 percent in 2001, with predictions for an additional 2.6 drop this year. Subscriptions were down 2.1 percent in 2001, and single copy sales down 8.6 percent.
And consumer book sales decreased 5.6 percent from 2000 to 2001. Only two categories showed growth, book clubs (up 0.7 percent) and religious books (up 2.4 percent). The accounting firm predicts a further drop of 0.7 percent in book sales this year. 
Gate revenues did rise more than 11.8 percent for major sporting events in 2001, but a closer examination shows this was largely attributable to escalating ticket prices. Actual attendance rose only 1 percent and was down for several sports.
The PricewaterhouseCoopers report predicts a 7-percent rise this year in rentals and sales of videos and DVD's, but it hasn't happened yet. Scott Hettrick, editor in chief of Video News, an industry trade publication, said that so far this year sales and rentals have actually been down about 2 percent. 
Yet at the movies, all seems rosy. 
Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a company that tracks the box office, estimates that revenues were up nearly 20 percent for the first 167 days of the year compared with the same period last year. Mr. Fithian of the theater owners' association said his members' figures showed an even larger rise, of about 23 percent. 
And even with an estimated 3.5 percent uptick in ticket prices -- to an average of $5.85 -- the number of tickets actually sold in America has risen somewhere between 15 and 16 percent.
Attendance at the nation's cinemas was a hair under 1.5 billion last year, so if the trend continues to year's end there should be about 240,000 additional tickets sold in 2002.
But many in the industry point to coming potential blockbusters -- movies like "Men in Black 2," "Austin Powers in Goldmember," "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "Die Another Day," the latest James Bond adventure -- to predict that attendance in 2002 may actually exceed 1.75 billion. 
Those attendance levels are still far lower than in the days before television, but they amount to a striking increase from the relatively flat levels of the last three decades. 
Last year's record box-office revenues of $8.4 billion -- up 8.4 percent over 2000 -- are almost certain to go over $9 billion this year, Mr. Dergarabedian and Mr. Fithian agree. And some starry-eyed souls in Hollywood are predicting they will exceed $10 billion.
"And we have done it this year without a 'Titanic,' a movie that really dominated the year's box office in 1998," Mr. Fithian said. "This year, the hits have been more spread around and they have appealed to all segments of the audience, from family movies to R-rated."
Steven Spielberg, who has his own new film, "Minority Report," hitting theaters this weekend, was asked if he had any idea why Americans were embracing movies to such an extent these days. 
He mentioned how movies have traditionally done well in hard times, then stopped, thought about it and shrugged. "I'm not really sure," he said.
Mr. Dergarabedian laughed when told about this exchange.
"Well, if Steven Spielberg doesn't know, I'm not even going to try to guess at it," he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on June 21 about a surge in movie box-office revenue this year misstated the trend in sales of videocassettes and DVD's in 2002. They have increased considerably, not decreased, though rentals, which are easier to track, have indeed declined about 2 percent. The article also misidentified a trade publication cited. It is Video Business, not Video News.

HEADLINE: City Hall Avoids Deep Cuts, But Full Bill May Come Later 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The budget accord this week between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council to close the city's $5 billion deficit has managed to stave off many of the most-feared cuts for now. But it relies on a battery of revenue sources that will not be available to help close the city's widening budget gaps over the next few years.
 The city is essentially postponing its day of reckoning with this budget, fiscal experts warned yesterday. 
 Even with the budget's cuts and new taxes and fees, the city's projected deficit for the next budget year is getting worse, not better: Bloomberg administration officials said yesterday that they believed the gap would be $3.7 billion, a billion dollars more than they had predicted just two months ago. The revision suggests that city officials are becoming less hopeful that a rebounding economy will flood the coffers and end the crisis. 
The mayor himself sounded less than sanguine about the city's prospects. "Next year looks like we're not going to have anywheres near as much money as we need," he said yesterday.
Not that the fiscal year beginning on July 1 will be pain-free: the budget has more than $1 billion in cuts that will shrink the Police Department through attrition, halt some ambulance shifts and suspend plastic and glass recycling. But many of the gloomiest, direst predictions of draconian service cuts did not come to pass, in large part because of creative moves that the city's budget drafters made to preserve services.
The danger, fiscal watchdogs warned, is that many of those moves are this-year-only infusions of cash that will help the city in the short term and then disappear. 
"Too much of the hard work still lies ahead," cautioned Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a budget monitoring organization.
The city is using a one-time infusion of $275 million in state aid to pay for a new, more expensive teachers' contract. Next year the expense will remain, but the state aid is unlikely to continue. The city is refinancing its debt, taking advantage of the low interest rates to borrow money to pay off its current high-interest loans. And, in one of its more baroque maneuvers, it is selling one of the giant water tunnels for $100 million to a private owner who will be allowed to count its depreciation as a tax write-off.
Some of these nonrecurring revenues, commonly known as one-shots, not only disappear in the future but actually wind up costing taxpayers more down the road.
Exhibit A in this category is one of the cornerstones of the budget: the $1.5 billion that the city is borrowing to help pay its operating expenses. Not only will this money be unavailable next year, but future taxpayers will find themselves paying those loans back, with interest, to cover the cost of services they got in the past.
Then there is the city's decision to take 10 years, instead of the current 5, to pay money it owes the municipal pension funds so that they will be able to pay higher benefits to city retirees. Although that will drive down the cost next year by $275 million, it will end up costing more money down the road; the city is, in effect, taking out a loan, at 8 percent interest, from its pension funds.
The city decided to borrow the money this year because it could; the State Legislature gave it permission to help pay for the costs associated with the World Trade Center attack, and city officials reasoned that as New York struggled to recover it made more sense to go into debt than to raise taxes or cut needed services. Mayor Bloomberg acknowledged that nobody was happy with the borrowing because "it is, to some extent, mortgaging our future." 
And it leaves the city with a hole in its budget next year. Ms. Fortuna, of the budget commission, said, "Borrowing buys you a year, but you're still left with a $4 billion gap."
Bloomberg administration officials, who put the gap at $3.7 billion, cited the new teachers' contract, which added $425 million, and lower projections of what the city can expect to receive in tax revenues as significant contributors to the growing deficit. 
Of course, those wait-till-next-year warnings are as common among budget pessimists as they once were among baseball optimists. But sometimes, as the Brooklyn Dodgers proved when they eventually won the World Series, they come to pass. 
Mr. Bloomberg said as much: "In the past, people have heard that rhetoric, but because the economy kept growing, we never in the end really had to cut anything. This time we really did cut well over a billion dollars in expenses, most of them recurring. Next year we're going to have to do something else." 
Yesterday, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, said he believed tax increases would be all but inevitable next year. "I think that there will have to be an array of ways to raise revenue," he said, explaining that he favors reinstating a tax on commuters who work in the city and live elsewhere as well as raising taxes on some absentee landlords. He added that the city would have to be open to increasing income and property taxes as well.
The Council had argued this year that the city should raise more taxes to close the gap and provide a recurring revenue stream. The mayor opposed more taxes, arguing that higher taxes were bad for the economy and unlikely to win the approval of Gov. George E. Pataki and state lawmakers in an election year.
Mayor Bloomberg said he did not know if the city would raise taxes next year. "I do see myself looking for new sources of revenue and new ways to spend less, and I've always said that you go into a situation considering everything, and then you make decisions," he said.
The city could conceivably run into trouble before next year. The budget still relies on $1.3 billion in savings and aid that require the consent of the State Legislature, the federal government and the city's unions. Bloomberg administration officials said yesterday that they had received commitments for $350 million of the $400 million they were seeking from Albany, for $200 million of the $400 million from Washington, and for $275 million of the $500 million in concessions they were seeking from the unions.
But sometimes things work out better than expected. The budget agreement this week was reached after the mayor agreed to restore $175 million in cuts that the Council opposed, averting many of the worst cuts, like the mayor's initial plan to close centers for the elderly. The city will pay for those restorations with a surplus that will be better than expected when the current fiscal year ends on June 30, officials said yesterday.
Bloomberg administration officials said that even though tax revenues were down, they expected a $677 million surplus, nearly twice what they had planned for. This led some city officials and municipal finance experts to question whether City Hall had been conservatively underestimating its revenues all along, as the Giuliani administration routinely did.

HEADLINE: Struggling Airlines 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Impossible Demands on America's Airlines" (Week in Review, June 16) leads to an inescapable conclusion: The American airline industry must undergo structural reforms to continue playing a vital role in our economy. To continue the low fares and ubiquitous service that customers demand, airline labor costs, which can reach 40 percent of operating expenses, must be realigned. 
 The major obstacle to this is the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which saddles labor and management with cumbersome dispute-resolution procedures that provide no practical mechanism for reducing labor costs. Even in the best of times, the act leads to acrimonious negotiations, including threatened strikes and strikes. 
For airlines to stop limping from crisis to crisis, and for the public to be well served, part of the solution must include reform of the arcane Railway Labor Act.

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
A Delayed Perception of the Rebellion in the Conservative 1950's

 BODY:
Morris Dickstein, distinguished professor of English at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, recently published "Leopards in the Temple: The Transformation of American Fiction, 1945-1970" (Harvard University Press, $15.95), in which he reassesses American postwar culture. Daphne Eviatar spoke with him.
 You write that beneath the conservative veneer of the 1950's was a strong undercurrent of rebellion. How does postwar fiction reflect that?' 
 Much of what we associate with the 1960's originated in the 50's, including new attitudes toward sex and the family and a new interest in ethnicity and diversity. Jewish and black writers, even a few openly gay writers, cut a path for the multicultural writers of the 80's and 90's. The margins of the culture were beginning to erode the conservative center. Elvis was influenced by black rhythm and blues, while writers like Norman Mailer and Jack Kerouac idealized black culture. Counterculture writers of the 50's were fascinated by jazz, which encouraged them to be more improvisational in their writing. Road novels like "On the Road" and "Invisible Man" not only created a loose-jointed plot but reflected a looser attitude toward morality and society. Even a book like J. D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye," which wasn't considered so innovative at the time, in retrospect became part of the youth revolution that led to the 60's.
Was the literature of the 50's in some sense enhanced by the politically conservative climate?
Some people do their best work under the most adverse conditions. Norman Mailer recently talked about the 50's as a steady drip on the brain. That irritation can create the pearl in the oyster. Some of the best work of writers, intellectuals and filmmakers of the time was in reaction to social conformity and the limited range of political debate. Films like "Rebel Without a Cause" reacted against the home and family ethos of the 1950's. In that respect, the oppressive atmosphere of the 50's did not make writers happy, but it was good for their work.
In your view, postwar writers abandoned overtly political and ideological themes after World War II to turn inward. What caused that?
The war revealed terrible things about human nature. Remember, it ended with the opening of the death camps and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Few writers dealt with those things directly because they couldn't really encompass them. But a window had been opened on the human heart that was shocking and horrifying; that led them inward. Another reason was growing prosperity. Abundance gave writers the luxury to be introspective.
Were the Beats merely an interesting cultural phenomenon, or were they great writers?
"On the Road" is a great book without being a really good novel. The little things that a novelist does well -- getting people in and out of rooms, dramatizing their actions and conversations -- Kerouac does not do very well. On the other hand, the book was an important breakthrough for the fluidity of its prose, which fits its theme of flight and movement, the values of openness and spontaneity. The best poetry of Allen Ginsberg holds up very well. Burroughs and Ginsberg also had a huge influence on non-Beats, particularly on writers like Norman Mailer or Robert Lowell, when they turned toward more open, confessional writing. When we think about the Beats we have to consider the subterranean impact of their work on other writers.
What about the influence of European writers?
The Existentialists -- Camus and Sartre especially -- had a strong influence on American writers of the 40's and 50's. Camus's "Stranger" was an important parable of alienation and psychic numbing. Much of the writing of the period reflected a sense that we had peered into the heart of darkness in the course of the war. The Existentialists presented man as perched over an abyss; we had to act in the face of absurdity, knowing the futility of our actions. Mailer is one of the few who called himself an Existentialist, but you see their ideas, along with Freud's, in all the writers. They moved away from absolute moral values and toward the sense of contingency, a feeling that life was unpredictable and we had to live fully.
What makes these writers uniquely American?
Despite everything, they retain an overall sense of possibility. Europeans grow up with a sense of limitation, a sense of being born into a certain class and milieu. The American tradition is different. People came to this country for the opportunity to drop their old lives, their names, the circumstances into which they were born and to remake themselves. Of course, some writers didn't feel that after the Holocaust -- a book like Saul Bellow's "Seize the Day," for example, shows that up as an illusion. But some more centrally American writers -- even a child of French Canadian immigrants, like Kerouac -- were exhilarated by the openness of the American horizon.
Weren't writers like James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison suggesting the opposite?
Although they had a strong sense of the limitations placed on black people in America, they reacted against any socially deterministic vision. "Invisible Man" is about how a young man experiences every trap laid for him, every limitation imposed, and manages to escape it, albeit at the cost of a certain cynicism. Both Baldwin and Ellison were reacting against Richard Wright's emphasis on racial victimization. In that respect, they offered a vision of greater openness in American society.
How do you imagine critics will characterize this period 50 years from now?
They'll probably look at the late 20th and early 21st century through a series of watersheds. Just as 1945 was a watershed, so was the Vietnam period, the beginnings of feminism, the economic crisis of 1973-74, the go-go stock market culture of the 80's and 90's. Obviously 9/11 was a watershed. After 9/11 somebody said, "Is it possible that we will look back to that trivial era between the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and 9/11 as some kind of golden age when we could afford to be so frivolous?" It may well be that the 90's were our 1950's, a period less political and more concerned with making money and massaging our psyches, a fairy tale of an expanding culture, when the larger problems that would arrive with Vietnam, or today, with new forms of terrorism, were not yet on our minds.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tries to Win Over Angry Indonesian Muslims 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: GUNUNG TEMBAK, Indonesia 

 BODY:
On the edge of the rich rain forests and gold mines here in the world's most populous Muslim country, students at an Islamic boarding school learn to abhor the United States.
 The anti-American creed is not spelled out in the brochure that beckons students to the Hidayatullah campus in Kalimantan, this mineral-studded province of Indonesia on the island of Borneo. But on the campus, where an imposing mosque with a silvery dome towers over scruffy school buildings, the antagonism toward America permeates every discussion. 
 "From very deep in my heart I think the United States is evil," said Muhammad Fadhil, a feisty 16-year-old, described by his teachers as one of the smartest students. "There are too many interventions by the United States around the world. It exaggerates its military force." 
The Hidayatullah, one of the more extreme of Indonesia's religious boarding schools, known as pesantrens, is the home base for a network of 120 branch schools throughout the country. Like the madrasas in Pakistan, pesantrens are led by charismatic leaders who strive to instill their version of Islamic values.
Now, as the United States scans the world for breeding grounds for Islamic extremists, some Asia experts in the Bush administration say they are worried about the changing face of religious schools in this nation of 220 million people. They express concern about a "lost generation" of young radicalized Indonesian Muslims. There is an urgent need for a soft sell by the United States, to win hearts and minds, to complement the tough administration strategy of throwing support to militaries, including the Indonesian Army, these experts contend.
To try and regain ground in the propaganda war, State Department officials say they have come up with a new strategy: inviting leaders of pesantrens to the United States for a show-and-tell two-week tour this summer, plus participation in a four-week course on religious tolerance at the Institute for Training and Development at Amherst, Mass.
The program is an effort to expose about 80 Islamic educators who might be suspicious of the United States to the American way of life. "We will concentrate on those who are receptive, who have not been to the United States and who have a degree of open-mindedness," an American official said.
But winning people over will not be easy. "The idea is to make other religions recognize Islam as it was in the Middle Ages," said Abdul Qadir Jakani, the chief operating officer of the school here. 
"More than 80 percent of Indonesians are Muslim but most of them only think of themselves as Islamic from their identity card. We want to change that."
The pesantrens have generally been simple places, devoid of much militancy. But at times in Indonesia's history, they have served as cells for mobilizing and indoctrinating young warriors. Today, feelings about America are running high.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the United States support for Israel, figures high in many students' statements. They believe, they said, that there is no tolerance between Muslims and Jews in the United States. In the United States, said Muhammad Sayyaf, 16, "The Muslims are hunted by the non-Muslims."
In their theology classes, the students are taught to defend Islam against the infidels, Jews and Christians, and to strive to convert the infidels to their way of thinking. But the students are also heavily influenced by a cheap and strident anti-American mass-circulation magazine, Sabili, which characterizes Osama bin Laden as a hero.
Television is banned at the school, and computer use is very limited. Some boys said they slipped out to an Internet cafe in the nearby village to look at the Web site of Laskar Jihad, the militant Indonesian Islamic group. The group was involved in the recent killing of Christians in the Molucca Islands. 
Muhammad Fadhil said he devoured issues of Sabili, his main source of current affairs. He learned from the magazine, he said, that George Soros is a Hungarian Jew who runs the American economy; that Bill Clinton was once governor of Arkansas and had an affair with Monica Lewinsky; and that 4,000 Jews who worked in the World Trade Center took a holiday on Sept. 11.
For all their invective, Mr. Fadhil and his classmates were friendly to an outsider and curious about the United States. When asked what they knew about the United States, Muhammad Arifin, 16, shot back: Britney Spears. Another said Clint Mathis, the American soccer star.
Then came the questions. "How come the United States supports Israel?" asked one. "What were people doing in so many floors of the World Trade Center?" asked another. And then: "Why is Milosevic a violator of human rights, but Ariel Sharon is not? Sharon killed a lot of people when he was head of the army."
Several boys said that, if approached, they would join Al Qaeda or Laskar Jihad. Others demurred, saying they did not like violence.
Like many pesantrens, Hidayatullah began as the dream of its founder, Abdullah Said. He believed that the money from the timber and oil companies was ruining both the environment and the moral values of young Muslims in Kalimantan. In the early 1970's, he borrowed a farmer's hut in this village 20 miles from Balikpapan, East Kalimantan's capital, and used it as a sanctuary for study and prayer. In 1976, he opened the school and mosque on a 100-acre site.
Since the founder's death two years ago, this pesantren, and its subsidiaries, have become more strident in its teachings. Its Web site and magazine have lashed out at Indonesia's moderate Muslim leaders. A cover of a recent issue read, "Israel at 54, the savage country."
The more aggressive stance, combined with the conservative interpretation of Islam, has prompted some moderate Muslims to ask whether the Hidayatullah schools receive funds from Saudi Arabia. Photographs of official visitors from Saudi Arabia, including a Saudi Arabian ambassador to Indonesia, are displayed on the school's notice board.
The school's administrators denied they received money from abroad. They survive, they said, on modest fees from parents, about $15 a month, and a modicum of support from the Indonesian government.
The rudimentary facilities suggest that the finances, at least, are limited. The girls and boys are kept separate. The boys sleep in small rooms. One long wooden bench covered with linoleum -- no mattress -- accommodates 10 boys.
The girls wear long veils, though most do not cover their faces. They sleep on hard wood too, though they have individual bunk beds in pleasant light-filled dormitories. (In contrast to the prudish behavior codes, however, a teacher asked a visitor to give an impromptu talk to her English class on AIDS and its causes.)
The school takes seriously what it sees as its obligation to propagate Islam. Graduates are encouraged to marry one another, and to participate in mass weddings. They are then instructed to go out and establish new schools.
In the last several months, Indonesia's Muslim politicians have begun to ramp up their appeal to voters on a religious basis, and the pesantrens are part of the political circuit. The vice president of Indonesia, Hamza Haz, who leads the biggest Muslim-based political party, visited Hidayatullah last month.
Mr. Hamza, who has gone out of his way to support the militant Laskar Jihad, left behind a $2,000 check earmarked for the expansion of the mosque, school officials said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Banks' Earnings Are Up 18.6% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
The nation's banks have taken advantage of low interest rates and stronger cost controls to increase earnings 18.6 percent in the last year as corporate profits have fallen, federal regulators said today. 
 Net income, or the difference between revenue and loan losses and other expenses, for national banks increased by $2.1 billion, or 18 percent, from the first quarter of last year through the first three months of this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a report on the condition of the banking industry. 
 The margin between what banks earn on interest and borrowing costs has increased $5.4 billion, or 18 percent in the last year, the office said. 
The overnight bank lending rate, the cost for banks to borrow money from the Federal Reserve, stands at 1.75 percent, a 40-year low, according to the Comptroller of the Currency. 
"They're making a lot of money on spreads," said Nancy Wentzler, the office's deputy comptroller of global banking and financial analysis. 
"Large banks have managed this environment very successfully," Ms. Wentzler said during a briefing on the condition of the banking industry. 
The amount that banks have earned from fees and from other noninterest sources has increased by $1.2 billion, or 4.9 percent during the corresponding period, the agency said.

HEADLINE: Messages From Perot Systems Show It Approached Edison 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, June 21 

 BODY:
Internal e-mail messages among employees at the Perot Systems Corporation show that the company approached Edison International with an offer to advise the energy company on how to manipulate California's market, either to make money or so Edison could be "alert to others trying to pick their pockets." 
 The messages were among five boxes of documents Perot Systems delivered to the Senate committee investigating the software company's role in advising companies accused of gouging electricity customers. In the May 1997 exchange of e-mail messages, Perot employees discuss partnering with a consultant, George Backus, to advise Edison on how to take advantage of "holes" in California's emerging energy market. 
 An Edison spokesman, Gil Alexander, said the utility did not hire Mr. Backus or Perot Systems because it had an incentive to keep wholesale prices lower, because it was selling power under a retail rate cap. 
H. Ross Perot, a former presidential candidate and chairman of Perot Systems, plans to testify July 11 at the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. 
The California attorney general subpoenaed the documents, which were also delivered to the committee. 
Perot Systems said it would also provide the material to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the company posted the documents on its Web site. 
Mr. Backus said Thursday that he had not been asked to testify before the California Legislature yet, but was asked by the committee to retain any documents pertaining to Perot Systems and California. 
He declined further comment and referred calls to his lawyer, Tim Beyer, who said he had not yet reviewed the documents and could not comment. 
An economist hired by Perot Systems blamed lawmakers and regulators for California's troubles. The economist, Steven Stoft, author of a book on designing electricity markets, said the rules for California's market were flawed.

HEADLINE: Sacrifice Is for Losers 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last weekend marked the media's self-congratulatory 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, and it would have spoiled the mood to suggest that all the energy expended on searching for ol' Deep Throat might be better spent trying to crack the Watergate under way right now. 
 This time the cancer is not on the presidency but on the economy, where the malignancy is a flood of corporate transgressions whose scope and scale, in the words of The Wall Street Journal this week, "exceed anything the U.S. has witnessed since the years preceding the Great Depression." As the first Watergate undermined Americans' faith in government for generations, so the replay threatens to do the same to American business. Or already is, if you regard the Dow Jones and Nasdaq averages, now flirting with their post-Sept. 11 lows, as metabolic measures of public trust in Wall Street. 
 It's a sign of the cultural sea change that Martha Stewart's ImClone stock trades threatened to knock John Gotti's funeral off the front page of New York's tabloids. The New York Post columnist Steve Dunleavy praised the Mafia don to his readers by saying that at least the mob didn't come near "your wallets," as "the Enron sissies did." 
The new Watergate, much like its prototype in the summer of '72, is still early in its timeline -- even though some in Washington, following the old script, reassure us that the story is almost over, that the public doesn't care about it, that the miscreants are all being punished and that reform is on the way. The five bungling burglars arrested on June 17 at the Watergate 30 years ago (can you name one?) are now all but forgotten by history, so minor was their role in the criminal conspiracy uncovered at the Nixon White House over the ensuing two years. The first culprit to be convicted in the new Watergate -- Andersen, on June 15 -- may also prove a passing footnote to the big picture. 
The Justice Department is touting its victory over Andersen as a strike at Enron, much as it hyped the arrest of the bomb-less "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla as a major setback for Al Qaeda. "It's like focusing on the guy who drove the getaway car," says Thomas Cullen, the head of general litigation at the international law firm Jones, Day. Now that Andersen has received a death sentence, its thousands of innocent employees included, it has lost any institutional incentive to help the government build its tardy case against the big enchiladas at Enron itself. 
Should most of "the Enron sissies" end up in Aspen rather than jail, will many Americans be shocked? Probably not. As the cancer of Watergate fed long-term cynicism about government spawned by the Johnson administration's conduct of the Vietnam War, so each new corporate scandal confirms the cynical but settled view that big business is conducted with two sets of mostly legal rules, one for inside investors who get in early and get out before the deluge, and another for the rest of us. Only the names of the insiders change from story to story in Watergate II -- though some characters now recur as frequently as the ubiquitous E. Howard Hunt popped up in successive revelations about Watergate I. 
Dr. John Mendelsohn, who served on the board of ImClone even as it botched the F.D.A. approval process for the cancer drug he developed, is the same John Mendelsohn who also sat on the audit board of Enron when it approved the corners-cutting partnerships that enriched a few insiders at the price of wiping out the company's plebeian stockholders. (Don't worry about the good doctor, though: he cashed out with $6 million from ImClone, and the Houston hospital he runs, the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, raked in $600,000 in Enron bucks.)
Peter Bacanovic, the suspended Merrill Lynch stockbroker and full-time balletomane who helped Martha Stewart dump her ImClone stock at a propitious moment, also helped guide another client to one of those lucrative off-the-books Enron partnerships blessed by Dr. Mendelsohn, according to The Times.
And then there's Dick Cheney, who has achieved a trifecta through his official dealings with Enron, his stewardship of Halliburton during alleged accounting irregularities and his on-camera appearance in a 1997 Andersen promotional video touting the firm's "good advice." (It's too late to find a Rosemary Woods who might erase it.)
To many this panorama of corporate self-dealing recalls the 1980's Wall Street scandals. Indeed, it's practically an old-home week for the Bush administration's bizarre choice to police Wall Street -- its S.E.C. chief, Harvey Pitt, who was not only a lawyer for Andersen in the 1990's, but also defended Ivan Boesky in the 1980's. Yet what makes the new scandals more noxious than the old is the hypocrisy of its players. 
Gordon Gekko, the symbolic apotheosis of 80's Wall Street corruption, was candid about his motive: "Greed is good." Today's Gekkos cloak their greed in pieties or pious causes, like finding a cure for cancer. Samuel Waksal, the former ImClone chief executive now indicted for insider trading, is also the chairman of the beneficent New York Council for the Humanities (which, under his leadership, honored the literary icon Martha Stewart in 1999). John Rigas, the founder of Adelphia, a cable TV company gutted by his family's alleged plundering of corporate funds, was famous in the entertainment industry for banning adult movies that conflicted with his family values.
Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic chairman, calls Enron "a metaphor for the Bush administration" after making some $18 million on a $100,000 insider's stake in the now-bankrupt Global Crossing. Dennis Kozlowski, the indicted Tyco C.E.O., actually gave a commencement speech last month instructing the graduates at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire to "do the right thing, not the easy thing" when "confronted with questions . . . that test your morals." Let's not even revisit Linda Lay's flaunting of her family's association with Houston's Holocaust museum during her infamous "Today" show appearance. 
What also distinguishes our current corporate scandals from those of the 1980's is the backdrop. After Sept. 11, greed on this scale starts to look as obscene as wartime profiteering. Take the case of Mr. Kozlowski, who made $300 million over the last three years, will net a disproportionately large tax break from the Bush tax cut and is alleged to have ripped off still another $1 million in sales taxes. Under his guidance, Tyco, which is based in New Hampshire, connived a tax break of its own, to the tune of $450 million a year, by incorporating itself, quite legally, as a mail drop in Bermuda. If you believe the president's declaration that an effective new department of homeland security will cost no additional taxpayers' dollars, then don't worry. But if you think that a big bill for the war may come due some day, guess who will have to pick up that $450 million per annum that Tyco might have contributed as its fair share. 
Given this sleazy climate, what is the Bush administration doing to repair broken public confidence? It is trying to slow down a bipartisan Congressional effort to plug the Bermuda loophole and it is promoting Mr. Pitt's efforts to keep his old accounting-firm clients in the loop of "enforcement" at the S.E.C. Otherwise, the administration seems less intent on policing corporate leaders like Mr. Kozlowski than in rewarding them with still more tax breaks.
Of course that's not what the president says. Last week, in an Ohio State commencement address that an aide said was inspired by writers ranging from Aristotle to the pope, Mr. Bush called on students to enlist in our "new ethic of responsibility" by eschewing "a culture of selfishness" to embrace "some cause larger than his or her own profit." As examples of such selflessness, he invoked New York's firefighters of Sept. 11.
But the day before that speech, the brain trust of his administration, Mr. Cheney and Karl Rove, both turned up at a Washington conference of business leaders to deliver the administration's true message, one backed up by policy rather than homilies. "This is a war," Mr. Rove said, "and we need to make an ongoing commitment to winning the effort to repeal the death tax."
Far from asking the nation's discredited corporate leaders to do their bit in our war on terrorism, the administration wants to fight another war to enable the Kozlowskis and Lays to sacrifice even less than they already are. As for those firefighters who did make a sacrifice by embracing "some cause larger than his or her own profit" on Sept. 11, their families are no more likely to reap serious dough from a repeal of the "death tax" than they are to be protected from losing their pensions in a future Enron by Mr. Pitt's "reforms." Let 'em eat Aristotle.

HEADLINE: Charges Against Forest Worker Surprise Hometown 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: DUNLAP, Calif., June 21 

 BODY:
For more than 150 years, people raised within sight of the giant sequoias that tower over the eastern horizon here have looked to the forest for their livelihood. Beyond pursuits like logging and catering to tourists, many sought work in taming the wildfires that any woodland must endure.
 With their lives dedicated to preserving the trees, they are all the more astounded that one of their own, Terry Lynn Barton, 38, who grew up here and who went into forestry when she was 20, has been charged with sparking the largest forest fire in Colorado's history. 
 The notion that a local woman could be an arsonist runs counter to every principle of logic, and has reverberated through people's conversations here in Dunlap, an unincorporated town with no center and all the signs of a withered economy. 
"Most of the families that live here are connected with forestry in some regard," said Connie Work, 49, a longtime friend who employed Ms. Barton for several years as a baby sitter for her five children. "If you love it, you want to protect it."
Ms. Barton, a mother of two teenage girls whose job with the United States Forest Service included fire prevention, has admitted causing the Hayman Fire, which has grown to more than 136,000 acres since it began on June 8 in the Pike National Forest south of Denver.
The people of Dunlap, in the foothills between the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada, 30 miles east of Fresno, are unaccustomed to the kind of attention the Barton case has brought. With about 6,000 people spread over a wide, hilly area that includes Dunlap, Miramonte, Pinehurst and Squaw Valley, the region is notable for what it lacks, like shopping malls, commercial strips and other signs of urban sprawl.
Dunlap's landmarks are a Baptist church, a community center, a post office and a middle school with a softball field. A sign in the grass across the road promises that a high school will be built, but people are not sure when.
Aside from the San Joaquin Valley's fruit farms and ranches, much of the area's focus is on the looming woodlands, divided into the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, the Giant Sequoia National Monument and the Sequoia National Forest. A sign on Dunlap Road, put up by local fire officials, offers a $10,000 reward for "arson information." Another sign, on Highway 180 as it leads into town from the west, says, "Californians Can't Afford Wildfires."
Saving the forests is a serious mission, and kids here grow up with it as a guiding principle. "That's about all there is up here -- forestry," said Janette Regedal, the daughter of a forest service worker, who returned to live in Dunlap six years ago after she tried living in other towns in the San Joaquin Valley. "You get a feel for it here and you can't stay away."
Ms. Regedal spoke as she waited tables at the only restaurant in Dunlap, Clingan's Junction. On its walls, photographs taken here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries show stagecoaches and gold miners, loggers and their ox teams pulling trees out of the woods to make houses and build cities.
Ms. Barton, who moved to Colorado five years ago with her husband and two daughters and continued working for the forest service, told arson investigators that she started the fire by accident while ridding herself of a letter from her estranged husband, John. In a four-count indictment, she has been charged with setting the blaze deliberately.
People here do not believe that. Her friends and relatives acknowledged that she may have been careless, but they refused to accept any suggestion of malice. 
"There's no way she would have done it on purpose," said Ms. Barton's mother, Wanda Haddock. "She loves that job."
As a young girl, Ms. Barton, who has two siblings, Carla and Bill Jr., watched relatives, friends and neighbors go into forest work. "Even as a teenager that was always her interest," said Ms. Work, who recalls hiring 12-year-old Terry as a baby sitter and general helper at a campground she owned, Dunlap Valley Lakes.
"She would work in any capacity -- cleaning the showers, the laundromat," Ms. Work said. The business evolved into a hand-glider operation, attracting fliers from all over the country.
"It definitely broadened her horizons," said Ms. Work, whose father was a logger. "But even with her horizons broadened, the choices here were still limited pretty much to forestry."
Until her arrest on Sunday, Ms. Barton was a forestry technician, a job that entails patrolling for, among other things, illegal campfires. It is paradoxical, people here say, that someone entrusted with fire prevention had sparked a huge conflagration.
"I'd compare it to a plumber with screwed-up plumbing or a mechanic whose car doesn't run," said Tammy Ahumada, a volunteer firefighter with the Mountain Valley Fire Department here, which covers 200 square miles west of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national forests.
Helen Clingan, the doyenne of the area's long-established families and the author of a book on its history, lamented the situation.
"She has to have been very disturbed by the letter to have done something like that, because she would have been trained not to," Mrs. Clingan said.
Les Chappel, owner of the L & L Mountain Feed and Hay store, said he has known Ms. Barton for more years than he remembers.
"She's not one to draw attention to herself -- never has been," he said. "She was just in a lousy marriage to John. That's why they moved to Colorado, so they could start again."

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Weaving Nile's Daily Life Into Dream of Change

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
THE phone rang late one evening and Attiyat al-Abnoudi picked it up to find a journalist from a leftist Egyptian newspaper on the line, asking her what she thought of boycotting products from America because of its support for Israel. 
 Ms. Abnoudi demurred. The reporter pressed and within minutes, Ms. Abnoudi was shouting. "What? I'm supposed to throw away the Avid machines that I use to edit my documentaries?" she bellowed. "The boycott is backwards, backwards, I tell you." 
 She hung up steaming. Like any Arab, she wants an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, but she has no patience for tired old formulas. "They think of me as an old revolutionary who will automatically start shouting in support of the boycott," she railed. "We were talking about a boycott because of Vietnam back in the 60's. Are we supposed to go back to all that?"
The spirit of the 1960's inspired and still informs her work as a pioneer female documentary filmmaker, a career marked by 25 films that underscore Egypt's gritty social reality, particularly for its poorest. 
It is a focus that awes her supporters and inflames her critics, bringing acclaim abroad but, closer to home, charges of trading on the poverty of her country. Although she has been interviewed often on state-run television, the network never shows her films. There is no official ban; it is more that, as she told the Egyptian paper Al Ahram on winning a national award in 1998, "everybody wants you to entertain them all the time."
Ms. Abnoudi's films, shown most often internationally at festivals, have won more than 30 prizes, many in Europe. 
"We know about Egypt from 7,000 years ago by the documents they left behind," she said. "If you see my films years from now, you will know about the Egyptian people, how they look, how they dress, how they eat, how they joke, what they are like when they are sad." 
But Egyptian critics are stung by that immediacy -- the poverty and misery unflinchingly captured. "There is no need to show reality in such an ugly way," said Hosn Shah, of the newspaper Al Akbar. "I am not against showing poor people, but the films should be more sympathetic, not all those flies and the filthy little kid with a snotty nose who is naked, barefoot and lacking underpants. Don't show me people who live like animals." 
To Ms. Abnoudi's mind, such images have a purpose. She described it almost wistfully: "We had a dream that we could change our society. We thought we could change the world by showing people how they live, that showing them would inspire them to make a revolution. Instead they hated us because they didn't want to see their reality." 
She went on, "Of course I still dream about changing the world, I am still young inside, but wiser." 
MS. ABNOUDI was born in 1942, the sixth of seven children in a family of once prosperous spice and textile merchants in a Nile village. Traditionally, the eldest daughter stayed home to help until she married and the task fell to the next daughter. "But by the time the sister right above me married, I was already in university, so they couldn't stop me," Ms. Abnoudi chortled. 
She was of the generation that benefited from Gamal Abdel Nasser's granting virtually free education to all. She keeps a framed picture of Nasser but remains ambivalent about the man whose revolution shaped modern Egypt. "He opened all kinds of dreams for us," she said. "But he made all the decisions for us, he didn't want to share. We would switch on the radio in the morning and suddenly discover we were a Socialist country."
While studying law at Cairo University, she was drawn to free movies at European cultural centers around the capital. That led her, in 1968, to enroll in the first class of postgraduates accepted to Egypt's new Film Institute. Lecturers, often drawn from abroad, emphasized film as social dialogue.
Ms. Abnoudi made two short films as a student. The first, in 1971, "A Horse of Mud," focused on illiterate women earning a pittance shaping bricks from Nile mud. Shot in grainy black-and-white on 16-millimeter film, it won many prizes, assuring her a spot in an English film school and lifelong financing.
Her second film, in 1972, was her graduation thesis, "The Sad Song of Toha," which showed snippets of the lives of a troupe of bedraggled Cairo street performers. The only words were a poem by Abdel Rahman al-Abnoudi, who became her second husband after a courtship of 15 days. (She was divorced from her first, a painter, at 21.) 
Mr. Abnoudi, who became famous for reviving the folklore and music of Upper Egypt, was once jailed for six months for his open Communist sympathies.
The couple adopted their only child, the 4-year-old daughter of a friend, after the girl's father died in an accident. They divorced 13 years ago, after 20 years. Ms. Abnoudi now lives with her daughter, an actress, in an apartment in a newer Cairo suburb. They share it with seven cats.
Her early work helping her husband travel from village to village collecting myths and music found its way into her films. Local musicians often provide the soundtrack, including that of her latest film, completed this month, called "The Nubian Train."
It is the story of a special 15-car second-class train that departs from Alexandria every year, carrying Nubians back to their villages for the biggest Islamic holiday. She almost had to abandon the project. The train departed last February, a day after a disaster on another train in which hundreds of passengers were incinerated. 
The fire was started by a gas stove, and the police were taking no more chances. They confiscated lights and generators. But she decided to shoot anyway, frantically calling rental companies to deliver battery-powered lights when the train stopped in Cairo. 
The movie shows images of the passing countryside and the Nile. The Nubian songs are bluesy. The first, which plays as the train leaves Alexandria, captures the edge of melancholy on any long voyage. 
MS. ABNOUDI dresses like many of the peasants whose lives she portrays. She favors the reddish henna they use to color their hair. Her frocks, decorated with beading and embroidery, are made by a village woman who lives near the Pyramids.
Outside film, Ms. Abnoudi does not fear taking on difficult causes. She devotes much of her time to a nascent organization that seeks to get more Egyptians involved in solving the country's myriad ills. 
"I am a good citizen," she said, then added with a smile, "I wear my seat belt."

HEADLINE: One More Rally, Late in the Game, to Win Over Critics of a Newark Arena 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 21 

 BODY:
After failing this week, in the waning days of the legislative session, to advance a measure to build a sports arena here, the owners of the New Jersey Nets and Devils are planning one final push this weekend: an advertising blitz aimed at the districts of key Republican lawmakers who are opposed to the plan or on the fence.
 The advertising campaign will test yet another of the seeming nine lives of the arena proposal, a five-year-old notion that has been unsuccessfully pressed by the administrations of three governors. 
 The newspaper advertisements will feature a long list of supporters of the proposed $355 million arena from corporate, political and civic circles, detail some of its economic benefits, and describe it as a necessity to keep the two sports franchises in the state.
The advertisements will also highlight the financial reasons the arena must open by 2005, and why legislative action is required by June 30 in order to meet that deadline. They will stress that the project will be financed by sales and income tax revenues generated by the arena and not directly by state taxpayers. 
James McQueeny, a spokesman for Newark Sports and Entertainment, the subsidiary of the YankeeNets that owns the two New Jersey teams, said the advertisements would bring together facts that had often been lost in news coverage of "the supercharged politics" surrounding the plan. 
The proposal, which would move the teams from the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands, has split Democrats and Republicans, North and South Jersey, as well as suburban and urban interests.
The advertisements will cap a flurry of activity over the last three days by the YankeeNets, Gov. James E. McGreevey and two former Republican governors to persuade lawmakers to tack the Newark arena proposal and a hockey arena in Pennsauken, in South Jersey, onto a bill authorizing a Harrison soccer arena. The bill has already passed the Assembly. Under Senate rules, the amendment requires the approval of both the Democratic and Republican leaders of the evenly split house, but John O. Bennett, the Republican leader in the Senate, refused to give his approval. The goal now, supporters said, is to build backing in key areas to prompt Republican lawmakers to pressure him to relent.
A spokesman for Mr. Bennett said the senator would not comment.
The 18,500-seat arena would be financed by a $120 million investment by the YankeeNets; $165 million in bonds issued by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority that would be repaid from sales and income taxes generated by the arena and adjacent development; $50 million in Essex County and Newark money; and a $20 million loan from the YankeeNets and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
The sense of urgency is coming from the YankeeNets about a month after it seemed to accept the governor's looser timetable. That timetable called for the governor to begin planning for a replacement development in the Meadowlands -- which might build support for the Newark plan among Bergen County's residents -- before approaching lawmakers in September or October to authorize the Newark proposal.
But when the YankeeNets fretted recently that this would prevent it from opening the arena by 2005, Mr. McGreevey pressed quietly for immediate legislative action. 
One immediate result was cries from Bergen County lawmakers, who said that the governor was attempting an end run around them. Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Bergen Democrat, said that he was reneging on his promise to address their concerns about the future of the Meadowlands first.
The governor's effort was also ridiculed by a group of Republican senators who said in a statement that it was "ludicrous" to press for three arenas when aid was being cut to schools and towns.
Paul Aronsohn, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, did not respond to the accusations. But he said that the governor was determined to move forward on the Newark arena, the Meadowlands redevelopment and the Pennsauken and Harrison arenas. 
Supporters of the Newark arena, like the Rev. Reginald Jackson, head of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, said Mr. Bennett and other Republicans were exploiting the divergent interests arrayed around the arena issue to advance the party. Mr. Jackson and others also said that conservative Republicans were using the project to embarrass and intimidate moderates who might support it.
Bret D. Schundler, the former Jersey City mayor and a conservative who ran unsuccessfully for governor against Mr. McGreevey last fall, has indeed been a vocal opponent of the arena plan, insisting that it would involve state money and should go to voters in a statewide referendum.

HEADLINE: Jousting Over Drug Coverage 

 BODY:
Voters coming out of the last presidential election had good reason to believe that no matter who won, there would be federal prescription drug coverage for older Americans in the near future. Now, both the Senate and the House appear to be moving toward votes on a Medicare drug plan. The two proposals are very different, and we feel the Senate version is by far the better version. 
 There is no doubt that a drug benefit is needed. Prescription drug costs are rising faster than hospital or doctor bills. Yet a third of the elderly have no drug coverage at all, and many of the rest are poorly covered. But many Democrats and Republicans seem less interested in compromise than in a campaign issue this fall, and both versions could easily die in a Congressional stalemate. 
 The differences between the two bills relate to cost and philosophical approach. The Senate Democrats' plan comes with a price tag of more than $425 billion over seven years, roughly twice as much as the Republican House version. That is causing sticker shock among senators concerned about budget deficits and the financial difficulties of Medicare. The Senate Democrats would also have the Medicare program itself cover prescription drugs for any elderly people who want it.
House Republicans, who regard traditional Medicare as antiquated, would provide money to private insurance companies -- a big source of G.O.P. campaign donations -- to offer prescription drug policies. The idea of relying on private companies seems more ideological than practical. The pool of elderly Americans who will want the insurance is likely to consist of those who have the most need for expensive medicine. Even with federal subsidies, it's unclear that enough insurance companies would be willing to participate and provide the economies that come from competition. 
The Senate Democrats' plan is clearly more generous to beneficiaries, particularly those who buy generic drugs. There would be no deductible, and out-of-pocket expenditures would be capped at $4,000 per year. Under the House Republican guidelines, which could be modified by private insurers, the elderly would pay 20 percent to 50 percent of the first $2,000 in prescription bills. Above that, they would have to pay the full cost themselves until they had reached a cap of $3,700 or $3,800. Both plans would subsidize the elderly who have low incomes.
The House Republicans are expected to pass their bill next week, while the Senate Democratic leadership is going to have trouble overcoming all the chamber's procedural obstacles. Opponents will rail about the cost and budget deficits. That would be much less of a problem if Congress canceled some of the future tax breaks it has scheduled. This page has pointed out repeatedly that if the public were given a choice between a good prescription drug plan for the elderly and less taxes for the country's richest citizens, there's little doubt which they would choose. But the upcoming debate is time for another reminder.

HEADLINE: Filing Raises Concerns About Merck Unit 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
As Merck & Company prepares the initial public offering of its unit that manages pharmacy benefits next week, a regulatory filing has raised concerns about the subsidiary's future profitability.
 Although by some counts the unit, Medco Health Solutions, is the nation's largest drug plan manager, it said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that its gross operating profits had been slim and were becoming slimmer. 
 The filings, which were amended last week and spiced with new information, presumably at the S.E.C.'s request, also show that Medco's profits have been heavily dependent on rebates on products made by Merck and other drug manufacturers. The rebates are tied to assuring market share for those products. 
Medco, formerly called Merck-Medco Managed Care, has been accused in lawsuits of unduly favoring expensive Merck drugs like Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering treatment, over similar products, like Lipitor from Pfizer, that the plaintiffs say are more cost-effective.
Medco and its main competitors, AdvancePCS, Express Scripts and Caremark, use the buying power of millions of drug plan cardholders to extract discounts and rebates from drug manufacturers. They arrange lower prices to promote prescriptions of favored drugs, including lower-cost generics, and they collect small transaction fees for processing hundreds of millions of payments 
Medco has pledged to push Merck drugs for the next five years, a move that Wall Street analysts said could be risky. If sales of Merck drugs falter, they said, the rebates would shrink, sharply cutting Medco's profits. "Some customers might object," said Andrew Speller, a health care analyst at A. G. Edwards.
Contracts with some of Medco's biggest customers are up for renewal, including those of the Defense Department and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which this week approved a staff recommendation to switch to Caremark from Medco. However, General Motors and Verizon recently decided to renew with Medco.
The initial public offering is expected late next week at a price that would value Medco at $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Merck bought Medco in 1993 for $6.6 billion, or about $8.2 billion, adjusted for inflation.
The price, about $22 to $24 a share, is roughly half the early estimates of $12 billion by most Wall Street analysts when Merck first announced the divestiture plan in January. Medco said it hoped to sell about 20 percent of the company now. Merck would like to spin off the rest to shareholders within 12 months.
Lawrence Marsh, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the lower valuation reflected a dip in Medco's first-quarter operating profits, and a slide in the stocks of other drug plan managers "based mainly on concerns about government investigations and various subpoenas."
Last month, Express Scripts, Caremark and the drug plan units of Cigna and WellPoint Health Networks said they received subpoenas in connection with a Justice Department investigation of drug marketing. They all said they were not the targets of the investigation.
Medco said it had been notified in 1999 that it was being looked at in another Justice Department inquiry. The company has also reported an investigation of its business by the State of Tennessee.
It said in the S.E.C. filing that its operating margins had declined to 3.2 percent in the first quarter, down from 4 percent the year before. A contributing factor, Mr. Marsh said, is that health plans and employers are demanding more and more of the rebate money that drug plan managers receive from manufacturers.
"As these rebates are more closely scrutinized, the economics of this sector could be devastated," said Larry Feinberg, a partner at Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund that has sold shares of some of the drug plan companies' stock short. "The rebates are going to go away, and it becomes a less profitable, even a nonprofitable industry," he said.
Under a new contract with West Virginia and several other states, Express Scripts will have to surrender any rebates to those customers.
Merck, which has been struggling with weakening earnings after patents have expired and costs have risen, brushed aside a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that raised concerns about Medco's practice of booking patients' co-payments on drugs as revenue.
"Neither our external auditors nor the S.E.C. has ever raised an issue with our accounting," said Greg Reeves, the spokesman. He added that the revenue had "no impact on our net incomes or earnings per share." But investors drove down Merck shares by $2.22, or 4 percent, yesterday, to $49.98, a four-year low. 
Mr. Feinberg also dismissed the co-payments issue as "a nonevent" because it does not affect earnings.
As for Merck, securities analysts said its profit picture would brighten enormously once Medco's low-margin business was gone. Mr. Marsh of Lehman said, "There will be a collective cheer from Merck analysts and investors when this is finalized."

HEADLINE: Russian House Supports Bill On Farm Sales 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 21 

 BODY:
Russia's lower house of Parliament today approved a bill to create a legal system for the purchase and sale of farmland for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. But the measure, which requires one more vote before it goes to the upper house, passed only after the government agreed to a late amendment prohibiting foreigners to own agricultural property. 
 Earlier this week, President Vladimir V. Putin played down fears that foreign companies would buy up Russian land. But his legislative allies agreed to the ban on foreign ownership on the eve of today's votes in what appeared to be an effort to mollify fears. 
 Parliament voted overwhelmingly for the ban on foreign ownership. The vote establishing a framework for buying and selling farmland was far closer, however. 
As protesters opposed to any sale of Russia's farms rallied outside Parliament, the debate inside underscored the depth of passions that still exist over Russia's slow move to a market economy, especially when it comes to its farmlands. 
The Communist leader, Gennady A. Zyuganov, called the legislation "a shameful spectacle" and warned that it would ignite civil conflict. 
On the other hand, the deputy chief of the liberal Yabloko Party, Sergei V. Ivanenko, contended that the ban on foreign ownership would worsen the investment climate and show the world that Russia was still not ready to embrace economic reforms. 
The majority of Russia's farmlands remain under the control of collective farms, whose members now own shares in the enterprise. Many shareholders lease their part of the collective back to the collective itself or to private farmers or corporations.
Michael Whitty, chief operations officer of an American company that is building a dairy farm on leased land north of Moscow, said the prohibition on foreigners could stifle investment and complicate efforts to raise capital for Russian enterprises. "If they want to establish enterprises here in Russia, with Russian partners, then it wouldn't be such big deal," he said. "If they want to establish their own freestanding property and ship the profits elsewhere, then it could have a very big effect."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Another Tumble Gives Stocks Their Fifth Week of Losses

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks skidded for a third consecutive day yesterday as investors grew increasingly gloomy about the possibility of more terrorist attacks, slowing economic growth and corporate accounting scandals.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.7 percent, closing below 1,000 for the first time since Sept. 21, when markets bottomed out after the Sept. 11 attacks. The index now stands just 3 percent above its September low. Other indexes, including the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index, also dropped sharply. 
 The decline capped another losing week on Wall Street. The S.& P. 500 has dropped five weeks in a row, eight weeks out of nine, and 14 weeks out of 16. Since mid-March, it has given up about 15 percent of its value. This week, stocks gained strongly on Monday, but the rally rapidly lost steam.
Investors have become negative, and the S.& P. 500 will probably fall to its September low before it has any hope of recovering, said Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
"I haven't met a bull in five months," said Mr. Levkovich, who remains bullish and said he thought investors' concerns about higher inflation and economic weakness were overblown. "We have this downward momentum that is overwhelming any kind of rational behavior."
With questions about accounting practices hanging over many big companies, including Computer Associates, Tyco International and General Electric, investors are no longer willing to accept optimistic forecasts from managers or Wall Street analysts at face value, Mr. Levkovich said. Instead, they want to see rising profits and cash flow before they buy.
"Given the sense of corporate rot out there, managements not working for shareholders, there's such a sense of 'show me,' " Mr. Levkovich said.
At a news conference yesterday, President Bush acknowledged that concerns about management honesty were weighing on the stock market. "The business world must clean up its act," Mr. Bush said. "People have got to have confidence as to whether or not the assets and liabilities are good numbers. They've got to have confidence that the leadership has got the shareholder and employee in mind when they make decisions."
The Bush administration has not taken a public position on legislation in the Senate that would toughen the oversight of accountants.
Losses yesterday were broad and deep. The S.& P. 500 fell 17.15 points, to 989.14. The Dow Jones industrial average skidded 177.98 points, or 1.9 percent, to 9,253.79, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 23.79 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,440.96.
Frank Holmes, the chief investment officer of U.S. Global Funds, which manages $1.3 billion, said he thought stocks would continue to fall. Even though the S.& P. 500 has lost a third of its value in the last two years, and the shares of many technology companies have fallen 80 percent or more, most stocks are still expensive, he said.
Companies continue to cut back on capital spending, and corporate investment in information technology remains dismal, Mr. Holmes said. Yet the average Nasdaq stock is still trading at 80 times earnings, far higher than the historical norm, he said.
Mr. Holmes said he was looking for companies that would benefit from a falling dollar. With the federal budget now in deficit and short-term Treasury bills paying less than the inflation rate, the dollar will probably decline, he said. If that happens, American consumer companies, like McDonald's, could benefit, he said.
Morton Cohen, general partner of Clarion Partners, which manages $180 million, said he thought many small technology stocks had fallen to bargain levels. Some companies are trading for less than the value of cash on their books, he said.
But Mr. Cohen said he thought the outlook for the broader market was bleak. Growth is anemic, and the risk of inflation is increasing as the budget and trade deficits rise and the dollar falls, he said.
"The overall market still looks like it's going lower," Mr. Cohen said.
Flight-to-safety buying raised the price of Treasury securities yesterday, as hefty declines in the stock market prompted buying. Also, a warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that terrorists may try to use fuel tanker trucks as weapons in the United States or abroad took bond prices higher.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 100 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.79 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond rose 12/32, to 99 20/32, with its yield falling to 5.40 percent, from 5.43 percent.

 HERMAN MELVILLE
A Biography.
PUB-DATE: UNKNOWN 2, 1851-1891.
By Hershel Parker.
Illustrated. 997 pp. Baltimore:
The Johns Hopkins University Press. $45.
 American lives have no second acts, F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, but some do receive second volumes. Many years ago Hershel Parker set out to write the biography to end all biographies of Herman Melville, a book in which everything that could be known about the writer would be pieced out and put on record. Having pursued this quarry with a single-mindedness worthy of a Melville hero, Parker has brought this project to its conclusion with a second 900-plus-page volume to match the one he published in 1996.
Parker's first volume told the story of an exhilarating rise. The descendant of Revolutionary War heroes on both sides, Melville was born in 1819 to a status and prosperity that abruptly vanished when his father failed in business. Allan Melville died insane, leaving his wife to raise eight children on the scant funds wealthy relatives would spare. Herman, the second son and third child, was put to work at an early age, making his way aimlessly from clerking through school teaching to another job that required no economic outlay, the life of a common sailor. Having sailed on a number of vessels, Melville came ashore in his mid-20's and, hanging around his mother's house, wrote up the adventures he had after jumping ship in Polynesia. By happy luck his brother found a publisher, "Typee" (1846) became a success, and Melville found himself a writer. 
He repeated this success and consolidated his fame. But as he continued, the work he had mastered with little effort or forethought became a far more absorbing activity. In the late 1840's Melville rediscovered writing as the means by which to unfold his emerging powers of mind, a pleasure he found virtually addictive. From this point Melville began to write obsessively, in ever bolder departures from the popular forms of his first successes and with ever grander visions of his artistic gifts. "So far as I am individually concerned, & independent of my pocket, it is my earnest desire to write those sort of books which are said to 'fail,' " this proud new Melville wrote in 1849. Two years later, having just turned 32, he completed "Moby-Dick" -- the book whose publication closes Volume One.
But the same willfulness that produced this masterpiece had other consequences as well. In the middle of writing "Moby-Dick," Melville impulsively decided to move his family to the Berkshires, buying a farm and taking out two separate mortgages on the property (the second of which he long kept secret). Parker's first volume ends with Melville relishing the fruit of his impetuousness; the second shows him learning its price. 
For "Moby-Dick" was badly reviewed and helped to harden Melville's reputation for having swerved from his real talent into some strange, incomprehensible new line. The novel's lack of success led publishers to slash Melville's advances, so his earnings fell just as his family grew. His family shared the public's literary tastes far more than they did Melville's own, and he found himself surrounded by people who saw his ambitions in an increasingly dim light. Having missed the annual payments on the second mortgage, he saw his economic position became a source of growing stress and shame.
Melville did some of his best work under these painful conditions ("Bartleby the Scrivener" and "Benito Cereno" are from this time), but his early exuberance did not survive. Already by his late 30's, a man who had once been a picture of robust health was often ill, with his family only too happy to have him travel for his health. By the age of 40, having virtually given up writing for publication and then having failed in a career as a lecturer, Melville stopped even pretending to work for a living, becoming a dependent of his wealthy father-in-law. 
After 1866 Melville worked for nearly 20 years at a low-end job as a customs inspector, avoiding threatened layoffs but suffering a pay cut from $4 to $3.60 a day. When he gave in to literary ambition once more and wrote the long poem "Clarel," the strain was more devastating than ever, and the result was no new success. His publishers made him sign an agreement to pulp the remaining copies after this book sank like a stone.
Parker tells this story with a thoroughness that is scarcely to be believed. Nothing is summarized in this biography, nothing foreshortened; this demon researcher treats every phase of Melville's life as equally significant and tracks down (and writes up) every last fact. He is helped by the fact that masses of correspondence turn out to have survived from Melville's publishers and the many members of his extended family -- a trove so rich that virtually each week of Melville's life can be chronicled, often in multiple accounts.
Parker's work with these materials produces a picture of Melville's life that is extremely detailed in some dimensions but curiously thin in others. Scholars will be grateful for Parker's skill in filling in obscure chapters in Melville's writing life. One tour de force is his reconstruction of the composition of "Pierre; or, The Ambiguities," the successor to "Moby-Dick." Having worked out the timing of the rapid deterioration of Melville's literary position in 1851-52, Parker shows how Melville interpolated his resulting rage into the new manuscript, with predictably disastrous results. 
Equally interesting are Parker's surmises about works Melville never published that did not survive. He makes the case that in 1852-53 Melville wrote a novel based on materials he shared with Hawthorne about a sailor who deserted his wife. If this is true, then the theory that Melville renounced writing after "Pierre" is just wrong, and the mysterious leap from "Pierre" to the work he published after a silence, the very different "Bartleby the Scrivener," can be explained in a new way. Parker is also convinced that Melville prepared a volume of poems in 1860 that failed to be published. If this is so, a stretch that had seemed empty of literary strivings was instead a time of new effort and new failure -- a black hole Parker alone has the instruments to detect.
Parker's other achievement is his reconstruction of Melville's family life. Melville lived in continuing close contact with his mother, all his brothers and sisters, and many Melville and Gansevoort aunts, uncles and cousins -- a huge extended family that was further amplified when he added his wife's family to his own and when his siblings married and had children. Many of these figures are lovingly particularized in the book, which is really a biography of the Melville clan as much as of its now famous member. Parker's fascination with the ephemera of supporting actors' lives will exceed that of many readers (many a paragraph begins with a sentence like "Both Kate and Allan had serious dental work that year"), but the day-in, day-out chronicle of family doings has a cumulative effect. Parker reminds us that Melville's life was never only his writing life. He did that work amid the fulfillments, irritations and sheer chronic busyness of a larger life shared with others.
Parker's love of this family and its abundant records does mean, however, that matters not treated in those records tend to vanish from his view. Space is always available for another visit with Tom Melville, the lovable youngest brother, who became governor of the Sailors' Snug Harbor on Staten Island, but Parker has little time for history beyond family history. The 1850's crisis over the extension of slavery receives little more than a nod, the election of 1860 -- precipitant of the South's secession and the Civil War -- is barely mentioned, and the agony of Reconstruction receives perfunctory acknowledgment in a sentence that turns to the Melville women and the hard time they had finding servants. Parker suggests that Melville "was unwilling to respond to any present national crisis directly." But whether he was truly unengaged by the dramas of his time or whether (as seems more likely) that story is just uninteresting to Parker, the absence makes a strange gap.
The bustle of family doings tends to blot out dimensions of Melville's inner life as well. Parker does an admirable job of reconstructing Melville's reading, always a crucial part of his intellectual life. But what was so absorbing to Melville himself -- the will to understanding that he felt working itself out in him in rapid, self-revising leaps -- is harder to document and gets less play. No reader of Melville's fiction will have failed to feel the force of his religious curiosity, that driven, skeptical yet strangely resourceful intelligence with which he attacked questions like the nature of the world's creator or the value of Christian charity. Melville's few intellectual intimates knew the obsessional power of this side of him. After renewing their acquaintance in 1856, Hawthorne wrote: "Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he had 'pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated' " -- that is, that there is no afterlife -- but still he does not seem to rest in that anticipation. . . . He can neither believe, nor be comfortable in his disbelief; and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other." But this part of Melville's character left little record outside his novels and a few reported conversations, so it plays little role in Parker's account. In Parker's story, Melville's religious life is largely a matter of his mother's efforts to make him go to church. 
Readers will need to turn to other sources to find these missing dimensions, but for all that, Parker's book has much to teach. In addition to the many episodes that he fills in or sets straight, he reminds us just how problematic writing was for Melville, how shrouded it was in personal risk and cost -- and how stubbornly he kept at this work, even late in life, when he did it almost wholly in private. (The manuscript of "Billy Budd" was found in his desk when he died.)
 Parker also deserves credit for filling in the darker half of Melville's life without making it a melodrama of misunderstood genius. The temptations to caricature are large in this volume, but Parker's doggedness defeats them. On one memorable page, tired at last (after a thousand pages!) of Mrs. Melville's chatty cliches and obtuseness to her husband's woes, Parker hauls off and rips into her for her failures to recognize and support his genius. But he knows that Melville was far from faultless as a husband, and, following them through their daily rounds and endless family visits, he builds the recognition that there was something between them, however imperfectly they met each other's needs. In his telling, Melville was certainly also a self-absorbed parent; for Christmas this man once gave his children bound volumes of a periodical he wished to own. But Parker refuses to let him harden into a caricature of egotistical tyranny, and he reports the sorrows these parents endured -- the suicide of their eldest son, the second son's emergence as a ne'er-do-well, the disabling rheumatism of their daughter Bessie -- without blame or exoneration.
What we cannot know, but the main thing this book makes us wonder, is what different life Melville might have led and what different work he might have done if his talents had met with a different reception. The first glimmers of the fame he would enjoy in the next century began to reach him in his last years, and when Melville reached his late 60's his wife even inherited a fortune. But by then the rising talent of 1851 was too old to get much good from this long-withheld support. Melville died in 1891 at the age of 72.

HEADLINE: Re-engineering the Drug Business 

BYLINE:  By Matthew Brzezinski; Matthew Brzezinski, a frequent contributor to the magazine, last wrote on Uzbekistan.

 BODY:
The vial of heroin lands in my lap, and for a few uncomfortable seconds, as an undercover police officer and a very jittery drug dealer both grope my midriff, I worry someone will panic and go for his gun.
 The dealer is shouting -- for his money, for us to hurry -- peppering his exhortations with unprintable expressions. He looks no more than 20, with baggy trousers, high-top sneakers and a Baltimore Orioles baseball cap perched at a rakish angle. His grasping fingers, I can't help noticing, are bejeweled, like those of the rap artists one sees on MTV videos. 
 Lost in the chaotic exchange, and now rolling on the littered floor of the unmarked police pickup truck, is the small vial of heroin. It contains a milligram of opiate in fine powder form and is sealed with a color-coded plastic cap. The top is pink in this instance, but it's also available in an assortment of other hues, each denoting a variation in purity and price, to tap the widest possible customer base. If that sounds incongruously like something out of an M.B.A. textbook, that's because it is: the strategy is called microbranding, and it is the reason so many different varieties of Coca-Cola sit on grocery shelves these days. 
The pink-top I have just clumsily purchased has its particular niche, or target market: the "kids from the counties," as middle-class teenagers from the suburbs are known in Maryland. They are the same trendy audience that advertisers slaver over, and Baltimore's inner-city dealers have tailored the pink-top to their finicky needs. The product is just strong enough so that it can be snorted -- all the rage nowadays -- yet, at $20, cheap enough that it won't make too much of a dent in its average customer's weekly allowance. 
Beneath its veneer of violence, narcotics trafficking is a surprisingly sophisticated industry, marketing-driven just like any consumer-products business. Only illegal drugs are a bigger business than most, generating global revenues in excess of $400 billion annually, according to a United Nations study. From source to street, pushing drugs shares many common elements with hawking soda pop or cigarettes. It requires lots of working capital, steady supplies of raw materials, sophisticated manufacturing facilities, reliable shipping contractors and wholesale distributors, the all-important marketing arms and access to retail franchises for maximum market penetration. 
Just as in most sectors of the economy, innovation and technology are engines of growth. New uses of old products like heroin, or the introduction of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine and Ecstasy, keep pace with the changing demands of the marketplace, redistributing income from traditional profit centers like marijuana and cocaine. As in the automotive industry, different source nations compete in the global arena, with producers popping up in one country as quickly as they are pushed down in another. Occasionally, aggressive upstarts catch complacent giants unawares, as the Japanese did with Detroit carmakers in the 1980's. 
The principal difference between the narcotics trade and legitimate commerce, of course, is that the drug business must operate in the shadow of the law. This throws the entire organizational chart out of whack. Transportation becomes paramount, consolidation and vertical integration -- those cherished buzzwords of merger-hungry multinationals -- impossible. As a result, the narcotics industry has adapted what might be called the Osama bin Laden approach to management: base your operation in remote safe havens, the more war-torn and chaotic the better; stay small and shifty; use specialized subcontractors or freelancers on a need-to-know basis; vary your routes and routines whenever possible; and most important, always insulate yourself with plenty of expendable intermediaries in case someone gets caught and talks.
Sept. 11 and its new world of heightened border controls has made decentralization doubly important for international smuggling networks, be they Chinese, Colombian, Turkish or Nigerian. Ever since the big Cali and Medellin cartels were wiped out nearly a decade ago, virtually the entire narcotics trade has radically slimmed down. With the added pressure of 9/11 security measures, drug kingpins have adopted the mantra of their more enlightened corporate cousins, that size does not necessarily create efficiency, and that to survive you have to stay nimble. 
Heroin is the perfect drug for the new age of small-batch manufacturing and decentralization, a high-value-added commodity where a little goes a very long way. In fact, it's so well suited to the changing times that many cocaine traffickers are retooling their production lines to include heroin and joining the global trend toward leaner, meaner, terrorist-style operations. 
The restructuring is helping the business survive what could otherwise be a difficult period. Despite the military and security measures taken to fight international terrorism and shore up America's borders, Heroin Inc. has had a remarkably good fiscal year. The industry has managed to sustain gains made during the boom of the late 1990's, largely shrug off 9/11 and make further inroads in cocaine markets in the United States. Supplies in America are at an all-time high.
European operations are thriving as well. The Taliban's 2000 ban on poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has had little effect on the bottom line, with existing stockpiles and rerouted deliveries from Southeast Asia more than making up for the temporary shortfall. And the European sector is looking forward to a strong year in 2002. Now that the Taliban has been routed, bumper harvests are projected for Afghanistan. Elsewhere, analysts predict that Colombian distributors will continue their ambitious expansion plans in the eastern United States. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization is expected to further open a vast new market for both domestic consumption of heroin and its transit to other countries. 
The only uncertainty clouding the business's outlook is the long-term effect of Sept. 11. In the post-9/11 era of linking drugs with terror, of beefed-up border security and improved communication between international law-enforcement agencies in both intelligence-gathering and interdiction, the industry is likely to grow even more diffuse. Power will continue shifting from remote producers to highly specialized smuggling subcontractors, and outsourcing in general will become the crucial factor to survival and success. The signs of the industry's new business model can already be seen at the very earliest stages of heroin production, in the distant and troubled lands where poppies grow. 
The men with guns and gold watches live down in the valleys below. But it is high in the mist-shrouded mountains along the border between China and Myanmar, as Burma is now known, where the monsoon washes away roads linking lonely villages without electricity or running water, that heroin begins its long journey to America. 
By the time it reaches the streets of Baltimore, the world's most powerful narcotic will have traveled through half a dozen countries, soared at least 5,000-fold in price and changed hands a hundred times. The first fingers to touch it, though, belong to a slender 36-year-old mother of seven.
Xiamin Dwan Swan and her husband, Ju -- like the other 40 families who live in this hilltop hamlet in Myanmar -- have been farming opium for generations, ever since the British introduced poppy cultivation to these parts more than a century ago. It's not a lucrative living, judging by the straw huts, mud floors and barefoot children, but it is the only one that the residents of Chaw Haw have ever known. 
The ritual begins every September, when the steep fields are burned and the poppy seeds scattered. They thrive in these altitudes, just about the only crop that does, but it is not only a quirk of climate that allows them to do so. A key competitive advantage of this rugged landscape is that it lies beyond the reach of any law-enforcement agency. As is the case in the world's other opium-producing regions -- the guerrilla-controlled jungles of Colombia, the lawless fiefs of Afghanistan -- central authorities have no say here. Power is exercised by renegade insurgent groups with prickly notions of territorial sovereignty, not to mention private armies 15,000 to 20,000 strong. 
By February, Xiamin Dwan Swan and her husband begin the harvest by scoring each poppy pod with a needle-like knife. A creamy gum oozes from the cuts, and once it turns black it is scraped off with a crescent-shaped tool that has been in her family ever since she can remember. It is painstaking work, and for their labor the Dwan Swans earn $600 annually, barely enough to feed their children, three pigs and two ornery dogs. Brokers come from the valley in early March to purchase the raw opium gum, which sells for about 1,500 yuan per vis -- the equivalent of about $135 a kilogram. (A vis is a unit of measure equal to 1.6 kilos, or about 3 pounds.)
"I don't know who buys our harvest," Xiamin says, which is the smart answer, but probably not true, given that she and her husband have most likely been dealing with the same broker for the past 20 years. Nor does she claim to know what happens to her harvest once the brokers collect it from Chaw Haw and other villages. This is probably true, since refineries buy their opium gum from the brokers rather than risking exposure by dealing directly with hundreds of separate suppliers. 
That is just the first of many layers of insulation that characterize the heroin trade and must be factored into the cost of doing business. For their services, the brokers, usually tribal elders, charge a 20 percent markup, sometimes more if they have lent villagers money in anticipation of their crop. In Helmand Province in Afghanistan, for example, some farmers grew so indebted during Mullah Omar's fatwa banning poppy cultivation that for a time after being liberated by American forces, they were selling raw opium to creditors for as little as $35 per kilogram. (That short-lived ban temporarily toppled Afghanistan from its nearly decade-long dominance among global opium producers, allowing Myanmar to briefly claim the dubious title, with up to 60 percent of the world total. But once the final tallies are in for this year's harvest, Afghanistan is once again expected to regain the top spot, followed by Myanmar, Colombia and Mexico.) 
Unlike poppy cultivation, refining is a complicated, capital-intensive process, limiting the number of players with the financial wherewithal to participate. This phase of the business is controlled mostly by the Wa, Kokang and Shan warlords, who run rebel states within Myanmar. "They tax it, or receive money for protection," says Kyaw Thein, a Burmese brigadier general. Indeed, ask a Wa official about opium, and he'll rattle off his town's yields as if he's quoting from the municipal budget. "Four thousand, six hundred vis," says Lu Kyar Shin, a Wa mayor who sports a Rolex and a sidearm. "Down from 10,000 vis a few years ago." 
Like the cocaine labs of Colombia, Myanmar's heroin refineries are temporary facilities buried deep in the jungle. They are set up to fill specific orders and can be quickly struck down in case the heat is on. But that only happens occasionally, when central authorities stumble on a refinery that falls within their territorial jurisdiction. 
Burmese officials proudly display the precursor chemicals seized in one such recent raid. The materials stand stacked in neat rows of blue and white industrial drums, filling a courtyard lined with papaya trees and barbed wire: 900 gallons of calcium hydroxide needed to cook raw opium into morphine, the first stage of the refining process; liquid ether smuggled into Myanmar by Indian networks; and Chinese-made ammonium chloride, which transforms the morphine into the lower-grade No. 3 heroin, or "brown sugar," as it is popularly known; and finally, out front in a place of honor, 150 gallons of hard-to-come-by acetic anhydride, the key ingredient to producing the 90-percent-pure No.4 heroin destined for American and European markets, the notorious China White.
Though China White is often packaged by refiners in 700-gram bricks, known as units, the universal measure in the global narcotics business is the 1,000-gram kilo. A kilo that will ultimately fetch in excess of $200,000 (wholesale) in New York City costs as little as $2,500 in Myanmar. That, at least, is what Saikyaw Myat, an unemployed stonemason, was expecting to get for it before being busted by an undercover agent. Ma Lwan Gyi and her two young friends, Ma Kaing Hland and Ma Ban Mong, were nabbed in a similar sting. They had each been promised $20 to deliver a kilo of the famed Double Lion brand into town. All four now sit in leg irons in a stifling corrugated-steel prison, a labyrinth of low wooden cages constructed from thick teak bars, forbidden to move from the lotus position, where they are to contemplate the error of their ways for the next 10 years.
The modest price of the China White they carried illustrates how in the overall cost structure of the heroin industry, refining is not a particularly large profit center. That's because the risks of interdiction within Myanmar are too low to factor significantly into the final price. The markup on the finished product is about 20 percent, in line with other forms of contract manufacturing in Asia like semiconductors or cellphones, where the real money goes to designers and distributors.
Once the sourcing and processing stages are complete, isolated countries like Myanmar or Afghanistan lose their competitive advantage. "The Wa or the Kokang don't have the sophistication or international networks to get their product to market," explains Maj. Win Naing, who heads the narcotics task force in the bustling northern Myanmar border town of Muse. "They leave that to foreigners." Much the same holds true with Afghan growers, who despite being the source of 80 percent of the heroin in the $12 billion European market, earned at most only a modest $56 million from opium sales last year, according to a United Nations survey. 
The real profits in heroin, to borrow a term from the embattled accounting industry, are all downstream -- in transportation and distribution.
To reach global markets, heroin leaves Myanmar through two principal pipelines. With each route, a different set of players, with specific expertise, is involved. The first, and most used, is north through China's Yunnan Province to Hong Kong or the free-trade zones around Guangdong. Chinese smuggling syndicates ply this route, charging as little as $1,000 per kilo to sneak the contraband across the border from Muse to as much as $10,000 per kilo to get it all the way to Hong Kong. One such group operated until recently in Muse, where the border with China is a four-foot-high fence that runs right through the center of town. The syndicate was headed by a 39-year-old Chinese national by the name of Tan Xiaolin, who set up shop in a large pink-and-green villa a few hundred yards from the frontier. Until his arrest last year through the joint efforts of Chinese and Burmese authorities, he had smuggled more than three tons of pure heroin to Hong Kong, where different trafficking organizations with a more international orientation sent it on to Sydney, Vancouver and the United States. Tan has since been extradited to China and, according to Burmese officials, sentenced to death.
The harsh penalties handed out in Asia for trafficking do not seem to be a great deterrent. That, say American officials, is because you can often buy your way out of jams or simply purchase protection from underpaid local Communist authorities. United States drug-enforcement officials, however, concede that the inner workings of the balkanized China pipeline are somewhat of an intelligence black hole because of spotty relations with Beijing. Much more is known about the second major route out of Myanmar, which travels south and then east, through Thailand.
Much as he tries, Mike Carter finds it hard to blend in with the crowd at his posting in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. For one, Carter, a special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, is a very large individual; well over six feet tall, a close-cropped former marine who went to college in Texas on a football scholarship and used to maul opponents as a 250-pound linebacker. Then there is the 9-millimeter Glock tucked into the waistband of his jeans. And those dark, wraparound aviator sunglasses. 
Even though he has picked up Thai and speaks it more or less grammatically, there's not much chance of passing himself off as a native. So he lurks in the shadows, behind the tinted windows of his silver Toyota, playing a supporting role, waiting for the drugs to come across the border.
Today he has brought some cash to entice traffickers, to expedite matters. It lies temptingly in a green satchel on top of my bag, five million baht, just over $116,000 at the current exchange rate. It's what's called "flash money," and it will be shown to a Burmese broker by an undercover Thai policeman posing as a customer.
The deal is set to go down in Chiang Saen, at the confluence of the Mekong and Ruak Rivers, where Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet: the heart of the Golden Triangle. 
"This all used to be poppy country, and 10 years ago there were refineries everywhere on the Thai side," Carter explains as we drive on broad, freshly paved roads. With all the tour buses and golf resorts around, it's difficult to imagine Thailand as a major heroin producer. But it once was a world leader, until the economy picked up and pressure from the international community forced traffickers to relocate across the border in Myanmar. Much the same happened in Pakistan, Turkey, Bolivia and Peru in the 1980's, as successful eradication efforts and increased standards of living forced production to shift to the more lawless and impoverished corners of Afghanistan and Colombia. That fluidity is another key feature of the rapid-reaction narcotics business: push it down in one place, and it simply pops up somewhere else. In that sense, heroin is truly a global commodity.
Carter's cellphone rings. It's Col. Dussadee Arajavuth, the head of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau, or N.S.B., in northern Thailand. The Burmese broker, he informs Carter, has taken the bait. Now it's only a matter of time and patience. While we wait, Colonel Arajavuth arranges for me to meet with one of his prized sources, a foot soldier in one of the warlord armies that smuggle heroin across the Thai border. We meet in a hotel room in Chiang Rai, not too far from where the N.S.B. keeps a safe house. 
"The heroin leaves the refineries in caravans," the informant begins. "There are usually 50 to 100 people in each caravan. Half are porters carrying up to 500 units of heroin, the other half are soldiers." The soldiers, he continues, are heavily armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and are provided -- for a fee -- by either the United Wa State Army or the Shan State Army, insurgent groups that operate close to the Thai frontier. The final destination is either Thailand proper or Tachileik, a rough Burmese border town that apparently inspires such dread that the superstitious residents of Mae Sai, on the Thai side, have erected a black steel scorpion the size of a tank to ward away their neighbors' evil spirits.
In Tachileik, brokers like the one Agent Carter is currently trying to set up take delivery of the heroin, which, because of high transportation costs, rises in price to $4,500 per kilo. There are approximately 20 such brokers representing the Wa and the Shan in Tachileik, says the informer. "Everyone knows who they are."
Delivering heroin directly into Thailand is a bit trickier, and the added risk is reflected in the slight price hike to $5,500. The drug caravans move over the dense mountain frontier, under cover of night, when Thai border patrols are in their barracks. To see how porous the frontier can be, Carter drives me to the Ban Phai border post atop Mount Doi Tung. We barely make it up the steep road, since Carter's Toyota is loaded down with M-4 assault rifles discreetly tucked into golf bags in the trunk. The firepower is a precaution. 
Tensions at the Ban Phai outpost -- a collection of bamboo huts reinforced with black sandbags, trenches and M-60 heavy-caliber machine guns -- are running high. Just a few days before, two advance scouts from a Wa caravan were caught by a nearby border-patrol unit. The Wa took exception to the arrest and unleashed a mortar barrage. The Thais responded with 105-millimeter Howitzers. Miraculously, only one person was injured. 
Once the shipment has arrived in Thailand or Tachileik, a whole new set of players enters the fray. These are Thais from Bangkok, who converge on the border area to pick up heroin. They, too, have their specific niche: moving the product to buyers in Bangkok. One such transportation subcontractor, who had 37 kilos of China White in his black Land Rover, was recently wounded by Burmese border guards in Tachileik. The bust clearly showed just how decentralization keeps the narcotics trade in business. The load was a mix of the Double Lion brand favored by Wa refineries and the 999 brand popular with labs in the Shan region. Under interrogation, the driver could not name his sources and could only provide police with a disconnected contact number to a broker in Tachileik. The chain to the producers was already broken. The transport subcontractors themselves add another layer of protection for both the brokers in the border area and outside buyers, because no one here will do business with a farang, as foreigners are known. They are "too conspicuous," says Colonel Arajavuth. "We'd pick them up right away."
In fact, most of the foreign buyers are West Africans -- Nigerians, to be precise -- who tend to stick out in the Thai provinces even more than Agent Carter does. They prefer the more cosmopolitan anonymity of Bangkok and are prepared to pay for the added security. In the Thai capital, the local middlemen charge between $7,500 and $9,500 to deliver each kilo of heroin, depending on the quantity ordered. West Africans are not the only foreign customers; there are smugglers from Taiwan and Europe. But the Nigerians are by far the most organized and entrenched group. Their job in heroin's ever-lengthening supply chain is also among the riskiest: to get the heroin into the United States.
Few C.E.O.'s of major American corporations lie awake nights agonizing over logistics. That's what companies like DHL or U.P.S. are for. The drug trade, too, has its courier services, outfits such as "Nigeria Express" or Mexico's notorious A.F.O.
The drug runners breach every United States frontier, but one of their main targets is San Ysidro, Calif., America's busiest border crossing, the fragile demarcation line that separates San Diego from the smuggler's paradise of Tijuana. Between a quarter and a third of the heroin, cocaine and marijuana entering the country passes through here and four smaller checkpoints in Southern California, and on a good day the Customs Service can hope to make at least a dozen decent-size seizures.
Up to now, it has been relatively easy going for China White traffickers. Nigerians, having taken delivery of the heroin in Bangkok, have either shipped it via couriers to transit countries like Mexico or Canada or, more commonly, have sent it home to Lagos. Given Nigeria's perennial position near the top of the global-corruption rankings, forwarding through Lagos international airport does not pose much of a barrier. In Nigeria, the drugs are repacked into smaller parcels, often into condoms that couriers swallow and transit through nonsource countries like Britain or France to throw Customs officials off the trail. If the heroin is sent directly from Thailand to the United States, Caucasian couriers are usually employed to foil racial profiling. They are often female, in their 20's and 30's. 
It is also at this stage that another complication arises for Southeast Asian heroin. As it approaches its target market, it brushes up against the competition, including Mexican-produced Black Tar, known derisively as Mexican Mud because of its poor quality; the more superior Mexican Brown in powder form; and especially high-grade Colombian White, its biggest rival. (Afghan heroin is conspicuously absent at San Ysidro and only occasionally shows up in the United States, in places like Detroit. Its principal market is Europe, where it arrives from Turkey, Russia and the Balkans.) 
Colombia is a relative upstart in the international heroin trade, with cocaine traffickers there deciding to get into the business only around 1990. It was a decision based purely on demographics. The cocaine craze of the 80's was waning as the drug fell out of fashion with urban professionals. Moreover, dealers were discovering that unlike heroin addicts, many habitual coke users tended to burn out after five years. Faced with a dwindling customer base in America, cocaine traffickers tried to expand into Europe. But they had only limited success, in places like Spain, England and, most recently, the Netherlands. The hard drug of choice in the European Union was heroin, and Pakistani and Turkish groups had the market sewn up there. So Colombian cocaine traffickers decided to diversify and launched a poppy-cultivation drive, importing seeds, equipment and expertise from Southwest Asia. 
"It took them three or four years to get it right," recalls Felix J. Jimenez, the D.E.A.'s New York bureau chief, "to procure the proper refining know-how and precursor chemicals like acetic anhydride." 
But by the mid-90's, he says, the Colombians were producing heroin with purity levels exceeding 90 percent. Suddenly Colombian smugglers had a product that was equal to, if not better than, China White. All they had to do was get the new product to the market, past points of entry like San Ysidro. 
One sure sign of the high regard in which traffickers hold San Ysidro's defenses is the risk premium attached to making it across. If getting heroin into China or Thailand bears a markup of $1,000 per kilo, here it's a different story altogether. After it makes the 100-yard journey across the border, a kilo of Black Tar will soar in value to $54,000 once safely on the San Diego side. Colombian heroin will rise by as much as 20 times once it gets to Los Angeles. And China White will command well into the six figures once it reaches American soil.
With the stakes so high, smuggling syndicates go to great lengths to keep tabs on what is going on at San Ysidro; when, for instance, shifts are ending, how many rovers are deployed on a given day, which canine units are on patrol. But mostly they just play the numbers game, the law of averages. More than 40 million people enter the United States through San Ysidro annually, and Customs can't check them all. 
"We get up to 60,000 cars a day, and you have to keep in mind that 99 percent of the passengers are honest travelers," says Robert Hood, a supervisory Customs inspector. "So the bad guys come straight at us. And if we intercept a few loads, that's just a tax they factor into the cost of doing business."
Most of the China White passing through San Ysidro is spirited through the pedestrian crossing, a long concrete corridor lined with metal detectors, airport-style X-ray scanners and D.E.A. posters offering $2 million for information leading to the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix and his brother, Ramon. 
The Arellano Felix Organization, A.F.O. for short, is a testament to just how important transportation subcontractors have become in the drug industry. The Tijuana-based outfit started out humbly, smuggling duty-free cigarettes and alcohol in the late 70's. Over time, they moved up to marijuana and were well placed to reap a bonanza from the cocaine craze of the 80's. By the 90's, they were moving tens of billions of dollars in contraband, controlled an estimated three-quarters of everything that passed through San Ysidro and even built complex tunnels into Texas. 
"They took over," says Jayson Ahern, director of field operations for United States Customs in Southern California. "They effectively supplanted their old bosses in Colombia and became a cartel of their own." The A.F.O.'s competitive edge was location: right on the Mexican-American border. However, the critical error that would lead to their downfall, as with the Colombian cartels before them, was getting too big and flouting the laws of decentralization. 
Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels were the first drug-trafficking organizations to vertically integrate. Like the big oil companies with gasoline, the cartels tried to hang on to their product through its entire chain of manufacturing, distribution and sale to consumers. For a while it worked, but the downside of any vertically integrated structure is that one broken link can bring down the whole organization. By using freelance subcontractors who don't know one another or even the identity of their employers, traffickers of China White assiduously avoid this peril.
The Nigerian buyers in Bangkok, for instance, don't even move the heroin themselves. Instead they hire American, European or Canadian couriers that they send on circuitous journeys to finally enter the United States in places where they hope Customs will have its guard down.
Inspector Hood is familiar with this type of ruse. "I had this one lady pull up to the pedestrian crossing in a cab," he recalls. "I took a look at her passport and it had an exit stamp from Thailand dated three days before. She said her vacation had been cut short because her goddaughter got sick and she had to get back to Baltimore quickly. I didn't buy it. There are definitely more direct routes to Maryland than driving through Mexico."
It turns out that the woman had nearly three kilos of heroin in her luggage and was a courier for Nigerian traffickers. They had hoped that a white waitress would not fit the profile of the Latin American smugglers usually seen at San Ysidro. "They probe for weaknesses," adds Hood, "figuring we are not looking for Southeast Asian heroin here, the way they do on flights arriving from Bangkok to J.F.K."
Many couriers -- mules, or body-packers, as they are known in the trade -- are swallowers who ingest honey-coated condoms filled with heroin. This makes them perilously hard to detect. Usually, it's only when something goes badly wrong that they get caught. One of Hood's colleagues, for instance, recently stumbled on a jittery gentleman claiming to be a pharmacist from Colombia.
"The guy was too jumpy," recalls the colleague, Chief Inspector Mark Wilkerson. "And he didn't look like a professional type." In other words, he fit the mule profile. Wilkerson asked him to remove his tie and put it back on. "He couldn't do it, couldn't tie a knot," Wilkerson laughs. The faux pharmacist was a mule who had been promised several thousand dollars to make the delivery. 
To the uninitiated, all this may seem like a great deal of trouble to go through to move a mere kilo. China White is unusual that way. Of all the branches of the narcotics trafficking trade, it is by far the least efficient on a cost-per-kilo basis. According to a study by an economist, Peter Reuter, Latin American-produced cocaine is as much as 10 times cheaper to transport because it is usually shipped in bigger batches, 250 kilos and up. This allows traffickers economies of scale to spread out the, say, $500,000 fee pilots of small aircraft or go-fast boats often charge. 
The discrepancy has its roots in the heritage of Colombian cocaine traffickers, many of whom came to the trade from the marijuana rackets, where bigger payloads were always the norm. But it also reflects the nature of heroin and demonstrates why it is increasingly the drug of choice for the savviest smugglers. With its high market value, heroin is ideally suited to traveling tens of thousands of miles, crossing countless borders. It requires far smaller networks to smuggle than the big organizations needed for cocaine or marijuana. And spreading loads over dozens of individual couriers minimizes risk. 
"If I had to make any analogies," says Mike Chapman, a senior special agent with the D.E.A. in Washington, "it would be to Al Qaeda."
Heroin traffickers tend to operate more like highly compartmentalized terrorist cells than multinational corporations or the sprawling Colombian cartels of the Pablo Escobar era. But that's also the case, increasingly, across the entire narcotics industry. "This type of activity does not allow concentration of power like legitimate commerce," says Ethan Nadelmann, an economist and drug-policy expert. "If smugglers get too big, they develop security and personnel problems and get targeted by law enforcement."
Indeed, Pablo Escobar -- El Patron, as he was known in his heyday -- would be living proof of this, had he not been killed in 1993 after one of the most intense international manhunts in history. It's the same story with the high-flying Tan Xiaolin from Muse, who is currently on death row in China along with 18 of his associates. Even those D.E.A. posters of the Arellano Felix Organization, the closest thing to a cartel since the leaders of the Cali and Medellin gangs were locked up almost a decade ago, are already dated. Ramon is dead, shot in February by Mexican authorities, and his brother Benjamin was arrested in March.
Drug traffickers are also vulnerable to shifting international winds. Smugglers have had a rough time since Sept. 11 changed the way most nations view border security. In late 2001, heroin seizures rose sixteenfold along the California-Mexico border, largely at San Ysidro, which, like every port of entry in America, has been on Level 1 alert since the attacks on the twin towers. 
"For the first few weeks," recalls Hood, "we didn't see any drugs whatsoever. It was eerily quiet, as if the traffickers were hanging back, waiting to see what we would do."
But smugglers, like anyone else, have bills to pay and can't afford to sit on inventory for too long. "Eventually they have to move," says Vincent E. Bond, a public affairs officer with United States Customs in San Diego. "And this isn't a very good time to be trying to fly in a Cessna under radar," he adds. "You're liable to have an F-16 up your tail."
So syndicates are shifting away from air routes and big ports of entry, trying to hide their tracks better, bury their loads deeper and use more marine cargo and speedboat deliveries. (The Coast Guard reports making seizures at a pace more than twice last year's.) And for once, the law of averages is now tilting toward interdiction efforts. "Regular passenger traffic has been way down since 9/11," says Bond. "That gives us more time to scrutinize each entrant." 
Once in the territorial United States, heroin typically makes its way to three major collection centers. On the West Coast it travels up Interstate 5 to Los Angeles. There, the wholesale price of a kilo of high-quality heroin jumps to between $86,000 and $100,000, from the $40,000-to-$54,000 range in San Diego.
Along the way, importers jack up the bottom line by cutting the product -- "stepping on" it, in street parlance. This is usually the first of many adulterations to follow, all intended to increase profits by decreasing purity, and a variety of agents are used for this purpose: quinine, talcum, even lactose. 
In America, as in Europe, immigrants are the major importers and distributors of heroin. This is simply because the smuggling networks prefer to deal with their own and don't trust outsiders. Nigerians will sell to fellow West Africans, Chinese to immigrants from back home and so on.
The American market for heroin, worth about $10 billion annually, is thus roughly divided into ethnic spheres of influence. Los Angeles-based Mexican groups control wholesale markets west of the Mississippi. Nigerians operating out of Chicago have the northern parts of the Midwest. And New York-based Dominican syndicates fronting for Colombians dominate the East Coast. Smaller Chinese gangs operate on the fringes, moving mostly in areas like San Francisco or New York that have large Asian communities. 
The divisions, notes Jimenez, the D.E.A.'s top man in New York City and a leading expert on heroin in America, are fluid. Mexican groups, for instance, regularly impinge on the West Africans in Chicago, who in turn intrude on Dominican turf in places like Baltimore. The competition can be fierce and at times violent, but more often than not it tends to be fought along straight marketing lines. 
One such battle changed the face of the heroin trade on the Eastern Seaboard. It occurred in New York in the mid-1990's. Up to then, Jimenez explains, the wholesale heroin business on the East Coast belonged to Chinese triads. (They themselves had supplanted Italian crime families the decade before.) But with the entry of the Colombians, the established Chinese rings found themselves with a serious fight on their hands. Astonishingly, what broke out was almost entirely a price war. 
China White, which was often smuggled a kilo at a time in people's stomachs, sold for between $160,000 and $180,000 per 700-gram unit, explains Jimenez. But the Colombians would include heroin in their large cocaine shipments, benefiting from drastically lower transportation costs. "They could charge $80,000 a kilo and undercut the Chinese by half."
The Colombians, of course, enjoyed the geographic advantage of closer proximity to the United States. But they had another, equally important, competitive advantage: established distribution centers. "They would force their Dominican cells to take, say, two kilos of heroin for every hundred kilos of coke they ordered and give out free samples to their customers."
The move turned out to be a marketing coup, creating an entirely new clientele for heroin, much the same way that the introduction of crack cocaine in the previous decade had exposed a yuppie drug to the mass market. Because the Colombians insisted that their distributors keep the heroin at high purities, upscale coke users could now snort or smoke it, ridding the product of the stigma of dirty needles and H.I.V. "I put a hidden camera on a street corner where I knew they sold heroin," Jimenez says. "You wouldn't believe the customers we got on film: lawyers, doctors, teachers."
The net result of the innovative strategies, says Jimenez, is that by the new millennium, Colombian heroin dominated markets in New York and throughout the Eastern Seaboard. 
From collection centers like New York City, heroin travels down the I-95 corridor to secondary markets like Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. Dealers from those satellite towns will usually make the trip to New York once every few weeks, picking up anywhere from one to five kilos at a time, explains Detective Lieutenant Michael Tabor of the Baltimore police department. 
While New York can boast of hundreds of "cells," as Jimenez labels major distribution rings, a city the size of Baltimore will have no more than two dozen dealers capable of buying in kilo quantities. "We know who they are," Tabor says, rattling off names. "We've got phone taps on all of them," he adds. "But they're damn slick."
As you go progressively down the food chain, though, things get a little easier from a law-enforcement perspective. I find myself setting out once again to cruise the streets of Baltimore with narcotics officers.
Special Operations Unit One meets daily at 11 a.m. in a newly renovated conference room that appears industriously messy, like the marketing department in a successful midsize company. But no one in Sgt. Mark Janicki's eight-man unit looks remotely corporate: beards, braids, ponytails and skull-and-bones ear studs form part of the dress code, which leans heavily toward leather and jeans. 
Sergeant Janicki goes over the game plan. I am to accompany one undercover officer on a heroin buy, while the rest of the unit is divided into surveillance and enforcement squads. The officer I'm accompanying, a 34-year-old Long Island native who uses the street name Mike, goes off to change into his disguise. We're posing as construction workers -- strung-out construction workers by the look of it when Mike returns wearing filthy, tar-splattered jeans, heroin-chic dark eyeliner and a backward baseball cap that pins down his stringy, shoulder-length hair. I'm suddenly glad that I didn't shave this morning.
Janicki gives us a lift to a nearby parking garage, where the department keeps a white Dodge pickup with scaffolding sections scattered in its flatbed for added effect. Kentucky Fried Chicken wrappers and crumpled 7-Eleven coffee cups litter the floor of the cab, more props.
As we head southeast to one of Baltimore's rougher neighborhoods, Mike explains how the lower rungs of the distribution chain are organized. Baltimore's dozen or so big dealers reparcel the newly purchased kilos into more affordable ounce-size lots. Shops or midsize dealers then break down ounces into grams that are resold to crews in "packages" of 100 vials or gelcaps, each containing one milligram. Gelcaps, as opposed to the pink-, blue- or green-tops, cater to the low end of the market, the addicts who inject heroin.
"That's when they're really stepping on the product," says Mike. "The rule is generally six to one," Jimenez elaborates, meaning that from the one kilo purchased from wholesalers, up to seven kilos will be produced by adding sundry adulterants by the time it hits the street. "This is where the biggest markups occur," he adds. "From wholesale to retail, because that's where you face the biggest risks. You have to protect yourself not only from the police but from rivals and people in your own organization who know you are carrying large amounts of cash." 
As we drive deeper into the drug zone, the violence and poverty that accompany the lowest echelons of the heroin trade become more visible. Mike spots a street corner that is not too busy. He doesn't want to risk leaving me alone with a crowd. He radios Sergeant Janicki to coordinate surveillance. "Corner of East Monument and Belnord," he says, stowing the walkie-talkie. "All right, put away your notebook," he says. "And whatever happens, don't get out of the truck."
We slow down and pull up to the curb. "Yo, man, dope's out?" he calls. Dope is street slang for heroin, which is also sometimes called boy. "I got shirleys," responds the dealer, a tough-looking youth in shiny white sneakers with a stick of red licorice clenched between a solid row of gold teeth. Shirley means crack cocaine, which is also called girl. "He waitin' on a fresh pack," says the youth, nodding across the street to a man with no teeth. A pack is 100 heroin gelcaps, each filled with heavily adulterated heroin -- scramble" in the local dialect -- which means he is expecting a delivery from his crew boss.
Mike doesn't like it. To make the buy, he has to get out of the truck and leave me alone. He hesitates for a moment. "Be cool," he finally tells me, and much as I try, I find it hard to follow his instruction, what with the licorice guy eyeballing me menacingly. Mike returns a few nerve-racking minutes later and hands me a clear capsule that looks like cold medicine. It is filled with a chunky white substance. "Scramble," he says, putting the pickup in gear. 
Mike paid $10 for the milligram, the purity of which usually ranges from 4 to 7 percent, but recently has been testing as high as 12 percent -- a sure sign that heroin is in plentiful supply in Baltimore. "What's that come out to per kilo?" I ask. 
"Math was never my strong suit," Mike says. "But a lot." I crunch a few numbers while we drive away, giving Sergeant Janicki and his enforcement unit time to swoop in on the unsuspecting mark. Moments later Janicki radios in to inform us that he has picked up the dealer, a 31-year-old black male with 21 prior arrests for heroin and cocaine distribution. "Guy's a junkie," Mike says sadly, shaking his head. "Probably gets 50 bucks and a free fix to sit out there all day."
There are thousands of others like him in Baltimore -- and throughout inner cities across the United States -- working, much like the stranded peasants of Myanmar, for next to nothing, for a lack perhaps of economic alternatives. And as for the heroin that unites them in their poverty, a lone kilo, which began its economic life cycle so humbly at the hands of a Burmese mother of seven, will have generated sales just shy of a million dollars by the time it ends its deadly journey and enters the American bloodstream.

HEADLINE: The Wasteland 

BYLINE:  By Austin Bunn; Austin Bunn lives in Los Angeles. He last wrote for the magazine about Erin Brockovich.

 BODY:
"A probation officer adopts the child from one of her cases." -- In the Echo"
"Rashomon' set among the cops, politicians and E.M.T.'s in Los Angeles." -- Boomtown"
"A 29-year-old Congressional aide runs against her boss." -- The Capital City"

Every television show starts as a phrase called a log line. Typically, it has the word "young" in it and doctors/lawyers/detectives fighting the system/one another. This phrase will be polished to perfection and then sold to agents, to the networks and -- assuming months of unbelievable luck -- to audiences via TV listings.
 Often, at first, it is cribbed from another show. Last summer, Rod Lurie's agent arranged a meeting with a production company that was looking to set up a "very rich" TV deal for him. They just needed an idea. A former film journalist, Lurie is the 40-year-old director of the movies "The Contender" (which he also wrote) and "The Last Castle"; he is sedate and articulate and has a sincere adoration for film. His dimly lighted office in North Hollywood is wallpapered with autographed movie posters and his 1984 diploma from West Point. "I had never thought about TV in any way," Lurie admits, which became clear when the executives showed up. "I had no ideas," he says. "So I said: 'I watch "The West Wing," and I see a show about good people doing the right thing. Why don't we do a show about bad people doing the wrong thing?"' 
 The executives immediately went back to their cars and made an offer. This alacrity is not uncommon in television, and neither was Lurie's response, which was to switch from pursued to pursuer. He approached other production companies, honing a pitch based on a meeting he'd had with Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas while doing research for "The Contender." Lincoln had run for Congress against her former boss. 
"The initial reason to say yes to TV was the money -- it was just too big," Lurie says. "Then it just became extremely enticing -- some of the lowest-ranking shows on television pull in six million people. That would have equaled twice as much money at the box office as 'The Last Castle' eventually made." 
Development in the television industry operates on a precise, rigorous clock, and every year a new market opens for good or "fresh" or at least sellable ideas, and it needs sellers like Lurie. It is a lucrative market, though the odds are bad to brutal. A network will buy 100 pitches to make into scripts and spend millions turning 20 into "pilots." These pilots are all made during the same three months in the spring, which creates, as one producer called it, "a climate of fear" that descends on Los Angeles -- fear" because in that mad dash to delivery, these pilots, despite staggering infant-mortality rates, begin inevitably to matter to their creators. In mid-May, each network usually "picks up" somewhere between 5 and 10 pilots to become series for the fall. Roughly two-thirds of the pilots, the best efforts of each network, are stillborn. They vanish from the press releases, from the trades and from the resumes. And every year, first-timers make the mistake of caring too much in an industry that succeeds by not. 
This pilot process, traditionally an insular, closed-door drama involving television veterans, has lately become infiltrated by a surprising number of filmmakers. From time to time, one would take a stab at television -- Steven Spielberg produced "E.R.," for instance, and Jerry Bruckheimer does "C.S.I." -- but over the past couple of years the presence of film talent has grown larger and more varied. Everyone from Hollywood hit-makers to indie outliers is now pitching TV ideas.
"These film people come to TV because they know, in a year, whether or not their show will be on the air," says Leslie Moonves, president of CBS. "Anything is better than the development hell" of film. In addition to bigger players like Sylvester Stallone, this year's crop included Lurie, the independent film director Allison Anders and Graham Yost, the screenwriter of "Speed" -- all first-time show creators, putting their work forward in this strange and unforgiving environment. "If you do a movie, and it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, you can always say, 'I still have this film,"' Anders says. "But in TV, if you do a pilot and it doesn't get picked up, you don't have anything." All that you have is your story.
Allison Anders is a natural den mother -- she calls people she has just met "Honey" and "Sweetie" and went around prepping multiple areas of her house in North Hollywood so her pregnant cat could choose where to best have her kittens. Last year, she finished a small autobiographical film about a rape survivor called "Things Behind the Sun," which she sold to Showtime. After regularly hawking her films ("Gas Food Lodging" and "Mi Vida Loca") at Sundance, she says, "I was, like, 'If I have another movie come out and die in the theaters in two weeks, I am going to die."' When her film played on cable, her attitude about television changed. "Five million people saw my movie on the first night that it aired on Showtime," Anders says. "I've never had five million people see one of my films in the theaters."
Her idea for a one-hour drama was, by TV standards, a deeply personal concept. When a cast member from Anders's film "Mi Vida Loca," about female gang life in Los Angeles, died and left behind a 2 1/2-year-old boy, Anders took him in. She had been trying to make the story of the adoption as a film, but it wasn't working. So she sold the concept to CBS, which paid for her to write the script with a collaborator, Kurt Voss. The "money" for a single network half-hour prime-time drama pilot script can range from the Writers Guild scale minimum of $28,687.50 to $250,000 for established names. ("Blind" overall deals -- to acquire the ideas of known directors or writers in advance of actually having them -- can jump into the millions.) The show, titled "In the Echo," grew out of Anders's time living in Echo Park, a largely Hispanic Los Angeles neighborhood, with her son, Ruben, and her two daughters. As Anders says, "I wanted to show L.A. as people don't see L.A."
This desire to show Los Angeles "as it really is" turned out to be unusually common this year. "I thought I was fresh doing a cop show set in L.A.," says Yost, 42, whose pilot script "Boomtown" was bought by NBC. "Well, there are four cop shows set in L.A. as pilots this year." The inspiration may simply be economic. Network advertising money atrophied 16 percent last year, from a record-shattering $8.1 billion in 2000 to $6.9 billion in 2001. So rooting shows in the "gritty" (read: cheap) side of L.A. sounds good to the networks.
The hidden instigators of selling season are also its biggest beneficiaries -- the agents. It's their annual sure thing, since each network is guaranteed to make 100 deals. Lurie, Anders and Yost were all prompted into their TV deals by their agents, those most aware of the industry clock. The film business, the agent's other source of income, is never as regular and punctual. 
"Every year, my agent asks me if I have anything to pitch," Yost says in his cozy office, scattered with wind-up toys, in Monterey, Calif., where he lives with his wife and two children. It's an idyllic headquarters for a screenwriter, blocks from the harbor. ("We have horses on our property," he says. "Thank you, 'Speed."') But it's an impossible location for the potential executive producer of a TV show. Yost made a deal with his wife that if a good enough idea came along, one "worth disrupting our family for," he would move back to L.A. and fly up on weekends. When Yost's agent called, he had just finished his rewrite of the screenplay for "The Last Castle" and was casting around for a new project.
In addition to his film credits, Yost has written for the HBO miniseries "From the Earth to the Moon" and "Band of Brothers" and spent a handful of "bad, silent" weeks on ABC's "Full House" before he quit. (A day later, "Speed" sold.) While interviewing four vets about a battle for "Band of Brothers," he realized that each had a different account. "I thought, Wouldn't it be cool to see one event, back up and then see it again from a different view?" he says. "To do the 'Rashomon' thing, but not strictly the 'Rashomon' thing. I haven't even watched 'Rashomon,' and I'm not going to watch it until this show is dead."
By late January, Lurie, Anders and Yost all learned that their scripts got "pilot orders," but each took a slightly different form, which reveals how the networks can hedge their bets. "The Capital City," Lurie's show, got green-lighted as a two-hour pilot. "I think they assumed I would get a really strong cast and there would be an event around that," Lurie says. Two-hour pilots are also a way for the network to recover losses should the pilot not go to series -- it can be run as a movie of the week. (David Lynch's movie "Mulholland Falls," initially conceived as an episodic series, was designed as a two-hour pilot that was eventually nixed by ABC.) Except in Lurie's case, "The Capital City" script ends with its own beginning -- the young aide deciding to run for office -- which would make it hard to broadcast by itself. 
Yost's prismatic "Boomtown" would be shot as a standard 44-minute pilot (the length of a show without ads) to be directed by Jon Avnet, a filmmaker ("Fried Green Tomatoes" and "Up Close and Personal"), not by Yost. "I don't have that kind of juice yet," Yost says. CBS ordered "In the Echo" as a 25-minute "presentation," somewhere between a preview and the show itself. Since pilot season is a financial bath for the networks, they have begun trimming budgets and length. While standard hourlong pilots run $2.5 million to $3 million, presentations cost $1.8 million to $2.2 million. 
Anders wasn't phased by CBS's call. The funds for just the presentation of "In the Echo" were still better than her entire budget for "Things Behind the Sun." "It's like making a demo for a record company," she says. "I'm sure bands say, 'Why can't we just do the record?' But it makes it more manageable for the network." 
Not everyone agrees with Anders, though. David Janollari, an executive producer of "In the Echo," argues that presentations are "severely handicapping" to a show's chances of making the schedule. "A 50- to 60-page pilot script gets cut to 25 to 40 pages," he says. "Inevitably things get lost and truncated, and you don't have all the tools to sell it to the networks." If a presentation gets picked up, the hedged bet doesn't end up saving money, he adds. "In success, a presentation probably costs more than a regular pilot because you have to shoot more. In failure, it's much cheaper, much less risky."
As investments go, television shows are long shots. So the risk needs to be divvied up. Studios, like Warner Brothers or DreamWorks, make the shows, and networks, like ABC or NBC, license them through an improbable system called "deficit financing," in which the networks pay a fee for the program that amounts to 70 to 80 percent of the cost of making it. The studio covers the remainder. If, for example, a 30-minute sitcom costs about $1.6 million a week to produce, the network might pay $1.2 million to run it, with the studio fronting the other $400,000. (The studio's costs could go up to $700,000 a week for an hourlong drama.) It works like this partly because it works like this -- It's an age-old system, and it's not going to change," one executive told me -- but also because it's the best technique to coerce the studios to develop good shows and not just mindless fodder. 
Studios see no real rewards for their investment until four years out, when a show hits its transfiguring 88th episode. This is variously referred to as "the mother lode," "the jackpot" or "Valhalla" and is why everyone gets involved in television. With 88 episodes available to sell, studios can syndicate the show to local stations and overseas. A successful comedy can garner $2 million an episode, and a single hit underwrites years of failures. "Everyone wants that because you hear about these huge checks," Yost says. "But the motivating thing has to be the work." Anything less than four years is a waste, Janollari says: "You don't want to be in the business of making shows that run two or three years and disappear or you're losing money hand over fist."
One reason sitcoms survive despite the limitations of the form -- like disposable plots or lack of character development -- is that these are precisely what make them ideal for syndication. They can be run back to back in any order at any time, the caulking of television. This is why some shows, like UPN's "Moesha," crawl along the bottom of the Nielsens -- and cross the syndication threshold, and six years of irrelevance pay off. 
Once the networks order pilots, the crush begins. "There are 50 pilots competing for the same pool of actors, the same pool of directors, the same stages," Janollari says. "It's a feeding frenzy." Networks demand total involvement. Actors in "holding deals" can end up cycling through pilots like human reruns until one goes. George Clooney was cast in 15 failed pilots before "E.R." went to series in 1994. Don Johnson was in five before "Miami Vice." Every year, an actor comes out of nowhere and brings a bidding war with him. Lurie was asked by ABC to consider a young actor for the male love interest. "ABC really wanted this guy. So did NBC. And CBS. And Fox," Lurie says. "This is a kid who had no track record whatsoever -- and his price was astronomical. He asked for his points. I said, 'Is this Tom Cruise?' I found myself trying to get this guy, and I had no clue why." (Ultimately, the deal fell through.)
To play the young Congressional candidate on "The Capital City," Lurie picked Leslie Bibb, a 28-year-old star from WB's defunct "Popular." "She blew the doors off," Lurie says. The lead in "In the Echo," the probation officer, went to Marcia Gay Harden, who starred on "The Education of Max Bickford," which made its debut last fall but did not make it to the next season. The ensemble drama "Boomtown" relied less on any specific star as on an array of stars. Yost wrote one detective role for Donnie Wahlberg, a "Band of Brothers" alum, who accepted. But casting the district attorney, a pivotal character who opens the show with a news conference, proved difficult. At the last minute, Yost remembered Neal McDonough from "Band of Brothers," and they brought him in.
Usually, when an actor "goes to network," he performs in a small room with dozens of executives jammed around him. There is 30 seconds of chitchat and introductions, and then the actor has one quick shot to show what he can do. "Neal went through the whole thing like a politician, even doing the thumb thing with his hand," Yost says. "He finishes his line, nods and walks out. There was no chitchat, no nothing. The door shuts behind him, and Jeff Zucker" -- president of NBC Entertainment -- said, 'Start shooting."'
In March and early April, Yost and Avnet, the director, spent 15 days shooting in downtown Los Angeles. Just blocks away, in Echo Park, Anders spent eight days. Lurie flew his cast and crew to Richmond, Va., for 17 days. The shows were edited, the titles fiddled with -- In the Echo" became "Saints and Sinners" because the network thought the former was too obscure -- and they were delivered the last two weeks of April. 
Then Yost got a call from NBC -- Jeff Zucker wanted an additional scene in the "fourth act." Two stray characters who had essentially been abandoned early in the script needed to be brought back in at the end to make a tidy package, he said. "Everyone's lives had ended a month before," Yost says. "But in two hours we had half the crew back." 
Zucker's recommendations turned a smart, if standard, police procedural into a remarkable bit of narrative engineering. Yost was not deterred by this 11th-hour intervention and considered the crash of collaboration "incredibly fun," as if he were playing an elaborate game that is satisfying specifically because it plays fast and you don't play alone. 
Anders, however, was understandably strung out by the pace. By the time she was done, she says, "I was so tired, I was, like, 'Whatever."' Texturally, her show has her indelible signature, suffused with music from the Hives, the Flying Burrito Brothers and Sonic Youth and more diversity in the cast than practically anywhere else on TV. But at 40 minutes in length, "Saints and Sinners" is not, by any stretch, a presentation. Anders committed to making the emotional intersection of her probation officer and kid authentic. In doing so, she did in 8 days what everyone else did in about twice as long. Still, Anders felt constrained by the cumbersome bureaucracy of television -- the big crews, the necessity of securing proper permits for everything. "I kept hearing, 'Do it guerrilla, do it guerrilla-style,' but I wasn't really able to do what I could have done with the smaller crew and a couple of digital video cameras."
Every pilot gets "tested" -- this is an essential part of the pilot season, since it is as scientific as any unscientific industry gets. It is the networks' chance to check their instinct against audiences. 
In April 2001, to escape L.A.'s "contaminated sample" -- too many locals are either employed by the television industry or incredibly cynical about it -- CBS opened a testing facility in Las Vegas, at the MGM Grand, called Television City. Every demographic plays there, and test screeners can be lured with $10 gift certificates for CBS pens and "Letterman" caps. It's a modest operation, with two screening rooms for program testing and two focus-group rooms. Securing diverse preview audiences here isn't hard. "In every 200 people, we have over 30 states represented," says David Poltrack, head of research at CBS, who created the Television City center. "You can find people who stay at Motel 6 and eat at buffets or people who are staying at Bellagio." 
When I visit the drab testing rooms, in each one four rows of chairs are aligned with desktop monitors, facing a large-screen television on an altar. Here, each screener first encounters the Dial, the most storied and lasting component of television research. It's really more of a paddle with a small dial at the top and an L.E.D. screen that currently reads 50 -- zero means "tune out" and 100 "riveting." The dial is used to get instantaneous feedback on how screeners are responding to the show, moment by moment. For all our years of listening to television, this is our one moment to talk back.
An attendant plays that day's first pilot -- Abby," a sitcom about a young black woman who breaks up with her arrogant white boyfriend but continues to live with him. It was implausible and oddly cruel, but I gave it points for the interracial relationship: my dial rode at 20 the entire time, except for the sly sexual references that earned it a brief 30. After the show, each screener answers questions on the touch-screen monitors. "Was 'Abby' a) silly in a good way, b) silly in a bad way, c) boring, d) competent," the monitor asks, as if communicating that "Abby"'s "competence" was somehow relevant. The questionnaire probes for some biographical materials but, surprisingly, nothing about income. "People are less willing to give you their income, or they exaggerate it," Poltrack says. "The real defining characteristic is education. The guy who makes $1 million who never graduated from college watches TV like other people who never graduated from college."
The dial results reflect the lowest common denominator, and they are consulted with Talmudic attention. "The studio keeps saying, 'Don't worry about the test results,"' says Marc Frydman, Lurie's producing partner. "But then all you hear about are the test results." Leslie Bibb of "The Capital City" tested "off the charts," not because she's a smart actor with good comic timing but probably because the show features the former model in a shower scene. Even the quickest flash of skin sends the dial upward. The technology can track male versus female responses, and a scene in which one senator slaps another rated high with men -- All the guys went up; they loved it," Lurie says -- and not with women, who much preferred Bibb's first kiss. Anders found that the dial responses matched her own suspicions. "We knew the show was a little tattered at the end, and audiences were lost in an area that I already knew was structurally problematic," she says. "It helped to switch things around."
Only one show testing in Las Vegas that day, CBS's "Presidio Med," would make it to the fall schedule. Created by the "E.R." producing team of John Wells and Lydia Woodward, it's an example of a perfect test-group show in that it is, at heart, just like other television shows. It's a hoary rule of research that shows test the best when they feel familiar or remind people of other shows. "Presidio Med" is blatantly "E.R." in San Francisco with an all-female cast and better light. It has a near-identical pace and throbbing music during the infant resuscitation. But despite my best defenses, "Presidio Med" worked on me. When the rousing Dido song surged at the end, I found myself moved and teary-eyed. In front of me, three young black women rammed their dials up to 100 and turned to one another, saying, "This show is the best." The three college-age males behind me had their dials at zero and looked bored. I looked down at my own dial. It was still at 50.
That disjunction, that I never moved my dial at all during a show I loved, reveals the limitations of the technology. When we don't respond to a show, we're trained to turn the channel, to disengage. When we're engrossed, we pay attention, and turning a dial is utterly unintuitive. For all the money pumped into the facility, the technology can't exactly tell what works, only what doesn't. "The negative is more important than the positive," Poltrack admits. "We want to find out what it is that really turns you off about a show and where did you lose interest. If you get a show like 'C.S.I.,' you have this gradual buildup. But if you were to visually look at its dial chart, you wouldn't see a lot going on. People are not saying, 'I'm gradually getting more engrossed; I'm going to keep turning the dial.' It doesn't work like that."
By the second week in May, the news leaks out about the killed pilots, and when that happens, as a writer-creator you either disconnect or you grieve. In the spring of 2000, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Jack Black made a pilot for Fox called "Heat Vision and Jack," which was summarily killed. The show was written and created by two 20-something comic-book writers, Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon, who came to Los Angeles in a turnip truck from Milwaukee. If it can be said that there are "victims" of pilot season, these two are it, and the failure of "Heat Vision and Jack" is a kind of cautionary tale for what happens during pilot season, which is that creative people begin to care about their projects, and that is a dangerous thing. "We wrote this joyful story as a joke," says the bearded 29-year-old Harmon, "and we got tricked into caring so much."
Within the television world, "Heat Vision and Jack" is considered one of the best pilots that never made it. Directed by Stiller, it is the comedic story of an astronaut (Black) who was exposed to "inappropriate" levels of solar radiation and travels the world with his talking motorcycle, Heat Vision (the voice of Wilson). Heat Vision has been fused with the spirit of his slacker roommate, just as "Heat Vision and Jack" has been fused with the spirit of "Knight Rider," "Manimal" and every other schlock action-adventure television program you can name. 
Fox executives raved about it until they saw it. It tested poorly. It was "too smart for the room." When the creators got the news of its demise, "I went out into the parking lot and cried like a baby," says the 32-year-old Schrab. Over lunch, he pulls out a scrapbook of all his "Heat Vision" memorabilia, including sketches for Jack's costume and fonts for the title sequence. Looking at this scrapbook, it's plain that even though "Heat Vision"'s life ended two years ago, it is very much alive for its creators. In one way, it actually is alive -- the studio that initially financed the pilot is now developing a film version but without Stiller, Wilson, Black or Schrab and Harmon. Schrab and Harmon still get advised in meetings with executives, "Let's not 'Heat Vision and Jack' this," as if making something that you loved were a problem. It's a bitter lesson, says the now reclusive Harmon. "I was lured out into the world, and they hit me over the head with a hammer."
On Friday, May 11, Yost went into his office, and the answering machine had nine messages advising that he would find out the fate of "Boomtown" in 30 minutes. Two hours later, the network called. "It was very anticlimactic," Yost says. "They said: 'Pack your bags. We'll see you in New York on Monday."'
"Boomtown," which is scheduled to run at 10 p.m. on Sundays, got an order for 13 episodes. Like most television shows, the network would wait to see how it fared in the fall and then order "the back nine" episodes for spring should it hold up. Yost would be committed for two years. "It's a very happy prison sentence," he says.
"The Capital City" and "Saints and Sinners" did not make the fall schedule, though officially both are held as potential midseason replacements, a way of softening the blow. "Sometimes you get the call, 'We're not going to pick you up,"' Janollari says. "We didn't get that call." Contracts make it possible for networks to order shows into production all the way into December, so the creators are kept on retainer. The reasons for not getting picked up are manifold, and a strong point of view can even work against you. This year, ABC has taken steps to make its programming more family-friendly; "The Capital City" portrays premarital sex and a bombing raid in Colombia by the United States military. "In the beginning of the year, the network might be looking for family shows, and then halfway through the year when their family shows aren't doing well, they might decide they don't want them," says Rick Rosen, a partner of the Endeavor talent agency, which represents Aaron Sorkin and David E. Kelley. "Or they can have too many good pilots for too few slots. It can be so many things."
Lurie says he had hoped to be midseason anyway, so his show "could avoid the thousand herds in the fall" and the competition for press. Though he doesn't have the official green light, ABC has let him know the show is still in the loop for consideration.
The possibility of a resurrection for "Saints and Sinners" is less likely, since Anders herself already talks about it in the past tense and CBS isn't calling. In her sun-drenched living room, Anders reclines on her couch and points out the bronzed Peabody Award she just won for "Things Behind the Sun." She shakes her head at the paradox of her nearly simultaneous recognition and rejection. There's a genuine sadness to her voice about the fate of "Saints and Sinners." This is because she did with the show what she does with her art, and that is to open up. "Saints and Sinners" is a show about her neighborhood, her son, one daughter's dyslexia and the other daughter's musical ambition. It was a show about Allison Anders, and to fail with it is to feel, justifiably, judged. "I'll show it to my mother and some friends, and that will be it," Anders says with a sigh. "Ruben will always have it."
Filmmakers are expected to care about their films -- it is the only way to commit 15 months to a single script, a lone idea. Television executives, meanwhile, prepare a spray of good ideas, hoping one or two will hit, comfortable with the creative sloppiness. It's a brutal process, but even Anders is hooked. "I've learned so much," she says. "I definitely want to do it again."

HEADLINE: In Following a Dream, A Bit of Reality Helps 

BYLINE:  By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
THE success stories are enticing: Lawyer chucks it all to become a circus clown. Investment banker moves to Tuscany to grow olives, get a life. Hard-driving high-tech manager opens an ostrich farm, lives happily ever after.
 It never hurts to dream, especially when you're in a rut at work. With jobs scarce, the temptation for the resume to stray in other directions is great. Moreover, close to half of all baby boomers are now in their 50's, many itching to fulfill a youthful ambition before it is too late. Why not pursue that hankering to become a singer in a mariachi band, or a ski instructor in Switzerland? 
 Not so fast, says John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm. "In most cases, we try to convince people not to make a radical change. Most go after it for the wrong reason, and they don't understand the ramifications in terms of money and position of authority." 
Sometimes, they are just sick of doing the same old thing and yearn to try something new. Sometimes, they have been laid off and can't find jobs in their fields, and so shop around in unfamiliar terrain. And sometimes, especially since Sept. 11, they want to do something more meaningful.
But unless they have done a lot of research, their experiment can backfire. "Often, people who choose a whole new career have to go back to entry level," Mr. Challenger said. "The result is that after a few years, they wish they hadn't done it."
Or maybe after a few days. Joe Bierman, 42, vice president for marketing in Manhattan for Sephora, the cosmetics retailer, did not have to take a cut in pay or position when he switched from a marketing career at Avon to a sales position at Fairchild Publications in 1999. He had just received his M.B.A., and after 10 years in the cosmetics business, wanted something new. 
But he realized right away that he did not like sales. "It is just enormously focused on a single thing -- closing that sale," Mr. Bierman said. "Publishing could have been more lucrative, but marketing used my creative skills more. I'd wake up in the morning with the feeling of not being challenged." Less than a year later, he was back in marketing, and happy again.
For many people, of course, switching careers can be liberating. Although the government does not track how often Americans do it, it calculates that they change jobs at least eight times on average by the time they are 55, so they do have some practice in starting over again.
And a study released in April by DBM, a human resources consulting and outplacement firm in New York, found that 72 percent of unemployed professionals changed industries (but not necessarily professions) in 2001, up from 52 in 1999, while 16 percent went into business for themselves, up from 7 percent three years ago.
Beth Burdick, managing consultant for DBM, has noticed an increase in the number of laid-off executives considering career changes lately. "Losing a job allows people time and space to reflect on their life," she said. "I'm hearing many people say things like, 'I had a really good career as a software engineer, but I want to do something different with my life.' "
But, she warns, they shouldn't make such a move lightly. "If you're thinking of doing something completely different, you have to go out and collect data," Ms. Burdick said. "If you want to run a bed and breakfast, spend time with people who do this. It's more than just serving tea and cookies, smiling and handing someone a map. Be there when there's a guest who's not happy, no matter what you do."
Sometimes a person will have the bright idea of making a business out of a hobby, she says, only to find that it loses its charm when it becomes a money-making proposition. "I knew a senior-level program manager in high tech who liked gardening, so she took a job with a landscaper," she said. "But she found that although she liked gardening, she didn't want to do it eight hours a day."
Some people mistake their dislike of an unpleasant aspect of their job, like a surly boss or a grinding corporate culture, for an aversion to the job itself. Change the setting, and they're fine, Ms. Burdick says.
Other people learn that a steep drop in income that they initially accepted as a trade-off for a job they love "is too much of a sacrifice," she said. "They may end up getting pressure from their family. If you have to worry every time you go to Starbucks whether you can afford it or not, is it worth it?"
In some cases, making the round trip from one career to another and then back again can take decades. Rena Thorsen, 50, of Basking Ridge, N.J., left a 60-hour-a-week job that she loved as a merchandising manager for Bamberger's department store 25 years ago for a 9-to-5 job giving training courses for corporations so that she could spend more time with her four children. "I switched to the corporate world so I could have regular hours, weekends and holidays off," she said. "But it was never the love of my life. I did it because I had to." 
Last year, the online education company Ms. Thorsen worked for closed and she began looking for another job in the same field. Then Sept. 11 happened. "Why aren't I doing what I love to do?" she asked herself. With her children grown, Ms. Thorsen decided it was time to return to her roots. In February, she and some partners opened iforstyle.com, which enables women entrepreneurs to sell jewelry, cosmetics and other goods online.
It was also a search for a saner existence that led Fernando Urroz, 51, of San Jose, Calif., to make the switch in 1988 from the world of high technology to the restaurant business. Mr. Urroz was a senior business consultant for Hewlett-Packard, traveling often and commuting more than an hour each way. 
"My wife and I had one child then, and we said there has to be a better life than this," he recalled. Since Mr. Urroz had worked as a chef before getting his computer science degree, the couple decided to buy a restaurant in Healdsburg, a small town north of the city, in Sonoma County.
The restaurant was so successful that their dream of a laid-back life quickly faded. Mr. Urroz spent seven days a week there, barely able to see his three children. The pressure was almost worse than it had been in the field that he had fled. "We were featured in Gourmet magazine once, and I remember a woman walking in with a photo of a particular dish from the magazine, saying, 'I want this,' " he said. When he arrived in Healdsburg, he bought a mahogany-hulled speedboat so he could go fishing on Sonoma Lake. It stayed in the garage. By the time the recession hit in the early 1990's and business fell off, the couple was almost relieved.
In 1995, Mr. Urroz sold the restaurant and then spent a year consulting, studying up on all the technology he had missed while he was a chef. Finally, he landed a job with Hewlett- Packard again as a regional sales and marketing manager.
"We joke that we had to slow our lives down by going back into high tech," he said. "I was back to 10-to-12-hour days; I had weekends and evenings off; I could take vacations. It was great."
In 2000, he left Hewlett to take a job with LSI Logic Storage Systems, but was laid off early this year. He has been approached about going back to the restaurant business, but one detour on the road to happiness was enough for Mr. Urroz. "I wouldn't go back to doing that," he said. "I love my family too much."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
If the Chair Fits (or Challenges), Settle In and Listen

BYLINE:  By WENDY PERRON; Wendy Perron is a senior fellow at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at the New School University.

 BODY:
ON a weekday afternoon last month, three 10-year-old girls were hanging out at the Langston Hughes Community Library and Cultural Center in Corona,, Queens, talking about capital punishment. They had just spent an hour with the installation "A Chair Is a Throne Is a Freedom Fighter's Camp Stool," moving from seat to seat and listening on headsets to stories on CD's. Chair No. 17 represents an electric chair, and the sound track tells of a young man who, in 1946, simply would not die from electrocution. Spurred by this bit of history, the girls debated the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, last year. 
 "They should throw him in jail and starve him to death," Johanna Sanchez said. 
 But Michelle Franco argued: "It doesn't really matter if you kill him. The people he blew up aren't going to come back to life." 
Jerri Allyn, the artist and educator who created the installation, called Chair No. 17 "the darkest chair." Of the 21 chairs in the show, which is now in the Port Richmond Library in Staten Island until Thursday and then travels to Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, describe people who have solved conflicts peacefully. (Ms. Allyn calls them "portraits.") Words silk-screened on the seats inform viewers of alternatives to violence: from the therapeutic power of art to a "Bikes Not Bombs" program for teenagers; from Gandhi's civil disobedience to Nelson Mandela's restorative justice.
The chairs are made of walnut, birch, mahogany and other woods. Some are cube shaped like Donald Judd's furniture, with right angles, pleasing proportions and hard seats. Others have scooped out seats in the African tradition, while still others resemble triangular Mexican stools. As the seat -- or site -- of an idea, each chair and audio portrait allows the viewer, in Ms. Allyn's words, "to sink into another person's world." (The sound design is by Helene Rosenbluth.)
Once you sit on one of these chairs and put on the earphones, you want to close your eyes and absorb Ms. Allyn's narrative. Her voice -- urgent, plaintive, lilting into awe or wonder -- carries you from a terrain of violence into a terrain of hope. Sitting in Chair No. 2, a half-moon poplar stool, one hears about a South African tribe's custom of encircling a ne'er-do-well and showering him with compliments. Then Ms. Allyn relates her own effort to apply this ritual in a classroom, which ends with the class bully beaming happily.
As a ceramics major at the San Francisco Art Institute in the 70's, Ms. Allyn never bought the myth of the artist as a lone genius; she hungered for a connection to the outside world. 
"I was a really good art student," she recalled. "I went to all the exhibits the teachers told us to go to. Who I saw there were other artists, instructors and students. I didn't see the public. I wasn't interested in being isolated or ghettoized within the art world."
She was attracted to minimalism for its meditative qualities but felt it was limited. "I remember at the institute we were all taken up to the roof, where somebody had put up a neon piece that said, 'Art Is.' There's an aspect of the art world that is art about art. In my early days I just hated it." 
In the mid-70's, the Feminist Studio Workshop, housed in the Woman's Building in Los Angeles, generated a surge of activity in performance art and new media. The founding artists rejected the male-oriented hierarchy of the art world and championed collaboration and accessibility. Suzanne Lacy, a magnet in that milieu who later became known for large-scale urban performances, crossed disciplines to highlight issues like violence against women. 
"The Feminist Studio Workshop taught that art doesn't just pop from nowhere, that it develops within a political and economic context," said Ms. Allyn, who assisted Ms. Lacy in many projects. "The questions were, 'What are you trying to say, and who do you want to say it to?' That shifted everything for me." She found a freedom to experiment with different media and to draw thematic material from life experience. The feminist credo "The personal is political" was a driving force. 
Teaming up with other women, Ms. Allyn formed a performance-art group called the Waitresses, making use of the metaphor of women as servers. Since all of the women had waited on tables, the art-and-life connection was strong. 
The art historian Arlene Raven, a founder of the workshop, recalled: "They made amazing performances in restaurants, where you didn't see art performed. It was startling, new and very fresh. Jerri was the conceptual power behind some of that activity. She has a strong social consciousness that she was able to translate into her art." Ms. Raven also praised the originality of Ms. Allyn's voice -- her "Jerriness."
Ms. Lacy recalled a 1979 event: "My favorite image is the Waitresses All City Marching Band. It was hysterical -- 40 women in white waitress uniforms with red aprons!" (This band, in which Ms. Raven played kazoo, was in the DooDah Parade, an alternative to the Rose Bowl Parade.)
As a member of Sisters of Survival, a performance-art group with an antinuclear message, Ms. Allyn wore a nun's habit and danced the twist. From there it was a short skip to work for Lily Tomlin in the 80's, helping her with research on a book project. Ms. Allyn admired what she called Ms. Tomlin's "vision of promoting eccentric individuals."
Groups like the Waitresses and Sisters of Survival were inspired by the workshop, but they also trace their artistic lineage to avant-garde artists like Allan Kaprow, who helped invent the "happenings" of the 1960's. 
Choosing libraries as sites for her work reflects Ms. Allyn's desire to bring art into people's daily lives. She has staged performances in her bed (for seven days), in a dairy restaurant, at the Los Angeles City Hall and in outdoor plazas. Each performance is at least partly shaped by the participants. "A Chair" is still evolving, with five seats left undesignated, awaiting material that Ms. Allyn is gathering from the audience in each borough about a local peacemaker.
As an artist who uses words, Ms. Allyn feels an affinity for Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger, especially when their subject is abuse of power. But whereas the messages of those two artists can be ambiguous or cryptic, Ms. Allyn aims to lead the viewer to action. "I'm almost obsessed with letting people know that there are a lot of resources out there," she said, "things we can learn, from personal strategies all the way up to international diplomatic solutions." 
Ms. Allyn, who trains New York City public school teachers in integrating the arts into the curriculum, says she wants "A Chair" to extend eventually beyond the five boroughs, perhaps even to the Middle East. "I am such a small fry that it seems completely insane," she said. "Why do I think this can really effect any change?" 
Answering her own question, she points to herself as an example of transformation through art. "I was born into trouble," said Ms. Allyn, who is 50 and whose parents divorced when she was 7. "I moved 21 times by the time I was 21. In the 10th grade I was running away on weekends, sleeping on the floor of the Port Authority. I was an unwed mother at 18 and placed my son with an adoptive family because I could barely take care of myself." 
But the impulse to create was instilled at an early age. Her mother, an interior designer, and her father, a woodworker, engaged her in art projects at every opportunity. Another plus, she says, was being brought up as a Quaker. "The Quaker community was the one place that was stable in my life," she said. "They taught me a profound sense of social consciousness."
Ms. Allyn identifies with children who are considered "at risk" and reaches out to them in "A Chair" with workshops and discussions. (A full schedule can be found on www.interactionarts.org.) The installation, which is sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, a nonprofit group, will visit libraries in all five boroughs by September.
Ms. Allyn knows the challenge of finding one's way to nonviolence. Being able "to talk something through, rather than blast someone with my anger" has taken her years to learn. "If I can figure this out, anyone can," she said. 
In words chanted during the narrative of Chair No. 4, she credits art with being a catalyst for change: "Art never leaves you where it found you."

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
New Operas Are Booming, But the Bold Aren't Heard

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
AMERICAN orchestras may be grappling with dwindling audiences and the indifference of the young, but opera companies are doing quite well. Attendance, overall, is up. It's not that the general directors of opera companies have been boldly reinventing what they do. The public just seems more interested in opera.
 One reason, certainly, is the adoption of supertitles or other text projection systems by virtually every American opera house. The technology has demystified the genre. All of a sudden, even neophytes get it: "Ah, opera is theater! I can just sit back and take in the show." 
 What's more, titles may be fostering the most important trend in opera today: a notable increase in the commissioning and presentation of new works. This assertion may seem a stretch, since most new works reaching American houses have English librettos. Yet as younger, eager audiences have been enticed into the opera house by supertitles, the natural curiosity for the new that exists among fans of theater, dance and film has affected operagoers as well. 
More new works are being developed and produced at America's opera houses than at any time since the post-World War II period, when a contemporary-opera boomlet was fostered by general economic prosperity and a serious commitment to the performing arts among corporations, private foundations and even television networks (until the rocking 60's declared high culture elitist). Savvy administrators have noticed the growing openness to new works and responded in their programming. And that's great.
What's not so great, however, is the timidity of their choices, which has resulted in a lot of earnest but forgettable works. General managers gravitate to composers who hew to what are deemed accessible musical styles: lush neo-Romanticism, folksy Americana, a halfhearted Minimalism that rejects the truly radical repetitiveness of the early, and best, operas by Philip Glass. Commissions tend to go not to bold composers but to marketable projects.
There are "Masterpiece Theater" operas, like Stephen Paulus's musically staid "Summer," introduced by the Berkshire Opera in 1999 and revived this month by the Center for Contemporary Opera in New York. There are operatic spinoffs from plays and films, like Andre Previn's "Streetcar Named Desire," which was unveiled at the San Francisco Opera in 1998. Though Mr. Previn's score, true to form, was harmonically rich, lyrically opulent and tellingly orchestrated, the music did not begin to match the impact and poetry of the Tennessee Williams play or its classic film version, directed by Elia Kazan.
But at least Mr. Previn was a veteran composer. The San Francisco Opera knew what it was getting and gave him lots of leeway. These days it's more typical for a company, worried about alienating its audience, to seek out a less experienced composer willing to be an obliging member of a large production team.
Stewart Robertson, the music director and principal conductor of the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., and of the Florida Grand Opera in Miami, concedes that companies have been too wary. "A lot of what is being commissioned and performed is, frankly, very conservative," he said recently. Company administrators have been a bit myopic, he added. "They tend to think of the operatic world only, and not what else is being done in music in orchestras and chamber ensembles."
Still, the status quo is changing, he said. The Florida Grand Opera will open its new house in 2004 with the premiere of a work based on Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" by David Carlson, a California composer Mr. Robertson believes in.
Two new American operas are enjoying widespread success. Mark Adamo's "Little Women," based on the Louisa May Alcott novel, was introduced by the Houston Grand Opera in 1998. Jake Heggie's "Dead Man Walking," based on Sister Helen Prejean's book about a Louisiana execution (though the devastating film directed by Tim Robbins was the real impetus), had its debut at the San Francisco Opera in 2000. So far, 16 companies have picked up one or the other of these works. "Little Women" arrives at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 6; "Dead Man Walking" opens at the Cincinnati Opera on July 11. Both come to the New York City Opera next season.
It's remarkable to see two new American operas on such a roll. Yet, musically, I want more from new operas than these scores provide. Mr. Adamo understands the voice and has an instinctive sense of dramatic pacing. But, musically, he takes a self-conscious tack in adapting the novel. In the scenes of daily domesticity, his music is beguilingly lyrical. In reflective monologues and scenes driven by plot, he spikes his language with 12-tone elements to give the music some gnarly anxiety, to reveal the angst and erotic stirrings within the restless sisters. But the atonal passages sound heavy-handed. Less is more in this score. The simpler, sweetly tonal music is the most satisfying.
I did not see the San Francisco production of "Dead Man Walking," which, by all reports, was boldly theatrical. My impressions of Mr. Heggie's ambitious score come from the live recording on the Erato label. Before this work, Mr. Heggie was known for songs that artfully flatter the human voice. Here he shows a gift for melodic writing and laces his tonal language with shards of dissonance and jazzy riffs. His polyglot style, beholden to Bernstein, incorporates vernacular song and dance.
But the polemics and horror that permeate this story would daunt a greater composer than he. The massed crowd scenes just sound congested. As Bernard Holland, who reviewed the premiere for The New York Times, put it, when the big ensembles "do take on a certain power" in the last scenes, "credit more the raw, visceral drama surrounding the music, less the music itself."
Opera companies, like major orchestras, forever say that it's their risk-averse audiences who balk at challenging contemporary fare. But what happened when the New York City Opera celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1993 with three premieres on three consecutive nights? The hit of the series was not Ezra Laderman's stylistically muddled "Marilyn" (about the last years of Marilyn Monroe's life) or Lukas Foss's charming but slight children's opera, "Griffelkin." It was Hugo Weisgall's biblical opera "Esther."
Weisgall's score was craggy, dense, saturated with dissonance -- and completely riveting. Here was an uncompromising, impassioned musical voice. The audience sat rapt, then cheered Weisgall, 81 at the time, ecstatically. Why has the City Opera not brought the work back?
Opera is drama, yes, but drama driven by music, which is why innumerable works in the repertory move and thrill us despite having pronounced dramatic flaws. Like Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra," with its Bermuda Triangle of an opera plot: sail in, and you may never find your way out. Yet Verdi's gravely beautiful music somehow ennobles the opera's ill-defined characters.
EUROPEAN companies have been far more willing to commission formidable composers. The Finnish-born Kaija Saariaho had a major success at the Salzburg Festival in 2000 with "L'Amour de Loin," which receives its American premiere next month at the Santa Fe Opera. Ms. Saariaho provided a mystical, richly hued and intriguingly complex score to a fascinating French libretto by Amin Maalouf about a young prince in 12th-century Aquitaine. Sick at heart from his pampered life, he falls into idealized love with a countess in Tripoli whose virtue and beauty he has only heard about. Coming 10 months after Sept. 11, the opera's exploration of the cultural gulf between West and East should be newly meaningful.
Also in 2000, the Royal Danish Opera presented the premiere of Poul Ruders's opera based on Margaret Atwood's futuristic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," in which Christian evangelicals have taken control of a large swath of the wanton, environmentally wasted United States and established a male-controlled totalitarian regime. Though the opera is somewhat convoluted, Mr. Ruders, an audaciously inventive composer, has written a wildly compelling score. The work receives its American premiere at the Minnesota Opera next year.
Music is paramount in the operas of the British composer Judith Weir, like her brilliant 1987 work, "A Night at the Chinese Opera," a play within a play about a group of Chinese actors forced into labor during the reign of Kublai Khan. Even if it were not so theatrically imaginative, Ms. Weir's music would captivate you. Listen to the first 30 seconds of the 1999 recording on the MMC label, and you start thinking: "What are those weird, slashing, wondrous orchestral chords? How did she do that?"
I'm not suggesting that only thorny musical languages have value. John Harbison, the composer of "The Great Gatsby," introduced by the Metropolitan Opera in 1999 and revived this spring, is essentially a pungently chromatic tonal composer. But he is a masterly technician and erudite musician whose voice is completely authentic, deftly drawing on the atonal rigor of his teacher Roger Sessions, on his own deep experience with sacred music and on an abiding love of early jazz.
Two projects on the horizon offer hope that American opera companies are ready to put more trust in strong composers. In 2004, the Glimmerglass Opera will give the premiere of Stephen Hartke's adaptation of a Guy de Maupassant story, "Boule de Suif," with a libretto by Philip Littell. The opera ("The Refugees" is its working title) concerns a sundry group of French people as they flee an enemy advance during the Franco-Prussian War. Mr. Hartke, 49, who teaches at the University of Southern California, has won acclaim for orchestral and chamber works that meld an astringent harmonic voice with fidgety rhythmic vitality and what could be called lucid complexity.
It surely helped in bringing about the commission that Mr. Hartke arrived at the bargaining table with part of his own commissioning fee: an award from the Institute for American Music, financed by the Howard Hanson estate and administered by the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. More critical was the presence at that table of Mr. Robertson, of Glimmerglass, a great admirer of Mr. Hartke's music. "Stephen's work," Mr. Robertson said, "while not wildly modern, has real compositional muscle to it."
Though this will be his first opera, Mr. Hartke has an ambitious agenda. "My opera will have no flashbacks, no outside narrator," he said in a recent interview, "none of those devices that smack of embarrassment with the medium of opera, of being unable to live with the unreality of the form." He is determined to avoid the "forced lyricism" that, he said, mars many operas of recent years.
In another heartening commission, the San Francisco Opera has asked Lewis Spratlan for a one-act work as part of its Aspects of Faust series, conceived by Pamela Rosenberg, the company's adventurous general director. Titled "Earthwise," with a libretto by Constance Congdon, a colleague of Mr. Spratlan's on the faculty of Amherst College, the opera tells of a scientist retiring from a research post who decides to select a successor from among three clones of herself.
Mr. Spratlan, 61, came to Ms. Rosenberg's attention through his opera "Life Is a Dream," based on the Spanish play by Pedro Calderon de la Barca. Inexplicably, the opera has never been produced despite snagging the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2000. It was commissioned by the New Haven Opera Theater, but by the time Mr. Spratlan completed it in 1978, the company had folded. For years he sought a production and was repeatedly turned down, no doubt, as he suggested in a recent conversation, because of the score's gritty atonal style.
"Opera company directors have made up their minds, wrongly I think, that the public is not interested in what might be called modernist music," Mr. Spratlan said. "The whole nature of our musical culture today is that we've passed by that ugly time of difficult works into a period of tunefulness and accessibility."
In 2000, the opera's second act was performed in a concert version, first at Amherst and then at Harvard. When it won the Pulitzer, Mr. Spratlan was elated, he said, thinking that "the sheer panache" of the prize would compel some company finally to produce the thing.
No such luck. It has apparently still proved too thorny for fearful general directors: a shame, for Mr. Spratlan's score is impressive. That the work is eminently performable despite its challenges was proved last month when the City Opera presented Act II as part of its Showcasing American Composers series, in which excerpts from new works and operas in progress are performed in open readings. With just one rehearsal under the conductor George Manahan, the singers and the City Opera orchestra gave a confident account of Mr. Spratlan's glittering score.
The City Opera would be a logical company to produce this honored work. It deserves credit for at least giving the piece some exposure. In just four years, the Showcasing American Composers series, now under the artistic guidance of Mr. Adamo, the company's current composer in residence, has become invaluable. Administrators, conductors and the operatically curious public can attend free readings and sample a roster of new works.
The venture has already produced success stories. Two years ago it presented excerpts from Scott Wheeler's "Democracy: An American Comedy," with a libretto by Romulus Linney based on novels by Henry Adams. In attendance were representatives of Placido Domingo and the Washington Opera, which Mr. Domingo runs. This exposure led to the unfinished work's being commissioned for the company's young artists program, which began operations in March.
Mr. Spratlan, though consoled by the San Francisco Opera commission, is "in calm despair" over the languishing fate of "Life Is a Dream," he said. Companies wary of music like his, he added, "should put more trust in audiences."
First they have to put more trust in composers. That overdue process may have begun.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Art Becomes an Instrument to Unearth Buried History

BYLINE:  By KAY LARSON 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
AT night on a heaving sea off the shore here, the Morris Island lighthouse seems to walk on water. Its sand spit is sinking and so is the post-Civil War lighthouse. At high tide the island disappears, and a needle of brick appears to float upright in a foaming blackness.
 The searchlight was dismantled 40 years ago, but in Kim Sooja's installation, "A Lighthouse Woman," for the Spoleto Festival USA the lighthouse itself glowed in colors from a bank of lights at its top. Starting with luminous cherry red and moving through spectral grape and the whole rainbow between, plus white, one color slowly faded into another, at a pace like breathing. 
 From a boat, with the lights of Charleston cut off by the curvature of the earth, the lighthouse seemed to join the parade of ghosts that inhabit this former slave port. No longer focused toward the ships it used to guide, the lighthouse now seemed to regard itself in the not-unpleasant glow of self-reflection. 
The meditative mood has infected the whole Spoleto art program, "Evoking History," which is on view through Aug. 4. (The music, theater and lighthouse phases of the festival ended on June 9.) The curator, Mary Jane Jacob, a white woman, has devised a three-year series of installations and community discussions, which is generating an impassioned conversation about art's potential for catalytic social activism. Some works from the initial series last year -- David Hammons's six-foot wide, two-story house, a project about gentrification, for example -- can still be seen in neighborhoods around town. Ms. Kim's lighthouse, and the other projects this year, have taken oblique aim at slavery and its complex legacy. 
The past is not hard to find in Charleston. Morris Island was the site of the 54th Massachusetts regiment's suicidal charge against a Confederate fort, memorialized in the movie "Glory." But hauntings these days are more often disembodied -- the parking lot that once held the auction block where slaves were sold, or the crumbling building where slaves were professionally whipped for a fee to shield the sensibilities of slave owners -- and buried in memory.
To excavate and heal, artists and curators have forged unusually intense bonds with local people, including two black sisters, Rebecca Campbell and Catherine Braxton, who grew up in a pair of decrepit houses that are the focus of a snowballing community oral-history movement. The community was Ansonborough, called the Borough, the poorest of the poor of Charleston, but a place of fierce loyalties and mutual aid. 
The Borough was nearly wiped off the map during recent urban renewal. What's left is a barren expanse of grass and the two empty houses, starkly picturesque with their red roofs, black shutters and peeling white clapboards: Edward Hopper meets Porgy and Bess. (DuBose Heyward set his 1927 novel, "Porgy," in a tenement on Cabbage Row off Church Street, morphed now into a tony boutique.)
An inheritance delivered the houses to Ms. Campbell, Ms. Braxton and a cousin. Last summer they were considering renovating, but something told them to wait, Ms. Campbell said. A month later, they got a call from Ms. Jacob and her co-curator, Tumelo Mosaka, a black South African bearing his own family history of displacement, who was moved to tears by the sisters' stories of their childhood. 
Nosing around, Ms. Jacob and Mr. Mosaka discovered a whole neighborhood, now vanished, existing only in the memories of its former inhabitants. Mr. Mosaka, who is living in town for the three years of the art program, began interviewing. "These people's sense of history is not what the city of Charleston is interested in," he said. "Somebody needs to break that silence."
As the oral-history project blossomed, Suzanne Lacy, a white California artist and practitioner of socially engaged art arrived in town to create an installation for Spoleto. She asked instead to turn one of the sisters' houses into a youth center and Borough history interviewing site, as a way of bearing aesthetic witness to the everyday life of ordinary people. 
The other house is temporarily home to "Cottage Industry," a textile and sewing project by J. Morgan Puett -- a white woman from Atlanta, now living in Pennsylvania. Ms. Puett has an archivist's passion for clothes and an improvisatory eye for their construction. She joked that she has compressed 300 years of fashion history into one set of garments, manufactured by seamstresses at the house. 
The clothes she presented in a wryly funky fashion show on a platform in front of the house did have the plantation persona -- not the Hollywood Tara look, but the cobbled-together air of the handmade and hard-pressed. Her models -- two young women, one black, one white -- were dressed in public by four others, provoking reflections of what it means to be unable to put on your own clothes.
The houses and the lighthouse serve as two points in the triangle of exhibitions called "The Memory of Water." The third point is the Drayton plantation, up river. The sisters' family is buried in the old slave graveyard at Drayton, which is now a historic-trust site. Ms. Kim -- a South Korean-born New York resident -- prepared a set of four carpets for the floor of the Drayton mansion. The carpets are black -- jarring within the 1742 mansion's faded pastels -- and in white are names of people from the Drayton inventories: Boat Jack, Dumplin, Poor G, Fatima, lad, girl, boy, African. Those with last names lived after the Civil War.
The carpets' simplicity has a bite. People step on them seemingly without seeing them. Your breath catches in your throat, as it does when the tour guide explains the history of the mansion and the graveyard without once uttering the word slave.
Does courtesy shade into denial? "Where is the history of African-Americans in Charleston?" Ms. Campbell said. "I want the truth." 
The barren ground that was the Borough appealed to two black artists: the Jamaica-born Nari Ward and the Martinique-born Marc Latamie, both now residents of Manhattan. Mr. Ward attempts a complicated metaphor involving a palmetto tree cast in a mixture of concrete and iron filings, enclosed by glass walls inscribed with fragments of interviews with Borough residents. The palmetto is shown at several stages of its life cycle. This palmetto "nursery," visibly rusting, refers perhaps too abstrusely to simultaneous growth and decay, but the sight of a 26-foot-tall iron tree in a hot field has its own startling appeal.
Growing up in Martinique, Mr. Latamie had a chance to muse on the global shipping routes that created both the slave trade and the current itinerant lifestyle of artists like himself, who ply their installations all over the world. In the Borough lot, he built a shack resembling his favorite corner store in Martinique and stocked it with the foods he grew up on -- all, except rum, manufactured in France for export.
Food for Mr. Latamie is a kind of ammunition in the global cultural and economic wars, speaking of nurture and of the will of those in power to withhold nurturing. So for his second work, a one-shot, he imported the Martinique master chef Jean-Charles Bredas and his assistant, Richardson Skinner, to Middleton Place, a plantation next door to Drayton. They served a fine island meal of spiced pork tenderloin, baked plantains and eggplant to the several dozen people -- local and not -- who had been talking all morning about art and education. The slave cabin outside the windows did not visibly curb any appetites.
The flow of outsiders may yet bring healing energies into Charleston -- perhaps altering the karma created by the first outsiders. The sisters may hail from the Borough, but they worked in New York for decades. As a social activist, Ms. Campbell said she is most proudof helping to establish the League of Women Voters in Harlem. The sisters had never paid attention to the arts, but now they are so involved they took Mr. Latamie shopping to stock his store. 
"I didn't know about installation," said Ms. Campbell, the more talkative of the sisters. "I'm learning all the technology. It's beautiful." 
Charleston resists its past, said Edward Ball, a local white resident and winner of a National Book Award for "Slaves in the Family," a candid account of the Ball plantations. "There is a culture of intentional forgetting, purposeful forgetting, which is observed by both black people and white people," he said. "For black people, it's a traumatic memory that has to be controlled. They are reminded of it on a daily basis."
White southerners, he said, are convinced that their loss in the Civil War was as great as the suffering of black people in slavery. "Our sense of self and memory," he continued, "has to be asserted over every competing memory of the past, because it was so traumatic and painful."
Mr. Ball himself seems infected with an intelligent and observant sadness -- perhaps caused in part by his family's vehement response to his book. Some welcomed it, but most saw it as dangerous. A cousin warned Mr. Ball that if any harm came to his two young daughters as a result of the book, he would hold its author personally responsible.
Ms. Campbell and Ms. Braxton are energized rather than cowed. They have vowed to continue the oral-history project and to memorialize the houses and the hidden life of black Charleston. 
"Believe me, Rebecca Campbell knows what she's doing," Ms. Campbell said of herself. "I've been in bigger projects than this." 
Retired now, with money, time and skills honed outside, these two insiders may yet turn Charleston inside out.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Stony Brook; 
A Hamlet Where History Stays Alive

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
STONY BROOK, a culturally and historically endowed residential hamlet of moderately priced to expensive houses in Suffolk County's town of Brookhaven, owes much to Ward Melville, the visionary philanthropist who strove in 1940 to reconstruct the village with a blend of housing, business and culture in a New England-like setting. 
 Mr. Melville's vision remains intact 62 years later in the crescent-shaped village center, regarded as the first planned shopping district in the country and the core of one of Long Island's outstanding public spaces. 
 The center, with more than 40 shops, restaurants and service businesses, looks down over a two-acre village green toward Stony Brook Harbor. At mid-crescent, a Federalist-style post office is topped by a mechanical eagle that flaps its wings on the hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mr. Melville, who headed the Melville Corporation, a major national footwear, apparel and drug retailer. insured the water view by buying up property and moving houses out of the way, relocating historic ones and razing others. 
In a stream of philanthropy over three decades, Mr. Melville also bought and renovated historic structures, including the Three Village Inn and a grist mill built about 1751; purchased 88 acres of wetlands where a marina was threatened; and, with his wife, Dorothy, established a museum. 
Most of the properties were bequeathed to the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, which remains the steward. A board of volunteer trustees and a paid president are in charge. The organization runs education programs, organizes seasonal family events and acts as landlord of the village center, which includes separate shopping areas called the Inner Court and Market Square. 
"There is very little you can do here or talk about that doesn't have something to do with Ward Melville," said Joyce Miraglia, the organization's community relations manager. The organization is also building a new educational and cultural center behind the Inner Court.
With the neighboring areas Setauket and Old Field, Stony Brook it is part of what is known as the Three Village area although Old Field is the only one that is actually a village. Stony Brook itself has two distinctly different sections. 
Lush, densely foliated and secluded, the residential areas along the winding and hilly roads in the hamlet's northern section are comforting to the eye. Older colonials and storybook cottages exude charm. Houses in the Southern sections, generally west of the Stony Brook campus of the State University and south of Route 25A, are newer, and the look is more typically suburban. 
The entire hamlet is within the Three Village Central School District, a highly regarded system that is a prime attraction for home buyers with children. Census figures show that more than 30 percent of residents moved in between 1995 and 2000.
The school district is also a common bond in the Three Villages area. "The schools are the unifying force; they tie everyone together," said Mitchell H. Pally, a school board member, vice president of governmental affairs for the Long Island Association and a Stony Brook resident for 16 years. 
As in many communities on Long Island, prices have been rising in the tight Stony Brook housing market despite the weakened national economy. "The mortgage rates are down, and there are a lot of buyers out there," said Andrea Kozlowsky, an associate broker at L. Ross Realty in Setauket. "There's just not that much inventory."
The $500,000 that Melville spent to reconstruct the village center would not be enough today to buy an older colonial near the water in the hamlet's northern part, where prices range from about $400,000 for cottages to well over $1 million for prime colonials. Newer homes in Forsythe Meadows, developed about 15 years ago, sell in the low $700,000's.
In the more affordable area of the hamlet south of Route 25A, Capes, ranches and colonials built by William Levitt beginning in the mid-1960's sold in the low $200,000's five years ago but now sell in the low to mid-$300,000's. The hamlet's median house price of just under $200,000 10 years ago is now only a memory. Rental houses go for $2,000 a month and up for three-bedrooms. 
There are no rental apartment complexes or co-ops. The Knolls at Stony Brook, a 180-unit condominium that opened in 1983, rarely has vacancies. "As soon as they go up, they sell like anything," said Sidney Reich, a board member of the owners' association. Mr. Reich said two-bedroom units were about $230,000 to $250,000. Six and eight-unit clusters make up the one-level complex, which has a pool and a recreation center.
Strathmore Gate, an older condominium complex for people 55 and older, is also in the hamlet. Prices are about the same as at the Knolls and vacancies are infrequent.
THE Three Village School District, a sprawling system joining Stony Brook, Old Field and Setauket, has five elementary schools for kindergarten through Grade 6 (there are no prekindergarten programs), two junior highs for Grades 7 through 9 and Ward Melville High School for Grades 10 through 12.
District enrollment, currently about 7,600, has grown from 6,870 10 years ago but still lags far below the district's peak of more than 10,000 students in the early 1970's.
Last year about 95 percent of the 466 graduates of highly regarded Ward Melville went on to higher education; 73 percent enrolled in four-year colleges or universities. About 78 percent of the graduates earned Regents diplomas. Average scores on the College Board were 559 in verbal and 564 in math. Both scores are more than 50 points above the statewide averages. Test scores in other grades are also above state averages.
The district is noted for a strong music program, the high numbers of students competing in state and national academic competitions, programs for students with special needs and a science research program for top achievers. "There are very high expectations for all the students," said John Sonedecker, the superintendent.
But despite its stature in the community, the district is not without problems. In May, voters rejected a $113 million school budget that would have increased the school tax rate by almost 13.9 percent. A vote on a revised budget is scheduled for Tuesday.
A lack of commercial and industrial properties leaves homeowners to pick up the school bill.
The Stony Brook School, which describes itself as a Christian college preparatory school, enrolls 375 students in Grades 7 through 12. Many take advanced placement courses and nearly all go on to higher education. Students are from Long Island and beyond. Fees range from $9,500 for day students in seventh grade to $25,150 for seven-day boarding students.
The State University of New York at Stony Brook, built in 1962 on land donated by Melville and since expanded, bears the hamlet's name but has a separate ZIP code and a limited town-and-gown connection with residential Stony Brook. Few students live in the hamlet. 
But Stony Brook is home for some of the university's administrators and 1,682 faculty members and also for employees of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, an Energy Department research laboratory in nearby Upton, and of the Stony Brook University Hospital and the adjacent Health Sciences Center.
The Stony Brook campus, which has nearly 1,200 acres, had an enrollment this spring of 13,646 undergraduates and 7,209 graduate students. It is the site of the Staller Center for the Arts, where a seventh annual film festival showing independent feature and short films, many making their United States or East Coast premieres, runs from July 17 to 27. Passes to more than 40 films cost $40.
A Melville legacy, the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages, is situated on nine acres near the Stony Brook village center. Admission to exhibits in its three separate museums is $5 for adults, $4 for students and free for museum members and children under age 6. 
A Brookhaven town beach open to all town residents is adjacent to the West Meadows Wetlands Preserve, the 88-acre parcel preserved by Mr. Melville. Naturalist-led wetlands cruises offered by the Ward Melville Heritage Organization aboard a 35-passenger boat, the Discovery, run from May to October. Tickets are $15 for adults and $9 for children under 12. 
A town boat ramp is located near the village center, as is the Stony Brook Yacht Club, a private club founded in 1913. Club membership is for Brookhaven residents only.
AN entrance to Avalon, a private garden established by the Paul Simons Foundation, is near the village center across from the grist mill. It is open to the public. A wooden boardwalk running along the west side of the Mill Pond leads to walking trails. 
Near the hamlet's southern rim is the Smith Haven Mall, with nearly 1.4 million square feet of retail space and more than 160 stores. Other commercial areas are along Route 25A and Route 347. Nicolls Road, which passes through the Stony Brook campus, eases access to major east-to-west arteries including the Long Island Expressway. Some rail commuters bypass the Long Island Rail Road station in Stony Brook for the railroad's more heavily serviced Ronkonkoma station, about a 20-minute ride away.
The Setalcott Indians inhabited the Three Village area when English settlers arrived in Stony Brook in the mid-1600's. By the early 1800's the hamlet was shipping cordwood to New York and developing as a significant port. 
A sea captain, Jonas Smith, purchased a homestead on the harbor in the mid-1800's; it survives as the Three Village Inn, a popular restaurant and hotel. By early in the 20th century the hamlet had become a resort. But it was fading by the 1940's, when Ward Melville stepped in.

Thousands visit each year to witness how millers ground corn into meal. Tours of the mill, which is owned and operated by the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, are $2 for adults and $1 for children under 12. A replacement for an earlier mill erected by Adam Smith in 1699 that washed away, the mill remained in commercial use as recently as 1947, when Ward Melville, the philanthropist promoting historical preservation, acquired it. A Bohemian immigrant who worked at the mill at the turn of the last century played his violin for hours as the turning water wheel provided background music. Map shows the location of Stony Brook.

HEADLINE: Supermarkets Square Off In Glen Cove 

BYLINE:  By STACY ALBIN 

DATELINE: GLEN COVE 

 BODY:
FREDERICK GAHAGAN said the spotty parsnips and the rotten eggplant annoyed him but he had no choice. Mr. Gahagan, a retired marketing executive from Lattingtown who now spends his afternoons cooking lavish meals for his wife, Dolly, was talking about the vegetables at the only supermarket in Glen Cove, the Super Stop & Shop on Forest Avenue.
 Stop & Shop came to Glen Cove about 18 months ago, after its Dutch parent company, Royal Ahold, changed the name of the Edwards supermarkets, which it also owned. Since then, Stop & Shop has bought out Farmers Bazaar, an independent local supermarket, and moved into the 45,000-square-foot Farmers Bazaar store on Forest Avenue. 
 But Mr. Gahagan, a twice-a-week shopper, isn't sold. "The quality stinks, and the variety stinks," he said. "All the staples went up 20 percent. If you do the shopping, you notice it very clearly."
A Stop & Shop spokesman, Gary Lewi of Howard J. Rubenstein Associates in Manhattan, said that he was not aware of customer complaints on quality or variety. He said that senior company officials inspect all stores on unannounced visits, using strict guidelines. "It is frankly a far tougher criterion than I suspect I would go out with, with a shopping list for my spouse," he said.
But since his tastes run to cheese souffles and zucchini-yogurt soup, Mr. Gahagan said he was pleased to learn that a second supermarket is opening in Glen Cove. "I think competition always makes a difference, especially in vegetables," he said.
The new store, the Farmer's Market of Glen Cove, will also be on Forest Avenue, about a block away from the Super Stop & Shop. Its owner, Cove Associates, is renovating a 30,000-square-foot brick building in an almost-vacant shopping center. Jay Adoni, the president of Cove Associates, said that he expected the Farmer's Market to open in September or October.
There have been a few snags along the way. In December, Stop & Shop filed a civil lawsuit in Supreme Court in Garden City, accusing the Glen Cove Planning Board of violating zoning ordinances in approving the Farmer's Market site plan. Stop & Shop's lawyer, William F. Bonesso, argued that the new market would likely attract vermin because its loading area was inadequate and that it would congest the parking lot with delivery trucks. He also accused the planning board of pandering to "a few vocal residents" in approving the Farmer's Market plans.
Last fall at a public hearing on the Farmer's Market's renovation plans, Mr. Bonesso, an associate at the Mineola law firm Forchelli, Curto, Schwartz, Mineo, Carlino & Cohn, said that Stop & Shop had an economic interest in the neighboring strip mall where the Farmer's Market planned to locate because it held the lease on the former Edwards store there. And as a leaseholder, it contended that having the Farmer's Market as a neighbor would reduce its chances of renting the space. 
But the Farmer's Market lawyer, Nicholas A. Sordi Jr. of Sordi & Sordi in Glen Cove, told the planning board that its employees would be assigned to clean up the grounds and that the loading area would be renovated. The board approved the store's plans in November.
Anthony J. Maurino, the city's director of building and code enforcement, said earlier this month that there was no legal reason to deny the application. The store's plans for the loading area, he said, were not a problem. 
But Stop & Shop was not swayed, and in December, Mr. Bonesso filed the lawsuit.
Mayor Mary Ann Holzkamp said that at least 50 residents had complained to her about the rising costs of groceries in Glen Cove. Some wrote to the local weekly newspaper, The Glen Cove Record Pilot, voicing their concerns. In April, the paper published a letter from Mayor Holzkamp that chided Stop & Shop. 
"Our sense of community tells us that what's good for Glen Cove is competition in the marketplace," the mayor wrote. "If Stop & Shop thinks we will settle for anything less, they are mistaken. When Stop & Shop came to Glen Cove it was welcomed as a member of our business family. It's time for them to act accordingly. Stop & Shop should stop the litigation, stop the appeals, and stop the delay, and let another supermarket come to Forest Avenue."
For their part, city officials say a resolution may be at hand. Mr. Maurino said he had received a call in early June from the T. J. Maxx chain, which was considering leasing the old Edwards store. No deal has been reached, city and Stop & Shop officials said. "The irony of it is it looks like we're going to have to a major national retailer there," Mr. Maurino said

HEADLINE: Towels, Sun Block And, Oh Yeah, Checkbook 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE WOODSIDE 

 BODY:
AS soon as beach season started, I set out on an odyssey to test the Connecticut Supreme Court ruling that municipal beaches must be open to the public, not just to residents. In the family van, my two daughters and I sought out beaches from Greenwich to Madison. Our plan was just to ask if we could use the beach and see what happened.
 What we found was a system that was both restrictive and human. As the Supreme Court ordered last year, towns have indeed made their beaches public, but the prices are so high and the rules about buying passes so awkward that much of the Connecticut coast remains as out of reach as ever. 
 In Greenwich, for example, it cost $50 for my girls and me to use the beach and would have cost $60 if my husband, Nat, had come along. That's outrageous by any standard. And economics is just the first hurdle. Many towns restrict parking around the beaches. And, finally, some don't sell nonresident beach passes at the beach. They must be bought at town offices, which are sometimes closed on weekends. So even when I was willing to pay the price to get in, I still faced being turned away. 
But we got in everywhere we tried, even when we weren't supposed to, and that was because of the people charged with enforcing the beach policies. These gatekeepers seemed embarrassed by the rules, often apologized for them, and sometimes tried to help us work around them.
In Madison, for example, the man checking cars told me that I had to buy our $40 worth of passes at the town offices, but that they were closed. He let us in anyway to "look around." In Stamford, the gatekeeper waved me in when I said we didn't want to stay that long. He saved us $20 and a trip to the Government Center, which, like Madison's office, is only open on weekdays.
In Greenwich, where I arrived at the beach on a cloudy Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, three different town workers warned us we would have to pay $50, as if to give us a chance to back out. The young man at the guard shack at Greenwich Point, which was at the center of the Supreme Court case, apologized when he told us the fee. "I know that's outrageous, but I didn't make the rules," he said, directing me to a town civic center about a mile away where the passes were sold. As I arrived there, a man sitting outside warned me about how much money I was about to spend and the man inside who sold me the passes said the same thing. It seemed everybody was trying to change my mind.
Back at the beach, the young man at the guard shack obviously felt bad that I had paid so much money to go to the beach on a cloudy day. So he told me he wouldn't stamp the passes so I could use them on a better day.
My trip around the state's beaches was full of such moments.

First Stop, Greenwich
 The Supreme Court ruling seemed to be made for people like me. I live in Deep River, which is along the Connecticut River and away from the great beaches on Long Island Sound. Before the ruling, I had very few choices if I wanted to swim in the Sound. The beautiful beaches at Greenwich were closed to me, as was Madison and those of several other communities. The court ruling was supposed to fix that.
I am the former environmental reporter for The Day, the newspaper in New London, and have written about the state's beaches, including the issue of public access, for almost 10 years. So I made the first stop on my trip Greenwich Point, which was the subject of the Supreme Court case. By forcing Greenwich to open its beaches to nonresidents, the ruling also forced other communities to do the same thing.
The Greenwich beach, of course, was beautiful. It was low tide. Annie, my 11-year-old, initiated a race to the rock wall. Elizabeth, who is 13, discovered pairs of horseshoe crabs, who had made circular patterns in the sand before mating.
It was one of those great moments of camaraderie for mother and child, and it happened at Greenwich Point. I wondered if you could put a price on watching horseshoe crabs with your children.
Annie said, "This is really nice. It's worth $10."
The girls dug a deep hole by the water. I had a cup of gourmet decaf from the snack bar. Annie and I hiked around the point past the blooming wild roses while Elizabeth napped on the sand. We watched a heron stretch out its neck, and then fold it up. A rabbit hid in a patch of wildflowers.
Annie said, "Maybe it's worth $15."

Candlewood Lake, New Fairfield
My stop after Greenwich was to Candlewood Lake in New Fairfield on Monday, Memorial Day. The sign there said, "All nonresidents will be towed." Annie spotted the sign and asked: "Are we going to be arrested?"
We were going to find out. It was mid-morning and the sun was out. I turned into an angled parking space near the bathhouse, just steps from the beach. We heard the drone of Jet Skis and motorboats. The water rippled beyond a row of trees and picnic tables. It was very inviting.
New Fairfield's town beach is adjacent to Squantz Pond State Park, where the parking lot tends to fill up on a hot day, sending overflow visitors looking for a place to park. I suspect that explains the no parking sign, so I warned my daughters that we might have to leave.
We got out of the van and walked up to the young woman and man guarding the beach entrance, which is through the bathhouse. "Hi. We don't live here, but we wondered if we could go to the beach."
"Yes," the woman said. "It's $10 to park and $6 for each of you. You have to park across the street, and pay for the parking there, then come back." The spot I had parked in right near the entrance to the beach, it turns out, was just for residents, who pay from $35 to $65 for a season pass. The lot for nonresidents was across a busy road, but at least it wasn't that far away.
After I reparked, we gathered up our paraphernalia, darted across the street, and went back. I paid the additional $18, for a total of $28 for our day there. No one tried to talk me out of it.
We swam for a bit in the chilly water and had the swimming float to ourselves. We lay down in the sun for a while before moving on, this time to Rowayton.

Bayley Beach, Rowayton
Bayley Beach in Rowayton, a village in Norwalk, used to be one of the more restrictive parks. Not only was it closed to nonresidents, but also to the rest of Norwalk. Only people from Rowayton could use the beach. So I wasn't sure what I was going to find when I tried to get in.
A woman was manning a card table at the entrance to the parking lot. I rolled down the van window and told her we wanted to use the beach..
She said it would cost $20 to park for the rest of the day.
"That's pretty steep," I said.
"They're charging more in Greenwich," she said. That was true, of course, especially since we were not charged to also use the beach. And the parking lot was the same for both residents and nonresidents.
The snack bar was open, and we could see a few dozen people walking down by the water or sitting in chairs on the sand. I bought Annie a hot dog and Elizabeth an Italian ice. They ate at the picnic tables, and then we set up our towels. I watched the girls collect shells and dig another hole, which the beach attendant soon enough refilled with his rake.
It was peaceful. I dug my toes into the sand and collected two or three tiny shells. I would have loved to stay longer, but the girls and I had another beach to hit.

The Surf Club, Madison
It was getting near the end of the afternoon on Memorial Day when we pulled up to the entry shack at the Surf Club, where Madison has strictly monitored residents' entries for many years. I knew that Madison had a policy similar to Greenwich's -- to sell passes at another location. But unlike Greenwich, Madison's offices are closed on weekends. I didn't know what they did when nonresidents showed up to enjoy the late afternoon sun on a national holiday, which is what I wanted to do.
"Hi. I don't live in town. Can we go to the beach?"
The young man was friendly. "You are supposed to go to the Town Campus to buy passes," he said. "It's $10 for the car, and $10 for each person. But Town Campus is closed."
I asked him what I should do.
"You can go the day before to get passes," he said with a straight face.
"I can't get passes now?"
"No."
But then his humanity took over. He looked at me and the girls, sitting there in our bathing suits, then said: "I'll let you go in and look around now because it's late in the day." I figured "look around" was his way of saying, "This is ridiculous. Just go on in."
We drove in and parked. There were about 100 people, all told, at the park. Most of them were sitting in the wooded section behind the beach, having picnics, or playing at the playground. A few were walking along the sand, wading, or just sitting and watching the way the sun makes shadows at that time of the day. I have always thought this is the most beautiful time of day at a beach. I'm glad the guard was nice enough to let me enjoy it.

Cummings Park, Stamford
A week and a half later, on a cloudy, warm Thursday, Elizabeth and I arrived at the little guard shack halfway down the long driveway of Cummings Park in Stamford. This is the home of Brenden Leydon, the Stamford lawyer who sued Greenwich over its beach policy in 1994. Stamford officials had told me in recent years that they are proud that the city has always allowed outsiders onto its beaches.
"Hi. I don't live here. Can we go to the beach?"
The friendly older man in the baseball cap said, "It'll cost you $50 because you'll get a parking ticket."
"Can I pay to park?"
"Where do you live?"
"Deep River." There was a pause. Then I said, "We're just passing through and we thought it would be nice to go to the beach. Can I pay to park?"
"I don't take money," he said. "How often do you come here?"
"Not often."
"For $125 you can get a pass for the year, or $20 for the day."
"Can I get it here?"
"No. At the Government Center," he said. "How long are you going to stay?"
"Not very long."
"Just go in," he said, "but watch out for the cop."
I proceeded to the empty parking spaces in front of the beach. The moody clouds and warm breeze lured us outside to a bench along the sand, but I was too fearful to move far away from the car because I didn't want to get a parking ticket.
Good thing. In 15 minutes, a Stamford patrol car floated into the nearly empty lot. We jumped up and leapt into the van. The Stamford beach would have to wait for another day.

Compo Beach, Westport
The next stop was in Westport, at Compo Beach, where rocks and sand form a wide peninsula near a peaceful residential neighborhood. Compo Beach has long been open to outsiders and I could tell that by how smoothly I was admitted. Here, three town employees walked up to our van as we edged into the narrow entrance. As usual, I told them I didn't live in town, but would like to go to the beach.
"O.K., it's $15 for the day," one of the trio, a man, said. "It would be $30 on a weekend." And, surprise, surprise, I could actually buy the pass there.
"Could you pull up here to the left so we can fill out the pass?" another of the group, a woman, asked me. I pulled over and two more cars, obviously with town passes, went around me to go into the park.
As she handed me the orange ticket, she said, "Put that on the dashboard. It's good for the day. You can come and go as you please."
So we got our feet into the sand and water of one more town. 

Forget Spontaneity
While the Supreme Court ruling has opened up once-restricted beaches, it's not as if the gates are wide open. My trip showed that anyone wanting to use these beaches can't be spontaneous. Want to go on a romantic sunset walk along the beach? You better plan your romance ahead of time since you may have to buy your beach pass at a town office, which may not be open when the mood strikes you. Then, you may have to be willing to spend what by any measure is a lot of money.
Leaders of many towns have been saying for years that residents maintain beaches with their taxes, and that it's only fair for nonresidents to pay their share. But Mr. Leydon said he was disturbed by the beach fees. He said that while he had expected Greenwich to impose high fees and then make it difficult to buy the passes, he was surprised that other towns did the same thing.
"That, I'm not happy about, and I do think the fees should be significantly lower," he said. "The State Legislature ought to take a look at it. If the Legislature established beach fees, it would save the courts from another lawsuit," which he said he is prepared to file next year.
Mr. Leydon said he thought the beach guards' willingness to bend the rules proved that municipal beaches aren't overcrowded.
"The people who are actually there are the ones to know if there is a problem, and obviously, there isn't," he said. "I think that really shows that all of this is a Chicken Little reaction."
I'm with the beach gatekeepers: I'm embarrassed for my state, where the coast is treated a little like a private club for those with the right credentials. I'm embarrassed for my own town of Deep River, where our beach at an abandoned quarry is free, but outsiders pay $10 to launch a boat on the river.
The beach gate guards we met never asked why we didn't just go swimming in our own town, why we didn't just go to the state parks (which were next-door to three of the beaches), or, outside of Greenwich, the most pressing question, one that I asked myself repeatedly during my trip, why would anyone pay these outrageous prices?

HEADLINE: The Knockoff Squad 

BYLINE:  By ADAM FIFIELD; Adam Fifield is author of the memoir "A Blessing Over Ashes: The Remarkable Odyssey of My Unlikely Brother" and collaborated with Wayne Barrett on "Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani."

 BODY:
TOTING a shopping bag heavy with knockoff purses, the undercover investigator wove through the throng of tourists on Canal Street on a sunny spring afternoon. 
 The street's small stores, in compact rows, enticed shoppers with dizzying displays of watches, sunglasses, T-shirts, hats, purses, ties, even fish and baby turtles. Browsing with the effervescence of a teenager at the mall, the investigator, in jeans and a tie-dyed tank top, plucked purses off a wall rack and tested their feel in her hand. "Oh, this is really nice," she'd exclaim. Or perhaps, "Isn't it ugly?" 
 Posted along the sidewalk were the stores' lookouts, young men with walkie-talkies ready at any hint of trouble to shut down the whole street. They were sentries for a large, loose network of vendors, importers and manufacturers of counterfeit merchandise, and for the last five years the tall, sharp-featured former actress had given them good reason to be on guard. Her sleuthing for Holmes Hi-Tech, a New York detective agency hired by companies to investigate trademark infringements, had resulted in the seizing of millions of dollars of fake designer goods. 
But on this afternoon, the lookouts -- whose faces she had memorized, whose names she knew -- did not recognize her. And no wonder. On her more than 100 incognito trips to Chinatown, she has posed as a pregnant woman, a homeless person, a French tourist, a bewildered Midwesterner and a sanguine Southern belle. She can assume 10 accents. To deflect suspicion, she has flirted, cajoled, bargained, even improvised one-way arguments on her cellphone.
Today she was playing the part of an out-of-state wholesale buyer. In the back of a dim, narrow store, the investigator told the clerk she wanted to buy some fake purses. No problem, the man replied, brandishing a laminated chart listing various counterfeit items; he could get her as many as she wanted and ship them almost anywhere in the country. With one fairly small shipment, he predicted, she could make over $20,000 in profit before the end of the summer. Grinning broadly, she said that sounded fabulous and promised to come back tomorrow to seal the deal. 
"Chinatown is just the icing," the investigator explained later. "All these teeny stores look like Mom-and-Pop places. But we'll get a call from a law enforcement agent or investigator in another part of the country that someone is shipping a million dollars of a counterfeit product to a huge place in Chicago or wherever, and when we find the source, it's one of the addresses in Chinatown."
Counterfeiting, in fact, is a booming international business, accounting for an estimated 5 to 7 percent of global trade, according to the International Chamber of Commerce. Although current statistics are scant, anecdotal evidence suggests this hugely profitable activity may be expanding, nurtured by a toppling of trade barriers and a siphoning of law enforcement resources to fight terrorism. Some officials say that it has ties to organized crime, the drug trade and terrorism, and is a prime user of sweatshop labor. 
At the very least, New York is a major hub of global counterfeiting. It may even be the capital. A vast range of fake products, from designer items to computer software to prescription drugs, are made in the city or imported here and then sent elsewhere in the United States or abroad.
"It's almost like a drug deal," said William Bowe, a Customs Service official at Kennedy Airport, about one aspect of this industry. "They fly in with a large amount of cash, stay for two or three days, buy the stuff and fly back out again." 
The cost to the city in lost jobs and taxes probably runs into several hundred million dollars annually. A 1994 study by Mark Green, then the commissioner of consumer affairs, pegged the cost in unpaid taxes alone at $350 million. 
Just as global counterfeiting seems to be growing, so seems to be the city's share, expanding from Chinatown to many other neighborhoods.
"Counterfeiting is definitely more prevalent now than it's ever been," said Sgt. Tom McFadden, who directs the trademark infringement unit of the police department's Organized Crime Investigations Division. "The manufacture and sale of counterfeit merchandise occurs in neighborhoods throughout the city. All you have to do is look at downtown Brooklyn, uptown and Midtown Manhattan, Fordham Road in the Bronx."

The P.I. at Center Stage
Often, the private investigator is the one at the center of the fight against fakes.
The world of New York's counterfeit investigators is small and insular, peopled largely by former police officers, former government investigators -- and actors. Some possess a keen sense of righteousness. A few tend to boast. All can tell war stories, some truly worthy of the description. They compete, but also share a camaraderie that comes from time together in the trenches.
One prominent member of this world is Robert Holmes, who is the founder and president of Holmes Hi-Tech and, along Canal Street, widely known as "the chief." His very appearance there is enough to send all the metal gates clanging shut within seconds. Obviously, he can no longer do undercover work.
Holmes Hi-Tech, which has offices in Midtown and near Atlantic City, employs six full-time investigators and 20 part-time "spotters," who scout out stores and make undercover buys. These scouts, like the buyer of fake purses on Canal Street, are usually actors, and their most important tool is the "spotters' closet" in the Hi-Tech office. The closet looks like a theatrical costume room, packed with scarves, yarmulkes, wigs, fanny packs, temporary tattoos and other accouterments.
Like other such enterprises, Mr. Holmes's company is hired by law firms whose corporate clients are wrestling with counterfeiting problems. Hi-Tech tracks down the source of the knockoffs and makes undercover purchases to get enough evidence to obtain an order to seize the goods. Then, accompanied by private security guards or city or federal officers, Mr. Holmes leads a raid on the property to seize the contraband. 
In April, the police asked Mr. Holmes for help in a case involving several Chinatown merchants whom he had been hired to investigate earlier this year by Gibney, Anthony & Flaherty, a New York law firm. The collaboration paid off on May 8, when Holmes Hi-Tech and police officers raided five locations on Broadway just north of Canal Street that netted a cache of fake sunglasses, DVD's, handbags and watches whose retail value was estimated as more than $100 million.

Big Money Equals Big Danger
If this hidden world means big money, it also means danger. On a routine raid in February 2001, Mr. Holmes, a husky former New Jersey state trooper, walked into a room in the back of a Canal Street store and discovered, stashed on a shelf, a wad of cash and bags of fake Ecstasy pills. Then he noticed, hanging from a nail in the wall, a 9-millimeter Glock handgun. Its owner ran a small sidewalk stand selling counterfeit watches, many of which were at that moment being collected by Mr. Holmes's men.
"I had been a little lax about watching my back," he admitted with a shrug. 
Mr. Holmes, who is not alone in facing such perils, has also parried punches, outdriven pursuers on the New Jersey Turnpike and discovered pictures of himself on backroom bulletin boards, tacked up like dart targets. During a raid in the early 90's, as he was searching a store's inventory, he heard someone say his name. Swiveling, he saw a Secret Service agent, there to assist with the raid, restraining a man clutching an ice pick. "He was going for you," the agent said.

Secret Rooms, Fake Walls
To conceal their goods, some Chinatown counterfeiters have engaged in a second deception: constructing elaborate networks of secret rooms, fake walls and trapdoors. Some of the entry points have electromagnetic locks, operated by garage door openers. Some of the networks extend down to labyrinths of basements, subbasements, living quarters and factories, all beneath the streets of Chinatown. 
"You can go for a couple of blocks underground," said Dempster Leech, a retired private investigator who has wandered into those catacombs in the search for counterfeits. "I got lost down there a couple of times." 
While exploring a basement room in the mid-90's, Mr. Holmes found a tall cabinet against the wall. He opened the cabinet and pushed the back, which sprang open into another room. There was a man chopping chickens with a meat cleaver.
"When we came through, he raised the meat cleaver," Mr. Holmes said. "But once he saw who we were and that we weren't bad guys, he put it down."
Another time, while combing a series of connected rooms underneath Mott Street, Mr. Holmes lifted a fake panel and stepped into an underground casino. "There were little tables, people gambling, drinking and smoking," he said. "Everything went quiet. A few guys reached under their jackets. And I just put my hands up and said, 'I'm just looking for counterfeit goods,' and stepped back through the panel."
But the most disquieting subterranean discoveries are of workers. On a hot August day two or three years ago, Mr. Holmes glimpsed some boxes in the back of a Canal Street store. Moving them, he found a three-foot-high door. Opening it, he discovered an elderly man sitting on a stool in a cramped, sweltering room, labeling counterfeit purses. The man, who was probably working off a debt to a smuggler, had been locked in the room since around 8 a.m. They found him seven hours later. 
"He was sitting in his underwear and T-shirt," Mr. Holmes said. "It was 110 degrees in that room. I was amazed he was alive. He had two bottles of water and a big jug to go to the bathroom in. He was terrified when we went in there."

Merchants Can Be Victims, Too
John Yong is a lawyer who has represented several merchants accused of violating trademark rules. He claims the vendors are not deceiving anyone. 
"The knockoffs are like novelty goods," he said. "When people buy them, they know they're not real." 
Sergeant McFadden, however, pointed out that customers in places where New York fakes are regularly shipped will probably assume they are getting the genuine article.
But, in addition, some merchants say officials steal their goods during raids. Mr. Yong once represented one of several vendors who accused Victor Araujo, a police sergeant, of pocketing and reselling counterfeit goods. Sergeant Araujo and another officer, Vincent Contini, were indicted in 1999 on various charges related to those assertions. In July 2000, both men pleaded guilty; Sergeant Araujo was sentenced to five years' probation, and Mr. Contini to one year in prison.
Merchants also say they are caught between law enforcement and organized criminals who pressure them to sell the fakes. 
"We're talking about people selling these cheap watches, making very little money, and at the same time they have to deal with these very unpleasant realities," said Peter Kwong, a professor of Asian-American studies at Hunter College and the author of "The New Chinatown" (Hill & Wang, 1996). "A lot of these vendors are very, very new immigrants. Some of them are illegal. They are really desperate, and so they take a lot of risks."
Mr. Holmes said, "Some of them are probably victims caught in the middle. But some of the vendors graduate and become importers and wholesalers and manufacturers. Some of them rise to the top."

The Sweetener Mystery
Today, counterfeiting in New York goes far beyond Prada bags and Rolex watches. It can involve prescription drugs, computer software, food, cigarettes, liquor, baby formula, auto and airplane parts, perfume and steroid creams. It can even involve sweeteners, as it did a few years ago when packets of Equal, the sugar substitute made by the Monsanto Company, began mysteriously appearing in stores around the country. 
To tackle the problem, Monsanto hired Michael Kessler, founder of an investigative firm, Kessler International, at Park Avenue and 45th Street. Mr. Kessler, a forensic accountant who has been the city's chief of tax investigations, traced the counterfeits to a trading company in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. One day, as he cased the company's building, he found his first tangible clue: scraps of fake Equal boxes in a Dumpster.
After more evidence had been gathered, Monsanto lawyers got a court order to seize the trading company's books. Using his accounting expertise, Mr. Kessler discovered that the company had been buying real Equal in the big boxes designed for restaurants and then illegally repackaging them in smaller, counterfeit containers for sale in grocery stores.
"When people think of counterfeiting, they think of the guy on the street selling a Mickey Mouse watch," Mr. Kessler said. "It's a lot more than that." 
Others are also impressed by the sophistication of the fakes trade. Kevin Dougherty, the founder of Counter-Tech Investigations, a firm on 34th Street, realized the extent of counterfeiters' coordination when he found an electronic organizer while searching a Queens factory in 1997. 
"They had descriptions of several of the undercover vehicles that we had used and that the N.Y.P.D. had used," he said. "But those particular vehicles had never been used at that location. That information came from Broadway in Manhattan."

The 'Born to Kill' Enforcers
Dempster Leech still has tooth marks on his thumb, where a woman bit him while he was trying to serve her with a seizure order in the early 90's.
"She was crunching my thumb, chewing my thumb, doing all she could to hurt me, " he said with a laugh in the murky recesses of a Midtown pub one afternoon. 
Mr. Leech, 60, a diminutive, classically trained actor with a master's degree in clinical psychology, looms large in the annals of the battles against counterfeiting. Retired since 1998, he is known for Canal Street raids in the 80's and 90's so aggressive that a contract was supposedly taken out on his life. In a field full of stories, those years yield some of the most gripping. The fake-goods industry still thrives, but back then, the heyday of the Born to Kill gang, Canal Street often saw chaos and violence.
One afternoon, Mr. Leech and Mr. Holmes, who then often worked together, figured out how to broadcast on the walkie-talkie frequency used by the Canal Street store lookouts. Their aim was to prevent the lookouts from alerting store owners about an imminent raid. Their chosen broadcast: Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries."
"We could hear music all over Canal Street," Mr. Leech said with a wide grin. "Like a helicopter rising off a hill." 
But most of their memories of that time are not as amusing. 
"It was like walking into Dodge City," Mr. Leech said. "It kept getting more and more dangerous. After a while, I said, 'What am I doing here?' " 
The forces of the Chinatown counterfeiting industry led a campaign of intimidation against investigators. During raids, members of the Born to Kill gang gathered on nearby roofs and hurled bombs fashioned out of nails, tin cans and M-80 firecrackers.
One afternoon, a mob waving bats and pipes surrounded Mr. Leech, Mr. Holmes and their raid teams. 
"It looked like the scene from 'Frankenstein' when the whole town comes out wielding sticks," Mr. Holmes said. "I backed my people to a storefront and kept a perimeter until the police got there."
The hostility they encountered stemmed in part from misinformation that ricocheted through Chinatown. "They were told things that simply weren't true," Mr. Leech said. "They were told that we didn't have a right to seize, that we were taking a form of government vigorish."
Mr. Holmes remembered an encounter with the well-groomed David Thai, the leader of the Born to Kill gang, who is now serving life in prison for murder and other crimes and who admitted to making $13 million in just one year selling fake watches. 
"I was right in the middle of a seizure," Mr. Holmes said. "David came out of this place on Canal Street and came over to me, all dressed up in a suit. He looked very nice. He said, 'Mr. Holmes?' I said, 'What?' He said, 'I'm getting very tired of you.' He was smiling. I said: 'Get in line, David. A lot of people are getting tired of me.' " 
"We love the knockoffs!" said a flight attendant from Houston as she stood at Canal and Mercer Streets one recent afternoon. Frequently in New York on layovers, she often peruses local shops for fake designer items. Today, shopping with another flight attendant, she bought a Gucci watch and a Louis Vuitton purse. 
She carried a list of New York tourist attractions, presumably prepared by a travel agent, that included the bold heading: "Going to Canal Street." It was below a heading for ground zero. When informed of the possible link between counterfeiting and unsavory elements like organized crime, she grimaced. 
"I don't want to support those things," she said. "But I don't think that would prevent me from shopping."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article last Sunday about investigations of counterfeit goods misstated a job once held by Michael G. Kessler, a private investigator in the field. He was chief of investigations for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, not the city's chief of tax investigations.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester; 
Children's Hospital Plans Family-Friendly Approach

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: VALHALLA 

 BODY:
AFTER five years of planning and fund-raising, the first steel girders of the $150 million Maria Fareri Children's Hospital and Trauma Center -- a 260,000-square-foot medical institution on 12 acres here -- are finally being hoisted into place.
 Named for a 13-year-old girl who died of rabies at the Westchester Medical Center in 1995 after being bitten by a bat, the new hospital is said to be the first in the country that is named after a child. 
 The center will tend not only the ailing bodies of acutely ill children, but to their frightened spirits as well, said Bruce Komiske, executive director of the Children's Hospital Foundation at Westchester Medical Center, the fund-raising and building arm for the new hospital. He said the concept of involving a sick or injured child's parents in the process of healing had driven the design concepts of the new building.
The Children's Hospital at Westchester Medical Center has pediatric intensive care and neonatal intensive care units, a cystic fibrosis center, children's cancer center and pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery programs. The new building will also hold a trauma center, which will serve both pediatric and adult patients. 
The design of the pediatric sections of the new hospital reflect the fact that many patients stay for extended periods of time. "We're setting a new standard for what is a healing environment," explained Mr. Komiske, editor of the book "Designing the World's Best: Children's Hospitals" (Images Publications, 1999). Mr. Komiske has been involved in planning, building and operating five hospitals, including, most recently, the Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I.
The 400,000-square-foot Westchester Medical Center, which was built in 1977, when parents were discouraged from staying with their children during hospital stays, now has 109 pediatric beds on two floors, where it treats about 20,000 infants and children a year. It serves young patients from a seven-county region in the Hudson Valley, northern New Jersey and lower Connecticut.
"The current quarters are overcrowded and not child-friendly in same way the new hospital will be," said Dr. Michael Gewitz, director of pediatrics at Westchester Medical Center, who was part of the design and planning team for the new building.
To include the family in the healing process, the architectural firm of NBBJ in Columbus, Ohio, designed a hospital with large patient rooms with sleep-sofas for parents. There will be 90 beds for children and adolescents and 50 beds for infants. 
Each of the children's rooms in the new hospital will also have a computer with an Internet connection and a wireless keyboard that can be used from the bed "so the patients can be connected to their friends and family when they want to," said Greg Mare, the lead architect on the project.
EACH patient room will occupy about 300 square feet. Many rooms in older hospitals are smaller than that and accommodate two patients.
"The size of the rooms, the increased square footage per patient, doesn't increase costs," Mr. Mare said. "It's actually the opposite, because family members can become participants and that's especially important with today's nursing shortage." Also, NBBJ has provided for a parents' kitchen area so families can prepare familiar dishes for their children.
NBBJ, one of the largest health-care architectural firms in the country, designed Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland and Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego, among others. NBBJ employs 800 people, including architects, designers and other related professionals. For the Maria Fareri Children's Hospital, NBBJ formed a partnership with two other firms: Lothrop Associates in Valhalla, the associate architects for the job, and Syska Hennessy Group, consulting engineers in New York City.
Overall, the design theme of the new hospital is one of many villages within the whole. "We wanted the design to relate to the region and people it serves, so people feel more comfortable," the architect explained. "In Westchester, the theme is one of many small thriving municipalities. So we've incorporated stone walls in the landscape, and we're using materials like brick, stucco, clapboard and asphalt roof shingles."
Instead of one large block of a building, Mr. Mare said, there will be many small sections of uneven heights -- including pavilions and a central landmark tower, as in a New England town square. "Before we even put a pencil to paper, we rode around Westchester and adjacent counties, documenting the physical characteristics of the environment and looking for a central theme," he said. The new children's hospital is a freestanding building next to the Westchester Medical Center and connected to it by passageways.
Inside the lobby of the new hospital, in accordance with the patient-friendly theme, children will be greeted by a 10-foot-tall 15,000-gallon aquarium designed by the Brooklyn-based artist and sculptor Vito Acconci. It will have an acrylic tunnel going through it, large enough to accommodate a child in a wheelchair.
THROUGHOUT the hospital, the architects -- who also sought the input of children in the design process -- have specified carpets instead of vinyl tile where possible and wood paneling rather than vinyl wall coverings. They have avoided harsh institutional lighting and chosen fixtures that focus on specific areas rather than large spaces.
"We want children to see the hospital as a less frightening place," Dr. Gewitz said. "It will be a place that children can come to and feel comfortable in, even though important things are happening to them and around them." Also, instead of setting aside space for a single traditional hospital gift shop, the design calls for a variety of retail outlets -- one selling magazines and newspapers, another selling clothing and yet another featuring toys, for example. Mr. Mare said the choice of shops and the merchandise chosen is being driven by economic considerations, specifically the desire to generate income for the hospital.
In some cases, the hospital will be in a partnership with retailers such as Kaybee Toys or Barnes & Noble. Also, instead of just one coffee shop, there will be a food court with, among other things, a Starbucks and a Pizza Hut.
Outside, a 60 foot by 60 foot precast concrete structure will be constructed for landings and takeoffs of an emergency helicopter. The new Trauma Center will be housed on two floors of the new building. 
Looking ahead, all of the steel girders are expected to be in place by October. Bob Buckley, senior project manager for the New York City-based Turner Construction, said that the steel structures for the complex roof gables -- which will eventually enclose the large industrial motors used in heating and cooling systems -- are being constructed on the ground before being lifted into place by cranes. Beginning in July, as sections of the steel are finished, the exterior walls will be constructed. Enclosure of the building is scheduled to be finished a year from now, with occupancy of the new hospital slated for January 2004. 
The new hospital is being paid for through a variety of sources. After their daughter's death, John and Brenda Fareri pledged $5 million for the hospital, to be raised through their friends. Including this pledge, the hospital has raised $24 million of its $27 million goal through a capital campaign. The remainder is being financed with tax-exempt bonds issued through Goldman Sachs.
The budgeted amount does not include money for art. "We couldn't justify that in the budget," said Mr. Komiske, the executive director. But donations of art work are being sought from groups and individuals throughout the community. An art committee has been established to develop a permanent art collection and raise funds.
"Art can have even greater impact in a hospital than in the greatest art museums in the world," Mr. Komiske said, "because it impacts people who are at the heights and depths of their emotions."
As Dr. Gewitz, the director of pediatrics, said, "When it opens early in 2004, we will have designed and built an environment that takes the stigma of 'hospital' out of the hospital."

HEADLINE: Trouble in Paradise 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE 

DATELINE: TABERNACLE 

 BODY:
THINK of a kingdom within a state, with 1.1 million acres of oaks and pitch pines, vegetable farms, cranberry bogs and housing developments perched atop a water aquifer of unparalleled purity, and you have a partial picture of New Jersey's Pinelands.
 But these days there is confusion in the Kingdom, which occupies one-fifth of the state. The blame can largely be laid at the feet of the 15-member panel that oversees the ecological treasure, and it includes a psychologist, a nuclear engineer, a former gym teacher, hay and cranberry farmers, professional planners, a retired utilities executive and a botanist. 
 Together, the Pinelands Commission oversees a land management plan so ambitious and so detailed that it is looked to as a blueprint for large-scale conservation efforts nationwide. To Jerrold L. Jacobs, the current chairman of the commission, he and his colleagues have more than held up their end of of this fragile trust. 
"We have protected the core of the Pinelands," said Mr. Jacobs. "That, by and large, was the plan."
Perhaps, but there is confusion nonetheless. By next week, the terms of Mr. Jacobs and six other commissioners will have expired, dropping a gauntlet in front of Governor McGreevey, who -- overwhelmed by concerns over a yawning budget deficit -- is months overdue in making new appointments.
In truth, environmental groups have been edgy about concrete and cars encroaching on this broad swath ever since Christie Whitman was sworn into her first term as governor. They have been more than eager to pounce on the commission for a perceived softening in the protection of rare species and for failing to divert development from some interior areas.
Nor has the tumult bypassed the commission staff, which provides expertise for hundreds of decisions each year on construction across seven of the state's southern and central counties. The staff's widely respected executive director, Terrence D. Moore, who had held the position for two decades, resigned unexpectedly two years ago during a controversy in which the commission eased zoning rules.
Now, William F. Harrison, a long-serving assistant staff director, faces disciplinary action for insubordination. Both Mr. Harrison and the commissioners declined to comment, but Mr. Moore said the volume of Pinelands building applications and the time required to review them often threatened to overwhelm the 60-member staff.
"If it continues, it makes it hard for the staff to focus on some of the larger issues," said Mr. Moore, a planner now working for the National Park Service in Philadelphia.
Staff turmoil and uncertainty about the complexion of the commission have led environmentalists to lobby the McGreevey administration for nominees who display a proven interest in conservation, just as builders and developers are clamoring for their own representation. Adding urgency this year, the Pinelands Commission is conducting a review of the master plan that could result in changes to address the searing growth in areas like Egg Harbor Township, near Atlantic City, that are supposed to be shielded from development run amok.
"There have been terrible precedents and a lot of red flags," said Carleton Montgomery, executive director of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, an organization in Pemberton, on the Pinelands' northern fringe, that has emerged as the region's primary watchdog. "We've told the governor that he's got to make the commission much greener."
Mr. Montgomery's concerns are shared by Michele Byers, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, which promotes land trusts and policies for open space. Ms. Byers said that while the Pinelands' plan remained largely intact, she had watched the direction of its administration shift.
"It's harder and harder to get a consensus," said Ms. Byers. "In the early years, there was never a question on getting eight votes to make the right decision to conserve the resource. Now, without appointments, the commission is not able to move ahead."

A Suburban Wilderness
And yet the Pinelands are far from being ecologically pristine. The region is a quilt of public and mostly private land that includes Fort Dix, McGuire Air Force Base, a stretch of the Garden State Parkway, tomato and berry farms and a climbing human population of more than 600,000 living in 56 towns and villages. Its borders sit within a tempting commute to Trenton and Philadelphia to the west, and Atlantic City to the east.
The Pinelands plan, a political offspring of former Gov. Brendan Byrne's administration that dates from the 1970's, tries to direct the flow of development away from the region's forested core and toward parcels designated for more intensive growth. The state Pinelands Protection Act of 1979 set goals of preserving farms and undeveloped lands, discouraging "piecemeal and scattered development" and conserving animal and plant species on the sandy soils of the Kirkwood-Cohansey Aquifer, estimated to hold 17.7 trillion gallons of water.
"This is a preservation statute, not a development statute," declared Candace McKee Ashmun, a Bernards Township planner and business consultant who has served on the commission since its creation.
Ms. Ashmun sits with six other gubernatorial appointees; an additional seven appointments come from the Pinelands counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean. Because the Pinelands also includes federal land, a 15th seat is appointed by the secretary of the Interior Department. Commissioners serve three-year terms, can be perpetually reappointed and are not paid. Both the governor and the Interior secretary can overturn any ruling, although a veto has never occurred. In a given year, the Pinelands Commission and its staff may review as many as 1,500 construction applications.
"Commissioners often take a hit in the press," said Annette M. Barbaccia, executive director of the commission staff and a former New York City environmental official who replaced Mr. Moore. "They're characterized as weak, but people don't see what they wrestle with day in and day out."
Even so, Ted Gordon, a Southampton botanist and commissioner since 1998, deplored what he described as weaknesses within the Pinelands plan itself. Mr. Gordon, whose gubernatorial appointment has expired, said that "severe fragmentation" between surviving forest areas remains the principal threat to the local environment.
"Anywhere you go, you see units being constructed in the Pinelands," Mr. Gordon said. "Additional remedies must be taken to further help out these communities. The plan is too lenient in the interior areas."

Snakes and Schools
The most divisive issues in the Pinelands Commission's recent history have involved snakes and schools. A six-year effort by a Burlington County district to build a huge regional high school in Tabernacle -- little more than a Pinelands crossroads -- polarized the commission and incited environmental groups to charge that the Pinelands plan had been irrevocably weakened.
Still under construction, Seneca High sits on a footprint of 210 acres, some of which has been protected farmland. Two years ago, the project won rezoning approval from the commission and kicked off a debate that traveled all the way to Bruce Babbitt, Interior secretary at the time, who ultimately granted conditional approval. The commission's staff recommended against it, said staff members, and Mr. Moore resigned before the final approval, although he remained as a special adviser.
"It is a total disaster," said Mr. Gordon, who voted against the project. "There were other sites that could have been utilized that would not have taken farmlands."
Stephen V. Lee III, a commissioner who lives in Tabernacle, saw it differently. A fifth-generation cranberry grower who farms land owned by his family since 1868, Mr. Lee believes the regional plan was never intended to stop development, but to take growth into account along with the demands of Pinelands communities.
"Conditions change, people change, aspirations change," said Mr. Lee, who has been a commissioner since 1982. "The commission has to be willing to change, too. Maybe I'm too pragmatic, but this site was a former sod farm. It had been a cornfield before that -- it wasn't a pristine site. The commission has been weighted toward absolute preservation, and that has created a lot of friction with the residents here."
As a result of the rezoning, the school district paid $1.9 million to buy development rights from property owners for nearly 2,500 acres in the Pinelands. Under the region's plan, builders who seek higher housing densities or exemptions from zoning rules must first buy development rights in areas designated by the commission. The purpose of the program is essentially to make progress pay for preservation.
While the credit program has saved 40,000 acres and is supported by the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups, they branded its application in Tabernacle as setting a shaky precedent.
"We made a big stink and it rallied people to the issue," said Mr. Montgomery of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance.
Ms. Ashmun, who also voted against the high school, called the decision "an outrageous performance, an unheard-of performance in the pines."
"The worst part of it," she said, "is that if it had been sited somewhere else, the kids would be in the school right now."
Perhaps most disappointing to environmental interests, the school passed a local bond referendum and won a strong measure of local support. Tony Russo, a Tabernacle farmer who cultivates 600 acres of strawberries, broccoli and sweet corn, said that change seemed to be inevitable, even in areas still zoned primarily for agriculture.
"The schools come in, then the houses," Mr. Russo said. "Nothing stays the same. It's not something you can really fight. The fact is that we needed a school and we put it here, but it cost the taxpayers a lot of money."
In a separate ruling in 2000, the commission again ran into trouble for making peace with a Burlington County developer who was interrupted while building 300 houses on a tract in Evesham where naturalists discovered timber rattlesnakes.
An early study of the site, called the Sanctuary, missed the snakes -- which are on the state's list of endangered species -- and received commission approval. When the naturalists later found den sites, the discovery prompted the Audubon Society and the Pinelands Preservation Alliance to sue the state to intervene. The groups argued that -- under state law as well as the terms of the management plan -- the presence of rattlesnakes should have halted building completely.
But a deal brokered by the commission agreed to limited additional building, while requiring the developer, Iva Samost, to install culverts and fences to protect the snakes, and to help finance a study of the local snake population. Mr. Samost was not fined, as some builders have been in similar circumstances. In the end, the state paid $5 million to protect 1,200 Pinelands acres from development. Legal challenges to the settlement are pending.
"We're talking about an endangered species, and development was allowed to continue," said Howard P. Boyd, who wrote "Field Guide to the Pine Barrens" (Plexus). "People are moving into areas where they don't belong. We're changing the balance of ecology in the Pinelands."
Mr. Jacobs, the commission's chairman, voted for the settlement, but he said it was a choice that was made reluctantly.
"It was the best decision in a very imperfect set of circumstances," he said. "It's my interest that we never get in that situation again."
Mr. Lee, the cranberry grower, missed the settlement meeting, and Ms. Ashmun abstained from voting. Since the commission requires eight votes to pass an approval, abstentions are often seen as votes against an issue.
"We dropped the ball on this one," Ms. Ashmun said. "Just buying land doesn't trade off against a bad decision. Our job was to protect an endangered species, and we didn't do it."

Fraying at the Edges
At the Pinelands' borders, the most potent argument against the management plan may be that it is working too well. In few places does the plan ban growth outright, choosing instead to designate nine distinct zones for farming, forestry, military use and residential building. The effect is to steer growth toward areas that planners determine can take it.
Towns like Jackson, Stafford and Manchester in Ocean County, Monroe in Gloucester County, and Galloway and Hamilton in Atlantic County have been marked as regional growth areas -- meaning they allow some of the highest housing densities and are zoned to take the heaviest burden of building. But no town has borne more than Egg Harbor Township, wedged between Atlantic City and the Pinelands' green core. In the past decade, the demand for residential building permits there has soared from 54 permits issued in 1992 to a high of 582 permits issued last year.
"It can't continue like this," said Mayor James McCullough. "Our traffic is overwhelming, and we watched 1,500 new residents come in here every year for the past three years. How does any town deal with that?"
The result has been a drain on roads, sewers, schools, firefighters and the police, and 1,200 children now attend classes in trailers while they await construction of permanent classrooms and additions to older schools. The township's property taxes are rising because the costs of infrastructure are accumulating faster than local revenue and state aid can match them. 
In the past, the Pinelands Commission took a measure of responsibility, doling out advice and funds for towns to build sewer systems. At the current pace of development, however, neither the towns nor most commissioners believe the effort has been enough. In a review of the management plan under way this year, commissioners are considering a tightening of zoning that would permit fewer houses in the regional growth areas. Some housing densities have already been reduced by 10 to 30 percent, and commission staff said further cuts were being projected to slow construction and to allow local services to catch up.
"We're under the gun, and we now realize that," said Edward A. Wuillermin Jr., a vegetable farmer and commissioner for Atlantic County who was appointed a year ago. "We may not be a body that can appropriate funds for the towns. We cannot tax, but we can be an advocate with the state."
Yet the direction of the plan's review, conducted every five years, will depend on the commissioners themselves, and seven vacancies wait to be filled by Governor McGreevey. In addition to Ms. Ashmun, commissioners with expired seats include Mr. Lee, Mr. Gordon and Mr. Jacobs, Sally Dudley of Harding Township, Linda Eckenhoff of Southampton and Jay E. Mounier of Franklinville. As a rule, expired commissioners sit until they are replaced. 
With increasing volume, builders' groups complain that their interests are neglected and have started to lobby for one of their own on the commission. Some builders contend that domination by environmental interests in decisions has actually fueled tensions in overwrought towns.
"The commission has done zip to provide for infrastructure," said Rick Van Osten, executive vice president of the Builders League of South Jersey. "They don't understand housing. These towns are no longer the masters of their own destinies."
Mr. Van Osten said that he submitted names of builders to the governor's office, but that none had been contacted. Anthony V. Ziccardi, on the New Jersey Builders Association's Pinelands committee, said the result was an imbalance: "From the beginning, it has been the white hat, black hat routine. The fact is that the commission has never had a builder representative. After 20 years, you get tired of that."
Last week, Bradley M. Campbell, the state's environmental commissioner, whose agency advises on Pinelands appointments, said that new members would probably not be selected until the fall, and only after Mr. McGreevey's had his budget passed. He added that the administration was considering several reappointments, but stopped short of releasing the list.
"Governor McGreevey will want to put his imprimatur on the management plan, and there are new challenges to address," said Mr. Campbell."He is committed to strong conservation appointments."
Environmentalists will be watching. In coming years, they expect no reprieve on the pressure that pushes at the Pinelands' borders. Of paramount interest is the store of water beneath the land, as the thirsty suburbs of Atlantic City, Trenton and Philadelphia expand. And the timber rattler may be the least appealing of more than 90 other threatened and endangered plant and animal species harbored within it. The region's value is reflected in the passions that all parties display about its contested, somewhat tattered, but also openly admired, management plan.
"The Pinelands Commission has made some bad decisions, and there are situations that were not well handled," said Edward Lloyd, a former director of the Rutgers environmental law clinic. He now holds the same position at Columbia University Law School. "The battles don't typify the commission. By and large, the plan is a success and the commission works pretty well."

HEADLINE: The State Should Support Developing Solar Energy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The article on the state's energy conservation program ("Trying to Save Energy May Come at a Price") on June 16 only scratched the surface of what could be a ground-breaking opportunity for New Jersey to provide leadership in significantly improving our global energy and environmental conditions, or just another dismal frittering away of millions of dollars with little or no beneficial sustainable results. 
 As the article notes, the Davies Report, commissioned by the state Board of Public Utilities, cites the lack of a long-range plan for achieving measurable results in what it calls "energy market transformation" efforts. However, what is needed first is a step back to ensure that there is a clear understanding and acceptance of key objectives and that the programs being planned and implemented are consistent with achieving those objectives. 
The objectives explicitly or implicitly in the landmark legislation are: reducing energy use (conservation) without impairing the standard of living of our citizens; increasing the supply of energy to keep up with demand, with emphasis on environmentally friendly alternative sources; replacing environmentally destructive fossil fuels with renewable energy sources like solar and wind; and maintaining a reasonable cap on energy costs. 
While some of these objectives are reflected in the evolving programs to date, priority has not been given to supporting the most productive means for achieving all or most of them.
Instead, the board appears to have been diverted by inside maneuvering of the various vested interests on the one hand and the inevitable bureaucratic inertia on the other plus the uncertainty of the transition process resulting from last November's election.
As one example, the board, in late December, issued a belated request for proposals "to develop renewable energy technology projects" to be submitted by the beginning of February. The board has allocated $10 million to the program's first year. Decisions on the proposals were promised by April 3.
Fourteen proposals were submitted by the deadline, including one for a solar energy project from me and my group, Hoburn Management Corporation. Our proposal is initially in the form of a one-megawatt capacity demonstration project that can be replicated throughout the state to, we believe, create a generating capacity of up to 100 megawatts, comparable to a midsized fossil-fuel fired plant, and with none of the pollution consequences. We and the other proposers are still waiting for a decision, which now seems to be postponed indefinitely.
The major impediment today to the more pervasive use of solar power is the high, up-front investment required of users. Payback times of around 15 years or more are still not sufficient to attract owners except, perhaps, for the most "green" motivated. 
So far, promotional efforts of the solar industry and government have focused on the individual user. The solution to achieving more widespread use of solar power in New Jersey is to encourage and support the development of innovative solar power aggregators who will bear the initial financial burden and supply electricity to both the ultimate users directly and to the utilities by feeding excess electricity generated into the electricity grid.
New Jersey can jump-start the process by taking the initiative in providing sufficient financing to help create a critical mass leading to economies of scale -- and the creation of hundreds of new jobs, including the attraction of solar equipment manufacturers to the state. New Jersey can become the first truly solar state in the country.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: On Fifth Avenue Between 115th and 116th Streets; 
Middle-Income Condos Both 'Green' and 'Smart'

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
"Green" and "smart" are two of the aims that the developers of the building now going up on Fifth Avenue between 115th and 116th Streets have set for their new condominium; so is "affordable," in order to attract middle-income buyers. 
 The first of its eight stories is to be devoted to retail space and the remaining floors to residential condos intended for purchasers who earn too much for standard subsidized housing and too little for most market-rate homes in Manhattan. 
 Two-thirds, or 86 of the 129 condos, will be reserved for buyers whose incomes range between $53,000 and $103,000 a year. Prices at the building, which is to be called 1400 on 5th, will start at $158,000 for a one-bedroom unit, with higher prices yet to be determined. The remaining 43 units, which will include three- and four-bedroom triplex town houses on 115th Street, will be sold at market rate to buyers whose incomes exceed $89,000. Prices for condos will begin at $284,000 for two-bedrooms, and town houses will range from $560,000 to $700,000. 
Owners in both categories will receive a New York State Green Building tax credit for $24,000 spread out over five years, and they will all be selected through a lottery that continues through July 19. Applications for the lottery can be obtained online from www.1400on5th.com or through the mail by writing to 1400 on 5th L.L.C., 55 West 116th Street, Suite 140, New York, New York 10026. Occupancy is planned for July 2003. 
Five retail leases have been signed and tenants will include a health club, a laundry and a restaurant. More than 60 percent of the building is to be constructed with material that is either recycled or renewable. In addition, it will consume 35 percent less energy than is permitted in the New York State Energy Code, which regulates the use of energy in new or substantially renovated buildings. The mechanical system will be capable of removing allergens from the air.
The project is part of the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development's Anchor program, which encourages the development of retail ventures in tandem with improved housing. 
Financing for the $40 million building, which is being developed by Full Spectrum Building and Development, a Harlem-based company, blends public and private investments. 
"When we started talking about doing something that was economically and environmentally sustainable in 1996, people had no idea what we were talking about," said Carlton Brown, a principal at Full Spectrum. "But we believe that housing can be much more than housing." 
He is adamant about making the building "green" because, he said, "by living in cities, we denigrate the environment and we must find ways to minimize environmental degradation." NADINE BROZAN

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Another Word About the Fox Guarding the Roundhouse

BYLINE:  By Ronald Smothers; Ronald Smothers reports from Newark for The New York Times.

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
They aren't exactly joined at the hip, but Governor McGreevey and his transportation commissioner, James P. Fox, have been a visible tandem in recent weeks, breaking ground for new train stations, trumpeting the purchase of rail cars, expanding parking for commuters and trying to bring rail connections to the Meadowlands.
 In the early part of his administration -- as Mr. McGreevey confronts a budget gap and economic news that ranges between not good and just bad -- it is not surprising that a new governor would put himself in the way of some applause for shiny new and promising projects. But there are many who see a broader significance to the flurry of activity and the central presence of Mr. Fox, a savvy political strategist with strong Washington experience in public policy. 
 "Jamie Fox might not know how to read an E.I.S," said one Democratic politician, referring to the often voluminous and archly technical environmental impact statements that come with most transportation projects, "but he knows how to get the McGreevey administration down the road, politically."
Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group, said that all of the appearances by the governor and his commissioner amounted to political posturing by an administration desperate to burnish its smart-growth credentials. Nonetheless, she, for one, welcomed it, and said that it was a good thing for the governor to put his best strategist on the job.
"We are still concerned that they are using it as a piggy bank for political favors," Ms. Bauer said. "But enough things are happening that are showing them to be very different from and better than the Whitman administration."
For David Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University, this is the key to the McGreevey-Fox tandem. Transportation -- whether roads, rails, E-ZPass or motor vehicle inspections -- has in many ways been the soft underbelly of Republican support in the northern and central suburbs. It is also an issue that allows a governor -- who Mr. Rebovich said styles himself as the champion of working people and families -- to build a bridge.
"It cuts across class lines and the fact that Fox is so experienced and such an adept political advocate means that transportation is that important an issue for McGreevey," said Mr. Rebovich.
Mr. Fox, who did not return calls seeking comment, spent more than 20 years working as a chief aide to such powerful Democrats as Senator Robert Torricelli, former Senator Frank Lautenberg and former Gov. James Florio. He was also executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, playing a major role in the Democrats' march to retake the majority and building contacts among unions, business leaders and policymakers.
He was a late addition to the McGreevey cabinet, but since signing on in March he has played a large role in revamping the leadership at New Jersey Transit and resolving disputes over parking for those who take express buses to New York from Willowbrook Mall, all with a keen eye to maximizing the political benefit with the ever-important commuting constituency.
He was with Governor McGreevey at last month's unveiling of new rail cars in Newark, and would have been with him at the groundbreaking of a new Montclair State University train station if he had not been dispatched to quell a political brush fire elsewhere. When the governor sought to convey to Bergen County lawmakers that he was serious about a plan to redevelop the Continental Airlines Arena site with rail access to the Meadowlands, he assigned Mr. Fox -- a move that helped convince wary officials and business leaders to at least listen.
Yet some familiar with state government dispute the significance of all of this. One former senior state transporation official accused the McGreevey administration of "picking the low-hanging fruit" by announcing with fanfare projects that had already been advanced by the previous administration.
And a lobbyist for leading business interests as well as a lobbyist for an environmental group saw it all as having no more political significance than parading projects that will bolster support for the administration among the Democratic Party's labor base while signaling to economic development and business interests that despite the budget gaps there still a lot going on.
Still, both of those sources conceded that it was a "savvy approach" by the governor and his transportation commissioner, who was "a consummate policy guy as well as political operative."
Leonard Resto, president of the Association of Rail Passengers in the state, said it was a bit early to judge what Mr. Fox and Governor McGreevey are up to, but they have been "proactive in attacking the crowding issues on the trains and generally paying more attention to public transit than other administrations did."
The political benefits are clear.
"They are appearing in public and looking to address transportation as a key issue and they know that this is an important issue to New Jerseyans," said Mr. Resto. "Jamie Fox seems very well connected with both Washington and state politicians and he knows his way around."
Ms. Bauer was more emphatic.
"I think Jamie Fox has a role in this administration that goes well beyond transportation commissioner," she said. "He just happens to be the transportation commissioner."

Make No Little Plans

BYLINE:  By LUCIUS J. RICCIO; Lucius J. Riccio was city transportation commissioner from 1990 to 1993. He is senior vice president of Urbitran Associates, an engineering firm, and teaches business and engineering at Columbia University.

 BODY:
HOW is New York different from Shanghai, Sao Paulo and Mexico City? For one thing, these cities are growing and New York is stalled. Shanghai's leaders, in fact, have resolved to make it the world's leading city by 2020. They are taking full advantage of their harbor and rail links to become a center of trade, finance and culture.
 Could Shanghai really surpass New York? Yes, because they have a plan to do it and New York is resting on its laurels. Without a plan for growth, New York will not move beyond being a tourist attraction. 
 New York has about the same number of people and jobs as it had 50 years ago. But the mix of jobs has changed, probably for the worse. We've lost our manufacturing base and concentrated our fortunes on the volatile financial services industry, which fluctuates more than the tides. We added jobs in the 90's, but those just made up for those lost in the late 80's. We're going nowhere but sideways.
Cities that want to grow do at least two things: they foster businesses that expand their economic base, and they build an infrastructure to support physical growth. New York's growth has come in waves, and each wave followed, or was accompanied by, a major expansion in its exports and transportation systems. The two are related. 
Initially, New York was blessed with a harbor that let it surpass all other East Coast cities as an economic power. Subsequently, the Erie Canal opened the productivity of America's heartland to the world, via New York. Later, the creation of the subway system enabled New York's population to grow fast enough to support its explosive economic growth.
None of those developments provide us with any significant advantage now, and we have nothing to replace them with. 
In the 1950's we lost our harbor. Norfolk, Va., is now the top East Coast port, largely because it has rail links to the entire continent and New York City does not. As for the scenic Erie Canal, it now serves no transportation purpose. And while the subway system grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century, not a single new line was build in the second half. Any capacity gained through extending lines or adding tunnels failed to compensate for losses like the Third Avenue el.
Our transportation system can't support significant growth. It is maxed out. So are the roads and bridges. Our airports are inadequate. Ferries are charming, but for New York to depend on them would be like Shanghai depending on sampans.
If New York is to avoid becoming a second-tier city, it must take several steps. First, it needs an economic development policy that diversifies and expands the types of businesses we can call our own. Thirty years ago it was obvious that computers were going to be a critical element of the economy. Today, the city has millions of computers. How many were built here? Essentially zero. We could have built an industry around just our own need. 
Second, we have to build major new transportation systems to make the city more livable and economically stronger. A cross-harbor tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey is essential, as is extending rail lines to the airports. Most critical is doubling the size of the subway system. We need not only the Second Avenue line and the extension of the No 7 line down the West Side, but also the addition of one new line each decade for the next 100 years.
We must also shift our priorities. Consider the Williamsburg Bridge, which was built for subways. In the 1920's it carried 500,000 people to Manhattan daily. Then someone had the bright idea of using it mostly for cars. The bridge currently is at full capacity, carrying 250,000 people per day by car and train.
Over the last few hundred years, London, Paris and Madrid justifiably laid claim to being the world's leading city. No longer can they make that claim. One hundred years ago, New York's leaders invested in a series of public works -- like bridges, aqueducts and rail systems -- that kept New York a major city for decades after those investments stopped. We cannot continue to rely on those old decisions for the next 100 years.

HEADLINE: Just Around the Next Curve Lurks a $2.6 Billion Question 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
EVERY rush hour, morning and evening, traffic backs up for miles through Morristown as commuters jockey and cram their way through the long-outdated interchange linking Interstate 287 and Route 24.
 "It is a series of lanes all merging together," said Mayor John DeLaney of Morristown. "It is like trying to put all of the traffic through a straw." 
 State highway planners have felt the pain, and say they would like to do something about it: namely, build a new interchange between the two highways. A similar plan did away with a logjam just a few miles north, at the intersection of Interstates 287 and 80. 
The problem is the state Department of Transportation does not have the money to do the job. And as the State Legislature lurches into the final stages of passing this year's austerity budget, the people in charge of fixing the state's bridges and highways are quietly spreading the word that next year will be even worse.
"We need to come up with additional funding by the end of next year to do the work that is needed in this state," said James P. Fox, the Transportation commissioner. "Everyone acknowledges that. The question is how much and how do we pay for it."
In fact, Mr. Fox has a pretty good idea how much money the repairs will require: Over the next five years, the state will have to raise an additional $2.6 billion to maintain its roads and to keep commuter trains and buses rolling.
As if that were not daunting enough for a fiscally challenged administration, more challenges are coming down the track. Last week, officials at the federal Transportation Department said they were going to recommend that states assume part of the cost of running Amtrak, the financially troubled national railroad system. That could become a particularl burden for New Jersey as Amtrak now pays for the maintenance of the section of the Northeast Corridor rail line that runs between New York and Philadelphia, which carries tens of thousands of New Jersey commuters each day.
While officials of New Jersey Transit said they would keep the line running no matter what the federal plan called for, they declined to say how much money their agency could lose if Amtrak's service was scaled back in the region.
"We have not had a chance to look at this, so I can't comment beyond that," said Ken Miller, a New Jersey Transit spokesman.
Martin E. Robins, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, said that New Jersey Transit had already paid about $50 million a year to Amtrak for use of the Northeast Corridor track, and acknowledged that there was now a possibility that New Jersey might be asked to come up with more.
"There is a very distinct possibility of the federal government assuming that the state of New Jersey should pay more," Mr. Robins said. "This could be a major bill for an agency that is already very stressed."
Taken together, experts agree that the state's transportation system will find itself at a crucial juncture next year. Despite some creative financing to squeeze dollars for major projects -- like persuading the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to finance the $250 million purchase of double-decker rail cars for New Jersey Transit -- the state no longer has enough money to repave cracking roads and refurbish aging trains. 
The stark choice, as Mr. Fox sees it, is between finding new sources of money or putting off sorely needed maintenance. As transportation experts see it, delaying these projects will only lead to long-term -- and more severe -- problems.
"We return to the bad old days of the 1970's when we deferred maintenance and disappoint everyone and hurt the economic vitality of the state," said Mr. Robins. "It was very stressful and very harmful to the state."
Transportation is no small matter in a state that sits at the center of the bustling Northeast corridor. Many of New Jersey's businesses rely directly on the state's network of highways, and tens of thousands of residents depend on mass transit to get to and from work each day.
Indeed, Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, a Republican from Morris Plains who is a member of the Assembly transportation committee, said it was difficult to overestimate the importance of the state's roads and rail system.
"Transportation is the cornerstone of the economic viability of the state," Mr. DeCroce said.
In all likelihood, the source of funds will be the state's Transportation Trust Fund, a giant pot of money that is primarily filled with the receipts from the gasoline tax. Although Mr. Fox declined to say whether he would recommend that the Legislature consider increasing the gas tax to pay for repairs, many observers here say that it is the probable source of any new money -- if for no other reason than it may be the only possible source.
And while the $2.6 billion represents a sizable shortfall for a department with an annual budget of about $3 billion, the money problems have been accumulating for several years. 
The problem, transportation experts say, is that there is little money left in the trust fund to pay for maintenance even though it takes in more than $500 million a year, almost all of which is committed to pay off bonds that earlier administrations issued to finance their transportation projects.
"They were spending more money, but the gasoline tax did not increase," Mr. Robins said. "It was all shifted into bonding, and there were these huge bond sales every year."
Mr. Robins likened the strategy to buying a new house year after year: You might be able to afford the down payments, but after a while the growing mortgage payments eat up all the money.
The Transportation Trust Fund was created by the State Legislature in 1984 as a solution to the chronic maintenance problems that plagued the state's highways in the 1970's. Tom Kean, who was governor at the time, wanted the fund to provide a stable source of revenue to repair roads, and for more than 10 years the state spent little more than the fund took in to pay for projects. But in 1995, Mr. Robins said, Gov. Christie Whitman decided to use revenue dedicated to the fund to issue highway bonds, rather than to make payments on ongoing projects.
The bonds allowed the state to drastically increase the amount of money for transportation projects, and more importantly, it allowed state officials to do so without increasing taxes. Consequently, spending from the fund increased to about $900 million.
"The dark side is that the funding never changed, and the money became obligated to paying the debt," Mr. Robins said. "The debt service is now somewhere on the order of $450 to $500 million a year."
That may lead to a decision that New Jersey politicians fear more than almost anything else -- and indeed something Governor McGreevey had pledged not to do: raise taxes. New Jersey's gasoline tax, at 10.5 cents per gallon, is the fourth lowest in the United States and was last raised in 1988. The state estimates that each penny increase in the tax would bring in about $45 million in revenue.
The question is whether Governor McGreevey, who is desperately trying to avoid increasing taxes, would raise the gas tax next year.
"It would be an easier sell than either a sales or an income tax hike," said David P. Rebovich, managing director of the Rider University Institute for New Jersey Politics. 
On one hand, Mr. Rebovich said that polls have shown that New Jersey residents feel that transportation is an area of state government that could be trimmed to cut state expenses. But on the other, he said, transportation spending is an area that is typically supported by business groups, which recognize its importance to the state's economy.
"If he can make the argument that the key to the state's economy is that New Jersey is a transportation hub and without maintenance and upgrades the economy could suffer," Mr. Rebovich said, then an increase in the gas tax might be more palatable.
But Paul S. Aronsohn, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. McGreevey had not decided what to do about next year's transportation funds.
"Our focus right now," Mr. Aronsohn said, "is on balancing the budget."

The Work Fo rce Is There. It Just Needs a Company.

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
When a company shuts down an operation, the affected employees are likely to scatter as they look for work elsewhere. But not the 360 employees of FCI Electronics in Clearfield, Pa., who were told last spring that their jobs would be cut in October when a plant in the town closes.
 They have another idea. Instead of leaving Clearfield, which is in the central part of the state, to find a new employer, they are trying to lure a company to the town. 
 In solicitations online and in trade magazines, the employees, who make components for the telecommunications and computer industries, have been promoting themselves as a made-to-order work force. They have also set up a Web site, at www.clearfieldworks.com.
"A lot of us have grown up here, we walk to work and our kids go to school here," said Jim Afton, 37, a senior engineer who has been at FCI for 15 years. "Instead of disbanding and going our separate ways, we wanted to do something different."
Employment experts say the workers face long odds. "There are at least some indications companies are picking locations based on the work force, but you've got to have a pretty tight labor market," said Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Still, Adam Bruns, managing editor of Site Selection, a publication specializing in corporate real estate and economic development, said the fact that the employees were "already familiar with operating in the high-tech milieu" might help.
So far, there have been no takers.
FCI, a unit of Areva, which is based in Paris, has been laying off employees worldwide since last year because of weak sales. It announced in April that it was closing the Clearfield plant, which had been in operation since 1966. Sheila Himes, an FCI spokeswoman, said the Clearfield employees were not offered jobs at the company's two other Pennsylvania plants. Vivian Marino

BYLINE:  By MARGO NASH 

DATELINE: RED BANK 

 BODY:
VIEW ASKEW, Kevin Smith's film production company, based in Red Bank, has a vision of the Garden State that is no rose garden, and his fans like it that way. 
 Since "Clerks" was released in 1994, admirers have been making a kind of pilgrimage to his comic book and toy store, and to Leonardo to see the Quick Stop where he made the movie "Clerks" for under $30,000 while he was working there. 
 "Clerks," which won the Filmmakers Trophy at Sundance, started Mr. Smith's career not only as a filmmaker but also as an A-list comic book writer. 
"Vulgar," View Askew's most recent film, was released in April to mixed reviews. Henry Sheehan, film critic for The Los Angeles Times, praised the film's cinematography, but called some of the language "repulsive." The talk show host Howard Stern was more direct, pronouncing it "the worst movie ever made."
"Vulgar" has disappeared from theaters, but it and the other offbeat movies that have come out of View Askew -- in which convenience store clerks are philosophers, drug dealers are heroes and God saves the world from two evil angels in Red Bank -- have built a worldwide following. Some of those fans travel long distances to experience Mr. Smith's New Jersey.
" 'Clerks' is one of my favorite movies," said Alexander Vuijsje, a 29 year-old journalist from Amsterdam, who was recently vacationing in the United States.
A fan of Mr. Smith's films, he made the trek by train and taxi to Red Bank, to Jay & Silent Bob's Secret Stash, Mr. Smith's store on Broad Street. Then he traveled to Leonardo to see the Quick Stop. 
What had he seen to make the 20-minute ride worthwhile? "Well, nothing," he replied pleasantly. Still, it was worth it, he said. 
"Every day, there's a couple of people who come because of the movie," said Sarla Thapar, president of the convenience store on Leonard Avenue. "Sometimes groups." 
"Some come from London, some come from Australia and Spain," she said. "They just walk around and take pictures. They get excited. 'Ah, this is the place. This is the place,' they say." 
Fans who go to Jay & Silent Bob's Secret Stash often ask to see Mr. Smith, said Walter Flanagan, the store manager. 
Unfortunately for visitors, Mr. Smith is not there often. But when he comes to town, Mr. Flanagan said, he does stop in.
The store sells action figures, video games, View Askew T-shirts, DVD's of Mr. Smith's films and comic books, including the ones Mr. Smith writes: "Daredevil," "Green Arrow," "Clerks" and "Bluntman & Chronic." 
Fans can gaze at Mr. Smith's statue or at the coat and hat he wore as the "Clerks" character Silent Bob, which are on display in a glass case. 
"The Stash has been drawing from as far away as Alaska and France since we opened our doors back in '97," Mr. Smith said. "But remove the economics from the equation, and you're left with the real reason both our production office and comic book store make their homes in Red Bank: It's one hell of a picturesque town." 
View Askew's headquarters is tucked away in an office building on Harding Road, where a creature from another cinematic realm, the Star Wars mobster Jabba the Hutt, guards the reception area. 
The company has a laid-back family atmosphere, said Monica Hampton, the producer of "Vulgar." 
"Kevin is totally supportive of his friends," she said. 
One of them is Ming Chen, the "Viewaskewinverse" Web master, who is responsible for View Askew news and merchandise orders on the Internet. Visitors to the Web site (www.viewaskew.com) can order "Dogma" caps, "Clerks" lunchboxes and a collector's edition of "Chasing Amy," autographed by the director.
Mr. Chen designed the site while he was a student at the University of Michigan. 
"Back when I was in college, I created a fan site for 'Clerks,' " he said. "I was hoping to find other fans I could talk to about the movie. Two or three months after I put it up, Kevin checked it out at a local Internet cafe in Red Bank. He was so impressed that he gave me a call the next day." 
Mr. Chen ran the View Askew site from college, and now works full time in Red Bank. "I still see everything from a fan's perspective," he said. "The typical fan is 18 to 32. The films tap into people my age who are into pop culture references like 'Star Wars.' "
That would include Mr. Vuijsje, the Dutch tourist. He bought some mementos of his trip, among them a "Clerks" action figure from Jay & Silent Bob's Secret Stash, and some peanuts from the Quick Stop.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BRONX UP CLOSE; 
Is Melrose a Melrose By Any Other Name?

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Ana Aquino is a 54-year-old physical therapist who lives in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx. But ask where she's from, and the best she can do is refer to the largest nearby street, Andrews Avenue. "There is no neighborhood name," Ms. Aquino explained. "It's all part of the Bronx." 
 Although residents of leafy Riverdale, coastal Throgs Neck, sprawling Co-op City and a handful of other Bronx communities have a keen sense of belonging to a specific neighborhood, many in the southern half of the borough, in places like Melrose, Mott Haven and Morrisania, would be hard pressed to name the community they call home. 
 It is not that Bronx communities' names are absent on popular maps. More than three dozen are indicated on the M.T.A.'s borough bus map, and the Department of City Planning's Web site cites about 50 separate communities.
The identity crisis is rooted in the borough's history. Initially, urbanization came to the Bronx so quickly and so intensely that many communities were settled long before labels could be attached to them. Even as subway lines from Manhattan were being planned, real estate developers started erecting buildings to attract a new generation of Bronx residents.
"Almost all of the previous history was erased because of that vast construction," said Lloyd Ultan, the borough historian. 
Subsequent population shifts further blurred an already foggy collective memory. The sweeping demographic and economic changes in the South Bronx that began in the 1950's, with the influx of Puerto Ricans and the flight of the middle class from many entrenched communities, further complicated the picture. As the blight of the South Bronx spread, the borough's entire southern part became subsumed under that rubric. 
Nowhere is the picture more unclear than along Southern Boulevard south of the Bronx Zoo, which Hagstrom identifies on its city map as both East Tremont and Bronx Park South. "All this area is Southern Boulevard," said Mpani Pile Ayorgo, who lives nearby. But neither Hagstrom, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority nor the City Planning Department give Southern Boulevard neighborhood status.
Confusion reigns elsewhere. One version of Hagstrom shows Concourse Village, a specific housing development, as a neighborhood that stretches west to the area near Yankee Stadium, which no local would call Concourse Village. That, of course, is the neighborhood known as "near Yankee Stadium."
With all these vagaries, "The Bronx: 61 Neighborhoods Strong," the oddly precise slogan of Bronx Week 2002, which ended June 15, raised a few eyebrows. According to a spokesman for Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr., the figure came from the City Planning Department. No, it didn't, said a department spokeswoman.
Finally, a truce. 
"Our use of the number is just to get across the idea that the Bronx is an amalgam of many communities and many different people," said Fred Winters, speaking for the borough president.
Names or no names, the borough is filled with neighborhoods. "They're basically defined by where you walk," Mr. Ultan said. "You walk to the subway station, you walk to the supermarket. That's your neighborhood." SETH KUGEL

Lessons FromNetworks, Online and Other

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
ALBERT-LASZLO BARABASI, a professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame, became fascinated with the structure of the Internet in 1998. He and his student researchers designed software robots that went out on the Net and mapped as many of its nodes, hubs and links as they could. He then began studying other networks and found that they had similar structures. The Internet in particular, he found, had taken on characteristics of a living ecosystem.
 That made for a valuable insight in itself. But Professor Barabasi went a step further and analyzed the genetic networks of various living organisms, finding that their genes and proteins interacted in much the same networked way as the Internet. 
 This conclusion, described in Professor Barabasi's new book, "Linked: The New Science of Networks" (Perseus Publishing, $26), could alter the way we think about all the networks that affect our lives. Those networks may be Hollywood power brokers, Vernon E. Jordan Jr.'s corporate board directorships or Al Qaeda terrorists. The Apostle Paul had a network of cities to spread Christianity.
Professor Barabasi's well written book will be understandable to most readers, but its core concept takes a moment to absorb.
Start by thinking of a highway map of the United States before the advent of the Interstate System. Each city, or node, was connected pretty much at random to others in the network of American cities. Each city has the same relative weight, or "scale," in Professor Barabasi's terminology. Knocking out one city doesn't disrupt the network. Traffic can be rerouted easily.
In contrast, consider the airport hub-and-spoke system that dominates the nation's airline transportation. A few nodes like Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth have become far more important than, say, Lincoln, Neb. Knocking out the important nodes has serious cascading effects throughout the network.
This is similar to a disruption on the Internet. Because the nodes of these networks do not have the same scale, Professor Barabasi calls them scale-free, a concept that permeates the book.
Once you understand that concept, you're off on an intellectual detective journey. Professor Barabasi has invented a vocabulary to talk about the structure of networks.
"We are witnessing a revolution in the making as scientists from all different disciplines discover that complexity has a strict architecture," he writes. These networks do not operate at random, the author contends; there are laws that govern their behavior.
In the case of human genes, scientists have decoded the genes and proteins of DNA, but that is just the first important step in understanding how genes and proteins interact, Professor Barabasi says. The next step, he writes, is understanding how genes and proteins interact as part of a network, and he predicts the discovery of a clear set of rules for their behavior that will help unlock some mysteries of the human body.
Professor Barabasi makes that prediction partly because he and his researchers mapped out the interactions of 43 primitive organisms and found they took the form of a network with rules.
There are many examples of scale-free networks. Even a cocktail party can be mapped that way: the most sociable people are the "hubs" that link all the guests in a pattern that can be drawn. Other scale-free networks include the electrical power grid, companies and consumers linked by trade and the nervous system of living creatures.
BUSINESS writers have long talked about "network effects," meaning that a network generates more power than individual parts can do by themselves. That was part of the intellectual case against allowing Microsoft to dominate so many personal computers using its operating system.
But Professor Barabasi has put more flesh on the relatively primitive concept of the network effect. His work is relevant not only to physicists and mathematicians, but also to business executives, computer scientists, sociologists and biologists.
Networks have strengths and weaknesses, and Professor Barabasi contends that we have to understand both. On the positive side, because of the multiplicity of connections, some things happen quickly. A good idea can win rapid acceptance.
Professor Barabasi uses the example of Hotmail's explosion in popularity. Created on July 4, 1996, by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, it had one million users within a year. By the time Microsoft came knocking on the door to buy it a year later, it had 10 million. "Innovations and products with a higher spreading rate have a higher chance of reaching a large fraction of the network," he argues. 
By contrast, networks have what he describes as an Achilles' heel. Knocking out a single major hub can cripple the network, which the Sept. 11 attacks almost succeeded in doing. In the United States, the airline system, financial markets and telecommunications networks all suffered grievous blows.
The extensions of Professor Barabasi's thinking go in many directions. What caused Cisco Systems and other technology companies that outsource much of their production to be so clobbered in 2000 and 2001? Cisco, in particular, had bragged that its Internet-based supply chain meant that it would never be surprised by having too much inventory. But, Professor Barabasi writes, Cisco did not understand network effects and had to pay for billions of dollars' worth of components in its extended supply chain; oddly, Cisco, the master of the network, didn't think in network terms.
"A me attitude, where the company's immediate financial balance is the only factor, limits network thinking," Professor Barabasi says. "Not understanding how the actions of one node affect other nodes easily cripples whole segments of the network."
Professor Barabasi makes a provocative argument about "the market." For hundreds of years, economists like Adam Smith have argued that there may be an "invisible hand" guiding the market but at the end of the day people cannot understand how the market works because it is too big, too complex, too random.
Nonsense, Professor Barabasi says. "In reality, the market is nothing but a directed network," he writes. "Companies, firms, corporations, financial institutions, governments, and all potential economic players are the nodes."
If you understand the structure and evolution of this network, you can, in fact, understand how the market performs, the author contends. That is sure to bring howls of derision from proponents of the dismal science known as economics.
If there is any criticism that can be leveled at him, it is that the reader is left wanting to understand more of the implications of his work. If we understand the network of the human body, can we cure cancer? If we understand the network of the global economy, can we stop recessions? If we understand the network of Al Qaeda, can we eradicate terrorism? The answers may be elusive, but Professor Barabasi's argument suggests that answers may indeed be found.

What The Nasdaq Means for The Dollar

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE strong dollar, which for many years has helped keep inflation low and foreign vacations cheap, is weakening.
 So far this year, the dollar has lost nearly 6 percent of its value against J. P. Morgan's trade-weighted index of a basket of currencies. The bank's currency analysts estimate that the dollar needs to fall an additional 10 to 15 percent before it can be considered fairly valued. 
 Richard Bernstein, the chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, took some time last week to talk about what a weaker greenback means for investors. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Is the decline in the dollar based on economic fundamentals?

A. As far back as 2000, we felt the main influences on the dollar were not the traditional ones like the current account, but that foreigners were selling local currency to get into the stock market bubble. Even today, there is a very close correlation between movements in the Nasdaq composite index and the dollar.
The stock market bubble was wildly influential in determining the performance of global currencies. In 2000 and 2001, a relationship we looked at a lot was the technology and telecommunications weight in the equity market of a country, and how that country's currency performed against the dollar. 
Currencies that were the weakest were those of countries with very little technology and telecommunications exposure in their home market.

Q. How can there be a correlation between the Nasdaq and the dollar if the Nasdaq has been falling for more than two years?

A. The dollar peaked after the Nasdaq did partly because non-U.S. investors continued to be heavy purchasers of U.S. stocks. The reason the dollar appears to be losing ground quite rapidly now is that foreigners are slowly but surely losing confidence in U.S. equities.

Q. A drop in the dollar's value will help American exports. Isn't that good news for American companies?

A. The good news is that a weaker dollar is very good for corporate profits. The strong dollar is one reason companies have suffered.
There was a vicious cycle that ran during the bubble of 1998 through 2000: People believed that technology was the only sector that could grow. That bid up technology stocks and bid up the dollar, which in turn depressed earnings of a lot of nontechnology companies. That in turn reinforced the view of technology's strength. 
Now, earnings in a lot of these other sectors may rise, which could reinforce the view that technology is no longer a growth sector. 

Q. Shouldn't technology companies, which sell a lot of their products abroad, benefit from a weaker dollar?

A. Actually, technology is by far the most foreign-exposed sector.
But we don't think the dollar will weaken enough to make up for the tech sector's problems, which are much more serious than a falling dollar could help. The sector is fragmented. It won't be a growth sector again until you see a lot of consolidation.

Q. So which sectors stand to benefit most from a weaker dollar?

A. The four sectors that would rise to the top are consumer staples companies, manufacturers, raw-materials companies and energy companies.
Consumer staples, which includes household products, beverages and personal care companies, is one of our favorite sectors. We think people are vastly underestimating the cyclicality of the sector. In 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, for example, these companies performed miserably. Why can't that work in reverse when the dollar weakens?

Q. Do any sectors of our stock market stand to fare poorly if the dollar's slide continues?

A. There isn't a lot that fares tremendously badly. Smaller stocks are much more domestically oriented and are not expanding across borders. They may benefit indirectly.

Q. How will a falling dollar affect the bond market?

A. There is every reason to believe that long-term interest rates might go up, but it is the expectation for slightly higher inflation that will push rates, because a weaker dollar pushes up import prices.

Q. At the moment, most analysts seem to expect that the dollar will stage a soft landing. But some fear that the currency could go into a free fall. Where do you stand?

A. We are looking for a period of orderly weakness, but not a collapse. A hard landing for the dollar is unlikely. The faster and more disorderly the fall, the more disruptive it would be.

After Pausing, Income Gap Is Growing Again

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE booming 1990's have been gone long enough to begin identifying the lasting improvements that those prosperous years made in our lives -- and the promises that faded.
 Personal computers and the Internet spread everywhere, enhancing communication in endless, permanent ways. Corporate productivity rose significantly for the first time since the early 1970's and some of that enriching gain seems likely to endure in the post-boom years. Wages are another matter; the promise evaporated. 
 The hope was that income inequality would finally lessen, or at least stop growing. And it did stop for a while. But the brief respite demonstrated how deeply embedded income inequality has become in the last 20 years, suspending its destructive inroads only in an overheated economy. 
"What you would expect from the strongest economy in a generation was to see income inequality diminish," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "Instead we just held our ground."
Americans often think of income inequality as pertaining to the really rich -- executives and highfliers in the 99th percentile of the income scale -- pulling rapidly away from the rest of the population. But the income inequality embedded in our system is a more down-home phenomenon.
Rather than millionaires, the men and women at the upper end who figure in many studies of income inequality are those in the 90th percentile, earning $1,440 a week, on average, today. Their wages, adjusted for inflation, have risen steadily since the early 1980's while the wages of those in the middle ($646 a week) and at the low end ($307) have stagnated or lost ground to inflation. The break in this pattern occurred in 1996 and lasted through most of 1999, when the wages of all three groups rose smartly and at the same rate. Then suddenly, in the final months of 1999, the weekly wages of those at the upper end pulled away again.
That is the surprising new finding of Mr. Bernstein and his organization. While the Economic Policy Institute is known for its liberal views, its detailed analyses of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are accepted as accurate by most economists and policy makers. In his latest study, Mr. Bernstein focused on the bedrock labor force: full-time workers at least 25 years old. He counted only their wages, overtime, commissions and tips, not bonuses, profit sharing or stock options: the earnings of ordinary folk, in other words.
While the wage spread between the high end and the middle was $707 a week in the fall of 1999, it had widened to $790 in this year's first quarter, adjusted for inflation. The $83-a-week difference may be a car loan payment or the extra cost of healthier food. That gave the upper end another leg up in living standards, which is what makes income inequality so divisive.
WHEN the wages of all three groups were rising in tandem in the boom years, Mr. Bernstein argued that a tight labor market and the strong demand for workers had halted the growth in income inequality. What the nation needed, he said, were policies that kept the unemployment rate at around 4 percent. But the unemployment rate was still falling toward 4 percent in late 1999 when the wages at the upper end separated from the pack and took off.
Hours may have played a role. About that time, overtime hours began to fall, an early warning that the boom was starting to fade. Manufacturing workers in particular collected smaller weekly paychecks. They are mostly men. Income inequality, in fact, is mainly brought on by men; women's wages at the high end, middle and low end have risen in tandem through the 1980's and 90's.
Some labor economists contend that the rise in income inequality is largely a result of the demand for skilled, college-educated workers in an ever more high-technology workplace. These skilled workers are indeed the people in Mr. Bernstein's high-end group. But David Card, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that the demand for high-technology workers was never greater than in the late 1990's, and yet wages rose across the board.
The decline in union bargaining power for middle and low-end workers has clearly limited raises. So has the reluctance of Congress to raise the minimum wage as often as in the past. Above all, employers have abandoned what Mr. Card describes as "the natural order of salaries," the once-flourishing custom of maintaining wages, including the chief executive's, in a fixed range.
For a while, the booming 1990's restored a fixed range, raising hopes of a lasting solution to income inequality. And now we are learning that the solution failed to last even as long as the boom.

HEADLINE: Business; 
Recovery in Technology Spending Is Still Elusive

BYLINE:  By RUSS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
EVERY quarter since the technology boom ended, hopeful forecasters have predicted that a recovery in business technology spending is just a couple of quarters away. "Eventually, they're going to be right," joked Kevin M. Landis, who runs Firsthand Funds, which focuses on technology stocks.
 It is not likely to happen anytime soon. While other areas are showing tentative signs of strength, technology remains in a deep funk. 
 The reasons go beyond the weak economy. Perhaps for the first time since the invention of the computer, technology is outpacing customers' needs, industry executives say. The equipment of today, they add, can generally handle most of what software users throw at it, meaning that companies will not replace equipment as often -- a trend that they say will outlast the current economic sluggishness. The business software sector, meanwhile, has grown intensely competitive, and vendors are under severe price pressure. 
Technology executives have pounded a steady beat of dour prognostication in recent weeks. First, I.B.M.'s chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, said, "It's clear the industry is not bouncing back this year," adding that next year did not look much better. Then the chief of Hewlett-Packard, Carleton S. Fiorina, said the "spending environment remains tough around the world" for technology.
On June 11, Kenneth A. Goldman, the chief financial officer of Siebel Systems, said that trying to sell software is "frankly more challenging" now than it was last year. And last year was dismal. Siebel's shares tumbled 14 percent the next day. The company makes software for customer relationship management, a software area that analysts expect to perk up early in any technology comeback.
Also this month, Intel warned that microprocessor sales were weakening, sending chip stocks reeling. And on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices said its sales are expected to be well below already low estimates.
Chief executives who have clamped down on technology spending to protect scarce profits lack vision, some technology boosters say. "Technology is one of the main drivers of productivity," said Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America in Arlington, Va. "The challenge is to remind C.E.O.'s and C.F.O.'s of that, so they're more willing to spend money."
But many top executives say they do not need to be reminded. As Nigel W. Morris, the president and chief operating officer at Capital One Financial, puts it: "We're willing to spend a dollar to make more than a dollar back." What is different now is that top executives see no need to keep increasing technology spending at anywhere near the pace of the last several years.
After splurging on multimillion-dollar, multiyear software projects from Oracle, SAP, Siebel and PeopleSoft and others, businesses are buying software in smaller pieces -- when they buy at all. They also report a move toward lower prices and better contract terms, which they expect to continue as software companies compete more aggressively.
If technology faces a long, grinding road to recovery, it is not because large corporations doubt technology's power. The impressive productivity growth of the last decade continued through the recession -- up 4.2 percent over the last year -- and at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2002, the highest in 19 years. Figuring into those statistics, of course, are wide layoffs that force remaining workers to pick up the slack. But few economists doubt that technology has played a big role.
"Technology is the fulcrum of our business," said Mr. Morris of Capital One. Considered by industry analysts as perhaps the shrewdest user of information technology in the credit card business, Capital One slices and dices data to offer high-margin products. Its customer base has increased to 45 million worldwide today from 5 million in 1995, while profits have grown 20 to 40 percent annually since 1995.
EXECUTIVES at Waste Management, the long-troubled garbage hauler, focused on new systems to help revive its fortunes. "Our stock went from 13 to 28 bucks over the last 30 months, and we couldn't have done that without technology," says Thomas L. Smith, senior vice president for information technology.
At Royal Bank of Canada, Martin J. Lippert, vice chairman and chief information officer, acknowledged that his company became caught up in the "silliness" of the late 1990's, expecting, for example, that customers wanted to check bank statements on wireless devices.
Still, Mr. Lippert said, the bank continues to "take a lot of the technologies that grew up in the dot-com boom and put them to practical uses." The company has moved aggressively into online banking and now aims to eliminate $1 billion in costs over several years, in large part through technology. A Web-based system to let customers reorder checks online saves $19 million a year, Mr. Lippert said. Another system allows a customer to make address changes remotely in a single step, saving Royal $38 million in annual mailing costs.
All these executives say they will continue to modernize aggressively. But because they will be spending less on each piece of hardware and software, and because they will extend the lifetime of equipment they already have, technology companies may well find a return to their glory days elusive.
It is almost as if Moore's Law has turned around to bite the industry that created it. Moore's Law says processing power doubles about every 18 months, or, conversely, that the cost of a single unit of computing power is cut in half.
Equipment capabilities are advancing faster than demand for extra power -- a switch from the days when a new computer seemed outmoded the minute it was bought. "The PC's coming out today have 2-gigahertz processors, 512K memory, 60-gigabyte hard drives," Mr. Lippert said. "There just aren't a lot of applications" big enough to drive that.
Several chief information officers said they were not planning to buy many more PC's, and that when they did, they would stretch the usual three-year replacement period to four or years or more -- unless a big, unanticipated application came along to chew up processing power again. "We used to refresh frequently," said Kenneth W. Lacy, the chief information officer at United Parcel Service. "We're not doing it as much."
Mr. Lacy is hardly abandoning technology investment. U.P.S. is putting the finishing touches on a highly automated distribution center in Louisville, Ky., that will pump through 50,000 more packages an hour than the center it replaces. Like other information officers, Mr. Lacy is finding more powerful equipment available at cheaper prices.
This is true for servers, for example, the specialized computers that store data and applications and "serve" them to PC's and other machines, including home computers via the Web. Users are finding ways to turn one big server into several small ones, saving on both hardware and maintenance. An I.B.M. mainframe can, in effect, be "partitioned" into multiple servers that run the Linux operating system. Big Sun Microsystems machines can be carved up the same way. And the market for "blade" servers -- basically, small servers built on computer cards that can all fit on a single rack -- is growing fast. They can be linked and can provide the power of a big server for a fraction of the price.
Hand-held devices are replacing bigger computers, too. One information officer says that as soon as devices like the BlackBerry and the Palm can handle e-mail attachments reliably, he plans to start providing them as replacements for more expensive laptops. That is good news for makers of hand-held devices. But each generation of smaller, faster, more efficient machines means smaller profit margins as well. That is good for the consumer, but tougher to make money on.
The software industry has long had rich profit margins. Either a software company makes it or it does not, and when it does the returns are huge, especially if it dominates the market, as Microsoft does with Windows, or Oracle had until recently with its databases. Information officers expect software margins to narrow as competition increases and prices fall, particularly the software made by companies like Oracle, SAP, PeopleSoft and Siebel.
THESE companies make what is called enterprise software, which is at the heart of important business operations, from finance to human resources to customer service. They were big winners in the 1990's, when demand and prices were high.
But now, demand has collapsed and terms are changing. Prices are coming down. "The power has shifted," Mr. Morris of Capital One said.
The pricing pressure for software is expected to last beyond the tough times, just as it is for hardware. Each enterprise software maker originally specialized in something different -- Oracle in databases, PeopleSoft in human resources, Siebel in customer-relationship management, SAP in enterprise-resource planning, which covers a variety of back-office operations.
Now SAP and PeopleSoft are trying to get into Siebel's business, while Oracle tries to nose in on all three. Microsoft, meanwhile, is coming up from the low end, selling databases and other back-office software to smaller companies.
Some buyers appear to regard the turn of events with glee. "It's come full circle on them now," Robert L. Mayo, the chief information officer at Subaru of America, a part of Fuji Heavy Industries, said of the new price pressure on vendors. For example, Mr. Mayo said, "in the late 90's you couldn't get a fixed-price contract to save your life." Instead, software vendors charged by time and materials, and the costs ballooned, he said. Today, vendors readily agree to fixed-price contracts, he said, and are more willing to sell a big project in smaller pieces, rather than lock up a customer with a major contract over several years.
The entire enterprise software industry came under fire for enormous multiyear contracts that went out of control. One of the biggest was Nestle USA's contract with SAP -- a $200 million software project begun in 1997 and only now being completed.
Such "big bang" contracts proved enormously lucrative for software vendors. But their days may be numbered. "I talk to other C.E.O.'s, and I'm surprised at the emotion around this issue," says William A. Zollars, the chief executive of the Yellow Corporation, a trucking and logistics company. "Companies have gotten a little disillusioned with big-bang solutions."
Yellow created a subsidiary in 1995 to manage technology; it now has 325 employees. Mr. Zollars continues to invest, spending $80 million annually, but on "bite size" projects. "We never do anything we can't complete in under a year," he said.
Likewise, Mr. Morris of Capital One enforces what he calls the 10-10 rule: a project must take "no more than 10 months, no more than $10 million."
So technology investment continues -- but more efficient, more focused, with equipment and software that falls in price. By continuing to increase productivity, technology will keep helping the economy. How much the technology vendors will benefit is not yet known.

Deep in Brazil, a Flight of Paranoid Fancy

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
PUT reason aside, for a moment, and imagine this: American students are taught that the Amazon should be taken away from Brazil and made into an "international reserve" under United Nations administration. United States Army special forces are training in Florida to seize control of that zone once it is established. And, to accelerate the process, Harvard University advocates the immediate dismemberment of Brazil.
 All of this, of course, is pure imagination. The Brazilian imagination. 
 From birth, Brazilians are taught that "the Amazon is ours." But their government has never been able to exercise effective sovereignty over the region, which in any case remains an exotic mystery to most Brazilians. The result is a national paranoia: a conviction that outsiders -- especially the United States, with its checkered history in Latin America -- envy Brazil's ownership of the world's largest tropical forest and want it for themselves.
Since late last year, suspicions have been running unusually high because of a spurious map that appeared on Internet sites here and was quickly accepted as real by newspapers and radio talk show hosts. Taken from what was said to be a junior high school textbook used in the United States, the map claims that Americans have a "special mission" to wrest the Amazon from the eight "unintelligent and primitive" South American nations that control it.
Though the text is clearly a forgery (it is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors that no native English speaker would make), the controversy continues. Some Brazilians say the C.I.A. fabricated the map to discredit those who would defend the Amazon from foreign interlopers. Others don't care whether the map is authentic.
"The map may be a falsification, but that the United States covets the Amazon and wants to eliminate Brazil's sovereignty is beyond dispute," said Rubim Aquino, a high school history teacher here. He said he emphasizes that message to his students "whenever the opportunity arises."
The area the Brazilian government defines as "Amazonia Legal" occupies 60 percent of the country's territory. But it is home to fewer than 10 percent of its 175 million people. And most of the population lives south of the river, along the coast, and has never visited the region.
"The southerner doesn't know the Amazon and disdains the region and its people," said Lucio Flavio Pinto, a native of the Amazon state of Para who is editor of "Amazon Agenda," the leading newsletter about the region. "There is a tendency to transfer responsibility for problems to foreigners, so as to placate a guilty conscience and shift blame away from a national state" that has long treated the area as a stepchild.
Seen from the south, the Amazon seems a cornucopia of easily extracted oil, minerals, timber, medicinal plants and other riches. The harsh reality, though, is that the few projects foreigners have undertaken in the region, from the Ford Company's Fordlandia rubber plantation to Volkswagen's cattle ranch, have all failed because operating costs in the Amazon are so high and infrastructure so weak.
ONE of the great villains of Brazilian history is Henry Wickham, a British naturalist who is accused of having stolen rubber seeds a century ago and spirited them off to Malaysia. That led to the collapse of an Amazon rubber boom that had financed the building of an opera house in Manaus and allowed a few Brazilian tycoons to send their laundry to be cleaned in Europe, but had also enslaved thousands of rubber tappers.
What Brazilians still cannot bring themselves to admit is that Wickham had obtained legal permits to export the seeds. As Roberto Santos's "Economic History of the Amazon" and other books acknowledge, British and American companies sought to shift rubber production elsewhere because the Brazilian system of production was inefficient and had roused the ire of antislavery campaigners.
Today, the focus of Brazilian suspicions has shifted from rubber to biotechnology. To cite just one example, the country is rife with rumors that the National Cancer Institute in Washington has clandestinely sent bio-prospectors to steal medicinal plants. (The institute dismisses such tales.)
Such mythmaking helps explain the widespread acceptance given to the notorious map. It appears to have originated on a Web site operated by a right-wing nationalist military group, but Brazil's left has also shown a penchant for Amazonian fantasy.
At the moment, one favorite theory has to do with "Plan Colombia," the American effort to bolster Colombia's fight against drug traffickers and Marxist guerrillas. Leftist groups here say the real objective is to give the United States a foothold that would allow it to seize the Brazilian Amazon and thus command the southern flank of Venezuela's leftist president, Hugo Chavez.
Then there is Sivam, a $1.5 billion Amazon radar system being installed by an American company. Though the project will enhance Brazil's sovereignty over the region by allowing it to track and intercept planes smuggling drugs, arms and gold, many here are certain that its actual purpose is to allow the United States to gather information by satellite about oil and mineral resources it wants to exploit.
Some of these accusations are undoubtedly spreading because Brazil is in the throes of a presidential election campaigns, in which calls to defend the Amazon always please the crowds.
Unfortunately for Americans, there is probably little that can be done to convince Brazilians that such accounts are simply not true. As Mr. Pinto noted, the Amazon has the name it does because of a delusion: the first Europeans to visit thought they saw one-breasted woman warriors, like those in Greek mythology, on horseback along the bank of the river. "The Amazon has always been fertile ground for fables, which gives it a prominent place in the collective unconscious of this country," he said. "People create phantoms, and it does no good to refute them."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Robert N. Streed; 
Northern Select Equity Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY stocks have little appeal these days for Robert N. Streed, manager of the $400 million Northern Select Equity fund. 
 He sold most of the fund's stake in stocks in the first quarter of 2000. The stake had been more than 50 percent; it is now 9 percent. "I keep trying to get back into technology, but we can't find many fundamentally strong companies," Mr. Streed said from his office in downtown Chicago. 
 But he is finding plenty to buy among retailers, media and other consumer industries. "Consumer spending is the driver of the economy right now," he said, "and it tends to rebound early in the recovery."
The fund lost 2.8 percent a year, on average for the three years through Thursday, placing in the top 10 percent of all funds that buy large growth stocks. That fund group lost 10.6 percent a year, on average for the same period, according to Morningstar Inc., compared with a decline of 7.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. In the last 12 months, the fund lost 14.2 percent, compared with losses of 21 percent for its group and 16.3 percent for the index.
Mr. Streed, 46, is senior vice president of the Northern Trust Company, the fund's adviser. He also manages about $600 million in individual accounts.
Most of the fund's roughly 130 stocks are United States companies with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion. The average market cap of the portfolio is $28 billion.
To find potential purchases, Mr. Streed runs computer screens to come up with companies with above-average revenue growth in the last three years. The screens also seek strong earnings growth. 
"These tell me which companies have decent fundamental reported trends and some indication that projected earnings are rising," Mr. Streed said. "It's an easy way to flag catalysts that can lead to higher stock prices." Those catalysts can include new products or markets, cost-cutting or new management.
The initial screens come up with 200 to 300 companies. He analyzes their technical trading patterns, looking at stock trading volume, price trends and other factors over the last 18 months. 
"This year, we're looking for stocks that are standing still when others are falling," he said, "because it's a good indication that the stock prices will rise when the market finally turns around."
Among media businesses, Mr. Streed likes Westwood One, the radio programming company. "The best place to be in media right now is in national radio," he said, "because that's where advertising rates are going up the most and the fastest."
Wall Street projects per-share earnings growth in 2002 of 150 percent. That figure is so high, Mr. Streed said, partly because earnings growth was flat in 2000 and 2001. He started buying the stock in April 2001 and has paid $28 a share, on average, for the position. The stock now trades at $34.01.
Another holding is Kohl's, the fast-growing retailer based in Menomonee Falls, Wis. Mr. Streed calls the chain "a better mousetrap."
It has a better store format than its competitors, he said, and "carries more brands than most discounters and sells them for lower prices than retail department stores." Kohl's, which started from its Midwestern base, then moved into the Northeast, now wants to expand in Texas and California, Mr. Streed said. He started buying shares in December 2000, paying $62, on average. They now trade at $70.77.
MR. STREED also likes General Dynamics, the military contractor. "Unfortunately, the world isn't as safe as it used to be, and defense spending is going up," he said. 
The company has a diversified portfolio of military projects, he said, and about one-third of its revenue is generated by Gulfstream, a unit that makes private jets. "People expected Gulfstream's business to fall with the poor economy," he said, "but it's doing much better as the economy improves."
He began buying shares in October 2000 and has paid $86, on average, for the position. The shares now trade at $110.58.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
I'll Fix Your Computer if You Paint My Office

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Diane Doster decided to expand her personal-training business by creating CancerFit, a workout program intended for cancer patients. She was confident that her new enterprise would succeed, based on her extensive background in physical fitness, but she did not know how she would spread the word about the business.
 "As a small business, I didn't even know that I needed public relations," said Ms. Doster, 37, of Sedona, Ariz. "I certainly couldn't afford to pay for it." 
 As it turned out, she did not have to. Just as CancerFit was starting, Ms. Doster said, she met Mary Schnack, 43, who was undergoing treatment for uterine cancer and looking for a personal trainer. Ms. Schnack also happens to run her own public relations firm, based in Sedona.
So the two women agreed to barter their services: Ms. Schnack would participate in the CancerFit program in exchange for helping Ms. Doster publicize her business.
Businesses, of course, have been bartering for years. Many of them now use formal agreements or barter networks that require annual dues, usually around $100, and are based on elaborate point systems. (A dentist can swap services with a house painter and receive points that can be used, say, for airline tickets.) Swapping goods and services also allows businesses to preserve cash and unload excess inventory, among other things.
But arrangements like the one between Ms. Doster and Ms. Schnack have also been gaining in popularity, especially in a weak economy. Many people who are striking out on their own, perhaps after a recent layoff, will barter for services to keep their young businesses going.
"It's always been around, but more and more people are becoming aware of it," said Eva Rosenberg, who runs www.taxmama.com, a tax advice Web site, and is an enrolled agent in Las Vegas. "It's just a natural thing that people do, particularly when cash is tight."
Because some informal bartering arrangements are not detailed on paper, there are no precise ways to measure their total worth. But some tax experts say the estimated value of goods and services exchanged informally could exceed $5 billion annually in the United States. That is in addition to the nearly $8 billion in goods and services reported last year by businesses participating in formal barter networks worldwide, according to the International Reciprocal Trade Association in Rochester. It tracks 125 formal business barter networks worldwide.
Businesses that use informal bartering do not have to fill out lengthy forms or contracts -- they just make a deal and carry it out. Many of these barterers live in the same city and may find one another through word of mouth or through local business groups, newspapers or Internet chat rooms. Craigslist, an online bulletin board (www.craigslist.com), often posts informal barter opportunities in several cities, including San Francisco, New York, Atlanta and Chicago.
Shel Horowitz, a marketing consultant from Longmeadow, Mass., and a frequent barterer, says he often asks people whose products or services he is buying whether they are interested in bartering. He said he recently exchanged his marketing services with a professional videographer and with a company that provides credit card authorization services.
Another advantage of informal bartering is that participants do not have to constantly keep track of bartering points. Ms. Schnack, the public relations professional, said she had been a member of bartering networks in the past but often found it difficult to spend all of the points she had accumulated. Sometimes those points expire at the end of the year.
The operators of formal barter networks say they provide members with more bartering opportunities than they could find on their own, along with rules and regulations that protect barterers. "Everyone is treated like a first-class paying customer," said Lois Dale, president of Barter Advantage, a formal barter network based in Manhattan. To join her network, members must pay a $400 fee and provide $200 worth of goods and services initially, in addition to other administrative fees.
Informal arrangements do not cost anything up front but they do pose problems of their own. The first challenge, of course, is finding a barter partner. Some people may be insulted by proposals to barter instead of paying for services. Without a formal contract there is no protection against shoddy or incomplete work.
Ms. Rosenberg suggests that people who engage in informal bartering put their agreements in writing, making note of the services that each participant is to receive and their estimated value. That will also be useful when it comes time to file an income tax return, she said.
The Internal Revenue Service says that people who engage in barter, even informally, are required to report the fair market value of the goods or services received on their returns. Anthony Burke, an I.R.S. spokesman, said that "there is nothing to indicate that bartering is a major area of noncompliance."

HEADLINE: Alabama's Power Struggle 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 

 BODY:
THE really sultry weather will probably drift into this city around the Fourth of July, Dr. Jack Hasson figures, and then his asthma patients will become sicker.
 The humidity and air pollution will make drawing a breath bruising. On some days, after a morning run, Dr. Hasson can tell that he will be busy at work just by the way his own lungs feel. Asthma patients will stream into his pulmonology clinic, complaining that they cannot catch their breath. He will give stronger medication to most and hospitalize the frailest. 
 "It's frustrating that their condition is well controlled and they do fine and then their attacks are triggered by pollution," he said. "It just sabotages our work." 
The steel mills that once fired Birmingham's economy and filled it with blue smoke are mostly gone. The pollution that worries Dr. Hasson now is barely visible: a tremulous summer haze that washes in from three large coal-burning power plants that surround Birmingham and are owned by the Southern Company, one of the country's largest utility holding corporations. 
The pollution over Birmingham seems the inevitable side effect of being neighbors with such a big power company. Southern, which has headquarters in Atlanta, contends that anti-pollution improvements it is installing at its plants take time, because it has to make sure that the environmental science is sound and that the regulatory requirements are fair before investing billions of dollars.
But critics like Dr. Hasson and a range of environmentalists and regulators contend that Southern has always marshaled its considerable political and economic might to resist changes, particularly stricter environmental requirements, that threaten a comfortable status quo and healthy profits. Southern, for example, fought doggedly for years against the same federal regulations that have now compelled it to install new anti-pollution equipment at its power plants through the Southeast.
But after the arrival in Washington of an administration sympathetic to the energy industry, Southern has had greater success in challenging environmental initiatives. 
Ten days ago, the Bush administration handed energy companies a crucial victory, proposing to relax an important enforcement statute of the Clean Air Act. The statute, known as the new source review, requires them to install anti-pollution equipment on old upgraded coal-fired plants. 
Under the administration's proposal, companies like Southern would be in better position to win lawsuits that accuse them of violating the new source review statute.
Southern was the first to press for such a change. Its thoroughbred Washington lobbyists, like Haley Barbour, the former Republican Party chairman, and Marc Racicot, the current chairman, helped shape White House thinking on the issue. In the 2000 elections, Southern was one of the most generous contributors to the Republican Party.
Southern bridles at its growing anti-environmental reputation. "We think the Clean Air Act is a landmark piece of legislation," said Dr. Charles H. Goodman, senior vice president for research and environmental affairs at Southern, "and many people tend to imply that we will circumvent it."
MANY Alabamians could have said right away that Southern would prove formidable, after watching the company's local subsidiary, Alabama Power, finesse state politics and press its agenda. Alabama Power and its allies are among the top contributors to state elections, and former executives from Alabama Power hold important positions in the administration of Gov. Donald Siegelman. Few, if any, state regulators or politicians criticize the company publicly.
People here once considered the company one of the big mules, an alliance of Birmingham corporations and large agricultural interests that have dominated state politics for the last century, said Carl Grafton, a political science professor at Auburn University Montgomery.
The cost of such close relations is tangible everywhere, critics of Alabama Power say. The Clinton Justice Department sued Southern over five of Alabama Power's coal-fired plants, including the three near Birmingham, accusing them of violating the new source review statute.
Birmingham is in violation of federal air pollution standards for smog. Those violations, in turn, have driven away new businesses and cost the city about $1 billion in outside investment over five years, according to the Metropolitan Development Board, a regional economic development unit. Some dams that Alabama Power operates have ravaged the rivers and the land that lies below them, environmentalists and some federal regulators say. Levels of toxic mercury, in large part from an Alabama Power plant in the area, are disturbingly high in the waters around Mobile and in many area residents, according to an investigation by The Mobile Register. Critics are particularly angry that Alabama Power exports some electricity to other states, leaving Alabamians with the damage and the cleanup.
"It isn't just the state's power company," said Brad McLane, executive director of the Alabama Rivers Alliance and a vocal critic of Alabama Power. "It is the powerful company."
Southern, the largest coal-burning utility in the United States behind American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, does not apologize for fighting hard to protect its interests. Alabama Power's electricity rates are 15 to 17 percent lower than the national average, according to state regulators. Over all, Southern provides power to most of Georgia and Alabama and parts of Mississippi and the Florida Panhandle, a region with a rapidly growing population and with the advantage, the company said, of cheap electricity. At the same time, Southern has a return on investment of about 13 percent a year, higher than the industry average, and its shares are trading at a premium to those of other power companies. Southern asserts that all this would be jeopardized if it acquiesced to environmental regulations it finds onerous or irresponsible.
"We will make improvements when we have gone through with regulators, consumers and others that what needs to be done is well defined," Dr. Goodman said. "We have to balance everything that is doable."
But other companies and regulators say Southern's activism exceeds the workaday pragmatism that drives most corporations. Some power companies, like American Electric Power and the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans have accepted the view that current methods of burning fossil fuels contribute to global warming. Southern counters that the science is inconclusive, although it has reduced its own emissions of carbon dioxide, thought to cause global warming. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has pushed utilities to submit plans for the creation of regional transmission authorities to expedite the movement of power and smooth the patchwork nature of the deregulated market. Southern opposes deregulation in its backyard, and what it submitted to the commission was "the most stark" rejection of the commission's goals of any plan offered, one regulator said. 
"THEY will do anything it takes to win," said Eric V. Schaeffer, former head of civil enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency and now the director of the Rockefeller Family Fund's Environmental Integrity Project. When he resigned from the E.P.A. in February, Mr. Schaeffer complained that energy companies facing federal lawsuits under the new source review statute were lobbying the Bush administration to have it weakened. Southern has said previously that it has no qualms about lobbying regulators and politicians to review the statute in an effort to disable the lawsuits.
Mr. Schaeffer continued: "Some companies facing lawsuits say, 'Let's settle this.' Some will joust with you over the law. And then you have Southern, who says, 'This is our business and we will do whatever it takes to keep you out of it, and if that means going to White House and getting you rolled politically, we will do it.' " 
Among the plants that the Justice Department is suing is Southern's James H. Miller Jr. power plant, 30 miles northwest of Birmingham. Miller's enormous cooling tower rises like a spaceship from the lush, rolling countryside. In the lawsuit, the government contends that Southern increased the output from Miller without installing the proper pollution control equipment, violating the new source review statute. 
Elsewhere, utilities facing litigation have settled or are negotiating settlements with the Justice Department. Southern says that it did nothing wrong and that the E.P.A., in the late years of the Clinton administration, changed its interpretation of the new source review to pursue these lawsuits. The company plans to fight the suits in federal courts in Atlanta.
Alabama Power appears quite proud of Miller, a hamlet of smokestacks, boxy buildings and coal hills on the Black Warrior River that produces about 2,800 megawatts of electricity. (One megawatt is enough to power about 800 homes.) One steamy day, Willard Bowers, the vice president for external affairs at Alabama Power, showed a reporter the improvements made at Miller to reduce pollution. The plant, like all of Southern's coal-fired plants, burns low-sulfur coal. Miller pulverizes the coal as fine as talcum powder so it burns more efficiently. 
On a catwalk between two buildings, Mr. Bowers points out a 600-foot-high red crane and a swarm of men installing the first of four selective catalytic reduction systems, known as S.C.R.'s, part of an investment of $1.2 billion that Southern is making at plants in the Atlanta and Birmingham areas to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. That pollutant reacts with sunlight and creates ground-level ozone, or smog, the gas that inflames the lungs of people like asthma patients. 
In most of the country, cars contribute the greater proportion of nitrogen oxides to the air. But in the Birmingham area, about 60 percent of the pollutant comes from Alabama Power's nearby plants, county health officials say. Birmingham, the state's biggest city, and neighboring Shelby County are in violation of federal standards for nitrogen oxides. Once all the pollution control units are in place at Miller by May 2005, Alabama Power expects emissions of nitrogen oxides to fall by more than 80 percent. That, Alabama Power says, will put Birmingham in compliance with current federal air quality standards.
"Ozone is a health issue and we're the first to say it," Mr. Bowers said. He said pollution control units were going in only now because it took years to settle the science of what caused smog, get the permits and finish construction. "Understand, we are doing things as quick as we can," he said. "From the time you start the S.C.R. construction process to its completion is three years. When people say Alabama Power is dragging its feet, well, I object to that."
EMISSIONS of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides have fallen in Alabama over the last decade, as they have across the country. But what goes unsaid by Southern and other utilities is that the reductions were ordered by the E.P.A. and that the power industry fought relentlessly to block the federal mandate. From the mid-1990's until at least 2000, for instance, Southern was among the leaders of a power industry campaign to fight the new nitrogen oxide requirements.
Environmentalists like Mr. Schaeffer contend that had utilities like Southern followed the new source review statute and installed pollution-control technologies years ago, the cuts in noxious emissions would be even more substantial now.
Just about everyone in Alabama's political circuit, however, considers Alabama Power a good citizen. The utility serves 1.3 million customers over most of the lower two-thirds of the state. It contributes generously to local charities and nature conservation programs. It has long been a leader in research, like clean-coal technology and a pilot project at its Gaston Plant in Wilsonville, southeast of Birmingham, to reduce emissions of mercury. 
Alabama Power is also among the largest contributors to state election coffers, just as Southern was for the 2000 presidential race. From Jan. 1 to late April, Alabama Power and the closely affiliated Business Council of Alabama contributed more than $717,000 to state political races, according to a review of state lobbying disclosures by The Birmingham News. Only the teachers' lobby surpassed that total. 
Elmer B. Harris, the company's longtime chief executive who retired recently, was the chairman of the transition team for Governor Siegelman, a Democrat, when he came to office in 1999. Henry Mabry, a former manager for legislative affairs at Alabama Power, is now the administration's finance director. And Trey Glen, who previously was an engineer at Alabama Power, is director of the Office of Water Resources for the state's Department of Economic and Community Affairs.
BUT some outside the power establishment doubt Alabama Power.
About 100 miles east of Birmingham, people who live along the Tallapoosa River downstream of Alabama Power's Harris Dam say that for years now, they have understood what regulators and environmentalists in Washington are only just beginning to discover about the tenacity of the Southern Company. 
At least once a day, the Harris Dam opens its gates and floods the Tallapoosa. The dam makes money by providing power at times of peak electricity demand, when the price is higher than it is the rest of the day. A horn calls from the dam over the saltbox houses and one-room churches in towns like Malone and Wadley and then, in the course of an hour or so, the water level rises from a trickle to a wall 8 to 10 feet high. The flooding has badly eroded the riverbanks and killed much of the fish and wildlife in the river, according to the Alabama Rivers Alliance, federal wildlife regulators and homeowners along the Tallapoosa. 
They have have all been negotiating with Alabama Power for at least two years, in some cases longer, to try to persuade it to create a stronger and more even flow. Mr. Bowers of Alabama Power said that the company was offering a reasonable increase in the flow but that area residents wanted a flow so great that it would ruin the utility's ability to run the dam as a provider of electricity during peak demand. To Alabama Power's critics, the company is offering a low increase mainly to drag out the negotiations.
James Traylor's family has lived in its house on the Tallapoosa since 1945. One late afternoon in May, he walked down to its banks with his father, George, some neighbors and a black Labrador puppy. "Something was robbed from me; something was robbed from my kids," he said, looking at the low, muddy river that he says is a good two feet lower than it was during the droughts of his childhood 20 years ago. 
The banks have been eaten away at least eight feet in the last 15 years or so. Trees hang over the river because there is no soil to cling to anymore. Fallen timber lies in large piles, carried and mixed up by the daily flooding. 
"We used to wade the tributaries and catch fish when I was a kid," Mr. Traylor said. "You would see deer, muskrats, hawks. Now you go up the creeks, and there's nothing to catch." Nothing, he and his friends say, can survive the daily flood and ebb.
"We just want them to give us a flow, and you can generate your electricity," said Curtis B. McGill, a burly man in overalls and baseball cap who has organized his neighbors to negotiate with Alabama Power. "But their attitude is, 'To hell with you.' "
To Mr. Bowers of Alabama Power, the riverbank residents are viewing it too simplistically. "We have always pledged to change," Mr. Bowers said, "if that change would be beneficial and accomplished with the economic viability of the plant."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Preservation; 
It Depends On How You Define 'Real'

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL J. LEWIS; Michael J. Lewis, chairman of the art department at Williams College, is the author of "Frank Furness: Architecture and the Violent Mind."

 BODY:
IN December 1999, the worst storm in French history swept through Versailles, uprooting trees by the thousands and ravaging the great Baroque gardens. Since then the site has been a horticultural emergency room. But rather than just repair the gardens, their custodians have decided on something more audacious: recreate the original designs of Andre Le Notre and return the gardens to their 17th-century splendor. Nothing could seem more reasonable, yet already the project has been greeted with controversy and dismay.
 Even if Le Notre's exquisite drawings are copied line for line, critics argue, the garden cannot be returned to an ideal golden moment, for such a moment never existed. The gardens were constantly modified during the reign of Louis XIV, most radically when Le Notre was replaced by the architect J. H. Mansart. Furthermore, a Baroque garden was the product of a society that no longer exists. France was the 17th century's supreme military and economic power, and this wealth was showered on Versailles. Shockingly labor-intensive, it depended on luxuries no longer possible, like individual watering for each plant. 
 Nor can the plantings be fully replicated, for certain species of flowers have been bred out of existence. Even the climate has changed: the cooler earth of the 17th-century "little ice age" has evolved into the warmer one of today. In these circumstances, any recreation of Versailles would be nothing but a learned improvisation. 
These events at Versailles are symptomatic of a new and controversial trend in historic preservation, the return to the making of historical pastiches, to a purity of the costume drama sort. Such contrived historical recreation has long been under a cloud. This was the legacy of Colonial Williamsburg, whose freewheeling restoration was made possible by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1920's and 30's. Buildings like Williamsburg's Capitol were recreated from scratch -- the original had long since vanished.
For more than half a century, historic preservation has recoiled from the Williamsburg example. (To be fair, Williamsburg soon became far more conscientious.) In 1964 the International Committee on Monuments and Sites was formed to give guidelines for architectural restoration. In 1982 it ratified the Florence Charter, providing guidelines for the restoration of gardens: "Restoration work must respect the successive stages of evolution of the garden concerned" so that "no one period should be given precedence over any other." It is this mandate Versailles now flouts.
According to conventional restoration theory, the sham is always worse than the ruin. One must value a building's physical remains (referred to as the historic fabric), and any new addition must be visibly distinct. Far from onerous, this requirement has been a spur to originality. When, for example, the house of Benjamin Franklin was rebuilt for the Bicentennial celebration, the architect Robert Venturi refused to make a pious brick effigy. Instead he produced a cartoon ghost of the house, a metal outline that gives its basic form, inviting the visitor to imagine what might have been. It provides an experience at once cerebral and entertaining.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is New York's Amster Yard, a complex of buildings and offices around an internal court on East 49th Street. There a renovation plan and new building resulted in the destruction -- apparently inadvertent -- of most of the original complex, which was under landmark protection. Though the owners have promised to recreate Amster Yard, critics point out that the result will be a vapid replica: a scale model that occupies the space of the vanished original.
DESPITE the controversy, it is the replica -- Amster Yard and not Franklin Court -- that now seems to be the order of the day. More and more, historical authenticity is being used to endorse what are, in effect, entirely new buildings. Next year the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles is to be demolished and replaced. At least four different buildings have stood on the site; it is the 1928 design by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright) that is to be the model. Here the claim for historical authenticity seems as much about marketing -- justifying the demolition of a sentimentally regarded landmark -- as about design inspiration.
It is not surprising that the most radical acceptance of historical tableaux has come in Germany, where there is also the greatest psychological need for the recreation of the cultural landscape. In Hanover the house of the philosopher Leibniz has been rebuilt from a few shards, over the ferocious protests of preservationists. A similar situation is unfolding in Dresden, where the splendid Baroque Frauenkirche is being reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle out of its original rubble, carefully inventoried where it fell.
Most contentious is the proposal to rebuild the Royal Palace in Berlin, whose deliberate demolition after World War II was a ceremonial act -- Prussian militarism was exploded both literally and metaphorically. On its site was raised the Palace of the Republic, a blocky complex that is the quintessential architectural artifact of vanished East Germany. With that regime now as discredited as Prussia once was, the pressure to recreate the old Royal Palace is nearly irresistible. At the moment the proposal has stalled for lack of funds, but the movement remains popular. According to international standards, this would perform two acts of historic vandalism with one gesture -- the replacement of a genuine, if despised, monument with a sham historical tableau.
Any facsimile is, by its nature, a product of the present. If the Berlin Palace is rebuilt, the result will not be a Baroque building but a work of early 21st-century image-making. This is the conclusion of David G. DeLong, former head of the preservation program at the University of Pennsylvania, and a forthright critic of historical replicas: "It creates a fantasy that never was. It is not an honorable part of preservation in any sense of the word."
FOR an example of preservation at its conscientious best, just look to Prospect Park, Brooklyn. There Vaux and Olmsted's exquisitely picturesque landscape is accorded as much respect as the park's classical gateways, gems of the City Beautiful Movement by McKim, Mead & White. Even the present -- with its hard-won awareness of ecology -- is given its due. Vaux and Olmsted's planting scheme, which relied on exotic plants, some perniciously invasive, is now being carried out as much as possible with native plants.
And yet confronted with a choice between the layered historical complexity of Prospect Park and a Versailles "restored exactly as it was," it is easy to understand why the public might prefer the accessible replica. The impulse is understandable, a plaintive longing for authenticity. It is not surprising that an age of cinema or virtual reality should crave the genuine. Nor is it surprising that the authenticity desired is of the virtual sort: graphic and visual, providing the image of the thing without the substance. This may account for the turn away from the main preoccupation of traditional historic preservation, meticulous care for physical remains, and its turn to conceptual replicas.
Every building -- or garden, for that matter -- is both idea and physical fact. One might cherish the idea, as we seem to be doing, and ignore the physical fact, but we then lose the tragic and mortal thing that is the building itself, the physical object that has journeyed across time, and whose roster of scars and alterations represents the most fragile aspect of a historic artifact: the sense of congealed time. To efface these and return to the original plans is to treat a design as a kind of pure mathematical abstraction, as remote and austere as the geometry of DNA. Such a recreated design might be like the genetic clone of a dear friend -- identical in every respect but that of shared experience, and therefore a stranger.
On the other hand, an instructive lesson is offered by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. In the 1980's and early 1990's, two replicas of the Vietnam memorial wall traveled across the United States, so those who could not travel to the nation's capital could see what it looked like. In every respect, they were artistically inferior: half scale, made of polished metal rather than marble, and resting on the earth instead of being sunk mournfully within it. Yet wherever each traveled, it inspired the deepest feelings and tears. One should bear this in mind before too swiftly condemning the new enthusiasm for the replica. It may be that the tears are genuine, even if the monument is fake.

HEADLINE: Notes From Minneapolis; 
The Governor's Ungraceful Exit

BYLINE:  By Neal Karlen; Neal Karlen is writing a book about the cabala.

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
I doubt that Jesse Ventura will be remembered as a great Midwestern populist like Nebraska's William Jennings Bryan. But then again, Bryan made a bigger spectacle of himself against Clarence Darrow at the Scopes monkey trial grudge match than Mr. Ventura ever did performing pile drivers in the professional wrestling ring while wearing a pink feather boa.
 When he announced last Tuesday that he won't be seeking a second four-year term as Minnesota's governor, this often cartoonlike symbol of my state wrote the end of an unusual civics lesson that should remain in the history books long after the more conventional Midwestern populists have disappeared into graduate students' footnotes. 
 While it has yet to be proved that any American child can grow up to be president, Jesse Ventura has proved that anybody can be governor. More important, he has shown that anybody is actually able to govern -- even someone whose last business partner was Adrian Adonis, the wrestling tag-team champion. Clocks at the State Capitol haven't run backward. Bills are still being passed and vetoed. And the governor has actually had an agenda, big parts of which he was able to push through.
When he appeared without an invitation at a candidate forum during the 1998 campaign, Mr. Ventura told voters, "You're going to find me a little different from the other candidates." He's tried to live up to that promise and to the commercials that may have won him the governorship in 1998: kids playing with a Ventura action figure as he did battle with Evil Special Interest Man. In 1999 he and the State Legislature agreed on a $2.9 billion tax relief program. In 2001 $791 million was sent back to Minnesota citizens in the third straight year of sales tax rebates. And Governor Ventura could face down controversy: he vetoed a 2000 bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women seeking abortions.
At the start he outlined goals he dubbed his Big Plan -- to manage the state's industrial growth, increase employment, streamline government and sell Minnesota to a world that knew us only as home to the country's largest shopping mall and the airport where one could buy "Our governor can beat up your governor" T-shirts. He didn't do much worse than other governors who had boom times, now followed by recession.
Mr. Ventura also proved that Everyman could be as petty as the usual politicians. He feuded with the Legislature and, calling himself the Samurai Governor, eviscerated budgets proposed by legislators. He tried (and failed) to halve the number of legislators by lobbying for a unicameral system. He also had a Spiro Agnew-esque loathing of reporters, whom he called jackals.
He often went too far: maligning the designers of St. Paul, on the David Letterman show, as drunk Irishmen; telling Playboy he'd like to be reincarnated as a brassiere; doing color commentary for the XFL, a league that was equal parts bad football and cheerleaders dressed like strippers at Tony Soprano's hangout, the Bada Bing club. But did vulgarity stall the ascent of career politicians like Huey Long and Lyndon Johnson?
Mr. Ventura's vulgarity could be ignored, but only for so long. Meanwhile, fallout from his policies has hurt him too -- Minnesota's sudden deficit crisis is at least partly attributable to his budget policies. Mr. Ventura, nothing if not a showman, knows his sui generis vaudeville act is dead. In July 1999 his approval rating was 73 percent; in March 2002 it was 43 percent. The day after state employees went on strike last fall, he left town to fly to New York to inspect ground zero on ABC's tab. That may have been good for "Good Morning America," but at home the Jesse show was over.
Now, like a model Jeffersonian democrat, Jesse Ventura will return to private life after his short spell as a citizen-politician. While Thomas Jefferson probably imagined educated burghers returning to their plantations, Mr. Ventura is thinking in 21st-century terms. His agents, he said, "are fielding any and all offers."

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Prescription Drug Debate; 
Why the Elderly Wait . . . and Wait

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
MAYBE this will be the year when Congress finally passes the biggest expansion of Medicare since 1965 and gives prescription drug coverage to 40 million elderly and disabled Americans. But almost nobody here is betting on it.
 Instead, the widely held expectation is that the long political stalemate on health policy will continue -- that a nation that has learned to tolerate 39 million uninsured will also, at least for another year, tolerate millions of elderly struggling to cope, largely on their own, with soaring drug costs. Democrats and Republicans alike will go home this fall, denounce each other as obstructionists and promise, if re-elected, to do something about prescription drugs for the elderly -- next year. And this time, maybe, they will really, really mean it. 
 But even that may not help. For the fight over prescription drug benefits has become a proxy for the larger struggle over health care itself, with all the questions that are achingly unresolved: What should be the role of the federal government? How do Americans cope with rising health care costs, spurred by an aging population and an explosion in medical technology? How much health care do Americans have a right to? 
As it turns out, the debates have paralyzed the political system not only on the broadest issue -- whether and how to move to universal health insurance -- but also on what seems, at first glance, a narrow one.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be this hard.
The elderly are supposed to be the 800-pound gorillas of American politics, the ones who show up, disproportionately, to vote and whose needs get met, pronto.
And it is difficult to argue with their needs. While more than two-thirds of the elderly piece together some coverage for drugs, mostly from former employers or H.M.O.'s, their coverage is increasingly limited and unreliable. And the cost of drugs keeps climbing.
Medicare beneficiaries spent an average of $813, out of pocket, on prescription drugs in 2000 and $928 in 2001, and are spending $1,051 in 2002, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. A reporter visiting senior centers with Congressional candidates routinely hears older people, on the verge of tears, recite their monthly bills and their monthly Social Security check and plead for help. The oldest are among the most vulnerable; an estimated 45 percent of those 85 and older have no prescription drug coverage.
It is easy to blame the stalemate on partisanship, especially this year. The combination of an imminent midterm election and a House and Senate that are up for grabs is hardly conducive to bipartisan cooperation. And the presidential election is just two years away. 
But this is about more than partisan advantage. The two sides fundamentally disagree about the government's role in health care, a clash that the Democrats won in 1965, when Medicare was created, then lost in 1994, when President Bill Clinton tried to cover everyone through an impossibly complex set of federal mandates.
The prescription drug benefit has become the first battlefield in the broader fight over the future of Medicare -- a popular program, but one that needs updating. Medicare is particularly troublesome to conservatives, being a classic, government-run insurance program, rich with regulations and detailed reimbursement rules. Instead, Republicans yearn for what they call the "choice" and "freedom" of a vigorous marketplace of private health plans competing for the elderly's business (although Democrats note that the experience with private plans and the elderly is very uneven.)
GIVEN these positions, the Republican drug plan, which is expected to pass the House this week, envisions the new drug benefits coming from private insurance companies, albeit with government subsidies and standards. And the Democratic plans propose adding a standardized drug benefit to traditional Medicare.
"Health care is the Rorschach test of American political ideology these days," said Bruce Vladeck, acting chairman of the geriatrics department at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, who was overseer of the Medicare program under Mr. Clinton. Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at Project Hope, a health education foundation, who oversaw Medicare for the first President Bush, agreed. "Unlike many things in Washington, this is an issue worth fighting about," she said.
Even if they could find a way to split the difference on ideology, lawmakers would still have to pay for a decent benefit. Older Americans are 13 percent of the population, but account for 34 percent of prescriptions. And the most generous proposals in Congress would cover only a portion of the elderly's drug costs. The fear on Capitol Hill, in fact, is that the elderly, once they get a benefit, are bound to be disappointed by how limited it seems. But even a cheap benefit costs a lot.
"Is it unaffordable?" said Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a health issues expert. "No. But we can't have low taxes, growing defense spending, increased resources devoted to education and other domestic priorities and a more adequate Medicare benefit package."
One way to do more with less is to control the costs of drugs. Which brings up the pharmaceutical industry, which has political clout to put the elderly to shame.
Public Citizen, the liberal watchdog group, reported recently that the drug industry last year employed 623 lobbyists -- 23 of them former members of Congress, 32 of them former staffers for the two House committees at work on Medicare drug legislation. Representative Tom Allen, a Maine Democrat and a critic of the industry, said in an interview, "Its combined economic and political power is allowing it to stop what a very large majority in this country -- not just seniors -- believe is needed."
But the drug industry also has a powerful argument: adding a drug benefit directly to traditional Medicare, it fears, will lead inevitably to government price controls. And price controls, industry officials argue, will hurt the research that has created many wonder drugs in the past 10 years -- and raises the promise of future cures for diseases like Alzheimer's.
Critics say much of the industry is more focused on marketing and slightly modifying existing drugs than on inventing new ones. "This notion that you need to be this large conglomerate with large profits to sustain R & D is just wrong," argues Nancy Chockley, president of the National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Educational Foundation, which receives funds from insurance and managed care groups. "I think the industry needs cost containment."
IN the face of so many barriers, many experts say nothing major will happen on Medicare drug benefits -- or health care -- until one side or another wins a strong majority in both houses. It was not until the Democratic landslide of 1964 that the logjam on creating Medicare broke.
And this, in its own way, is a big challenge for the political system. The country is aging. There is an unending appetite for new drugs, procedures, treatments -- and medicine offers more each day. On the horizon is the aging tsunami of the baby-boomers, who are already accustomed to their Lipitor and Paxil, and likely to be ever more avid health care consumers the older they get.
Health care costs are already rising sharply, and there is no real consensus about what to do about it. "We killed managed care, or evolved it into a form more tolerable to the American people," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "And nobody has a big idea, or a good idea, of what comes next. In the absence of any big idea for reforming the system, for controlling costs, what we resort to time and again is incremental changes."
And, of course, learning to live with inequities in American health care.

HEADLINE: Iran By the Numbers 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
The most striking thing about Iran today is the honesty you can find in the newspapers. Some mornings, they take your breath away. Consider the mainstream paper Entekhab, which ran a long piece the other day, headlined "Skyrocketing Figures," that ticked off the following statistics: There are now 84,000 prostitutes operating on the streets of Tehran and 250 brothels, including some linked to high officials. There are 60 new runaway girls hitting Tehran's streets every day -- a 12 percent increase over last year. Forty percent of all drug-addicted women in Iranian prisons have AIDS. Two sisters, ages 16 and 17, recently gave AIDS to 1,100 people in a two-month period. Four million youths under the age of 20 suffer from depression. Unemployment (which is already around 30 percent) is steadily rising.
 All of these problems are symptoms of a floundering economy, or, as the newspaper Iran News baldly put it two weeks ago: "The nation's entire economic structure is fundamentally bankrupt and in desperate need of urgent and sweeping reforms. Some of the graver and more prominent problems include lack of sufficient foreign investment, mismanagement in all tiers of our economic system, political isolation leading to a deteriorating economic situation, atrocious unemployment and high inflation." 
 This deterioration is not primarily the result of U.S. sanctions. Iran has plenty of oil wealth and can buy anything from Europe or the black market. It is primarily the result of mismanagement by Iran's theocratic rulers -- their corruption, incompetence, arbitrary decisions, religious legal codes and antiglobalization instincts. Which is why the biggest internal drama playing out in Iran today is this: Will the ayatollahs peacefully reform their system, or will it explode beneath their feet from social unrest?
In a poll published by the Noruz newspaper last month, 6.2 percent of those surveyed in Tehran said they were satisfied with the current state of affairs, 48.9 percent favored "reform" and 44.9 percent favored "fundamental change."
The problem for Iran's ruling clerics is that they cannot provide enough new jobs without privatizing their state-dominated economy and attracting foreign investment. And they cannot reform the economy and attract foreign investors, who will bring new technology and new markets, without reforming every pillar of their ruling system. This system includes vast monopolies awarded to their allies -- the bazaar merchants, clerics and children of the clergy -- as well as Islamic charities that serve as front organizations for huge business conglomerates that pay no taxes and import everything from cigarettes to cars, duty-free. Iran also can't attract investors, particularly for industry, without some transparent rule of law, which means curbing the arbitrary rule of the Guardian Council of clerics and the judges they appoint, who sit atop the system here, dominating the courts and parliament.
The Islamic revolution urbanized millions of rural Iranians and made them real citizens, in a way the shah never did. "Now they have education, roads, transports and health facilities," said the manager of an auto-parts company. "Sixty percent of university students today are girls. But now these new citizens are looking for a citizens' regime, not a rural regime. A citizens' regime is a secular government, which respects the religion of the people but also the rights of the people."
For the moment, the ruling clerics have enough oil money -- and enough support in the rural areas, in their seminaries and in the bazaar -- to stay on top. But given Iran's soaring population -- there were 30 million Iranians when the shah left 23 years ago, and there are 66 million today, with 70 percent under age 30 -- something will have to give if Iran hopes to create enough jobs.
"The establishment has two choices," said the opposition economist Rahim Oskui, "but they have the same result: either the establishment will resist international and national changes -- in that case it will crash -- or it will become flexible and adapt. But in that case it cannot remain what it is now. . . . My feeling is the clergy will reach the conclusion that they will have to secularize the system in order to survive, but this will take time. . . . All our modern revolutions came from inside the country, and given the level of demands inside the society today, a backward establishment like we have now cannot resist these forces forever -- provided there is no outside interference."

And the Market'sDownbeat Goes On

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
If there was a single lesson to be learned on Wall Street last week, it was not to get your hopes too high.
 The stock market began the week on a euphoric note, with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 300 points on Monday and rising modestly on Tuesday, in response to some good news about corporate earnings and the economy. 
That left a few analysts predicting that the battered market was finally on the mend. 
 But on Wednesday, prices abruptly reversed course, then continued to slide through the rest of the week. The downturn was prompted by earnings warnings, particularly from the technology sector, including Apple Computer, Advanced Micro Devices and Nokia, and by more fears about terrorism and unrest in the Middle East. Even some positive economic news, including a slightly higher-than-expected increase in the index of leading economic indicators, failed to change investors' mood.
 For the week, the Dow finished at 9,253.79, off 220.42 points, or 2.3 percent. The index has fallen 10.6 percent in five weeks. The Nasdaq composite index ended at 1,440.96, off 63.78 points, or 4.2 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 989.14, down 18.13 points, or 1.8 percent. VIVIAN MARINO

Back to theBasics (and the Butterfat)

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
 Ice cream is one of life's little indulgences, and the popularity of its leaner substitutes is waning. While sales of regular ice cream increased by about 8 percent in the year ended May 19, sales of fat-free or low-fat ice cream increased by only 1 percent. 
And sales of frozen yogurt and tofu ice cream decreased 39 percent from 1997 to 2001. 
 One reason for the change is the array of interesting new flavors of regular ice cream on the market, said Susan Ruland, vice president of the International Dairy Foods Association. "Some of the flavors coming out use some of the best and finest ingredients," she said. "People eat ice cream because they love it. because it's delicious. If they've got something more deli-cious to try, they will." KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

To the Editor:
 "You Earned Your Wings, So Return to the Nest" (Preludes, June 16), described how college graduates were moving back in with their parents and how, in this uncertain economic time, it may take up to six months for them to find jobs in their chosen fields. 
 Graduates need to understand that labor conditions may not always meet their interests. 
This is a good time for young people to learn to get along on a lot less dollar power and in a less-than-perfect job. It is a time to grow up.
Perhaps it is also a time for young people to consider some form of national service for two years before going to college. Living away from home with supervision could be a chance to broaden one's experience as well as a chance to save for a rainy day.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
A Governor Who Stepped Into a Hole, in More Ways Than One

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: PEMBERTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
IN his first adventure as governor, James E. McGreevey fell off a sand dune. The tumble in Cape May was on a stretch of sand known locally as Poverty Beach. And the injury turned out to be a badly broken thighbone.
 The governor should have known then. He has limped through his first months in office as New Jersey has slipped further into fiscal poverty, posting the biggest budget deficit in the state's history. 
 "I'm waiting for the locusts to arrive," he told a town meeting here Thursday night.
It must feel like a plague on Democrats. Mr. McGreevey is the first Democratic governor since Jim Florio, who took office 12 years ago. Facing a budget gap and school funding mandates, Mr. Florio pushed through a monstrous tax increase, which helped banish his party from power for almost a decade. In waltzed Christie Whitman, who took advantage of a flush economy to slash taxes while also inflating the state's debt like the Hindenburg.
Now, with the economy slumping again, Mr. McGreevey is trying to navigate between the legacy of Ms. Whitman and the lesson of Mr. Florio.
Mr. Florio's troubles caused a mutation in New Jersey politicians, giving them a string in the back of their necks which, when pulled, makes them say, "I will not raise taxes." Part of the fun of campaigns is watching candidates trying to pull each other's strings. Mr. McGreevey had his pulled late in last fall's race.
Mr. McGreevey says he has kept his pledge, proposing to raise not income or sales taxes but the cigarette tax. Cigarettes would be so expensive that the only people left smoking would be the truly addicted or the truly nervous about state finances. But that will barely dent the deficit, now projected at a whopping $5.3 billion, in the governor's $23.6 billion proposed budget.
Aid to schools and municipalities will not grow, and even favored programs of the governor's -- from cancer research to reading coaches -- will take a hit. 
Mr. McGreevey is proposing to collect $1 billion more in corporate taxes. He describes it as closing loopholes that allow 30 of the state's largest employers to pay only $200 a year in corporate taxes. Republicans, eager to cast him as just-like-Florio, call it raising taxes. Business groups are running advertisements saying that it would hurt working people like a mythical store clerk named Sally. In the State House these days, the governor's opponents wear buttons that say, "Save Sally."
But the question is not Sally as much as Jim. Mr. McGreevey is a former mayor of Woodbridge, a middle-class town in the middle of the state. He pursued the governorship for years as if it were a local office -- befriending anyone who could be construed as a party official, walking the state from end to end, studying issues as if preparing for finals.
Those instincts were on display at Thursday night's town hall meeting. He explained the budget deficit with charts and even humor. And he pleased the crowd with his no-issue-too-small attention to audience concerns, from arcane boating issues to local road-resurfacing projects.
But juggling Christie Whitman's tax structure with a view of government perhaps closer to Jim Florio's was beginning to look like a difficult stunt -- far more precarious than a beach walk.
Clara Capers, a teacher, said her colleagues supported Mr. McGreevey but were concerned that the governor's plan to freeze school funding could threaten their jobs.
Walter M. Urban Jr., the mayor of Medford, in Burlington County, said that more than a decade of eroding state support of schools had caused local property taxes to soar. If the governor solves that situation, Mr. Urban said later, "I'm his best friend."
That's the kind of loyalty Mr. McGreevey likes, sometimes to a fault. Now, in the middle of the budget crisis, he is trying to get support to build three sports arenas -- the main one in Newark, whose mayor, Sharpe James, was crucial to Mr. McGreevey's victory. State tax dollars generated at the arena would repay $165 million in bonds.
Mr. McGreevey likens starting his term with a gaping budget hole to "waking up to the bell." And he still has that limp.
His mother, a nurse, urges him to attend to his rehabilitation. It's good advice for a politician seeking his footing.
"My mother says, 'You're not going to be governor forever, but you're always going to want to walk.' " he said.
Not to mention, run.

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Fume as Clothing Sales to U.S. Tumble 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Ashraf Sajid, a thin man with a bushy black beard and mustache, paused while sewing a gray cotton pullover shirt in a factory here and explained how he came to hate America.
 When Pakistan agreed to help the United States after Sept. 11, Mr. Sajid hoped that Americans would reciprocate by buying more clothes from Pakistan. Instead, Washington has maintained strict limits on imports of Pakistan-made clothes, American store chains have turned to more stable countries and Mr. Sajid was laid off for seven months. 
 He and his wife and their newborn son returned to their home village and exhausted their meager savings before Mr. Sajid was finally rehired. 
"America is like poison to me," he said. "I'm still bitter about it. I felt they were our friends."
Pakistan's textile and apparel industries, which dominate the country's economy and account for 60 percent of its industrial employment, have been battered by a combination of restrictive American trade policies and repeated fears of war, first from the conflict in Afghanistan and more recently during Pakistan's confrontation with India. Several terrorist attacks against Westerners have made clothing buyers even more reluctant to come here. One result has been mass layoffs.
Setbacks for the textile industry, including the temporary laying off of tens of thousands of workers last winter, are contributing to resentment of the United States among many young Pakistanis, Lahore residents say, while mullahs at radical local mosques have been playing on anger over job losses in their sermons. Government officials and residents here agree that the American stance on textiles is increasing political pressure on the government of Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who has aligned himself with the United States in its campaign against terrorism.
"If the United States had been willing to help us, it would have given people like me the ability to talk, to say that the United States is creating jobs," said Razaq Dawood, Pakistan's minister of commerce, industries and production.
Last fall, Pakistan asked that the United States and European Union waive import duties on textiles and clothing and liberalize quotas on textile and apparel imports as a reward for its help against Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
Instead, the Bush administration opted in February for a small increase in quotas while backing legislation to lower import duties on just two categories, leather gloves and hand-knotted carpets.
There had been talk in Washington last autumn of a grand gesture toward Pakistan, similar to the 50 percent increase in textile quotas that the first Bush administration granted to Turkey as a reward for its help in the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
But that idea fizzled in December when the current Bush administration was faced with imminent defeat in the House of its broad package of trade legislation and decided to woo six lawmakers from textile states by promising them it would not do much for Pakistan's textile industry.
"In developing any proposal for assistance to Pakistan, the administration is committed to working with the Congress to minimize the impact on the U.S. textile and apparel industry," Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans wrote in a letter to one of the lawmakers, Representative Robin Hayes, Republican of North Carolina. The trade bill passed the House by a single vote after the six legislators voted for it.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's textile industry has languished. After the fighting calmed in Afghanistan last winter, buyers began drifting back here, especially from Europe, which eliminated its import duties of 8 to 10 percent for clothing from Pakistan and raised quotas by 15 percent. But terrorist attacks, including the bombing on May 8 of a busload of French technicians in Karachi, prevented a full recovery in sales.
Then Pakistan and India mobilized their armies for a possible war, prompting the United States and many European nations to call for their citizens to flee both countries immediately. In the factories that line this city's outskirts, managers now say that they may have to shut down again within weeks once they fill existing orders, because few new orders are being placed.
"They say, 'We'll let you know next week,' and that has been the last three weeks," said Aleem Ahmad Khan, the chief executive of Akbar Enterprises, which owns the factory where Mr. Sajid works.
Government officials in Islamabad are especially upset that the United States has not rolled back import duties of more than 25 percent on cotton clothing from Pakistan, which would help Pakistani producers offer lower prices and avoid losing sales to manufacturers in other countries.
While Pakistan continues to export large quantities of linens to the United States, products for which there are few other suppliers, Pakistani exports of garments like cotton shirts have plunged as buyers have shifted orders elsewhere. Because cotton garments are labor intensive, the loss of sales has had a severe effect on employment.
American trade officials say a few steps have been taken to help Pakistan. The Bush administration raised quotas in February for a dozen categories of apparel, which potentially would allow an extra $143 million worth of Pakistani goods into the United States each year, a 7 percent increase. However, some of these categories are for goods Pakistan hardly produces, like work gloves, making it unlikely that it would realize that gain in exports.
Under World Trade Organization rules, the textile quotas of Pakistan and many other American trading partners, including India, were automatically raised by an additional 12 percent at the start of this year, part of a process that is supposed to lead to the global elimination of textile quotas by 2005.
A senior American trade official said that the domestic industry's concerns and constant demands for larger quotas from other developing nations had prevented the United States from doing more for Pakistan. "As we're phasing out quotas as we approach 2005, it's hard to give much away to one country without causing a stampede from every other developing nation," said the official. Indeed, India has already threatened to ask the World Trade Organization to investigate whether the European Union is unfairly helping Pakistan by eliminating import duties.
Lahore and Faisalabad, 70 miles to the west, form the hub of Pakistan's textile and apparel industries. Lahore has the misfortune of being just 14 miles from the Indian border, on flat terrain that is ideal for tank and artillery warfare. Pakistani fighter jets patrol overhead, and one of them shot down an Indian spy plane 25 miles south of here in early June.
The effects of trade restrictions and war jitters are best seen at a factory here like Mr. Khan's, which sells to many American department store chains.
Even before the recent tensions with India, the factory had to cut the wholesale price that it charges for knitted cotton men's shirts to $3.40 apiece, from $5, to retain customers made nervous by the fighting in Afghanistan, said Athar Rasul, the factory's senior marketer. Mr. Khan said the price cut, possible only because of a worldwide slump in raw cotton prices, had wiped out profits.
Mr. Khan's 650 workers each earn $70 to $150 a month for putting in 48-hour weeks in a well-lit factory, which stays surprisingly cool despite the 104-degree heat outside. That is good money in a country where the minimum wage is $50 a month, but not enough to build up much in savings, especially when two-thirds of the work force was laid off through the winter when sales to the United States declined steeply.
Arshad Muhammad, a strapping 26-year-old who sews the shoulders for pullovers, said that for the last six years he and his cousin, who is now 20, had wanted to marry. But their dreams of marriage were delayed yet again when he lost his job last winter. Now he despairs of marrying her anytime soon, especially if he is laid off again.
"I want to marry her, but she belongs to a poor family and neither they nor we have the money," Mr. Muhammad said, adding quietly, "I love her."

HEADLINE: Once Again, Trying Housing as a Cure for Homelessness; 
Mothers With Children Are Getting Preference in City Assignments for Subsidized Apartments

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
At the heart of the Bloomberg administration's ambitious new policy to deal with homeless people in New York is an old idea with a whole new life: subsidize more housing and the number of homeless will drop. If the plan succeeds -- still a big if -- it will move 9,250 homeless families from city shelters to subsidized housing over the next year, nearly triple the number placed this year and well above the 1990 peak.
 Much of the increase will come from giving more of the scarce subsidized apartments to homeless mothers and children and fewer to other needy people. That change is a significant marker of shifting attitudes in the history of the city's homeless policy. 
 Two decades ago, the notion that homeless people needed housing seemed reasonable, if unaffordable, to many city officials. In the late 1970's, after years in which urban renewal, landlord abandonment and arson-for-hire had swept away swathes of the city's cheapest housing, more "street people" and beggars appeared on New York's sidewalks. Homelessness became far more visible nationwide in 1981, in the worst recession since the Great Depression, but instead of disappearing when unemployment dropped again, as most Americans expected, it kept growing. 
In the 1980's, advocates presented the problem as a failure of government to do right by the most vulnerable: people who were just more unlucky than others, not different or less deserving. Families sheltered in squalid Midtown welfare hotels during a city real estate boom became the focus of campaigns for public sympathy and subsidized housing.
In one sense, it worked. The Koch administration adopted a 10-year housing plan that eventually produced 150,000 apartments, 10 percent of them for homeless families. Prodded by court rulings and David N. Dinkins's primary campaign in 1989, Mayor Edward I. Koch vowed to close the welfare hotels by moving homeless families into homes, including an annual allotment of 1,800 apartments in public housing.
In another sense, the strategy backfired badly. As crack, street crime, and anger at welfare mothers increasingly framed public debate about poverty, advocates acknowledged belatedly that drug addiction and mental illness, not just a lack of housing, afflicted many homeless people. 
The defining shift came in the first year of the Dinkins administration. Mr. Dinkins had come into office insisting that "a shelter is not a home," and he assigned Nancy Wackstein, a longtime advocate for poor children, as director of his Office on Homelessness. Working 12-hour days, she succeeded in a few months in reducing the number of families in welfare hotels to 150 from 1,200.
But the hotels filled up again, faster, it seemed, than they had been emptied. By 1992, more than 1,000 of the 5,200 homeless families in the city lived in welfare hotels.
"I thought that if you just provided 8,000 units of permanent housing for a couple of years, you'd address the problem," Ms. Wackstein said in an interview that year. "I failed to understand that the universe of potential homeless families is very large."
In retrospect, some analysts point out, the rise in shelter applications coincided with the start of a new recession, but politically, the idea that subsidized housing could cure homelessness was dead.
Now the idea is back, with fresh vigor, not only in New York City but nationwide. More sophisticated research, the expensive growth of an improved, service-rich shelter system, and the galloping rise in family homelessness in the welfare-to-work era have made it inescapable, say veterans of homeless policy debates.
In the last year of his mayoralty, even Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had strongly rejected subsidized housing as an answer to homelessness, found himself scrambling with little success to add rent subsidies, federal vouchers and more public housing apartments to the dwindling pool of low-income housing the city could offer the surging number of homeless families.
It was like a U-turn. Joan Malin, Mr. Giuliani's first homeless services commissioner, recalled that in 1995 the mayor had been determined to shrink the soaring shelter population the way Richard J. Schwartz, his senior policy adviser, was shrinking the welfare rolls: tighten eligibility rules, deter applicants at the front door, and eject those who failed to meet new work requirements.
"I have vivid memories of very painful conversations at City Hall," Ms. Malin, now chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said recently. She recalled asking permission to offer day care, a restaurant allowance or social services to mothers and children denied shelter beds under new eligibility rules before sending them to try to crowd back in with angry relatives.
"The mayor looked at me and basically said, 'No. What Richard's done in the welfare system is what you need to be doing.' " said Ms. Malin, who resigned in 1996. "It became his mantra." 
The courts eventually ruled against Mr. Giuliani's bid to deny shelter to homeless mothers who did not meet strict new welfare requirements and to put their children in foster care. With additional hurdles to clear, half the families who were ultimately found eligible for shelter had to apply five times. While their eligibility was under review, many bounced between 10-day temporary shelters and the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, where children and their parents routinely slept on the floor through the night.
At the same time, Mr. Giuliani reduced subsidized housing placements from the shelters to a 10-year low, and let the pipeline of city-owned apartments dry up, convinced that the lesson of the Dinkins years was, as another former commissioner put it, "If you build it, they will come."
They came anyway, as the Coalition for the Homeless and the Legal Aid Society had warned all along. By February 2001, the number of people lodging nightly in the shelter system equaled the 1980's peak of 28,737, and Mr. Giuliani's last commissioner of homeless services, Martin Oesterreich, exclaimed in an interview, "I can't screw the front door any tighter."
In a booming rental market, many private landlords would not tolerate the bureaucratic delays involved in accepting housing vouchers. The Giuliani administration, like the Koch administration in the 1980's, turned more and more to hotel rooms, which cost about $3,000 a month, far more than permanent apartments.
Last July, the number of homeless families with children in the system surpassed all previous records, and that trend has only accelerated. Last month, a record of 33,887 homeless people slept in the shelters each night, including 14,553 children and 11,612 adults in 7,879 families.
Research using the city's own computerized records, and supported by respected national studies, shows that any such record of homeless people catches only one in four of those who experience homelessness at some point during a year -- and overestimates the share with chronic impairments.
"Personal difficulties, such as mental disabilities or job loss, may increase vulnerability to homelessness, but they cannot explain the high number of people who fall into homelessness every year," said Martha Burt, a national authority on homelessness who directs the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. "Only policies that expand the availability of affordable housing to people with below-poverty incomes will ensure stable homes for these individuals."
A New York University study that followed homeless families who entered city shelters in 1988 and a random group of families on public assistance who had not been homeless found that only one factor -- subsidized housing -- determined whether a family in either group was stably housed five years later. Of those who received such a subsidy, 80 percent met the definition of stability -- living in their own apartment for at least a year. Among those who did not get a housing subsidy, only 18 percent were stably housed.
"Education, work history, mental illness, childhood trauma, substance abuse, experience with the criminal justice system -- nothing else we could measure made a difference," said Marybeth Shinn, a writer of the study, published in 1998 in The American Journal of Public Health. "The basic message is that subsidized housing was both necessary and sufficient to create housing stability." She added, "We conclude that housing cures homelessness for families."
Linda I. Gibbs, the Bloomberg administration's commissioner for homeless services, said 26 percent more families applied for shelter in the fiscal year ending this month than in the previous year. Conservatively, she added, the city projects another 26 percent increase in applications next year, not because anyone expects new housing subsidies to draw more families to the shelters, but because the trend is unmistakable.
"They're really here," she said, "they're really homeless, and all these resources are being put into place to meet this very real demand."

HEADLINE: Among Small Businesses Hurt by Attack, Some Gratitute and Some Grousing Over Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
John and Suzan Natalucci do not know if their Italian restaurant three blocks south of the World Trade Center site will survive. But they say they deeply appreciate the $79,000 they have received in government aid. 
 Robert Berger says that while he wishes his grants, worth nearly $50,000, had been available earlier, he values their contribution to reviving his small computer company three blocks north of the site. 
 Harvey Kaplan, whose small wholesale jewelry business is a mile from it, says he is grateful for $36,000 in aid because it helped keep his company afloat after the weeks of traffic chaos in Lower Manhattan prevented retailers from getting to his shop. 
Many owners of small businesses in Lower Manhattan have complained bitterly about what they call the paltry packages of government aid for businesses struggling to stay alive since the Sept. 11 attack, and about application processes they find onerous and filled with delays. But there are indeed satisfied customers like the Nataluccis, Mr. Berger and Mr. Kaplan, who have received aid and found it helpful -- and who hope the money will keep them going long enough for them to get on their feet. 
"We always want more, but what they're giving us we appreciate," Mrs. Natalucci said. "Every little bit gives you a feeling that somebody cares and you can go on." 
Business owners and their advocates have also complained that some government aid programs demand too much in loan collateral, or reject too many deserving business owners. And, they say, too much aid is going to larger businesses, rather than the smallest. 
Advocates for small businesses like Kevin Curnin, a lawyer who advises From the Ground Up, a group of nearly 300 Lower Manhattan businesses, say that those who are as happy as the Nataluccis, Mr. Berger and Mr. Kaplan are in the minority. 
"I think it's fantastic that there are small businesses out there who are satisfied," he said, "but for everyone out there who has had a good experience, there are 10 who have had a bad experience." 
For people like the Nataluccis, the government aid programs are not nearly as bad a problem as the lack of customers. An estimated 100,000 jobs were lost in Lower Manhattan in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack, and tens of thousands have not returned, downtown business leaders say.
At Giovanni's Atrium, a 28-year-old restaurant at Washington and Rector Streets, a quick walk south of the trade center site, Mr. and Mrs. Natalucci described their plight. 
It was lunchtime, but fewer than half the 110 seats were occupied, the patrons digging into appetizers like beef carpaccio parmigiano and entrees like mahi mahi piccata. In the background, Fats Domino sounded from the stereo with his 1950's rock 'n' roll hits.
Before Sept. 11, Mr. Natalucci said, not only would all the tables have been occupied, but "there would be a line at the door." 
"This is it," he said of that day's lunch business. No longer are tables used two or even three times in one shift. Dinner is similarly off. In general, he said, revenues are about half the $150,000 monthly average before the attack; there are 11 employees, down from 25. 
Mrs. Natalucci said the $79,000 in grants had helped them go on while hoping for an upturn.
But Mr. Curnin said that overall, the aid programs usually gave far too little. For example, he said, one the major programs, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, set the caps for grants too low. 
The program, for businesses of up to 500 employees, authorizes grants based on lost revenue and on location within the eligible area, which runs south from 14th Street. Nearest the trade center site, where the benefits are highest, a business can receive up to 4 percent of its annual gross revenues, or 10 days of losses based on a 250-day business year. Most of the Nataluccis' aid came from this $481 million program, which is administered by the state and the city.
Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the state's Empire State Development Corporation, which helps run this and other aid efforts, called the criticism of the grant programs "grossly exaggerated." 
"We have a certain amount of money to work with that came out of Washington, and we try to spread it out as fairly as possible," he said. The aid, he said, is not intended to "solve the problem, but to help them get through this difficult period." 
Of the complaints about paperwork, Mr. Gargano said the application requirements were important to ensure that those getting the aid truly needed it. Guidance is available at his agency's center at 2 Rector Street, he said, and at the city's Economic Development Corporation site at 140 William Street. 
A spokesman for Mr. Gargano, Michael Marr, disputed the idea that too much aid was going to larger businesses. The nearly 6,900 businesses that have received grants so far, he said, are "predominantly small," and half have four or fewer employees. He said his agency had speeded up the process to cut delays. 
Another major source of aid is the federal Small Business Administration's disaster loan program. The agency says it has approved more than 4,550 loans to businesses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that were economically or physically damaged as a result of the attack, and that the number approved represented 54 percent of the 8,500 business applications so far considered. Another 1,700 applications were not considered, and are not counted in computing the approval rate, often because defaults on taxes or on a previous government loan made the applicants ineligible. 
The agency says 54 percent is in line with a rough 50 percent approval rate in natural disasters across the country. A spokesman, Thomas Pirinelli, said the agency based its lending decisions on an applicant's credit history and repayment ability. 
After questions by members of Congress about the effectiveness of the government aid programs, the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, recently began a study of the matter.
Several blocks from Giovanni's Atrium, at 73 Warren Street, U.S. Telecom, which designs and supports computer networks, is doing about 15 percent less business than before Sept. 11, said Mr. Berger, president of the 19-year-old company. This is an improvement, he said: "We probably lost about 35 percent of our business right after 9/11." 
He said the drop in business, and damage to equipment and furnishings stemming from the trade center's destruction, had resulted in nearly $500,000 in losses, only two-thirds of which were covered by insurance. 
With the place refurnished and its shelves again full of cables, connectors and other network hardware, Mr. Berger said, a $46,000 business recovery grant he received will help pay for an office administrator. He had to cut his staff to three from seven, he said.
A mile away, at 95 Canal Street, Mr. Kaplan said his wholesale jewelry business, Sunisa-Renu, lost more than $100,000 in the last quarter of last year. It was closed for only three days, but many of the retailers he supplies could not get there with any regularity for weeks because of the traffic snarls. His $36,000 in government grants helped him stay in business, he said.
"I could have used more," he said. "But, hey, what are you going to do? There are a lot of people a lot worse off than I am."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
A Banker in a Land of Risks

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
GALIA MAOR, chief executive of Israel's Leumi Group, had a tough time in New York earlier this month celebrating the banking company's 100th anniversary at Cipriani 42nd Street, where dinner guests were serenaded by Itzhak Perlman, the violinist.
 The day before the party in New York, where the bank has 2 of its 302 branches, a suicide bomber killed 17 people in northern Israel. But Ms. Maor said she decided that it was important to go ahead with the party. 
 "The tendency would be to forget about it," Ms. Maor said in an interview on the morning of the attack. "But this is an opportunity to say to the world: Here we are."
Ms. Maor, one of the few women anywhere to run a large bank, is trying to make the best of what could diplomatically be described as a hostile environment confronting Leumi, which, with $52 billion in assets, is the second-largest bank in Israel.
She is trying to strengthen Leumi's business in the 19 countries outside Israel that accounted for more than half its profit last year.
Like banks in the United States, Leumi lent money to many telecommunications and technology companies and has been writing down the value of these loans. But for Leumi, the outlook has been worsened by the crisis in the Middle East.
"Our business reflects the Israeli economy," Ms. Maor said.
Leumi has also written down loans to businesses linked to the tourism industry, like hotels, and must assume costs of increased security at branches. Then there is the social cost. Leumi branches are near sites in Israel where suicide bombers have struck, and Leumi has hired social workers to counsel the bank's staff. "There is an economic impact and a personal impact," Ms. Maor said.
Even before the increased threat of bodily harm to customers in branches, Ms. Maor was encouraging electronic banking: only 37 percent of consumer transactions with Leumi are handled through the branch system.
But her basic challenge is to keep Leumi's profits stable while waiting for the political and economic situation to improve.
Analysts said Ms. Maor, 58, was doing a good job under the circumstances. "The bank is managed very well," said Ronit Goodman, an analyst at Nessuah Zannex Securities, an Israeli brokerage firm, noting that operating expenses fell 10.5 percent in the most recent quarter. "We believe Leumi is a good long-term investment opportunity."
Ms. Maor is one of the most prominent women in Israel. "There are few women in Israel in major positions," said Avi Tiomkin, an Israeli financier and longtime friend of Ms. Maor.
An article in Business Week, written soon after Ms. Maor was promoted to run Leumi in 1995, said, "Not since Golda Meir has a woman wielded so much influence in Israel."
Not surprisingly, Ms. Maor does not dwell on her gender. "I never felt it was an issue," she said.
The daughter of immigrants from Poland, she spent 24 years at the Bank of Israel, the country's central bank, becoming the senior bank regulator in 1982.
"She rose to a high level outside of a large corporation, in an environment where intellectual power is more of a factor," said Dina Dublon, the chief financial officer at J. P. Morgan Chase, who once worked for Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank. "That helped her achieve authority."
The Bank of Israel has one of the highest proportions of senior female executives among Israeli institutions, said Jacob A. Frenkel, the chairman of Merrill Lynch International, who ran the country's central bank for much of the 1990's.
Ms. Maor said that working for the government meant flexible work hours while raising her three children. She and her husband, Joshua, are a power couple in Israeli business: he led I.B.M.'s Israeli operations for 12 years and now works as a venture capitalist.
At Leumi, Ms. Maor has been skillful at juggling relations with the country's unions and with the Israeli government, which owns 42 percent of the bank.
"We run this very much as a private bank," said Ms. Maor, who has criticized the government's timing in looking to sell a portion of its stake in Leumi, probably by floating the shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. "They missed an opportunity when the economy looked better," she said.
Worries that the government sale will dilute the value of Leumi stock held by other shareholders have hurt the price, Ms. Goodman said.
There were rumors earlier this year that Citigroup, which opened its first branch in Israel two years ago, would look to buy Leumi.
Ms. Maor declined to comment specifically on Citigroup. "We did have executives from a couple of banks come to Israel and meet with us," Ms. Maor said. "There was interest in the financial community in our bank, in the U.S. and Europe, but nothing ever materialized." A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment.
At a time when sales of Israeli government bonds have been unusually brisk, Ms. Maor is looking for ways to promote doing business with Leumi as a way to help Israel. That was one reason Ms. Maor went ahead with the party in New York; in Israel, the bank celebrated in a quieter fashion.
Leumi was started in London in 1902 by the founder of the Zionist movement, Theodor Herzl, as the Anglo-Palestine Company, with $:50,000 in capital. The first branch was opened in Jaffa in 1903, although the Turkish government, which then controlled Palestine, tried to close it. The bank took on the name Leumi, which means "national," when it incorporated in Israel in 1950.
Ms. Maor said the bank was prepared to cope with a worsening crisis in Israel, both in terms of its balance sheet and in backup technology.
"We have very detailed emergency plans," Ms. Maor said. After the attacks on Sept. 11, "we found great interest in how we prepare ourselves," she said.
"People here were shocked," she added. "But in Israel you adapt rapidly because you have no choice."

HEADLINE: Former Officials Say Enron Hid Gains During Crisis in California 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 22 

 BODY:
The Enron Corporation used undisclosed reserves to keep as much as $1.5 billion in trading profits off its books during the California energy crisis, according to six former managers and executives who handled or reviewed the accounts.
 The enormous reserves, which would have doubled the company's reported profits, were hidden in late 2000 and early 2001, as energy prices soared in California and politicians accused trading companies like Enron of price gouging. The former Enron officials said that the company swelled the reserves in hopes of damping the political firestorm. 
 Further, some former executives said, Enron manipulated the reserves to help it report steady profit growth to Wall Street and credit rating agencies. Investors generally are not willing to pay as much for the stock of a volatile trading operation as they would for companies -- like Enron before its collapse -- that report steady quarter-by-quarter growth. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and investigators from the Justice Department have interviewed witnesses to determine whether the practices violated securities laws by creating "cookie jar reserves" or a kind of corporate slush fund to doctor quarterly earnings reports, according to people who have been interviewed by investigators.
The existence of the huge reserves adds a strange twist to the Enron story. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last December amid reports that executives inflated profits and hid losses with off-balance-sheet partnerships. But interviews with more than a dozen former executives and managers suggest that the company at times also held back trading profits to serve its political and financial ends.
The majority of these gains were "paper" profits on long-term contracts, rather than cash that could have helped Enron stave off the liquidity crisis that led to its collapse last fall. In any event, one former executive said, the reserves were depleted in the months before Enron's bankruptcy.
The use of reserves to manage profits is outlawed, but it is not uncommon. This month, the Microsoft Corporation agreed to settle an enforcement action in which the S.E.C. charged it with maintaining huge reserves in the late 1990's that could have been used to enhance profits when the company's earnings growth began to wane.
Former top executives at Enron, including Kenneth L. Lay, the longtime chairman, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's president and later chief executive, said last week through their spokeswomen that they were aware of the reserves but considered them proper.
Judy Leon, Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, said that money was set aside mainly in credit reserves to insulate Enron from the risk that California's utilities could be bankrupted by the crisis and left unable to pay their debts. "At no time did Mr. Skilling have any knowledge of inappropriate or illegal activity in the reserve account," she said. The S.E.C. questioned Mr. Skilling about the reserves late last year, according to a person who has reviewed his testimony.
Accounting rules allow for credit reserves -- and, indeed, California's biggest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought bankruptcy protection in April 2001, owing Enron $500 million. The rules also permit companies to reserve against specific contingencies, like litigation. And trading companies can use so-called prudency reserves to protect against market risks, like the inability to exit a trading position at a good price.
But six former Enron officials who handled or reviewed the accounts said that Enron used prudency reserves to manipulate the reported profits of its energy trading operations.
The economic value of energy trades -- particularly deals providing for the delivery of electricity long in the future -- is highly subjective. As the dominant trader, analysts say, Enron had great leeway to establish market prices. Likewise, when profits seemed bloated during the California crisis, executives said, it became common to give trades a "haircut," shifting a portion of the profits into a reserve that could later be drawn down. 
One former executive recounted how Enron traders made close to $500 million on a single day in the summer of 2000, after a natural gas pipeline burst near Carlsbad, N.M., and market prices spiked.
"We made such an incredible amount of money we didn't want to recognize it all into earnings," said the executive, who like others interviewed requested anonymity because of concern about being drawn into litigation. "We were supposed to make $500 million in a quarter and we were doing it in a day." Two other former Enron officials confirmed details of the episode.
Accounting experts said that the subjectivity of prudency reserves makes them susceptible to abuse.
"If you're using trading reserves as a mechanism for understating your positions in good times -- and therefore not reporting profits -- and later reporting the old profits in times that aren't as good, that would clearly be an abuse of the accounting rules," said Lynn Turner, a professor at Colorado State University and the former chief accountant for the S.E.C.
During the energy crisis, power shortages led to rolling blackouts and price spikes in California. Elected officials railed at power merchants, with Gov. Gray Davis accusing them of profiteering and market manipulation.
At the time, Enron executives denied the charges, blaming a poorly designed energy market for California's problems. And while the company reported profits of $350 million for the last three months of 2000 -- 34 percent more than a year earlier -- executives minimized the impact of the crisis on Enron's bottom line.
"Now for Enron, the situation in California had little impact on fourth-quarter results," Mr. Skilling told Wall Street analysts on a Jan. 22, 2001, conference call. "Let me repeat that. For Enron, the situation in California had little impact on fourth-quarter results." He explained that because Enron did not own power plants in California, the company did "not invite the same accusations the generators have faced regarding excessive profits."
The disclosure of internal documents last month describing ways that Enron's traders operated in California's market prompted officials to renew their demand for billions in refunds from energy companies. Told about the reserves, Gov. Davis expressed fresh outrage.
"Enron's made such a killing off this state, they were embarrassed to disclose it to their shareholders," the governor said on Friday in a statement. "Unfortunately, Enron will live on as a symbol for everything that has gone wrong with electricity deregulation."
Several high-ranking Enron executives said that the company began using reserves to "smooth" or "manage" earnings growth as early as 1998, when energy price spikes in the Midwest brought traders unwanted scrutiny.
Enron's disclosures about its reserves were limited, and, according to former executives, incomplete. In its year-end report for 2000, it listed $452 million in "credit and other reserves." There was nothing disclosed about prudency reserves.
Enron's use of the reserves was approved by Arthur Andersen, the company's longtime auditor, and by Richard A. Causey, the company's chief accounting officer. His lawyer, J. C. Nickens, said that Mr. Causey -- who left the company after its collapse -- told Enron's board that the company was using a combination of credit and prudency reserves.
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the independent directors who have left the board since Enron's collapse, said, "If the management of Enron was using reserves to manipulate the profits of the company, the board was completely unaware of it."
Kelly Kimberly, the spokeswoman for Mr. Lay, Enron's former chairman, said that both the growth of the prudency reserves and their subsequent release into the company's profit stream were appropriate.
"It is a common practice and in fact a responsible practice to increase prudency reserves when volatility is high and when prices are rising," she said. "In 2000, volatility was high and natural gas and electricity prices rose at least fivefold over the course of the year. In 2001, when prices and volumes declined, the prudency reserve would also have been adjusted downward."
Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Andersen, said the firm did not engage in any wrongdoing. "Andersen auditors would never, under any circumstances, tolerate an arrangement intended to manage earnings," he said. "Not in this situation, or any other, did that happen."
Former managers and executives said there were at least three types of reserve funds and that they totaled between $800 million and $2 billion at various times in 2000 and 2001.
During the California energy crisis, the reserves skyrocketed, former managers and executives said. Enron's traders were making more than enough to meet profit targets. And there were concerns that the big gains would not last.
"There were days when we were making $100 million," said another former Enron manager with access to the trading records. "When you're making that kind of money you have to ask yourself, 'Are we the market?' Your earnings are unfathomable, so you say, 'Maybe we're too large. Maybe we ought to reserve something.' "

HEADLINE: MOVIES: CRITIC'S CHOICE 

BYLINE:  By Neil Genzlinger

 BODY:
NOT a shot is fired in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY (1964), but with its perfect pacing and strong performances the film delivers the kind of heart-pounding suspense that noisier thrillers can only dream of. Burt Lancaster is a power-hungry general so upset with a nuclear arms treaty that he plans a military coup, and Kirk Douglas, ramrod straight, is the colonel who unmasks the scheme. The best performance, though, comes from Edmond O'Brien as a hard-drinking senator who supports the president. The film still packs a punch thanks to Rod Serling's lean screenplay (based on the popular novel), but there's no mistaking that the story is three decades old: a subplot involving incriminating love letters seems downright quaint, and a sturdy cigarette case ultimately saves the nation -- Tuesday at 6 p.m. on TCM. 
 Some commentators found it noteworthy that a nice guy like Denzel Washington won the Oscar this year for portraying a despicable detective in "Training Day," but he wasn't exactly warm and fuzzy in REMEMBER THE TITANS (2000) either. In the film, based on a true story, Mr. Washington plays a high school football coach who pushes his players mercilessly. It's 1971 and the school, in Virginia, has been forced to integrate. Will Patton is the white coach who defers to Mr. Washington's character, agreeing to become his assistant. Sure, it's a simplistic story of sports overcoming racial divisions, but it's stirring nonetheless -- Saturday at 
4 p.m. on WAM.
 "Urinetown" isn't the first popular stage musical based on a nutty premise. One of the most enduring is about a man-eating plant, and it took its story and title from a low-budget horror movie called THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1960). The musical, of course, became a film of its own in 1986, but this original nonmusical incarnation is in some ways even weirder. There is, for instance, a chase scene in which Seymour, the flower-shop flunky who turns to homicide, is pursued into a warehouse full of toilets. Weirdest of all, though, is that deep in this film lurks a 2001 Kennedy Center honoree for lifetime artistic achievement: yes, that pain-loving patient in the dentist's office, asking for no Novocain, is Jack Nicholson -- Friday at 2 p.m. on Channel 55.
 Another now-familiar-but-then-unknown face turns up in MYSTIC PIZZA (1988), about a trio of waitresses who form a friendship. When JoJo (Lili Taylor) asks Daisy, the wild one of the group, where she is going to be in 10 years, it's Julia Roberts who answers: "How the hell do I know where I'll be 10 years from now? I could be dead for all I know." Well, she's not dead, and you could see back then why she would become so famous. She's luminous, even under all that 1980's hair. You can also get a glimpse of little Matt Damon, playing a rich boy's bratty younger brother -- Sunday at 10 p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m. on Family.
 When the documentary STARTUP.COM (2001) was released, the go-go Internet economy had already begun its decline. The film, which follows some young entrepreneurs on a giddy journey as they jump on the dot.com bandwagon and then fall off, had the feel of a morning-after hangover back then, immediate and embarrassing. Today, through the filter of Sept. 11, it still has that feel, but doubly so. It's hard to watch millions of dollars being squandered on a relatively frivolous enterprise without thinking what all that money and energy could have done if applied to more important needs. Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman are the partners who create the startup, govWork.com, and Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim are the filmmakers who chronicle their efforts in fascinating detail -- Sunday at 8:35 a.m. and 6 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 a.m. on Sundance.

 Re "Putin Calls for Russians to Bring Funds Back Home" (World Business, June 20): 
 The recent stories about American business practices -- including devious tax-avoidance schemes, crooked accounting, insider trading and vast transfers of wealth from investors to executives -- could easily be stories about the Russian kleptocracy. 
President Vladimir V. Putin is calling on Russian business executives to bring back funds that they are sheltering abroad. 
With the business news in the United States increasingly resembling the news in Russia, perhaps President Bush could follow Mr. Putin's lead and call on American executives to bring their money home from the offshore tax havens that have proliferated in recent years.
I find it curious that Mr. Putin could be a more outspoken advocate of economic reform than our own president.

HEADLINE: Ready for an Upturn. Not Ready to Spend. 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
ALEXANDER M. CUTLER worked his way up through three recessions. Unlike many chief executives, he has learned to thrive in downturns, and has made his reputation that way at the Eaton Corporation, the giant manufacturer based here. This downturn, however, has been different. 
 "The recession we've been through," Mr. Cutler said, "was as steep as anything we've seen since 1981 and 1982," which stands as the worst since World War II. "Everybody keeps comparing what just happened to the mild '90-'91 recession. That totally misses it." 
 National statistics are signaling recovery now, but Mr. Cutler worries that the data are too upbeat. While the Bush administration and many forecasters see a revival under way, he sees only "mild indications" of the beginning of an upturn. It will not be truly recognizable at Eaton, he said, until the fall. Even then, his managers will have incentives to be tightfisted and to shun the risk of overexpansion because the bust has been so painful. 
"Any company that has been through the trauma of laying off people," Mr. Cutler said, referring to the 19 plants and 12,000 jobs -- 20 percent of the work force -- that Eaton has eliminated in the last 18 months, "is going to be cautious about adding that incremental person or investment dollar back until you are really sure that you have a stream of new orders coming in."
That reluctance, shared by chief executives across manufacturing, could become self-fulfilling, weakening the economy for many months. By cutting capital spending, the nation's manufacturers helped bring on the recession. Now their determination to squeeze as much production as possible from scaled-back plants and shrunken work forces is shaping the recovery. Instead of a rapid decline followed by rapid rebound, the recession is being followed by a slow rebound. 
Eaton makes hydraulic and electrical devices as well as truck and auto components in 109 American factories and 100 more abroad. It is still in the decline stage, and so are many of its customers. Because Eaton sells components to other producers, its difficulties reflect manufacturing as a whole. The nation's manufacturers, in turn, have enough leverage through spending and hiring to speed up a recovery.
"Manufacturing dragged the economy into recession," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo. "And now it has the leeway, more than any other sector, to pull the economy back up." 
But if gradual economic growth is the nation's lot, the productivity gains at companies like Eaton may result in a more efficient, more profitable corporate sector -- or, in a future stretch of hard times, in companies that will not have to pull back so drastically when revenue is falling and profits are squeezed. That is Eaton's goal today.
"Restructuring on the fly," Mr. Cutler called the solution. While Eaton is further along in the process than most manufacturers, he said, it is still finding ways to produce more with a reduced work force and restricted investment. 
Mr. Cutler presents himself as a chief executive who cuts costs ethically. At 51, he still has the square-faced youthfulness of a varsity football player and pole vaulter. He was both at Yale and the Loomis Chaffee prep school in Windsor, Conn., where his parents sent him from their home in Milwaukee. In an interview in his living-room-size office here, near a framed photograph of his wife, Sarah, on horseback, Mr. Cutler extracts from the story of his 24 years as an Eaton executive the managerial qualities that he views as essential for chief executives.
The main ones seem to be these: the ability to absorb new information quickly and to act on it without second-guessing. In his career, that has meant a lot of downsizing, without looking back. Many critics of downsizing point to it as a huge source of job insecurity and even alienation. Corporate America nevertheless has adopted the practice as an essential tool in achieving productivity and cost control. And in this context, Mr. Cutler has developed what he describes as a procedure for laying off workers as painlessly as possible.
"We try to give as much advance warning as we can, and we try to talk people through the process as we're developing information," he said. Benefits to those laid off are generous, he said: a year's pay for workers with at least 25 years' service, at least three months' pay for short-termers and company-paid health insurance for the severance period.
"I think our employees understand it," he said, "and as a result, when we have had to go through a contraction, we've been very fortunate that we have not suffered employee sabotage, people leaving before we can get a job done."

Slimming Down
In Mr. Cutler's eyes, the Eaton plant in Asheville, N.C., is a fine illustration of the company's gains in efficiency. The plant is a collection of unionized operations from the North that over the last 35 years were moved to the South and became nonunion. The median wage at Asheville is $14.54 an hour, high for the city but $8 to $10 an hour less than it would be in a Northern city, said Richard A. Stinson, vice president of Eaton's power distribution division. 
From this plant, acquired from Westinghouse in 1994, come control boxes and panels, similar in function to residential fuse boxes but far larger and more technologically advanced. Customers -- say, a manufacturer or a hospital -- use them to bring power from the street and distribute it in-house. The plant's payroll, at 701 employees in 1999, when sales were $146 million, has been cut to 574. Sales in May ran at an annual rate of $125 million. 
"We have gotten much more aggressive about laying off nonperformers," Mr. Stinson said.
In addition, mandatory, unpaid furloughs lasting up to 28 days have reduced the hours of the remaining employees by the equivalent of 78 workers. When the rebound finally comes, Mr. Stinson explains, production and sales can rise even higher than the 1999 level without the need to increase staffing. Ending the furloughs would be enough to expand capacity by 40 percent without any capital investment, he said.
If Eaton's sales are hurting, competitors have lost even more sales, some to Eaton, Mr. Cutler says -- an assertion he makes for all of Eaton's products. In today's zero-growth marketplace, he said, the battle in manufacturing is over market share. 
During a tour of the plant, Charles L. Haltiwanger, the plant manager, points out the "process improvements" that he says have helped lock in the new capacity. Instead of assigning individuals to assemble entire cable boxes, for example, the work is being shifted to a more efficient assembly line. A design modification has also helped.
Elsewhere, plastic bins filled with bronze bolts, washers and nuts are lined up within reach of a worker who uses them to secure the metal panels of huge control boxes. The worker, Irvin Ball, says that in the past, the bins were scattered, forcing him to walk to get what he needed. "We used to bolt together six or seven of these structures in a shift," Mr. Ball said. "Now we are up to 15 to 16." 
Many customers now enter orders via computer, requiring less labor for Eaton. Previously, faxes and mail were more the norm. The efficiencies have pushed down costs at Asheville faster than prices have fallen, or at least as fast, a phenomenon that also shows up in the Commerce Department's national measures of the economy for the last two quarters. That downward spread produced the first spurt in corporate profits since the fall of 2000.
For Eaton, just holding the line on prices is considered an achievement, and at Asheville, price increases come only by adding bells and whistles to the electrical controls, Mr. Haltiwanger said, just as automakers charge extra for sliding sunroofs.
"We can charge more for load shedders and for diagnostic devices," he said, speaking of add-ons for large pieces of equipment. "In today's market, we can get a 10 percent premium for faster cycle time," or weeks between order and delivery. "And tomorrow," he added, "when sales come back and demand is greater, the premium for faster cycle time will be 30 to 40 percent."
At a far end of the plant, a new laser-beam device, the only significant recent capital expenditure, cuts steel sheets into parts of various shapes. Metal stamping, however, is not what Mr. Cutler describes as a core competency -- not a means of adding much value, or price, to a product. That would seem to make Asheville's metal stamping a candidate for outsourcing, although Eaton is not planning that now.
Across Eaton, outsourcing has been a means to reduce what Mr. Cutler calls its capital intensity. The company has outsourced transmission plates, metal housings, castings and distribution operations to contractors in the United States or abroad -- and Eaton's capital spending has fallen to $275 million, or 4.5 percent of net sales revenue, from $500 million, or 6 percent, in 1999.
The new goal, even in the next boom, is to hold down capital spending to 4 percent of net sales revenue. Eaton, meanwhile, is paying down debt, retiring $663 million over the last five quarters, so that when the moment comes, Mr. Cutler said, Eaton will have "the financial capacity to invest" again.
"You will see capital spending come back," he said, "but with a lag."

The Lessons of Hard Times
The trauma that has made Mr. Cutler so cautious -- "the dark side of the bubble," as he puts it -- was abrupt and precipitous. Emotion and awe edge into his voice when he recounts the events that were already coming at Eaton when he took over in August 2000 as chairman and chief executive. During his first 16 months, $1 billion disappeared from $8.3 billion in annual sales revenue, cutting net income by more than half.
The damage spread across all of Eaton's divisions, and net sales revenue is still falling, although only at half the 15 percent rate of last year. Shipments will not begin to turn up significantly until late this year, Mr. Cutler says. Not since the Rust Belt crisis of the 1980's has Eaton had such an experience. Then, the company shrank by one-third, and while the "resizing" is less drastic now, he said, it is much swifter and steadier.
"Some people will say, 'Gee, that's tough; that's insensitive,' " he said. "My view of it is that attentiveness to month-to-month and year-to-year productivity gains is really a tremendous focus in the economy."
His management tactics were shaped during a difficult stretch for American industry. In 1975, having just earned an M.B.A. at Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School, Mr. Cutler returned to Milwaukee and went to work for Cutler-Hammer, an electrical equipment maker. His great-grandfather had founded the company, and an uncle still ran it as chairman, although it had been taken public decades earlier. 
Eaton in the 1970's was a Cleveland-based maker of truck transmissions, clutches and auto components, and in its first big fling at diversification, it acquired Cutler-Hammer in 1978. Mr. Cutler came with the package. By the early 1980's, during a recession, he found himself managing an Eaton electrical parts factory in Atlanta. The plant's major customer, an air-conditioner manufacturer, bought 60 percent of its output and was unhappy.
"We were going to lose that customer within three months after I got there," Mr. Cutler said. "That was the challenge."
The customer stayed, satisfied with Mr. Cutler's improvements -- or, more to the point, his operating style. Glossing over details, Mr. Cutler talked about speed and decisiveness as the qualities that served him in Atlanta and still do. "You've got two choices," he said. "You can get on with it, or you can stew about it. And you might as well get on with it."
Getting on with it meant the decision in January 2001 -- five months after Mr. Cutler became chairman -- to close 19 factories and eliminate 12,000 jobs, mostly in the United States. That reduced the work force to 27,000 in the United States and 20,000 abroad. He acted soon after the Federal Reserve decided that the economy was sinking and began to slash rates.
Even while majoring in history and economics at Yale, Mr. Cutler had shown a preference for getting on with things. Rather than delve profoundly into the forces that shaped the United States, whose basic history he knew from prep school, he studied Japan. "I think you can study the same subject forever and you are going to learn the last 4 percent of it, and that is not of that much interest to me," he said of American history. "It's learning the new things that matters." 
It was a quality that helped to lift Mr. Cutler to the posts of president and chief operating officer. He held those jobs from 1995 to 2000, while Stephen R. Hardis was chairman and chief executive. As Mr. Hardis, who retired at 65, describes their relationship, Mr. Hardis was the conceptualizer who put together a series of acquisitions and divestitures that completed Eaton's diversification, while Mr. Cutler was the doer who integrated the acquisitions and strengthened central management.
When the downsizing began, the task fell to Mr. Cutler. "I know I could not have done the cost-cutting," Mr. Hardis said. "He is much better at it." 

Reading Signs of Change
To Mr. Cutler, the new economy never existed separately from the old. In their enthusiasm, high-technology companies drew in old-line manufacturers like Eaton and everyone overexpanded together. Consider electric generators for auxiliary power, popular products among the flourishing dot-coms, which they used as backup in their well-appointed offices and plants. Eaton makes circuit breakers and other components for generators, and to meet the demand in the late 1990's, it expanded production at two factories.
When the bubble burst, "we had to cut way back," Mr. Cutler said, adding that Eaton will not easily bring back those two assembly lines. 
For all his reluctance today to embrace the optimistic talk of an upturn, Mr. Cutler missed the first signals of the recession. In July 1999, he was still 13 months away from taking over at Eaton, but as chief operating officer he was very much in charge of daily operations, and he made an appearance at a golf outing for truck dealers. At dinner, he asked the dealer sitting next to him how things were going and learned for the first time that prices for used tractor-trailers had begun to fall sharply.
"I can remember talking to people about what he said," Mr. Cutler recalled. "And people said: 'He's crazy. He does not know what he is talking about.' "
The booming new-truck market was still six months away from reacting to the pressure of declining freight and overproduction. Net sales revenue across Eaton's product lines was still climbing toward $8.3 billion in 2000, and the payroll had swollen to 59,000 from 41,000 in 1995. Times seemed good, and Eaton's chief economist, James Miel, assured Mr. Cutler that they were. "Our interpretation was too sunny," Mr. Miel said, "and Cutler soon sensed it."
Now the antennas are out for the upturn. "There is a lot of goofy economics out there," Mr. Cutler said. "One of the best places to find out whether the economy is up or down is to hop into a private car in New York or Chicago and ask the limousine driver how business is." 
It is not good.

This Summer Camp Grows Young Entrepreneurs

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
DAN LYNCH knows that he is one of the fortunate ones. A Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor, he helped start, and later sold, a string of successful high-technology companies long before the dot-com bubble burst. (Remember CyberCash and Infoseek?)
 Now he spends most of his free time in his 1,000-acre vineyard in the Napa Valley, leisurely making wine under the Lynch Valley and Napa Dan labels. But he is hardly resting. 
 "When my ship came in, it became obvious to me that I wanted to do my part to help give back to society," Mr. Lynch, 60, said in a recent interview.
Next weekend, he and his wife, Karen, will officially open Camp Venture Creek in the hills of Nevada City, Calif., near Sacramento. It is a nonprofit operation where children ages 8 to 14 can hike, swim, work on arts and crafts and, through a daily 90-minute program called KidBiz, learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. 
Plenty of specialized camps are available, and some focus on business or entrepreneurship. But how many have a mentor list that includes top executives from Sun Microsystems, Accel Partners, Akamai Technologies, Softbank and Bowman Capital?
Camp Venture Creek costs $1,800 for a two-week session. But tuition can be sharply discounted, based on household income, and scholarships are available. A child from a family with an annual income of less than $60,000 may pay as little as $100.
One goal of the camp, Mr. Lynch said, is to help children, particularly those from low-income families, turn their passions into profits. 
"We teach kids the concept of marketing: Who are you trying to reach? What do they need?" he said. "And if that is something you love to do, you win."
Mr. Lynch bought the 60-acre camp, a fixer-upper, two years ago. Last summer, he recruited 255 low-income children from California and Washington, D.C., for a pilot program there. For many of the campers, he said, it meant three square meals a day for the first time.
The business part of the Camp Venture Creek pilot program begins with an introduction to basic business concepts, like supply and demand and marketing. The children in the pilot program were asked to make two lists -- of things they are passionate about and things they do well. Then they were told to come up with a business idea based on the two that would serve the camp market. By the third day, the children were drawing up simple business plans with help from camp counselors.
The ventures they created were as diverse as the children themselves and spawned a thriving camp economy, complete with its own currency.
Four 12-year-old girls developed a post-card business, figuring that other campers would want to write home. (Two of the more artistically inclined girls designed them, while the other two focused on the business side.) A group of three boys started an advertising firm to help the other children promote their ventures. 
But if there were a Most Likely to Succeed in Silicon Valley Award, it might have gone to an 11-year-old boy from Oakland, Calif. He appointed himself the landlord for the camp and began charging "rent" to the other campers. With the "money" he took in, he set up a bank, granting loans to those who needed capital to expand their ventures. He did not stop there: when some of the ventures went bankrupt, he bought them and set about turning them into money-making ventures.
Participants this year can expect the help of mentors from the worlds of technology and venture capital -- many of them friends of Mr. Lynch. The mentors include Bud Colligan, a software entrepreneur who is now a partner at Accel Partners, the venture capital firm, and Meihong Xu, a principal at Softbank Ventures.
Mr. Lynch and his staff said they were heartened by the business knowledge displayed by their budding proteges last summer. But, they added, the camp aims to teach much more than business. Equally important, they said, are life lessons in collaboration, relationships, goal-setting, responsibility and the integrity of creating something of value. 
"We teach them that they can take risks and can be masters of their own destiny," said Dennis Campbell, the program director of the camp.
That is something that Mr. Lynch has learned over the years -- along with the value of perseverance. He spent 15 years as a computer center manager at various California universities and became familiar with Arpanet, the precursor of the Internet. It was not until 1986, however, that he had his first business success -- Interop, a popular computer networking conference he started when the market for such technology was taking off. After selling the conference to Ziff Davis Media, he became an "angel investor," helping to start several successful companies, including UUNet, an Internet networking company that was later bought by WorldCom and then by America Online; CyberCash, an online payment system that was bought by Verisign; and Infoseek, an early Internet search engine company that was acquired by the Walt Disney Company. 
DESPITE his past successes, Mr. Lynch is not immune to the continuing steep decline in the value of technology companies. He initially intended to support the camp on his own, and has already spent $7 million to set the camp into motion. But he needs to raise $10 million more, he says -- perhaps from some of his venture capital friends -- to keep it going.
"I really like the idea of doing my own camp; I get to define what's going to happen," he said. "Part of the joy of being a start-up is that you are master of your own ship."
"It would have been much easier to write a check," he added. "Instead, I got in and wrestled with it as an operating business."

HEADLINE: A Cheerleader, for a Company in a Midlife Funk 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
WHAT the boy could not do well himself, he recruited someone else to accomplish. Specifically, he was not about to lose his childhood church-league basketball championship, but being slight and, while coordinated, not supremely athletic, he needed to attract great players to join his team.
 That was something that the boy -- John T. Chambers, who would become chief executive of Cisco Systems -- had a real knack for. "His teams always won; he picked his people very well," said his father, also John, adding with a laugh: "Whether or not they were all Methodist, I was never sure." 
 The boy grew up, and those traits became the chief executive's trademarks: organization, execution, unabashed optimism -- and, pointedly, recruiting through acquisition. Cisco, the Internet behemoth, built an empire by buying technology from start-ups, not developing it internally. The style reflected that Mr. Chambers, unlike his best-known counterparts in Silicon Valley, was foremost a salesman, not a technologist. 
Now this formula is being tested.
Cisco, whose fortunes rose and fell mercurially with the Internet bubble, is acquiring companies at a markedly slower pace. Industry analysts and some former Cisco executives wonder if it can buy its way to another pinnacle, find another means to soar and to develop and mine new markets, or whether its best days are behind it, with its legacy tied inexorably to the irrational exuberance of the boom. After all, its current businesses are on a pace to register about $19 billion in revenue this fiscal year, a 13 percent decline.
In short, Cisco is in a midlife crisis. And it has fallen upon Mr. Chambers to field a new winning team. "This is not a company you want to bet against," said Mr. Chambers, 52, whose competitive drive can be masked by the staccato twang of Appalachia.
Then again, there is no way around it: those who placed their bets with him in 2000 did not just lose -- they were battered. In March 2000, Cisco's market value peaked at $555 billion, briefly eclipsing Microsoft as the world's most valuable company. Cisco's market value has since dropped more than $450 billion, costing its shareholders five times what Enron cost its investors.
The company, which Mr. Chambers said was caught by surprise when corporate technology spending went from 60 miles an hour to zero in the blink of an eye, wrote off $2.2 billion in unused inventory last year. It declared its first quarterly loss ever. It laid off 8,000 people -- 17 percent of its work force -- casualties in part of Mr. Chambers's zealously optimistic outlook for the markets for routers and Ethernet switches, Cisco's main products.
YET Cisco is far from undone. While technology spending has stagnated, the company remains the Shaquille O'Neal of its core markets, dominating the competition. Cisco held 81 percent of the $7 billion market for routers in 2001 and a 62 percent share of the $11 billion market for switches, according to the Dell'Oro Group, a market research firm. (Routers direct data to a neighborhood while switches deliver it to a particular office.)
Still, after the bust, Mr. Chambers has sought to move Cisco past triage and into long-term rebuilding by reorganizing the company, cutting costs and focusing on new markets, like Internet telephony, security and wireless communications.
He acknowledged that he had erred during the boom by concentrating so much on next-generation telecommunications carriers. Those customers crashed and burned, and Mr. Chambers now courts their rivals, traditional phone companies. For the last 12 months, he has taken only $1 in salary and options on two million shares at around $16 a share. The stock closed Friday at $13.74.
The strategy has been well received on Wall Street. Many stock analysts who cover Cisco remain bullish about the company and Mr. Chambers, whom they credit with seeing and capitalizing on technology trends. That may be why Cisco sales have fallen far less than those of its competitors, as Mr. Chambers is fond of pointing out.
This is important, analysts say, not only because it shows Cisco's relative standing, but because it also underscores a change in Mr. Chambers's pitch since the boom. Previously, he evangelized about all things Internet; now he extols Cisco, Cisco, Cisco.
"He was like a Greenspan for technology," said Stephen Kamman, a stock analyst at CIBC World Markets, who said Mr. Chambers's message became narrower as the technology market plunged. "A year ago, the message was, 'I speak for the entire industry.' Now it's: 'I speak for Cisco. I don't know about those other guys, but I'm going to get through this, and I'm going to do it by eating their lunch.' "
Mr. Chambers might feel that way, but he would be unlikely to use those exact words. He is competitive, but not verbally aggressive. Unlike his peers -- Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, Steven P. Jobs of Apple Computer or Bill Gates of Microsoft -- he is not only not a technologist, he is also not known for overt egoism, or for ruffling feathers. He is, in a word, polite. If Andrew S. Grove of Intel has the mantra "Only the paranoid survive," Mr. Chambers's might be: "Only the polite thrive."
"It's easy to criticize Chambers because he's so visible," said Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of Google, the search engine. "But he's not mercurial. He's not odd. He's steady. He's sincere. He's the kind of guy you chat with at Safeway."
Mr. Chambers says he tries to be consummately focused on consumers. He says he asks people constantly what Cisco can do better -- not only customers, but everyone he meets who is willing to express an opinion. He said recently that two passing joggers stopped him to say hello, and he asked them, "What do you think we ought to do better?" Two nights later, he asked the car valet at a restaurant, who said, "Keep doing what you're doing."
"I learn by listening," Mr. Chambers said. If he hears the same thing two or three times, he added, it may be worth acting upon.
But critics are skeptical. After all, they ask, how much could the chief executive of one of the world's largest high-technology companies learn from a car valet or passing joggers? The critics suggest that his inquiries are more the stuff of seduction, a constant effort to endear himself to whoever is listening. Others say they mask a more aggressive streak.
David House, now chief executive of Allegro Networks, said that when he was chief of Bay Networks, which competes with Cisco, he once had a contract all but signed with a company that had been buying its equipment and getting technical support from Cisco. At the last minute, the company backed out of the order.
"I got a call from the C.E.O., who said, 'Dave, I'm not going to give you that order,' " Mr. House recalled, saying the executive added, " 'I just got a call from John Chambers, and he said that if I put this piece of foreign equipment in my network, they will pull their service people out.' "
"He can be very charming," said Mr. House, who professes to like and admire Mr. Chambers personally. "But he can turn in a nanosecond into a fierce killer."
Some other critics say Mr. Chambers's optimism is misplaced -- and excessive. Whether that is the case, there is no disputing that he always seems to look on the bright side and to find it brighter each time he looks.
He advocates the adoption of technology, not for technology's sake, but for its healing powers. He hails Cisco's capacity to improve not just productivity, but also to improve lives. In this regard, he is downright evangelical. When he addresses big audiences of customers or industry groups, he comes across as a mix of manager and missionary. His is not a podium, but a pulpit.
"I am truly the optimist in the industry," he told a gathering of customers and industry analysts in Atlanta three weeks ago, because of the effect that communications and its applications will have "on changing every aspect of our lives."
MR. CHAMBERS says he gleaned his people skills from his mother, June, a psychiatrist, and his business skills from his father, an obstetrician and gynecologist who had a knack for business and real estate. They raised him in Charleston, W. Va., where Mr. Chambers was a good student who overcame his dyslexia and loved all things athletic. "I tried to get him to collect stamps, but he wasn't interested," his father said, noting that sports and school were his interests.
Mr. Chambers discovered early on that he had the dyslexia. It did not prevent him from excelling in school. He received a bachelor's degree in business and a law degree from West Virginia University and an M.B.A. from Indiana University. His father said his son succeeded not because of his unparalleled intellect but because of phenomenal organizational skills, coupled with a natural affinity for people.
"He's like his mother and I," the elder Mr. Chambers said. "We're not all that smart. We do O.K., but we're not brilliant. He does have people skills -- that's his really strong point."
And he was not a quitter, apparently with one exception. He sought to get a pilot's license when he was barely in college, his father said, but stopped when he was three hours from completing the training. The father said his son secretly didn't want to disappoint his dad, who, disliking the potential risks, told him, "You screw up flying and you're going to wind up dead." (A spokeswoman for Cisco said Mr. Chambers quit -- in what must be one of the eventual multimillionaire's worst prognostications -- because he worried that he could not afford such an expensive hobby.)
These days, he does not do the flying himself, but he has made enough money to own his own jet. He has two homes, a primary one in Los Altos Hills, an affluent area of Silicon Valley, and a weekend home near Carmel, an hour's drive down the coast. The Carmel house has a huge picture-window view of the Pacific.
Over all, however, Mr. Chambers says he leads a modest life with his wife, Elaine, with whom he has two grown children. He irons his own shirts, he said, and Elaine, who was also his high school sweetheart, "tells me to take out the garbage and reminds me that I'm not the C.E.O. of the house."
HE has little time for much else. He said he regularly works 11-hour days, leaving voice mails for managers as late as 11 p.m. He fuels himself with Diet Cokes, drinking around a dozen a day. He tries to jog three miles daily, and he plays golf and tennis.
He is also politically active, giving generously and often on both sides of the aisle. The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks contributions, reported that his gifts included $100,000 in October 2000 to the Republican National State Elections Committee. But in June 2001, he gave $15,000 each to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee.
For someone raised by a psychiatrist, he is not particularly introspective about his ambition. "What drives me is building a company that will last," he said. When pressed about his personal motivation, he added, "Changing the way the world lives, works, learns and plays."
Whatever his style of presentation, or personal style, he has impressed many people on Wall Street with his ability to execute, to read markets and to understand the technology landscape, despite not being a technologist by training. They say he acquires and integrates as well as any chief executive in the country.
After spending six years at I.B.M. and eight years at Wang Laboratories, he arrived at Cisco in 1991 as a senior vice president for worldwide sales and operations. Mr. Chambers became the president and chief executive in January 1995, when his predecessor, John P. Morgridge, became the chairman.
Early on, he oversaw the integration of Crescendo Communications, a switch company that Cisco acquired for $89 million and that set the tone for its strategy in the boom. Cisco closed 71 acquisitions from 1993 to 2001 -- 25 in 2000 alone. It has closed on just two this year and announced two more.
"He figured out a simple way to use acquisition to build a massive company," said Mr. Schmidt of Google. "He'd buy a company for 10 times revenue, put them through his sales force" and more than recoup his investment.
"The company is full of John Chambers clones," Mr. Schmidt added. "They are good buyers of technology and sellers of systems, and they've done it for 10 years."
But there are critics who say that strategy has run its course.
Ariane Mahler, an analyst at Dresdner, Kleinwort & Wasserstein, who is one of the few on Wall Street who does not recommend that investors buy Cisco, said the company, by virtue of acquiring much of its underlying technology, lacks the culture to innovate and will find its own products lagging.
It is a view shared by several former Cisco executives. "The company's ability to fill a void doesn't mean it has enough strength to cause a major shift to occur" that will drive new markets, said one former Cisco executive, who requested anonymity because he said his new company deals with Cisco.
Ms. Mahler said: "They don't have the best technology, but they do have the best relationships. No matter how charming John Chambers is -- no matter how much you like him -- some of those relationships will erode."
She says, for example, that Mr. Chambers must repair his relationship with traditional phone companies after banking unsuccessfully on selling to the failed next-generation carriers. "It was like being an arms merchant to Iran, then trying to sell to Iraq," she said.
Mr. Chambers chafes at the idea that his company is not innovating, and that it cannot build the technology that will satisfy the telecommunications markets or pave the way into new markets, like selling switches to deliver telephone traffic over the Internet.
The company cited as an example of its innovations a router that won Best in Show at the 2001 Network and Intertop Trade Show and is designed to carry storage data. It said the new router was based on technology it acquired when it bought a company called NuSpeed in 2000, but then Cisco developed the product fully and made it ready for market.
"Our customers are happy with our innovation strategy," Mr. Chambers said. "Let the results speak for themselves. Our market share is not only No. 1 -- but No. 1 by a long way. You don't get that without product leadership."
AFTER his speech at an event called Supercomm in Atlanta, many people in attendance said they remained convinced that Cisco's best days were not behind it. Mr. Chambers's success, several analysts said, was not a product of the boom, but of his own abilities -- to see what needs to be done to create a successful company, then to put the pieces in place.
"He's probably the most savvy representative of networking technology there is in the United States," said Ian McPherson, an analyst with Optical Networking Research at Communications Industry Researchers, a market research firm.
"He's very practical," he added. "It doesn't necessarily mean that Cisco has the best products for every solution," but that Cisco consistently seems able to stay ahead by making incremental changes to itself and to its technology.
The same goes, apparently, for Mr. Chambers, who has made a career of recognizing holes and filling them.
His church-league teammates would be proud.

HEADLINE: Assessing Watergate 30 Years Later 

BYLINE:  By Richard Reeves; Richard Reeves is the author of, most recently, "President Nixon: Alone in the White House."

 BODY:
President Richard Nixon would have loved the coverage of the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in last week. The scandal that drove him from office has been pretty much reduced to a little guessing game about who did or didn't whisper in the ear of a young Washington Post reporter that there were some bad things going on in the White House. Who was Deep Throat? Who cares? The press cares, that's who.
 Nixon wanted Americans to think of Watergate as a third-rate burglary -- just another White House melodrama, like Bill and Monica -- and he may get his wish. Journalists' predilection for putting ourselves at the center of history and tacking "gate" onto the names of later scandals, great and small, is gradually trivializing the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's. 
 Watergate was not just a burglary. It was not about personal finances like Whitewater. It was not about a president's knowledge of clandestine foreign operations as in the U-2 affair or Iran-contra. Watergate was a clandestine domestic operation in which a determined president secretly plotted what amounted to a coup d'etat against American constitutional government.
The real story and lessons of Watergate are in peril of being lost or forgotten. Thirty years of research, scholarship and confession -- millions of documents, thousands of tapes -- have made it perfectly clear that the botched break-in of June 17, 1972, at the Democratic National Committee offices was actually a small incident in Nixon's deliberate, if sometimes clumsy, effort to secretly create a new kind of all-powerful presidential government that reflected his own contempt for democracy and for the Constitution's checks and balances designed to restrict the power of presidents.
Richard Nixon was a strange and gifted man and, in his own words, an introvert in an extrovert's business. In his years at the White House, he spent more and more time alone, writing out his thoughts and frustrations late at night on yellow legal pads or scheming with the two men he saw most, his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. He was not kidding when he said that he envied Mao Zedong because the Chinese Communist dictator could rule a vast country with only two or three other men involved in critical decision making.
If Nixon's personal desire was to be alone with his thoughts, his presidential goal was to decide and act alone. One of the more amazing documents uncovered in recent years was the secret contract he forced Cabinet members to sign after he was re-elected in 1972. He retreated to Camp David to craft a plan to reorganize the executive branch. One of the 15 clauses of the contract read: "No policy-making resides in any Policy Council, Policy Group, Assistant to the President, Counselor to the President, or Cabinet Secretary, except as expressly designated by the President. . . . A Cabinet Secretary should not be encouraged to anticipate either free access or frequent consultation with the President."
He operated behind screens of secrets and layer upon layer of lies, big and small, a strategy that worked in his first term. Nixon was able to make great decisions, world-changing decisions, without the advice or interference of Congress, the courts, the federal bureaucracy, the press -- and certainly without the knowledge or consent of the governed. 
Take two of the great milestones of the Nixon years: the opening to China in 1972 and taking the United States dollar off the gold standard in 1971, which changed the economy of the world. Both of those momentous initiatives were created on his yellow pads or in secret meetings involving fewer than two dozen people. There was no public debate or discussion. Both were presented to the American people as faits accomplis in television announcements by the president.
Nixon had learned to govern by surprise. His most important role model was Charles de Gaulle, another antidemocratic elected president, who governed more or less by edict. But surprise in the American system required enormous secrecy. Protecting the secrecy required lies -- so many that some of the most important officials of the country had no idea what the truth was and neither, it could be argued, did Nixon at the end. By then the military was tapping White House telephones and sending its own operatives to the building at night to empty wastebaskets, steal documents and photograph National Security Council records.
The baffles of deceptions began not with a burglary, but with a murder in June 1969. Nixon dictated lies to the Central Intelligence Agency to prevent the court-martial of six Green Berets for murdering one of their own spies. It happened that the man, Thai Khac Chuyen, was involved in target selection and damage evaluation for secret bombing in Cambodia. Any legal process would have revealed the bombing, which was being kept secret from Congress and the public by phony Air Force record-keeping ordered by the president.
A year later, Nixon approved a secret plan, the so-called Huston Plan, authorizing domestic electronic surveillance and lifting restrictions on surreptitious entry. He had to back down on that plan because the F.B.I. director, J. Edgar Hoover, refused to cooperate, saying the press or Congress would eventually discover what was happening. Then Nixon decided to do the same thing from inside the White House in 1971, creating an extra-legal secret operation that included the unit called the Plumbers. By early 1972, Nixon, his re-election committee and the Republican National Committee were using illegally collected cash to pay the Plumbers, a group of low-lifes capable of breaking into offices and embassies to plant telephone taps and to photograph papers.
Three years after the Green Beret cover-up, the Plumbers were caught in the Watergate building. Whether Nixon himself ordered that particular operation may never be known, but he tried to use the Central Intelligence Agency to cover up the incident. The details of what he knew don't matter that much now. He was the one who made the decision to pay off the burglars for their silence in court, committing the crime that eventually crushed him.
There will always be political scandal revealed in a country with a healthy free press. But Watergate was unique as the climax of a presidency that believed that governance required lies and deception. Though Nixon was pardoned, his legacy was the destruction of American faith in government and its elected leaders. And that -- not the heroics of the press -- is what should be remembered about the episode called Watergate.

HEADLINE: Insiders Trading 

 BODY:
Insider trading is so closely associated with the late 1980's, the time of the last epic popping of a stock market bubble, that there is a certain elegiac quality to the latest scandal on Wall Street. When Samuel Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone, was arrested at home recently and charged with insider trading, one couldn't help but think of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. The latest bubble was all about a supposed new economy, but some of its dirty tricks may have been timeless classics. 
 Dr. Waksal denies charges that he tipped off family members to sell their shares of ImClone, a biotechnology company, last December, before the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration had rejected its application for approval of a new cancer drug. Dr. Waksal's father and one of his daughters sold ImClone stock for about $10 million in the two days before the news became public, and he himself tried unsuccessfully to sell shares worth about $5 million. His brokers refused to make the trades. 
 A Congressional panel has been looking into whether more needs to be done to prevent corporate insiders from trading on private communications from a regulatory agency like the F.D.A.
What has propelled the ImClone case into late-night TV monologues is the involvement of that doyenne of all things tidy and decorous, Martha Stewart. A friend of Dr. Waksal's, she managed to sell all of her 3,928 shares of ImClone on Dec. 27, the day before the company released the news about the F.D.A.'s decision. Ms. Stewart, a director of the New York Stock Exchange, insists that she did not act on any inside information.
Still, these allegations have further roiled investors who already feel victimized by the duplicity of insiders like Enron's Kenneth Lay and Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski, chief executives who made millions unloading shares while urging others to keep the faith. Cases of abusive executive compensation are another form of insider trading at shareholders' expense, and they are seen nowadays as a further indictment of the entire market.
By contrast, in 1999, when Ms. Stewart's own fastidious empire had its splashy initial public offering as the markets soared, the stock market still seemed to most Americans to be a benign tidal wave of empowerment -- both for their wondrous retirement plans and for the ingenuity of people like Martha Stewart.
Unfortunately, plenty of other cases of financial chicanery are likely to be revealed before new reforms and a sustained rally can again restore public faith in the fairness of the market.

 GLOBALIZATION AND
ITS DISCONTENTS
By Joseph E. Stiglitz.
282 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 During the prosperous but politically volatile 1960's, Presidents Kennedy and Johnson summoned a formidable team of diplomatic and military experts. Among them were Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara and McGeorge Bundy. They guided foreign policy at a time when it seemed the Russians might win the cold war. They fought Communism all over the globe and, notoriously, refused to let another domino fall in Vietnam.
During the prosperous but economically volatile 1990's, President Clinton formed an inner circle dominated by the nation's finest financial minds. Among them were Robert Rubin, a Wall Street legend; Lawrence Summers, who gained tenure at Harvard at a younger age than anyone before him; and Stanley Fischer, an M.I.T. economist whose students staffed finance ministries worldwide. The three brought free markets to nearly every developing nation. They also committed hundreds of billions of dollars to defend capitalism's advances in Latin America, Asia and Russia.
Joseph E. Stiglitz was at least nominally part of that inner circle, as Clinton's chief economic adviser and later chief economist at the World Bank. But he now argues that the way the Clinton team pursued American interests overseas was as flawed as the way "the best and the brightest" defended national security in the 1960's. Stiglitz's "Globalization and Its Discontents" is more of an economic treatise than a narrative critique, and he does not mention David Halberstam's work. But he paints a similar picture of how rampant arrogance, simplistic nostrums and disdain for foreign political realities doomed globalization. He argues that in the hands of the Washington brain trust, globalization became a neoimperialist force that left hundreds of millions of people worse off in 2000 than they were in 1990.
Stiglitz shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work analyzing the imperfections of markets. His main complaint against Rubin and Summers, who served as Treasury secretaries, and against Fischer, the No. 2 official and de facto chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, is that they had too much faith that markets could transform poor countries overnight. He labels these three men market fundamentalists, who fought to maintain financial stability with the same urgency that an earlier generation struggled to contain Communism. Worse, he suggests, they shilled for Wall Street, conflating the interests of the big banks with the financial health of the world.
Sensing a historic opportunity to secure capitalism's victory after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Clinton team demanded wrenching reform for Russia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. The Treasury Department and the I.M.F., which follows the preferences of Washington, its largest shareholder, used huge loans to compel governments to sell off companies they controlled. Even some of the least developed nations were instructed to allow competition in their stock, bond and banking businesses immediately. Aid was withheld if governments spent too much money or protected key industries.
This formula -- predictably, in Stiglitz's view -- led to financial bubbles and collapses in Mexico in 1994 and in Asia, Russia and Latin America from 1997 to 1999. The Clinton experts compounded the error by linking billions of dollars in emergency aid to even deeper concessions in managing trade, monetary policy, banking and privatization. Nearly everywhere this was tried, Stiglitz says, the changes deepened rather than alleviated recessions.
Stiglitz amply illustrates how Treasury and the I.M.F. required nations to sell companies before the time was right. He also makes a good case that the monetary fund was fighting the last war -- the 1970's and 80's battle against hyperinflation -- when it advised developing countries in the 1990's. High interest rates and tight fiscal policies, the standard tools in the fund's medical kit, pleased Wall Street creditors. But slow growth was the problem, not inflation, and high interest rates painfully stifled growth.
John Maynard Keynes had something else in mind when his ideas inspired the creation of the I.M.F. and the World Bank after World War II. Keynes envisioned the fund as an ecumenical force for growth, providing capital to help governments raise output when markets faltered. During the Clinton era, according to Stiglitz, the fund became Hooverite, forcing a failing nation to "beggar" itself, as he puts it, to meet the financial and monetary objectives of an inflexible economic orthodoxy. The prescriptions had all the science of a medieval bleeding. "Not for 60 years have respectable economists believed that an economy going into a recession should have a balanced budget," he writes.
Much of the book is devoted to case studies that support this thesis. Malaysia is cited because it rebounded quickly after the Asian crisis despite -- or perhaps because of -- its rebuff to the I.M.F. China has never accepted aid from the fund, but its performance has been miraculous compared with that of Russia, one of the biggest I.M.F. clients. Russia produced two-thirds more than China did in 1990; China produced two-thirds more than Russia did in 2000.
These failures have been debated for the past several years and form the intellectual cornerstones of the antiglobalization movement. But Stiglitz packs more wallop both because he argues his case trenchantly and because he writes as a disaffected insider.
Yet for the same reason, his book seems overly tendentious, even vengeful. He refers to the "faceless" international bureaucrats of the I.M.F., but surely they were not faceless to him after his years at the World Bank, its sister institution. He can seem sanctimonious. "Unfortunately, my forecasts turned out to be all too right" is a typical conceit.
Stiglitz inexplicably chooses not to detail his own conflicts with Rubin, Summers and Fischer. He does not reveal the circumstances of his resignation from the World Bank in 1999, even though bank officials have said that it came at the behest of Summers.
He provides a handful of anecdotes about his involvement in major decisions, but they are full of innuendo. Stiglitz claims that Rubin and Summers hatched the most important policies in secret, leaving not only him out of the loop but also the president. Recounting debates about aid to Russia, he writes, "Treasury viewed the issue as too important to let the president have an important role." But he leaves the charge dangling.
Politics, unlike economics, has no invisible hands. Yet the book makes no effort to sort out the political and diplomatic machinations that shaped policy. Stiglitz ignores the fact that the right wing dislikes the I.M.F. as much as the left wing does, and that conservatives saw the Clinton-led fund as intervening too much, not too little, in the market.
Russia's economy performed dismally during the Clinton era. But growth was not the only goal. Did Russia policy create "the worst of all possible worlds," as Stiglitz claims? One can imagine something worse than a relatively democratic nation -- run by the moderately pro-American Vladimir Putin -- now growing again after a painful transition.
Stiglitz also makes a superficial case for an imperialist plot. Yes, the Clinton administration pressured countries to attend to the financial markets. But the administration bowed to the bond market at home, too, where fiscal discipline helped feed the 1990's boom. Stiglitz acknowledges that private capital flows to the developing world grew sevenfold in seven years during the 90's, while foreign aid stagnated. That American and many foreign leaders wanted to eliminate barriers to those flows -- and did so too quickly in some cases -- is not as unfathomable as he maintains.
While parts of this book are disappointingly shallow, Stiglitz's critique of the market-driven 90's still resonates, especially when the business pages are full of stories about white-collar crime and the stock market seems stuck in a perpetual rut. Even the United States cannot blithely assume that financial markets will work on autopilot. It is testament to the salience of Stiglitz's arguments that many economists -- even some Bush administration officials -- now embrace his view that economic change in the developing world must evolve more with local conditions, not on Washington's calendar. Without a thorough makeover, globalization could easily become a quagmire.

HEADLINE: Africa's New Realism 

BYLINE:  By Thabo Mbeki; Thabo Mbeki is the president of South Africa.

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN 

 BODY:
A great moment is at hand: a chance for developed countries to make a sound investment while helping to break the cycle of African underdevelopment. This prospect now seems as obvious as it was previously elusive.
 The Group of 8 conference of industrialized nations that begins this week in Canada comes as we plan for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in September. It follows significant commitments made by the Bush administration and the European Union at a United Nations conference earlier this year in Mexico to increase development aid. The common thread here is the renewed determination among political leaders and civil society to build a humane world of shared prosperity. 
 The idea gains its momentum not from the desire to provide charity. Nor is it premised merely on fears in highly developed nations of new immigrants or of poor regions becoming so volatile as to pull the rest of the world into instability. The momentum for sustained development, in partnership with the private sector, is based on a recognition that it is possible to revive poor nations, particularly in Africa, through investments for mutual benefit. There is an unprecedented resolve on the continent to turn away from the begging bowl and engage in new efforts to build a better life.
The fact that most African states have held multiparty elections in the past decade is relevant. So is the imminent formation of the African Union, out of the Organization of African Unity, which will occur at a summit in South Africa early next month. Such developments have helped reveal a socioeconomic potential previously obscured, and they have given strength to a new realism.
In this great effort, we Africans seek, and need, partners. On offer to the investors from the highly developed economies are sound prospects in countries whose infrastructures -- limited telecommunications systems, poor roads, rail and port facilities, sometimes dilapidated cities -- hold the promise of exponential improvement. Where others are approaching saturation, Africa offers rapid growth.
Such cooperation will reward the many African nations prepared to improve political and economic governance. But there could be broader spinoffs. This partnership of equals may lead to new introspection among the citizens of developed countries about themselves; it may rekindle that humanism that should lie at the foundation of global relations.
Such might be the outcome, if the developed nations work with Africans in redefining assistance, fashioning a fairer trade regime and treating Africa as an investment destination. Group of 8 leaders and other statesmen will gather in a remote spot in the Canadian Rockies to hear more about the New Partnership for Africa's Development. African leaders will arrive with concrete proposals on how to get this partnership off the ground.
A central feature of the new partnership is ensuring democracy, human rights and good governance. It sets out independent mechanisms for peer review, with provisions aimed at foreseeing problems and working to prevent their spread -- rather than just censuring and punishing when things go wrong. If programs in manufacturing, agriculture, education and health are to succeed, Africans in their millions must take an active part.
Most important, it is Africans who have done and will continue to do the planning. As George C. Marshall noted in proposing his famous plan to rebuild Europe half a century ago: "It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans." And so it will be for Africans now.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Why a duck? Because it sells insurance. Kaplan Thaler puts consumers ahead of peer approval.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
STRANGE but true: you can still go far on Madison Avenue by larding ads with liberal doses of sex, schmaltz, chirpy jingles and "talking" babies and animals.
 Just ask Linda Kaplan Thaler. 
 Thanks to such formulaic devices, at odds with prevailing creative trends, Ms. Kaplan Thaler and her New York agency, the Kaplan Thaler Group, are among the hottest commodities in an advertising business suffering through harsh times. 
Critics may sneer at Kaplan Thaler's talking duck (for Aflac insurance) or orgasmic shampoo users (for Clairol Herbal Essences haircare products). But consumers are responding to the broadly emotional and humorous themes in the agency's ads. And when they buy the merchandise being peddled, marketers will overlook the brickbats hurled by critics complaining that an agency's work is unoriginal, uncreative or downright annoying. 
Since Kaplan Thaler opened five years ago, billings have increased twelvefold, to more than $325 million, and the agency has added clients like Blimpie sandwiches, the Coldwell Banker realty division of Cendant and Pilot pens. 
In recent months, Kaplan Thaler has received two more big votes of confidence. Procter & Gamble decided to keep Kaplan Thaler on the Herbal Essences business it acquired in November. And the agency's parent, the Bcom3 Group, gave Ms. Kaplan Thaler control over another agency it controlled, the illustrious but now struggling N. W. Ayer & Partners. 
For Ms. Kaplan Thaler, 51, the success vindicates her philosophy of advertising. "I like to do advertising that's entertaining and not annoying, because entertaining is better," she said. "But I think the worst thing is to be ignored."
"We're doing our job when we find ways to get people to buy things," she added, "because when people buy things, it stimulates the economy. So there."
Ms. Kaplan Thaler, a Bronx-born copywriter whose resume also includes stints as a music teacher and comedy-troupe performer, became interested in the ad business a quarter century ago after she took a freelance job writing jingles for Life Savers. (It paid $150.) Her first full-time job was as a junior copywriter at J. Walter Thompson. But she quickly rose through the ranks both there and at Wells Rich Greene BDDP, creating memorable ads and jingles for brands like Eastman Kodak and Toys "R" Us.
Ms. Kaplan Thaler unapologetically embraces her image as a throwback to when ads tugged at heart strings and poked at funny bones rather than taking postmodern, hipper-than-thou postures.
"I don't believe in following trends," said Ms. Kaplan Thaler, whose speech and mannerisms recall another Bronx native, the actress and director Penny Marshall. "You have to zig when everybody's zagging."
"Emotion is the lightning rod, the trigger, to make a purchase," she added. "A baby evokes a very warm response. A little duck waddling around with an attitude is funny."
And a walking, talking duck sells. 
"You're talking to a guy in love with Linda and her agency," gushed Daniel P. Amos, chairman and chief executive at Aflac, in Columbus, Ga. Since 1999, Kaplan Thaler has produced a critic-proof campaign for Aflac that features an irascible duck shouting "Aflac!" rather than "Quack!" in a frustrated quest for attention.
"I don't think any of us dreamed of the success the duck would have," Mr. Amos said. "Our sales were up 28 percent the first year and 29 percent last year, compared with the industry flat or up slightly."
As for the criticisms, Mr. Amos said: "Advertising isn't necessarily to be creative, but to accomplish the objective of the customer, which is what ultimately matters. Our objective is to get name recognition, and we went from a company that was basically unknown in the United States, with 13 percent name recognition, to 91 percent."
"So you've got to give the agency an 'A,' " he added. "And anybody who says otherwise is just jealous."
There are plenty of people in the ad business who do say otherwise. For instance, the Advertising Women of New York club gave Kaplan Thaler a mocking "Grand Ugly" award in 2000 for a campaign for Herbal Essences centered on a coy double entendre, which promotes the brand as "a truly organic experience" as actresses simulate sexual ecstacy while shampooing.
The award, part of an annual event sponsored by the club known as "the Good, the Bad and the Ugly," was meant to castigate "advertising we see as insulting or detrimental to women," said the club's president, Jill Manee, who is vice president and publisher of the Ad Age Group in New York.
Even so, 18 months later, the club honored Ms. Kaplan Thaler as its woman of the year for 2001, complete with a presentation at which the jingles she has written for clients like Toys "R" Us ("I Don't Want to Grow Up") and Kodak ("Because Time Goes By") were performed.
"That shows our objectivity," Ms. Manee said, laughing, when asked about the seeming contradiction. The mock award was aimed at the agency, she added, while Ms. Kaplan Thaler received her actual award for being "a well-blended, successful woman executive who has given back as well as succeeded for herself."
Ms. Kaplan Thaler has no problem defending her agency's work on the Herbal Essences account. "I'm laughing because I feel that this advertising is very empowering," Ms. Kaplan Thaler said, by showing that "women can laugh at ourselves."
"The criticism comes from women in the advertising industry, women here, not women in general, women out there," she added.
That point of view is endorsed by the client.
"Linda and her group brought a brand to life in a light-hearted, fun way, a niche no one was occupying, with remarkably fast results," said James R. Stengel, global marketing officer at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, which acquired Herbal Essences and other Clairol brands from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
"Herbal Essences's being one of the fastest-growing brands in the world," he added, climbing in sales in seven years from zero to $700 million, "was one reason why we were interested in the acquisition."
"I'm not denying some consumers not in the target don't like the advertising," Mr. Stengel said. "But the young single consumers who use the brand respond to the advertising, and it's important we stay true to what created this brand."
That was important enough for Procter to flout tradition by keeping the Herbal Essences account at Kaplan Thaler -- an agency that had never worked for Procter -- at the same time it let go another Clairol agency it inherited without a Procter track record, the New York office of Foote, Cone & Belding, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Another fan is Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive of the Publicis Groupe in Paris, which is expected during the summer to complete its $3 billion acquisition of Bcom3 -- making Mr. Levy the boss of Ms. Kaplan Thaler. "With the merger of N. W. Ayer and the Kaplan Thaler Group, Linda has a nice task ahead of her, to build from this base a much broader agency," he said. (Ms. Kaplan Thaler now oversees accounts like Continental Airlines and KitchenAid.)
"Linda has something unique in one person, the strategic aspect as well as the creative aspect, which makes what she does very powerful and very impactful," he added.
As for the complaints about her work, Mr. Levy dismissed them this way: "There are people who do advertising for what I call the advertising village and people who are doing advertising for the consumer. She is doing advertising much more for the consumer."
Ms. Kaplan Thaler characteristically described herself as ready for whatever comes next.
"It's a very exciting time now, exciting and challenging," Ms. Kaplan Thaler said, "and a certain amount of chaos is important."
"You don't get from A to B in a straight line," she added. "It's less about a vision and more about a passion."

No, They Didn't Name It Mississippi

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
The story is not very romantic, Murillo Tavares warns. No starry-eyed 20-somethings, fresh out of local universities, with little money but big ideas.
 Instead, for Submarino -- an Internet retailer loosely considered the Amazon.com of Brazil -- the prevailing philosophy, for the most part, has been caution. While most of Brazil's Internet start-ups followed their northern neighbors into spectacular bankruptcy, Submarino -- which is privately held by a group of local and international investors, including the American firms Warburg Pincus and TH Lee.Putnam Internet Partners -- says it should break even in the next few months, two years after its founding. 
 Mr. Tavares, Submarino's managing director, likes to point out that it took Amazon .com seven years to break even. "Unlike Amazon.com, we never had enough money to make huge mistakes," Mr. Tavares said, grinning.
The story began about three years ago, when Mr. Tavares was a 32-year-old executive at a local investment group called GP Investimentos, which has $1 billion in investment assets. After an extensive market study, the company decided to set aside part of a venture capital fund for a consumer-oriented Internet investment, and rather than give the money to others, Mr. Tavares and four partners decided to take on the project themselves. 
To start, they bought a fledgling Internet bookseller called BookNet, and four months later, Submarino was born, the name itself selected through focus groups. (Besides having desirable associations with the sea, "submarino" is the same word in Spanish and Portuguese and is even recognizable to English speakers.) 
"If we had it to do over again, we would have picked a name that starts with A," Mr. Tavares said. "The Internet is highly alphabetical, and we're always last on the list."
And there were other missteps, too. 
With $14 million in the coffers from a first round of private investment in 1999, Submarino opened for business simultaneously in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Spain, initially selling only books and CD's but with the intention of becoming the leading online retail destination for a whole range of products in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. It rented prime office space and, in a familiar touch, bought pinball machines for the Sao Paulo headquarters.
But Internet sales never gained popularity in retail-saturated Southern Europe, forcing the company to sell out to the French retailer Carrefour. In Argentina, persistent recession closed down that operation in May 2001. By the time the television giant Grupo Televisa offered to buy Submarino's Mexico operations, the partners had decided to pull back from their international aspirations -- including a service for Hispanics in the United States that had been on the drawing board -- and focus on keeping the Brazilian Submarino from running aground. 
Submarino cut about 20 percent of its staff, down to about 265 people, and moved out of offices in Sao Paulo's pricey Vila Olympia neighborhood (briefly known as Brazil's Silicon Alley) to set up shop in quarters attached to their newly built warehouse in the industrial neighborhood of Barra Funda.
After raising another $20 million from existing backers in February 2001, they turned all their energies toward breaking even.
Acknowledging that Brazil's Internet user population is small and likely to remain that way for some time, the company has focused on courting existing customers with high quality service. Now the largest parcel client of the Brazilian postal service, Submarino has had an overnight delivery service developed especially for the company, processed, to save time, out of a three-man post office that has been set up inside the Submarino warehouse. 
The company guarantees delivery within 24 hours in the State of Sao Paulo and two days to surrounding states, but may take up to five days to reach the farthest points in the country. More than 70 percent of Submarino's revenue -- $33 million last year from 560,000 orders -- now comes from sales to repeat customers.
"I always check Submarino first because they usually have the best price and the fastest delivery," said Cacilda Camargo, 45, who usually buys books and CD's on Submarino, but whose last purchase was an iron. "I would have bought my washing machine there, but at the time I was looking, they weren't selling them yet." 
As consumers in Brazil grow familiar with e-commerce, the company has increased its variety and stock of items, now carrying 65,000 different products, including DVD's, toys, electronics, refrigerators and other major appliances. Compared with offerings from Amazon.com, which has tens of millions of items in stock, Submarino's list seems small, but it surpasses most brick-and-mortar retailers in Brazil. 
The growing stock is one of the reasons why Submarino is responsible for 56 percent of online sales in Brazil in the category that includes books, music, videos and DVD's, and 26 percent of consumer electronics, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group. The trick now is to bring new consumers in, and keep them buying.
Cultivating new customers means overcoming resistance to placing orders online, based on concern about sending credit card or bank account information over the Internet.
"The trouble with e-commerce is that the perception of risk is much bigger than the risk itself," said Alexandre Magalhaes, an Internet analyst at the audience measurement firm Ibope eRatings. "Consumers usually start slow, with a book or CD, and as they grow more comfortable, they buy bigger and more often." 
And being compared with Amazon.com, which competes with Submarino among wealthy Brazilians who often speak English, can be a double-edged sword, said Mr. Tavares, who found out recently that he was in the same graduating class at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Business as Jeffrey Wilke, Amazon's senior vice president of operations; the two have not yet met. While the company can look north for ideas, so can investors and consumers.
"My investors ask me 'Why can't I have a personalized home page, like on Amazon?' " he said. "But my base of clients and their number of purchases is so small that it's not even statistically significant yet. I'd wind up spending a lot of money, and still offering the wrong things to the consumer."

HEADLINE: Argentina Says I.M.F. Talks Will Resume 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 23 

 BODY:
The president of Argentina's central bank will continue to help the government negotiate a resumption of International Monetary Fund aid despite his decision to quit, President Eduardo Duhalde of Argentina said on Saturday.
 The central bank president, Mario Blejer, who is stepping down from his central bank post at the end of the month, is a former monetary fund official is who considered by investors as the best guarantee for orthodox monetary policies in Argentina's economy. 
 Mr. Blejer "is ready to continue working with us in the United States in everything involved with negotiations about how to pay the debt," Mr. Duhalde said. 
Argentina, in the grip of a deepening four-year recession, was forced to default on most of its $140 billion public debt and devalue the peso currency in January, and needs monetary fund assistance aid to avoid defaulting on multilateral loans. 
Mr. Duhalde also said Latin America as a region should come together to pressure multilateral lenders for help since several countries were facing economic problems. Neighboring Uruguay has been forced to devalue its currency because of spillover from the Argentine crisis.

HEADLINE: One Show In the Park And a Drama For the Board 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Joseph Papp founded the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1954 to bring plays like "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Tempest" to people without charge. He started in a Lower East Side amphitheater, then moved to a truck that toured the five boroughs and ultimately built the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. At first, the Public offered three plays a summer, then two so each would run longer and more people could see them. 
 The park productions have always been a serious drain on the theater's finances. Except for 1980, when Papp eliminated "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and did only "The Pirates of Penzance" to protest the city's budget cuts, the festival delivered at least two shows each season. 
 But this summer, the Public will present only one production in the park, "Twelfth Night," to run for seven weeks rather than the usual four. George C. Wolfe, the Public's producer, and Kenneth B. Lerer, its chairman, said that the combined financial hit of a weak economy, the effects of Sept. 11 and the city's cultural budget cuts proved too great for the theater. Each production costs the Public about $1 million. 
"Like every other cultural institution in the city, we're dealing with the realities," Mr. Wolfe said. "Instead of two shows it's one show, but it can run longer and more people can see it."
In addition, the Public is about to announce the appointment of a new executive director to handle the business side of the theater. The board's choice is Mara Manus, 42, a program officer of economic development at the Ford Foundation who was previously a senior vice president at Universal Studios.
These two developments, along with several other moves, are part of an aggressive effort by the Public over the last year to get its house in order, even if that means making some unpopular decisions.
Artistically, the Public is coming off a strong season, with two shows that moved to Broadway: Suzan-Lori Parks's "Topdog/ Underdog," which won this year's Pulitzer Prize, and the one-woman show "Elaine Stritch at Liberty," which won this year's Tony Award for special theatrical event. Its December production of "Othello," with Keith David and Liev Schreiber, exceeded box office projections by 10 percent, said a spokeswoman for the Public. 
"The institution is in better shape today," Mr. Lerer said. "We have righted the ship. I like where we are."
The Public lost a combined $14 million on its ill-fated Broadway musicals "On the Town" and "The Wild Party," which left the theater projecting a shortfall of nearly $700,000 and deficits until fiscal year 2004. In anticipation of the city's budget cuts, the theater laid off about 20 percent of its staff in November and cut back on activities like community outreach. 
Even though two of the Public's biggest benefactors -- Larry Condon of the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust and Dorothy Cullman -- quit the board to protest what they called mismanagement last fall and have not returned, their donations are intact, and Mr. Lerer said Mr. Condon has been personally supportive. 
The Public has brought on six new members: Andre Balazs, who owns the Mercer Hotel; Alec Baldwin, the actor; Susan Lyne, the president of ABC Entertainment; Myer Berlow, an AOL Time Warner executive; Frederick W. Hill, an executive at J. P. Morgan Chase; and David Rockwell, the architect.
The board appointed a new finance director, Ellen C. Moran, formerly director of finance and chief financial officer for the Lincoln Center Development Project, executive director of the Tucker Music Foundation and general manager of Pennsylvania Ballet.
Rather than bring "Topdog" and " Stritch' to Broadway, the Public licensed them to other producers, incurring no financial risk but retaining shares in the royalties and a small percentage of profits. (Mr. Lerer estimated that the Public has made a total of $250,000 from the two works.) "We were gun-shy," said Ken Auletta, who writes for The New Yorker and sits on the Public's board. "We had two Broadway shows that didn't make it and lost us some money. In the teeth of that and this economy and 9/11, are we going to dip into the endowment to produce two Broadway shows?"
The theater plans to return to two shows in the park next summer, finances permitting. "It's a wonderful venue that puts great economic stress on the institution and has since day one," Mr. Lerer said. 
However financially necessary, the decision is symbolically potent. For as long as anyone can remember there have been people lining up in Central Park for free tickets to two shows a summer like "Julius Caesar" and "The Taming of the Shrew." Some of those shows have been so well received -- like "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" -- they moved to Broadway.
Of the decision to mount a single production, Rosemarie Tichler, who recently retired as artistic producer after about 30 years, said: "I hope it doesn't happen again. George is trying to be fiscally responsible."
Merle Debuskey, who worked as Papp's publicist for years, said: "I don't think it's a violation of any moral principle. I think the principle is to stay alive and to do plays and to do them free and what you have to do to accommodate it, you have to do."
Papp modeled the festival after institutions like the New York Public Library. In discussing the origins of the festival in her biography "Joe Papp: An American Life," Helen Epstein said Papp wrote: "There's a reason it's called show business. A business must stay out of the red to exist. I had a different idea. I wanted to reach audiences who might never have seen a play before and who were unable or unwilling to pay. I wanted my theater to be free."
Public board members warn not to make too much of the decision to produce only one play this summer. There was no internal debate. It seemed to everyone like the right thing to do. "There was not a climactic discussion," Mr. Auletta said. "There was not a moment when we said, 'This sabotages everything we believe in.' "
Even Papp's widow, Gail Papp, who sits on the board, said the call was not particularly significant, merely prudent. "We don't like it, believe me," she said. "But to be financially responsible we had to cut back, not only in the park but to start to economize in a responsible way."
By choosing the crowd-pleasing comedy "Twelfth Night" and casting stars like Julia Stiles, Jimmy Smits and Oliver Platt, the Public is hoping to replicate the success of its "Seagull" production in the park last summer, which had people camping out overnight for tickets to see Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline directed by Mike Nichols.
"We decided to do one production with big star names," Mr. Lerer said. "We picked a comedy rather than one of the dark ones." The play opens tomorrow and runs through Aug. 11.
Perhaps most crucially, the theater is trying yet again to find someone to handle the business side of the Public.
While several have failed in this role before -- most recently, Fran Reiter -- a number of board members said Ms. Manus was bound to work because she must. They said it was Mr. Wolfe's last chance to show that he could share power.
Even as the theater has been adjusting its financial side, its board continues to support Mr. Wolfe, in large part because he is coming off one of his strongest artistic seasons, having directed both "Topdog" and "Stritch." Mr. Wolfe also wrote and directed the show "Harlem Song," a pastiche of songs and skits about Harlem that starts performances at the Apollo Theater on July 6, although it is not a Public production. 
"We feel very good about George," said Mr. Auletta. "Look at what he does as a showman, as a director as a spotter of talent." He cited Mr. Wolfe's support of Ms. Parks's work as an example. "He's been nurturing that talent," Mr. Auletta said. "That is one of the things he does and does brilliantly."

HEADLINE: Money From Kin Abroad Helps Bengalis Get By 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: BARIKHALA, Bangladesh 

 BODY:
The 5,000 residents of this village share one telephone. So when a call comes in to the village shop, a child must sprint down the meandering lanes, past the jackfruit hanging from the trees and the painted tin houses and the women pounding grain in their courtyards to fetch the lucky recipient.
 It could be a call from a brother building high-rises in Singapore, a husband trimming lawns in Dubai, a son calling from Italy, where he is said to be selling flowers in a city whose name no one knows. 
 Globalization meets the dirt road in villages like this one. Virtually every family here depends on at least one able-bodied man and sometimes a woman working overseas. 
They go abroad on temporary work contracts, mostly to Southeast Asia or the Middle East. Some make it back with money enough to make a living at home. Some come back empty-handed, and they wrap their checkered loongis around their waists and go back to working the fields. Many simply wait until they can scrape together enough cash to head out again.
As it has in developing countries worldwide, overseas migrant work has transformed villages and towns across Bangladesh. Remittances from abroad reached a record of nearly $2 billion last year, and that was just what came in through official channels. 
If unofficial transfers were counted, Finance Minister Saifur Rahman has said, they would substantially reduce the country's reliance on foreign aid -- about $1.4 billion a year. Remittances are the country's second-largest source of foreign revenue, after garment exports.
The government has a huge labor export program of its own. Today three million Bangladeshi migrant workers are overseas on government-sponsored contracts, the largest number in Saudi Arabia, according to government figures. 
That does not count those who go from villages like this one, sponsored by private employers in labor-needy countries from South Korea to the United Arab Emirates. Nor does it count all of those who go abroad illegally, paying through the nose for the chance to wash dishes in Tokyo or hawk fruit in Manhattan.
Migrant workers' success stories are abundant. Thanks to money made across the oceans, roads are widened, rooms added, minivans bought. A color television comes from Singapore, a fluffy fleece blanket from Malaysia.
But there are other stories as well. A woman comes back and sees that her husband has taken a new wife. A son comes back still unable to repay a family debt. Local land prices skyrocket as cash flows in from overseas workers. A man who goes abroad is likely to attract a wife from higher up on the social ladder. A woman may taste a freedom from familial duties that she never imagined. She may also taste abuse as never before.
One who has fared nicely from the arrangement is Harun Rashid, a garrulous, enterprising native son of Barikhala. 
Armed with a cellphone and a counterpart in Singapore, Mr. Rashid finds the right men for the right jobs. He fixes their work papers, fetches airline tickets. If his clients want to send money home, he arranges that too; there is no bank nearby.
The price of opportunity, as Mr. Rashid acknowledges, is not cheap. Fees for passage range from 150,000 takas -- roughly $2,700 -- for a relatively undesirable Persian Gulf country to nearly double for Singapore. In the last few years he has sent 52 of his kinfolk abroad.
A cash economy has come to Barikhala. But it is all but impossible to make any cash without leaving.
"There's not much to do here," the recently returned Bashir Ahmed, 31, said bluntly. Electricity came to his village in the five years he was away on a construction site in Singapore. Now idle at home, he is considering his next move and how to raise the money to get there.
For Saidur Rahman, the chance to go abroad came soon after he turned 18, though he had little choice in the matter. His mother, a mechanic's widow, could hardly afford to send her boy to college. So when a cousin called from Singapore offering to bring him over, a deal was struck. The family sold a tract of land to pay for his passage.
"We're in a poor country, so we get this idea," Mr. Rahman explained. "One older brother goes. Then, one after another, we all go."
Mr. Rahman, a twig of a man just over 5 feet tall, worked in a factory for a couple of years. He returned exhausted, and what he brought back was not even enough to buy back the land his mother had sold. Shame hovers over him like rain clouds. Going abroad, he said, is like playing craps: sometimes you win, sometimes you don't.
"The only thing we think of here is when do we go to Singapore," he said. "I didn't realize how hard it would be."
The drama of the laborers' journey plays out virtually every day at Dhaka International Airport. 
The foreign-returned pour into the arrivals wing, wheeling television sets and refrigerators. The foreign-bound linger at the departures terminal, sometimes wearing identical overalls, each with an identification number pinned to the chest.
Anwara Begum, a Barikhala-born woman married off to a man in a nearby village, did not tell anyone at first about her plans. No woman from her clan had ever worked outside the home. 
Shame aside, she said, what choice did she have? Her husband, a retired military man, could hardly make ends meet. Debt piled up on her back. After a few years working as a seamstress in Dhaka, the capital, she set her mind on going away. 
An ad in a Bengali newspaper informed her that Malaysia needed seamstresses. With roughly 20 other Bengali women, many of whom, like her, had left their children at home, she stepped onto an airplane for the first time, headed for the Malaysian island of Penang. "What a father does, I thought I would do as a mother," she said.
The hours were long: from 8 in the morning until after 10 at night. But gone was the tedium of her one-room house. No one to cook for. No one to wash for. No one minding what she did with her free time.
It was a freedom, she said, that not everyone handled well. A breadwinning wife, calling long distance, sometimes talked back to her husband. A woman sometimes found someone new to love. Occasionally someone returned to find that a new wife had taken her place.
Anwara Begum, it seems, was always aware of such things, which is why she never asked what her husband did with the money she sent every month, nearly half of her earnings. "If I questioned my husband," she explained, "there would be more trouble."
In any case, by the time she returned after five years away there was nothing left, only new debt. She has since borrowed some more money and bought chickens. Her chicken coop sits on top of bamboo stilts in a swamp across the road from her house.
Now around 36, Anwara Begum can still break into rapid Malay, the lingua franca of her co-workers in the sweatshop. They were women from all over South and Southeast Asia -- Sri Lankans, Indonesians, Indians -- and their concerns, as she recalled, were identical: the welfare of parents, husbands and children back home. 
"You're not the only one in need," they told her.
Memories of Penang are still with her. In a photo album she keeps inside a glass-doored cabinet are the smiling faces of her girlfriends. They are standing at an airport, clutching crates of gifts. They are sitting in their best dresses at a banquet hall. They are strolling on a day off.
Anwara Begum kept a journal all the years she worked away from home. But one of her friends took it away. "If you had it to look at it every day," she told Anwara Begum, "it would drive you mad."

PERSON: Dr. Frank X. Ogasawara 

HEADLINE: Frank Ogasawara, 88, Professor Who Helped Turkey to the Table 

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Dr. Frank X. Ogasawara, a poultry expert whose advances in artificial insemination helped keep the fat and happy farm-raised turkey from going the way of the dodo, died on June 8 at a hospital in Davis, Calif. He was 88. 
 Dr. Ogasawara, a longtime professor of avian and animal sciences at the University of California at Davis, was considered a pioneer in developing methods to impregnate turkeys artificially. 
 Artificial insemination is now used almost exclusively to produce the more than 250 million turkeys raised each year in the United States. But when Dr. Ogasawara began his research in the 1950's, the birds were left largely to their own devices when it came to mating -- and the results were none too good.
The domesticated turkey had become an ungainly creature, thanks in part to selective breeding by turkey producers. The male's swollen chest and meaty body made him a hit in the kitchen. In the bedroom, it was another story. It was not just the ability to fly that the birds lacked.
"The toms were getting heavier and heavier, and so it was very difficult for them to mount a hen and not really squash her," said Dr. F. Howard Kratzer, a professor emeritus of animal science at Davis and a friend of Dr. Ogasawara's. "It just wasn't possible for them to mate naturally."
Enter Dr. Ogasawara and his colleagues, who drew on earlier artificial insemination work to help the turkey industry avoid a serious economic blow.
The researchers figured out how to massage the male turkey's abdomen to coax the release of semen. Then it was simply a matter of getting the semen into the females. (Imagine the turkey-baster method, but with a genuine turkey.)
Dr. Ogasawara also made an important discovery about why female turkeys remain fertile for weeks after a single mating, finding that they have special "sperm nests" for storage in their oviducts. 
In 1972 he established the California Raptor Center at Davis, which cared for birds injured in the wild. He was also an expert in the long-tailed fowl, a Japanese bird whose feathers can reach 30 feet in length.
But he was best known for his work with breeding turkeys. He taught the technique to poultry experts around the world. In 1966, he received the National Turkey Federation's Outstanding Research Award. In 1982 he was named a Fellow of the Poultry Science Foundation.
Dr. Ogasawara, who took emeritus status in 1983, was born in San Diego on Nov. 10, 1913, and was raised mostly in Nevada. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley and his doctorate from Davis. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Kay Ogasawara of Davis; two daughters, Pam Ogasawara of Urbana, Md., and Patty Sunui of Sacramento; a son, Paul, of Sebastopol, Calif.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Syracuse Dreams Of a Mall to Rival A Magic Kingdom 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
Something momentous is happening here, they say, something that will transform upstate New York like nothing since the glaciers, or at least the Erie Canal. It will do more than simply enrich the region, they say; it will change the very way that people think -- about their environment, about themselves.
 It is not a new religion. It is a mall. 
 But even "mall" does not do justice to this project, its promoters say, because it is so much more. It is DestiNY USA, a behemoth of a shopping, tourism and entertainment complex that will take up more square footage than two Empire State Buildings. It will be even bigger, they promise, than Minnesota's Mall of America -- which is really, really big. 
The plans call for 400 stores, 4,000 hotel rooms, and more than 30 cafes and restaurants, including many without plastic trays. But that's not all, the promoters say. A massive saltwater aquarium. Rock- and ice-climbing mountains five stories high. A 65-acre park under a Biosphere-like dome. A 20-screen movie complex, a 15,000-seat concert hall and not one but two Broadway-style theaters. 
Oh, and a miniature Erie Canal, like the real one a few miles away.
That the financing for the $2.2 billion project still has to be secured does not bother its extremely wealthy developer, Robert J. Congel. He is so certain that his development firm will get the needed investment from Wall Street -- "We should have it shortly," he said -- that groundbreaking is tentatively scheduled for July.
Meanwhile, the plans for DestiNY USA continue to grow, mutating in size and expense like some space-eating organism made of glass and steel. In recent months, its estimated cost has risen about $400 million, as Mr. Congel keeps adding more flourishes, including a plan to make the entire project "green," or environmentally friendly. Even the poured concrete will be dyed green.
"It is time to give back," said Mr. Congel, who acknowledges that "cuddly" has not been among the terms applied to him as his company, Pyramid Management Group, has decorated the Northeast with malls and shopping centers. Hard-nosed, even ruthless, yes; warm and fuzzy, no.
But this native son's tough reputation may be why many here have come to share his bold assumption: that millions of people will flock to the cold belt of New York to visit a mall-that-is-not-a-mall, where a stop at the International Tourism/Exposition Center will move them to see the actual Erie Canal, the actual Adirondack Mountains and other actual upstate attractions. 
Mr. Congel's charmingly relentless style, along with upstate's glaring need for economic jumper cables, has persuaded virtually every level of government to give him extensive tax breaks. All this even though a few central matters, like the names of the anchor stores, remain a mystery.
Mayor Matthew J. Driscoll jokes that he often begins his frequent conversations with Mr. Congel by asking, "What is it you're building, and when is it?" But like so many others here, the mayor remains an enthusiastic supporter of the project, in Syracuse's old Oil City section at the southern end of Onondaga Lake. After all, where else in upstate New York -- or in the rest of the country -- is anyone investing $2.2 billion?
Figures developed by Economics Research Associates, a consulting firm hired by Mr. Congel, long ago became regional gospel. DestiNY USA will generate up to $12.5 billion in annual economic activity, the firm estimated, and will create as many as 122,000 jobs with an average annual wage of about $31,000. The firm predicts that the project will attract 35 million "visits" a year -- more than San Francisco, New Orleans or even Disneyland.
Mayor Driscoll acknowledged that the numbers sounded incredible; comparisons between Syracuse and San Francisco have never before seemed necessary. But the city has double-checked the soundness of the consulting firm's projections, he said. "And if half of what they estimate comes true, it's a home run."
For Syracuse, a simple double would be nice. This city of 150,000 remains proud of its museums, colleges and ethnic neighborhoods, and a 20-minute car ride from downtown leads to dairy farms and lakes dotting a lush countryside. But it suffers the classic upstate urban plight: the department stores have fled from downtown, there is a projected $28 million deficit in the school and city budgets, and high-tech industries are not exactly clamoring for office space. Once known as the Salt City, it now calls itself "A City for All Seasons" to make the most of those long winters encased in snow.
Along came Mr. Congel, a resident of a Syracuse suburb who has an estimated worth of $700 million that, according to Forbes magazine, puts him in a tie for the country's 364th wealthiest person. His company says its shopping centers serve one of every four households in the Northeast. Those developments often faced intense opposition, which Mr. Congel dismissed as the handiwork of competitors.
He plays hardball. In the mid-1980's, Pyramid spent big-city money -- $770,000 -- to influence the outcome of a small-town election in Poughkeepsie because one of its mall proposals hung in the balance. The mall was built, a state ethics panel expressed dismay but found no criminal wrongdoing, and Mr. Congel was left with what he calls a "bad taste," though not bad enough to end his days as a prodigious campaign contributor. State records show, for example, that in January he made a $25,000 donation to Gov. George E. Pataki's re-election campaign.
But when it comes to Syracuse, Mr. Congel says that he opens his heart and wallet. When he replaced an ugly stretch of oil tanks with the Carousel Center mall, he said, his company spent $173 million to clean up the pollution -- an expense he considers to be a contribution to the city that granted him the substantial property-tax concessions needed to build the project.
That was in 1990; things have changed. Mr. Congel is 66 years old now, with 17 grandchildren, all under the age of 9. His professed desire to keep those grandchildren from fleeing Syracuse one day has become part of the DestiNY USA legend.
Two years ago, Pyramid announced plans to expand the Carousel Center to create what in the tourism trade is known as a destination. More than a year of intense haggling over tax breaks followed; at one point, Pyramid adopted a take-it-or-leave-it stance, and prepared to build DestiNY USA in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, which, among other complications, would have required a name change.
"Suppose you went to a guy and said, 'I'll give you $100,' and he said, 'No, I want $110,' " Mr. Congel said. "You can't negotiate forever."
In the end, he got what he needed to seek Wall Street financing, from a 30-year property-tax exemption to inclusion in the state Empire Zone and the federal Empowerment Zone, providing even more tax incentives. The state also agreed to spend some of the sales tax generated at DestiNY USA -- an estimated $30 million a year -- on promoting upstate tourism and perhaps operating the mall's tourism center, as long as Pyramid builds a substantial portion of the project -- 3.2 million square feet -- by July 2004.
Pyramid has striven to create excitement and mystery about the project, dispatching executives to drop the DestiNY USA name with travel agencies and chambers of commerce. Its promotional video, available on the Internet, alternates images of the proposed project with those of the American flag, while the same phrase is repeated: "Nothing like it in the world." 
All the while, Mr. Congel summons people -- public officials, environmentalists, hotel managers -- to spend the day and perhaps the night at his secluded country lodge, about an hour's drive from Syracuse. There, before elaborate meals of game hunted on the property -- deer, elk, Russian boar, -- the New York wine is uncorked and ideas are discussed and sometimes incorporated into the ever-changing proposal. Before long, another frill is dangled before the public, the latest being: How about a golf course?
The project's name is now firmly lodged in the regional consciousness. Entrepreneurs are incorporating businesses with names like "DestinyUSA Golf" and "Destiny USA City Tours," while critics are often accused of exacerbating Syracuse's latent inferiority complex. 
Still, some people manage to steel themselves against the constant Pyramid message that Mr. Congel is a visionary long enough to ask a few questions.
"Is there as much detail about the project as I would like? No," said Steven DeRegis, a city councilman. "People in my opinion were scared to stand up to the developer. The position they fell back on was that he would walk away from the project, but I believed that he had too much invested down there to walk away."
Mr. DeRegis said that he supported the project after Mr. Congel made certain financial assurances to protect the city's interests. Still, he said, he worries that DestiNY USA will become an Atlantic City -- "a castle with a moat around it" -- and he is fighting for assurances that the entire city will be integrated into the overall tourism plan.
Robert Haley, an architect and co-director of the Urban Design Center, a nonprofit urban-planning organization, expressed similar concerns. "They're trying to create all of the experiences of New York State within the mall: the canal, the Adirondacks, Native America," he said. "It's about having all the excitement right next to the cash register. And it's not dealing with the downtown context at all."
Amanda Nicholson, who teaches retail management and consumer studies at Syracuse University, said that DestiNY USA may represent the next generation in the evolution of malls. She also said that building it in Syracuse makes sense: the city has interstate highway access, a central upstate location, and long winters that will make indoor entertainment seem even more attractive.
As for the virtual elements of the plan -- the imitation canal, the faux rock climbing -- Ms. Nicholson said that "virtual stuff seems to be very popular with the American psyche."
"It's getting in touch with reality," she added. "But not really."
The other day, Mr. Congel settled back into a chair at his sprawling country lodge and once again discussed his DestiNY USA vision. He dismissed the idea that visitors will see virtual representations of some of upstate New York's attractions and then venture no farther than the upscale food court. He said that his project would improve the economy of upstate, with the high-tech tourism center perhaps arranging trips to Cooperstown, Niagara Falls and, yes, even downtown Syracuse.
He said that this would be his last development, and that he intended to recycle his profits back into the project. In fact, he said, he planned to be the unofficial mayor of DestiNY USA, making sure that the operation continues to meet his high standards.
The cooks were puttering in one of the kitchens. Downstairs, the grandchildren's bunk beds were all made. And in the conference room, another round of guests -- some hotel executives -- were being shown a promotional video about, well, what else.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Serious Crime Rose in 2001 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Serious crimes like homicide and robbery have risen in the United States for the first time in almost a decade, fueled by increases in many large cities but tempered by a sharp decline in New York City, according to statistics to be reported today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Crime increased in the nation by 2 percent over all in 2001, according to the federal report, which was released yesterday by New York officials trumpeting an eight-year decline in the state in most major crimes tracked annually by the F.B.I. 
 The nationwide increase comes after steady inroads against crime during the 1990's, and when many local police departments are facing budgetary strains as they confront the new and complex demands of fighting terrorism along with routine crime. 
The F.B.I. data are to be officially released today with more detailed statistics. They also show that in many categories, like homicide (up 3.1 percent) and car theft (up 5.9 percent), the incidence climbed dramatically during the second half of 2001, after declining in the first half. 
While criminologists cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about the country's crime based on a one-year -- or, in some cases, a six-month -- change, there were substantial increases in all but a few of the seven crimes in the F.B.I. report.
The data, part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program, are considered preliminary until the final statistics are issued in October and reflect the incidence of homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft reported to police nationwide. 
With the exception of New York City, where violent crimes continued a sharp decline, almost 10 percent in 2001, homicides and other serious crimes surged last year in several cities. They included Boston, where homicides rose 67 percent last year, Houston, Atlanta, St. Louis and Phoenix, F.B.I. officials said yesterday. 
Data on crime in cities outside New York were first reported yesterday in The Washington Post. 
"Americans were getting along much better with each other during the 1990's," said Andrew Karmen, a professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "Many of the cities that enjoyed big drops in the 1990's are now suffering from a rebound, with New York City being the big exception."
While the F.B.I. data showed that crime had risen by 2 percent over all, violent crime increased only slightly, by 0.3 percent. 
One kind of violent crime, aggravated assault, decreased in 2001, by 1.4 percent. In the other six categories, crime was up, and in most cases those increases reversed a downward trend from the previous six months. 
Professor Karmen, the author of "New York Murder Mystery," which discusses the plunge in crime in New York City during the 1990's, said that the factors contributing to a decline in crime were as varied and hard to figure as the factors contributing to an increase. 
But he suggested that the spike in crimes during the second six months of 2001 might have been fanned by anger over the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the economic downturn that was gripping the country a year ago, at the start of the second half of 2001. 
Professor Karmen said that the two categories of crime experts considered most reliable were homicide and car theft, because incident reporting is more accurate and more thorough than for the other categories. 
While crime in those two categories rose substantially nationwide in 2001, New York City continued to show sharp decreases. Homicides, reflecting data reported earlier by New York City officials, decreased by 3.6 percent, while the incidence of car theft in the city was down by 16.3 percent, according to the federal data. 
The New York City and New York State statistics did not include the deaths and injuries that resulted from the attack on the World Trade Center.

HEADLINE: Soon Only Snakes Will Be Using Outhouses 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WARM SPRINGS, Va. 

 BODY:
Just three or four years before the 21st century, taking a bath at nearly one in five homes here in Bath County in the Allegheny Mountains meant hauling a galvanized tub into the kitchen and filling it with water heated on the stove. Children took turns, oldest first. 
 "You never felt like you were clean," said Peggy Stewart, 64, whose family repeated the ritual on Saturday nights for generations. 
 For the Stewarts of Bath County, population 5,048, those days are over. On a two-and-a-half acre lawn planted with dainty clusters of flowers made of cloth, Mrs. Stewart and her husband, Tommy, now have water enough for real plants they have begun to cultivate. They have removed the five-gallon buckets from their drain pipes. Copperhead snakes lurk in the outhouse, but nobody need go there any more. 
"We are in seven heavens," Mrs. Stewart said. 
The 2000 census recorded the demise of the outhouse, an artifact that for most Americans is old enough to be funny. Yet at the start of the 1990's, having tubs that drained and toilets that flushed remained an aspiration for around 3 million people living in 1.1 million houses, or 1.2 percent of all houses.
Now, the census shows, the number of houses without plumbing has dropped below one million for the first time, to 671,000, and below 1 percent, to 0.64 percent, for the first time, too. The decline has been precipitous but a long time coming, from nearly half the houses lacking plumbing in 1940, when the Census Bureau began keeping plumbing records, and 17 percent in 1960. 
"You're seeing the end game" of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise to bring rural residents the conveniences of cities, said Robert E. Lang, demographer and director of Virginia Tech's Metropolitan Institute in Alexandria. "Although the numbers look infinitesimal, at the county level you see a dramatic change."
The tiny fraction of houses that remain without plumbing are tucked away on terrain too arid, rocky or remote to accommodate plumbing, or their owners just will not have it.
"You never get to zero in one of these things," said John C. Weicher, assistant secretary for housing in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "I think at this point we're down to such a small number, it's difficult to do anything about it." 
A department-sponsored survey three years ago found about 2 percent of all houses to be severely inadequate, Mr. Weicher said, but plumbing was just one of the criteria, with safety, wiring and heating.
Spurred by money from HUD, as well as state health departments and county treasuries fattened by the economic growth of the last decade, 48 counties in 19 states reduced the number of houses without plumbing by more than 90 percent, according to an analysis by Andrew Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College and a consultant to The New York Times.
Twelve years ago, 349 Bath County houses had little or no plumbing. By 2000, the number was down to 31, the sharpest decline of all Virginia counties. In Hamilton County, N.Y., in the Adirondacks, 854 of 2,362 occupied houses lacked plumbing 12 years ago. By 2000, the number had fallen to 20. In Mahnomen County, Minn., an Indian reservation, the number dropped to 4 from 181 and in Piscataquis County, Me., site of Moosehead Lake, to 130 from 2,332. 
Close to the West Virginia line, the corkscrew mountain roads of Bath County bind isolated homesteads, farms, villages and little subdivisions. In Hot Springs, the county's biggest town, stands the 2,948-acre Homestead Resort and its immense brick pile of a hotel, celebrated for its therapeutic mineral baths. 
The Homestead is the county's principal economic engine and its biggest employer. In addition to guests from big cities who spend $300 to $400 a day to stay there, the Homestead has attracted a growing population of affluent retirees to its nearby hills.
But the wealth of Bath County stops there. "We just have the extremes," Claire Collins, the county administrator, said. "The very wealthy and the poor." 
Well into the 1990's, many workers who cleaned the Homestead's bathrooms lived in houses without bathrooms. Some lived in West Warm Springs, once called Shakerag, a hilly, largely black subdivision of about 35 small, four- and five-room ranch houses a mile from the serene county seat, Warm Springs, population 980. 
West Warm Springs, along knolls overlooking the Alleghenies, was an unlikely candidate for the indoor plumbing that reached the county seat generations ago. Most of the community's terrain is too rocky to percolate, ruling out septic tanks, and the county resisted putting in water and sewer lines.
For decades people coped. Joan Williams, a cafeteria worker at Bath County High School, said she gave her four boys and two younger girls sponge baths each morning with water heated on the stove. For the Saturday bath, she put the boys in the tub, one by one, then changed the water and put in the girls. 
" 'If Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson did it, we can do it, too,' " Ms. Williams's daughter Sarah, 25, said her mother would say as she put her into the tub.
Once a week, the Williamses would toss a layer of lime into the pit of the outhouse. "When that hole filled up," Mrs. Williams said, "you dug another hole and moved it." She watered her flowers with spent dishwater. Twice a week, she drove to the nearest coin laundry, 25 miles away in Covington, to wash clothes. 
Her neighbor, Mrs. Stewart, recalled: "We'd put jugs in the car, 15-, 20-gallon jugs, 5-gallon cans, as much as you could haul, and go to the river. It might last a week." 
In the house, she said: "We had a little room that had a slop jar. In the morning, you'd take it to the outside toilet. We would wash it out with disinfectant." 
For years, she said, she and her neighbors pressed county officials for water and sewer services. 
"They didn't think we should have water," Mrs. Stewart said. "Like we didn't count." 
In the late 1980's, the county acquiesced and stretched water lines into the settlement. But they stopped at small hydrants -- three-foot-tall pipes with frost-free faucets -- on the residents' lawns. Lacking sewers and septic tanks for drainage, homeowners could not bring the lines indoors. 
Then in the early 1990's a new county Board of Supervisors took office, and Ms. Collins, 47, was hired as administrator. "One of the questions during my interview was, 'Would you be willing to work with people on improvements of their indoor plumbing?,' " Ms. Collins said.
With the change in command, Shirley Cardwell, 52, a bartender at the Homestead, organized a neighborhood campaign for plumbing. She learned of a federal program to rehabilitate rural housing in communities and another to fix up isolated houses that lay beyond villages and subdivisions. 
"I thought, 'Let's see if we can get some things done,' " Ms. Cardwell said. She said the supervisors asked if she wanted water or home renovation. " 'We'll go for both,' " she said she told them. "They were open to it."
At a maximum cost of $27,000 per household, contractors tore down the shakiest houses and built new ones, shored up foundations, replaced roofs, siding and floors, and installed kitchen sinks and bathrooms. 
Most outhouses were filled in and plowed over. 
Once drains and faucets were flowing, most of them by late 1996, Mrs. Stewart said, "I told all my neighbors, 'If you call I won't answer because I'm going to be in the bathtub all day.' " 
Gene Phillips, administrator of the Bath County Service Authority, said he had spent nearly $15 million in federal, state and county money to lay 80 miles of sewer and water lines since the mid-1980's. Homeowners pay $17 a month for sewer service and $15 a month for water, plus 3 cents a gallon for amounts of more than 4,200 gallons. 
Some traumas have come with plumbing. Margaret Bee, a 96-year-old widow, was moved to a motel while her house was renovated. Accustomed to water warmed on a stove, she turned on the motel's water to take a bath and died of a scalding. "She never got a chance to enjoy her new home," Ms. Cardwell said. 
A land rush has ensued, too. "I've had poachers," said Mrs. Stewart's husband, Tommy, 54, a bellman at the Homestead. Laying aside a single-barrel shotgun he was using to pick off copperheads, he said the poachers pretended forebears left them parts of his land. "They would paint the side of one of my trees and claim it was theirs," Mr. Stewart said.
Amy Crowder, the county planner, said land in West Warm Springs is now selling for $12,000 to $20,000 an acre. "Before it was 1,000 bucks an acre, if that," Ms. Crowder said. 
Elsewhere in Bath County, some houses have yet to see a flush toilet. A few years ago, Jim Smith, a retired electrician, and his wife, Carolyn, a registered nurse, bought an imposing three-story farmhouse in the hamlet of Burnsville from the estate of a widow who died there in her 80's. 
The woman had let the county fix the house up, installing electricity, insulation, storm windows and a water line from a spring into the kitchen. "But she refused a bathroom," Mrs. Smith said. The Smiths fixed up the two-hole outhouse, 100 feet beyond the back door, and wallpapered the inside. For a year they trudged through the mountain ice and rain to use it. 
But like their neighbors in West Warm Springs, the Smiths have been swept up by the tide of domestic technology. They have built a three-story addition and are packing it with pipes. "We have put in two bathrooms," Mrs. Smith said, "and we're going to have four."

HEADLINE: The Politics of Futbol 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HARPERS FERRY, W. Va. 

 BODY:
You isolationist moms may call it soccer, a word derived from the second syllable in "association football," but we pre-emptive interventionists call the game that has the world transfixed this week futbol. 
 Set aside the game itself; this is not the sports page. Consider instead the intelligence, geostrategic, cultural and diplomatic ramifications of futbol, with its World Cup played, as always, halfway between U.S. presidential elections. 
 On intelligence: The game of futbol first came to the attention of our satellite mapping analysts at the C.I.A. during the Kennedy administration. A playing field had been leveled -- obviously not a baseball diamond -- near some unexplained facilities in Cuba. That recreational facility could only be a soccer field, which strongly suggested the presence of Russian workers -- a deduction that led to the Cuban missile crisis. 
On strategic power: the Italian semiologist-novelist Umberto Eco wrote in 1978 about the impact of the World Cup on global crowd psychology. He noted that war and terrorism were destabilizing forces, but that the great countervailing power in the world was "in society's capacity for redistributing tension, immediately afterwards, on other poles, closer to the soul of the crowds." This stabilizing "other pole" was an international sports event like futbol's World Cup. 
On culture: The U.S. team, which had come in dead last in the last tournament in 1998, amazed 40 million viewers around the world by battling its way into the quarter-finals. The unthinkable thought was thunk: what if (gasp!) the U.S. team were to win the biggest global sports prize of all? 
The International Herald Tribune headlined a column by its astute political-cultural observer, John Vinocur, with a startling "God Bless America -- and Let U.S. Lose." 
"God save us from the United States winning the World Cup," he wrote, "not so much because it would bring on waves of anti-Americanism . . . but because the Americans don't play pretty soccer. Things are tough enough for the Beautiful Game." 
Vinocur noted in sadness that "winning ugly is on the rise all over the sport . . . the gorgeous, swooping attacks of a Brazil, once virtually a national obligation, are on the decline" as against "the willfulness and professionalism that have made Germany recurring world champions however consistently short on beauty." 
The columnist deplored the replacement of the past glories of brilliance and elegance with the secondary virtues of strength and robustness, "relentlessness snuffing out what's left of filigree." (On Friday, the robust Germans knocked the robust Americans out of the tournament on a disputable call and tomorrow will play the surprising South Koreans; the winner of that, on Hyperbowl Sunday, will play the title-rich Brazilians or the title-hungry Turks.) 
On diplomacy: U.S. foreign-policy makers, though patriots all, hoped fervently from the start that the U.S. team would make a respectable showing but not win. This lust to lose has nothing to do with Vinocur's sensitivity to the quality of the sport; on the contrary, it is based strictly on our national interest. 
If the invigorated U.S. team had come out of nowhere to defeat the best of all the nations of the world -- and not in our football, but in their futbol -- such a triumph, in this year, would have been a psychological bummer for the rest of the world and thus a diplomatic disaster for us. 
Here we are, the locomotive of the world economy, the unipolar bear, a hyperbolic hyperpower bestriding the earth like a Colossus -- do we have to win every hand, rake in every pot, block every competitor's goal? Let some other nation's screaming populace get a kick out of the kicking game. Because we lost honorably, doing better than expected, the U.S. won by losing. 
But nice guys finish last only once. We don't play to lose well; that would be the height of condescension. The purpose of the World Cup may be to redistribute global tension, but the object of each team is to win. In 2006, even our multilateralists will root for our players' victory, whether their play is elegant or robust.
In the meantime -- go Turks!

HEADLINE: The Immigrants And the Suburbs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Suburb All Grown Up and Paved Over," by David Plotz (Op-Ed, June 19), was correct in noting that Fairfax County, Va., is the "very model of the benefits of immigration," but I disagree that the county is in a "crisis." In 2001, my agency helped 164 companies that said they would create more than 11,500 jobs here. 
Compare that with tech centers like San Jose, Calif., and Atlanta, which have been shedding jobs by the tens of thousands. 
 Also, Mr. Plotz says there is only enough "greenery left for a side salad." Funny line, but the county has more than 30,000 acres of dedicated parkland, including a national wildlife refuge established to protect bald eagles and one of the largest urban marshes on the east coast. 
 Yes, some homeowners have "asphalted" their lawns so they have a place to put cars. Putting a halt to this was a legitimate response to keep lawns beautiful for all our residents. There's nothing wrong with worrying about property values. 
Fairfax County has assimilated thousands of immigrants, built an economic powerhouse, lowered tax rates, added parkland and maintained a top-flight school system -- and what is the hot topic? Parking.

HEADLINE: In the Role of Manhattan, Toronto; 
New York Crews Worry as Canada Lures Filmmakers

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Blame Canada.
 That's the rallying cry these days among New York City's film workers as they listen anxiously for the giant sucking sound of movie jobs departing for Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. They say Canadian government subsidies are luring so many feature films away from New York that the new phenomenon has inspired a phrase that sounds like an above-the-title credit: "runaway productions." 
 Filmmaking in New York City is a $5.1 billion business that employs more than 100,000 people and drives 5,000 production businesses, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
"New York is losing jobs to Canada," said Patricia Reed Scott, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. "And when you undercut the businesses that offer facilities here, you undermine the very infrastructure that makes us an international production center." 
In 1998, Canada enacted its production services tax credit, a rebate that gives payments to United States producers for 11 percent of labor costs. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and other provinces have offered additional subsidies that enable United States producers to save a total of 22 percent on wages in, say, Toronto. Added to the weak Canadian dollar, the subsidies are becoming a powerful lure.
"The subsidies are an ever-present concern for our members," said George DeTitta, president of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 1,500 electricians, sound technicians and other craft workers in the New York metropolitan region.
The Canadian subsidies have cost the United States $4.1 billion in lost revenue, and an average of 25,000 jobs a year, according to Stephen Katz, director of the Center for Entertainment Industry Data and Research, a nonprofit association in California financed by movie-industry groups.
Feature-film expenditures in New York City decreased to $678 million in 2001 from $839 million in 1999, Ms. Scott said. Canada benefited from about $1.1 billion of spending from foreign productions in the year that ended on March 31, 2001, up 17 percent from the previous year, according to the Canadian Film and Television Production Association. Most of that spending came from United States filmmakers.
Nevertheless, some New York loyalists are resisting the call from the north. "There is no better backdrop than New York, and the look of our film is crucial to its authenticity," said Jane Rosenthal, a producer of "Analyze That," the sequel to "Analyze This." It has been shooting in the metropolitan area since April 3.
"New York's talent pool is extraordinary, not just for the first choice, but for the fourth choice," Ms. Rosenthal added.
On a recent afternoon, the film's stars, Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, were facing the cameras in the film's final scene before the panoramic sweep of the Brooklyn Bridge. The crew of 150 at waterside was but a part of the 250 employees on the production payroll.
"We were asked about shooting 'Analyze That' in Canada," Ms. Rosenthal said, "and it was right after Sept. 11, and in view of our commitment to the city, we felt it had to be here."
Ms. Rosenthal would not reveal the production cost of her film, but it has been estimated at $50 million. She could have saved $5 million to $7.5 million across the border.
"It would be nice to save that kind of money," Ms. Rosenthal said. "It can sometimes be the difference between making your movie, or not."
But the incentives have made it increasingly common for films to do "splits," said Ms. Scott, where Hollywood studios "do the hard shot here in New York, then run up to Canada to do all the other work," like interiors. 
Canada, unsurprisingly, is less than thrilled about being blamed. "We don't see any divine right of the United States to have ownership of production," said Peter Lloyd, who heads political and economic relations at the Consulate General of Canada in New York. "It is a global industry, and we believe that every country has a right to compete for a share of the business." 
Elizabeth McDonald, president and chief executive of the Canadian Film and Television Production Association, a group of 400 producers, said, "It is not even clear that 'runaway production' actually exists."
"These productions may be shot in Canada, but the dollars don't necessarily stay in Canada," she said. "The copyright remains in United States hands, and profits remain in the United States." 
She also challenged some of Mr. Katz's findings, saying that the increase in foreign productions shot in Canada -- and the corresponding decrease in the United States -- could have been affected by production rescheduling in preparation for possible industry strikes last year.
Mr. Katz responded that "only Canadian subsidies could have caused the trend." 
But beyond this, the United States critics are "aggressively focused on Canada," Ms. McDonald said, when the issue "is also about Australia, the Czech Republic and other countries around the world."
In fact, many other nations have implemented tax incentives; Australia offers a 12.5 percent rebate. And Ms. Rosenthal said she knew of studios in the Czech Republic and Germany that are offering lavish incentives. 
"But the difference is that Canada is in the same time zones as New York and California," Ms. Scott said. 
The Canadian subsidies are especially damaging to New York because the city has mounted a longtime campaign to build its film infrastructure, the commissioner said. "New York City's economy currently has 47,000 full-time jobs in the industry, 78,000 freelance jobs and 5,000 production businesses," she said, "and now they are in jeopardy."
Many in the industry "are looking to remedies by our federal and state officials," said Mr. DeTitta of Local 52. 
Joseph A. Aredas, who heads the West Coast office of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 28,000 film workers in California, agreed. "Everybody realizes that producers are going to travel to different places for artistic reasons or to get a certain look," he said, "but it shouldn't be money that makes them go."
Last month, the California State Assembly passed a proposal that would provide a 15 percent production tax credit on the first $25,000 of wages for film and television productions. The measure, which could help low-budget features, is headed for the State Senate. Similar legislation has been introduced in the United States Senate.
The Film and Television Action Committee, a Los Angeles advocacy group that says it represents 200,000 film workers and vendors, has announced plans to file a petition to get relief under the Trade Act of 1974. The group asserts that the subsidies provided by the Canadian federal and provincial governments are inconsistent with Canada's obligations under the World Trade Organization.
If the group's petition meets success, it could force Canada to eliminate the subsidies, or duties or import restrictions on Canadian goods could be imposed.
But Mr. Lloyd of the Canadian Consulate said, "There is nothing to indicate that these subsidies are not in conformity with international trading rules." And he pointed out that subsidies to moviemakers were already offered by states and locales, including New York.
Ms. Scott responded that "no incentive offered by either New York City or New York State rebates public funds to producers in New York."
Another option is to punish Canada for its subsidies by placing tariff barriers on the import of Canadian-made products "such as beer or hockey sticks," Mr. Katz said.
Meanwhile, even the most dedicated aficionados of Gotham cannot ignore the Canadian incentives. "I am loyal to staying home here, but you have to do what's smart for your project," Ms. Rosenthal said. "It could be the right business decision to shoot in Canada. The subsidies are a real threat that have to be considered."

HEADLINE: SCORCHED EARTH: THE OVERVIEW; 
Giant Wildfires Combine To Menace Arizona Town

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SHOW LOW, Ariz., June 23 

 BODY:
Larry Humphrey, the incident commander, pointed to a map today and said: "We have our plans for attack. We have a strike team in place. We have our task forces. We're ready to triage."
 If it sounded as if he was at war, he was. 
 Two wildfires that have burned about 330,000 acres of northern Arizona in the last week merged today, becoming the biggest fire in the state's history. Officials said it could cover a million acres, about 1,500 square miles, before it goes out. 
It was bearing down tonight on Show Low, normally a town of 8,000 in the White Mountains that was eerily ghostlike today. Most of its residents fled on Saturday night, leaving squadrons of firefighters, fire officials and several hundred obstinate townspeople who defied the mandatory evacuation order.
The fire, one of the largest in the United States, is easily the most challenging of the young fire season. It surpasses even the forest fires that have beset Colorado in recent weeks.
Most of the 25,000 residents of the region have left their homes. With the fire's leading edge running for 50 miles at the north and the east, plumes of bruise-colored smoke are rising 15,000 feet and are visible halfway to Phoenix, 125 miles away.
On Monday, its first day, the larger of the two fires, Rodeo, grew to 48,000 acres from 700 acres in just six hours. In the next few days it blew mostly through wooded areas of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. More recently, it has churned through small communities like Clay Springs, Pinedale and Linden before joining up with the Chediski.
But it is now threatening to hit its first real population center, Show Low, a town named for a style of poker. Fire officials said this afternoon that the blaze was moving ominously toward the west side of town.
"There are a lot of houses on the fringe of the forest, and there's nothing we can do to save them," Mr. Humphrey said, adding that the fire had already destroyed 115 houses, but "thousands of others have been saved." Seventy were destroyed by the smaller fire.
All the experts are saying the same thing: It is likely to get worse, perhaps much worse, before it gets better. That is especially bad news for Show Low, the economic engine of the area as a tourist and recreation destination for residents of Phoenix and Tucson. Fishing and hunting, gambling at the Apache casino, and the Fort Apache Timber Company keep the town vibrant.
Now, the forest that brings thousands to the area each summer is burned and closed to outsiders, the casino and timber mill are closed, and state officials are predicting that the fires will affect the economy of the area for years to come.
"I cannot tell you how serious this is," said Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who toured Show Low and a nearby evacuation site in Eagar today. "This is like a freight train coming at us."
Ms. Hull's trip served several purposes. She wanted to rally troops dog-tired after fighting the fire for almost a week. But she also wanted to send a political message to Washington that the fire-management policies now in place are not working.
Echoing the testimony of Dale N. Bosworth, the Forest Service chief who recently appeared before Congress and joined her today, Ms. Hull criticized the lawsuits and layers of administrative process that she said had prevented more aggressive efforts to clear the nation's forests of dense underbrush. The underbrush has been making fires so intense that firefighters cannot always get close enough to fight them.
"We've got to clean up these forests," said Ms. Hull, a Republican whose family has had a home in the area for three decades. "Mother Nature is telling us to do so. We've got to get this under control."
From here today, that sounded like a dream. Towering spirals of smoke over hot spots moved ever closer to town, casting a wide purple pall over the western horizon, a sharp contrast to the azure skies to the east. Officials said embers from the updrafts would soon begin falling like dirty snowflakes.
"The tactics we are going to be using is to let the flaming front go through, then go back and put out the fire," Mr. Humphrey said. "If it retreats, then we can go back in."
For Governor Hull, the tour was her first expanded look at fires that have led President Bush to promise her -- by telephone on Saturday -- he would declare on Monday that Arizona would receive federal disaster aid for the firefighting efforts.
With Mr. Bosworth and state officials, she flew into Show Low about 12 hours after all roads in were closed by the state police so evacuations could proceed at a more orderly pace.
Then, she spent 30 minutes aloft in and around the smoke plumes to get a close up view of the fires.
At the fire command center, she and Mr. Bosworth were briefed by officials who, essentially, gave them one small dose of good news, that firefighters working overnight have secured a four-mile fire break southeast of Show Low.
But the rest of the news was chilling. As John C. Bedell, forest supervisor for the Apache-Sitgreaves forests, said, if the fire outpaces efforts to extend the fire breaks, Show Low would be consumed by flames.
Additional caution came in the form of the weather forecast. It was hotter and drier than Saturday, perfect conditions for the fire to spread rapidly. Mr. Humphrey said that experts were considering asking for a fourth federal hot-shot team.
By today, firefighters on the lines, some from as far as Alaska, California and Illinois, were being aided by eight helicopters and seven tanker planes, dropping water and slurry on fires and homes. That was sufficient equipment, Mr. Humphrey said, because of hot spots so intense that firefighters can get only so close to them from the ground and air.
After the briefing, Ms. Hull joined state and local officials at a news conference at the command center, where Mayor Gene Kelley of Show Low was, perhaps, the most forlorn looking of the group. "We have no idea what we're going to do until we find out what the depth of damage is," he said softly. That damage, he added, could include his own home.
Mr. Bosworth used the opportunity of facing a dozen television crews to hammer home the point that federal fire management policies need to change. Forests like this one, he said, have grown 100 times more dense than they once were, a clean invitation for trouble.
"We need to take less time with analysis, paperwork and process," he said. "We need to do more work on the ground, and it's still going to take 10 years to make a difference."
Governor Hull then boarded her plane and flew 40 miles east to Eagar, which has the country's only high school with a domed football stadium. The facility is now the largest of three evacuation centers serving people driven out by the fires. On Saturday night 1,500 people slept on Army cots on its football field.
Dawn Huset, her two daughters, Samantha, 8, and Danielle, 2, and Ms. Huset's mother Deannna, were camped out on the 20-yard line. They had a few pillows, blankets, a few toys for the girls and not much more.
Ms. Huset said they moved to Lakeside, south of Show Low, two weeks ago from Moline, Ill. "Now, I don't know what to think," she said, an assertion heavy with meaning. She had no idea whether the house was still standing and, if it was not, what the family would do.
"I can't believe all this," she said.
Ms. Hull walked around the field, chatting with evacuees, encouraging them to stay hopeful. There were forced smiles all around.
The return flight to Phoenix took Ms. Hull past the soaring plumes once again, off in the purple distance. "Congress passes laws, and bureaucracies make regulations," she said, shaking her head. "Most of the time, neither one of them makes a lot of sense."

Israeli Military Advances And Surrounds Arafat
Israeli tanks and troops surrounded Yasir Arafat's battered compound at dawn this morning, extending the shutdown of nearly all of the Palestinian West Bank, as President Bush's advisers said he was tentatively planning to announce his new Mideast policy, including a path to creating a Palestinian state, this afternoon at the White House. This Israeli offensive, in contrast to fighting in Nablus and the Jenin refugee camp in April, has been without resistance. A1

Terror Arrests in Morocco
George Tenet, the American director of central intelligence, went to Morocco in February on a special mission to secure help in quelling any future terror attacks. As a result, Moroccan and Western officials said, the Moroccan authorities charged three Saudis and four Moroccans with plotting to use explosive-packed boats to attack American and British ships. That outcome illustrates how the United States and its allies are trying to counter continued threats from Al Qaeda. A1

Taiwan Crash Investigation
The investigation of the China Airlines crash that killed all 225 people aboard has turned up strange noises on the cockpit voice recorder. It is unclear what the sounds are and if they are related to the crash. The disaster has captured the attention of safety experts around the world because it is very unusual for a jumbo jet to come apart in midflight. A6

Asylum Seekers Leaving China
China agreed to permit 26 North Korean asylum seekers to leave its territory, ending weeks of diplomatic gridlock. China is bound by treaty with its old ally North Korea to repatriate asylum seekers, but virtually all of China's newer allies vehemently oppose repatriation. A6

Privatizing Unemployment
Chile was the first country with a privately run pension system, and now the country is planning to allow the private sector to manage the nation's unemployment insurance system. Instead of turning to the government for benefits, unemployed workers will draw from individual accounts that have been invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds. The new system is scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1. A4

Bush's Economic Agenda Stalls and Raises Concerns
After winning a quick victory last year with passage of its tax cut, the Bush administration has had little success advancing the rest of its economic agenda and faces growing questions about the strength of its economic team, analysts and members of both parties say. A1

Arizona Fire Grows
Two wildfires that burned more than 330,000 acres of northern Arizona in the last week merged to become by far the biggest fire in the state's history. Fire officials said it could easily scorch one million acres, about 1,500 square miles, before it goes out. The fire, one of the largest ever in the United States, is easily the most challenging of the young fire season and surpasses even the forest fires that have beset Colorado in recent weeks. A16

Smoke from the Arizona blaze has made firefighting more difficult for workers battling wildfires in Colorado. Hot temperatures and low humidity added to the challenge. The only good news was the relative lack of wind. A16

Crime Rises in U.S.
The nation's crime rose by 2 percent in 2001, according to statistics to be reported today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Serious crimes like homicide and robbery have risen in the United States for the first time in almost a decade, fueled by increases in many large cities but tempered by a sharp decline in New York. A12

The Demise of the Outhouse
The Census Bureau says the number of houses without plumbing has dropped below one million for the first time, to 671,000, and below 1 percent, to 0.64 percent, for the first time, too. The decline has been a long time coming, from nearly half the houses lacking plumbing in 1940, when the bureau began keeping plumbing records. A1

Judge Throws Out Case
A federal judge has dismissed the Justice Department's case against seven people accused of funneling charitable donations to an Iranian military group deemed partly responsible for the 1979 takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran and still labeled a terrorist threat. A13

HEADLINE: Bush Facing Test in House As Economic Agenda Stalls 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
The Republican-controlled House faces a politically painful decision in the coming week about whether to give in to increasingly urgent demands from the Bush administration for action to avert a government financial crisis, the latest example of the White House economic agenda's becoming trapped in partisan gridlock.
 The administration is likely to succeed in its efforts to persuade the House to support an increase in the legal limit on the national debt, because failure to do so would leave the government unable to borrow enough money to meet all its obligations starting at the end of the week. 
 "We will not let the federal government default on debt," J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois and the House speaker, said today on the CNN program "Hunt, Novak and Shields."
The reluctance of House Republicans to take up the issue, and the eagerness of Democrats in both chambers to emphasize it, is the newest skirmish in the fight over whether the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by President Bush has proved to be too expensive.
But the maneuvering over a step that both parties acknowledge must be taken to avert a catastrophic default is also evidence of how the two parties are at loggerheads over a range of economic issues. 
After a quick victory last year with passage of its tax cut, the administration has had little success advancing the rest of its economic agenda and faces questions on the strength of its economic team, analysts and members of both parties say.
Now that the government's priority has shifting to fighting terrorism, and with the White Houses political strategy complicated by last year's recession and the shift in control of the Senate to the Democrats, many Bush proposals have been slowed, watered down or undermined by the administration's own actions.
On trade, the budget, Social Security, energy, the fallout from the Enron scandal and efforts to make permanent the provisions of the 10-year tax cut, Mr. Bush has found himself on the defensive, forced into compromises or playing for time.
He paid little or no political price for the recession, because it was brief and mild and because of the focus on terrorism. But with the strength of the recovery in doubt, Wall Street jittery about corporate malfeasance and Democrats eager to emphasize pocketbook issues in this fall's Congressional elections, analysts say the Bush economic record is sure to be scrutinized more intently in coming months.
"The only thing the administration really accomplished that was set out in the original December 2000 game plan was the tax cut," said Kim Wallace, a political analyst in Washington for Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Bush came to office advocating an expansion of free trade deals. He asserted that the nation could afford a big tax cut and still pay down the debt. He called for creating personal investment accounts in the Social Security system. He sought more freedom for oil companies to drill, saying it would reduce reliance on foreign oil.
House Republican leaders have signaled that they will do what it takes to avert a financial default this week, despite wide opposition among them to any vote that would put them on record supporting an increase in the $5.95 trillion national debt, much of which is obligations to pay future Social Security benefits. The Senate has voted for a $450 billion increase in the debt ceiling, enough to get the government through to early next year.
Moreover, White House officials say they are forging ahead with the rest of their agenda, with no second thoughts about the wisdom of the tax cut. They say last year's tax cut for individuals and the corporate tax breaks Mr. Bush signed into law in March are lifting the economy. 
To the extent that other initiatives have been stalled or rewritten, they assert, the fault rests with the Democratic leadership of the Senate, which they cast as obstructionist.
With members of Congress from both parties facing pressure from voters to accomplish something, the logjam could break this summer, giving the president a series of victories, administration officials say.
"Things are progressing," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic policy adviser. 
Democrats say the current situation makes clear that Mr. Bush is not much interested in any domestic or economic policy beyond tax cuts.
"The Bush domestic agenda ended with the tax cut," said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council. "Instead of coming up with new economic ideas, they've spent most of their time coming up with new rationales for old ideas."
Even important economic legislation that is progressing faces many hurdles. The House and the Senate have passed legislation increasing the president's authority to negotiate international trade deals. But it is unclear if the two very different versions can be reconciled. An effort to begin talks on a compromise faltered last week when the Republican leadership in the House lacked the votes to get past a procedural hurdle.
In other cases, circumstances have forced the administration to accept radical changes in its goals. With national security needs and a drop in tax revenue, Mr. Bush's push to limit spending growth has given way to the biggest expansion of government in decades and a swing from surpluses to deficits. With money tight, the president has failed to persuade Congress to make permanent the 10-year tax cut, including repeal of the estate tax.
Then there are Social Security and energy. On the first issue, vociferous Democratic opposition has led Mr. Bush to put his plans for an overhaul on the back burner; on the second, the Senate gutted central provisions of the president's proposal, including his call for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The relatively limited regulatory changes Mr. Bush advocated after Enron's collapse have done little to restore investor confidence on Wall Street, where falling stock prices and concern about the integrity of corporate accounting threaten the recovery. On Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee adopted a bill, with bipartisan support, that would go further in regulating accountants than Mr. Bush has called for.
On some issues, the administration has muddied its own message for the sake of scoring political points, members of both parties say. In a move widely seen as out of step with his free-trade philosophy, Mr. Bush imposed tariffs in March to protect domestic steel. Last month he signed a bipartisan farm-subsidy bill that conservatives considered bloated, undercutting his calls for limited government spending and more reliance on market forces.
"The Bush team has treated conservative economic principles at times like bargaining chips," said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. 
Some analysts say Mr. Bush's economic team lacks the influence to prevail not just on Capitol Hill or in the public arena but also in debates with White House political advisers like Karl Rove.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, a blunt, results-oriented pragmatist to his supporters, is dismissed as a quirky loose cannon by his critics, some of them Republican. Mr. Lindsey still has the president's ear but is viewed by people inside and outside the administration as disorganized and a weak manager. 
"They've got an imbalance in the sense that they have strong political advisers who know what they want," said I. M. Destler, director of the program on international security and economic policy at the University of Maryland. But they have no "comparably connected people with economic perspectives," he said. 
Mr. O'Neill "has been an idiosyncratic figure," in the view of Mr. Destler, who said of Mr. Lindsey, "The skepticism about him as a policy manager hasn't been rebutted."
After winning initial praise for their role in getting the president off to a fast start with the tax cut, nearly all the members of the economic team have taken some lumps. 
"There's no one in the inner sanctum who's a heavyweight on these issues," said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a political action committee for supply-side conservatives. 
Administration officials say the economic team has the president's confidence, and the targets of the criticism, like Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Lindsey, have for the most part brushed it off. 
To be sure, the administration has had some successes since Mr. Bush signed the tax cut into law a year ago. It has pushed forward much of its deregulatory agenda, particularly on environmental rules, and is making plans for initiatives, including an overhaul of the tax code. But the lack of momentum on most high-profile economic issues has left parts of Mr. Bush's conservative base frustrated.
"The tax cut was the crown jewel of what they were trying to do in domestic policy," Mr. Moore said. "Having said that, from the start of this year Bush's economic agenda has been pretty much adrift."

HEADLINE: The Imperial Chief Executive Is Suddenly in the Cross Hairs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT; Alex Berenson, Claudia H. Deutsch, Barnaby J. Feder, Constance L. Hays, Patrick McGeehan, Andrew Pollack and Tim Race contributed to this article.

 BODY:
Stephen M. Case, a hero of the 1990's for having built America Online into a multimedia giant, sat on the stage at his company's annual meeting last month, listening to investors mock him for overseeing multibillion-dollar losses.
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, following in the footsteps of the lionized John F. Welch Jr. at General Electric, has tried to soothe rebellious shareholders by releasing more information than Mr. Welch ever did, but G.E.'s stock has still fallen more sharply than most others this year. 
 Meanwhile, Charles R. Schwab, hoping to capitalize on Wall Street's new unpopularity, has appeared in a television advertisement proclaiming his brokerage firm "a different kind of company."
Across the business landscape, the imperial chief executive, hailed not long ago as the savior of entire companies and the driving force behind the turnaround of the American economy, is suddenly under siege. With two prominent executives being indicted in the last month, accounting problems continuing to emerge and the stock market stuck near its lowest level in three years, executives are facing their most significant challenge in a decade or more. 
To respond, chief executives have begun a delicate two-step intended to answer their critics and still defeat efforts at systemic change. While proclaiming their own companies to be fully healthy and the recent disclosures about problems at Enron, Tyco International, Rite Aid, Imclone Systems and elsewhere to be a series of exceptions, many executives have become more solicitous of their investors, more open about their financial dealings and more responsive to detailed questions from board members. But few are willing to sacrifice even a sliver of the many privileges and huge pay packages they were awarded in recent years.
"We C.E.O.'s have to do gut checks," said William D. Zollars, the chief executive of the Yellow Corporation, one of the nation's biggest trucking companies, who has been attending meetings with investors that he once would have skipped. "We have to make sure we're playing it down the middle of the fairway, not close to the lines."
For much of the booming 1990's, the nation's chief executives could make the case -- and they often did -- that they embodied all that was right with America. They received personal credit for nearly every improvement at their companies, accumulating enormous wealth and prestige in the process. Some, like Mr. Welch, who received a larger book advance than the pope, became international celebrities, thanks to fawning magazine covers and idolatrous management tomes.
Today's far different atmosphere has helped contribute to a decline in major stock market indexes even as the economy has apparently emerged from recession, a chain of events that had not occurred since the 1920's.
The actions of just a few chief executives have hurt the images of everyone else. "It's the same thing as when a couple of policemen are found corrupt," said Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, the drug company, echoing the frustration of his peers. "The whole police department suffers."
To others, however, the individual problems that have become apparent since Enron collapsed last December suggest that many of the usual checks on chief executives' power disappeared during the giddiness of the 90's economic boom. Now some investors, who tended to give executives free rein when stock prices were rising, are trying to force changes.

Delivering a Lecture
A Corporate Chief Is Taken to Task
Ten days ago, William H. Miller III, one of the market's most successful mutual fund managers and a recent critic of the board at Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, picked up the phone to find Barry S. Sternlicht, Starwood's chief executive, on the other end.
Mr. Sternlicht built Starwood into one of the world's largest hotel chains by buying bigger rivals and starting the unexpectedly popular W Hotels, nearly all before his 40th birthday. He forced out many of his deputies along the way, received a raise last year even as profits fell and, provoking Mr. Miller's ire, recently decided not to heed more than three-quarters of his shareholders, who passed a resolution asking for changes to the board.
But Mr. Miller gave him little of the deference to which chief executives had become accustomed in the booming 90's. Instead, Mr. Sternlicht received a lecture on democracy.
"Barry, my issue is simple," Mr. Miller, who runs the $11 billion Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund, recalled saying. The founding fathers, he said, thought that any issue that could gather the support of three-quarters of the states was good enough to be in the Constitution; shareholders should have the same power over the company they own. "What's good for America," Mr. Miller said, "is good for corporate America."
More broadly, investors and private groups, including the business-sponsored Conference Board and the governors of the New York Stock Exchange, are proposing new rules, including one to limit executives' stock option awards and another to require that many board members have no other connections to the executives reporting to them. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere have become more aggressive about investigating executives' behavior.
Americans' perceptions of executives' integrity, meanwhile, have dropped sharply since the 90's. People now say public officials in Washington are more honest and ethical than business leaders, a switch from earlier years, according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
"We now have too many examples for people not to conclude there's a pattern," said Scott C. Cleland, the chief executive of the Precursor Group in Washington, which advises investors. "We have a deep crisis of confidence."
Chief executives have proved adept in recent years at avoiding nearly every attempt to curb their power, and they have an important ally this time. The Bush administration is emphasizing the enforcement of existing laws over the passage of new ones, which the White House says could make companies less efficient and slow the economy. Having watched the political standing of the nation's captains of industry drop, however, administration officials have stopped comparing President Bush's management style to that of a chief executive and have harshly criticized some business behavior.
"You should get on the tabletop and scream out against the abuses that have been done," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill advised executives in a speech last week. "This is not what we think is responsible behavior," added Mr. O'Neill, a former chief executive of Alcoa. "We don't like it any better than anyone else."

'Times Have Changed'
Forfeiting Millions After Complaints
At the very least, the most opulent behavior of the last decade has become more difficult to justify.
Christos M. Cotsakos, the chief executive of the E*Trade Group, the online brokerage firm, had made something of a joke of his willingness to throw away money. During the 2000 Super Bowl, a company ad showed a monkey wearing an E*Trade T-shirt and clapping, with a tag line saying, "Well, we just wasted two million bucks." After the monkey's star turn during this year's game, Mr. Cotsakos himself appeared on camera reading a newspaper with the headline, "Monkey Flops. Silliest Ad in Game History."
He could not have expected that his shareholders would consider the more than $80 million in cash and stock he received last year to be a similar waste. It was a tremendous amount of money, to be sure, but it was still only a fraction of the largest awards in recent years.
With E*Trade's profits down and its stock far below its high, however, investors rebelled in a way they never did during the 1990's. To settle a lawsuit from one of them, Mr. Cotsakos forfeited $21 million of his pay last month and, when the criticism continued, announced at E*Trade's annual meeting that he would give an additional $16 million to E*Trade's employees. Investors continued to deride him anyway.
"Times have changed," Mr. Cotsakos said in a recent interview, explaining why he returned some of the money even though he believed that he deserved all of it.
By contrast, a decade ago, in one of the first big windfalls, Roberto C. Goizueta, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, also received about $80 million in pay, and he also used the next annual meeting to explain it. But shareholders did not need much convincing. They interrupted his speech inside an Atlanta convention center four times with applause, and none of them criticized the pay.
"In a bull market, people just take easy answers," said Christopher C. Davis, a portfolio manager at Davis Selected Advisers, which manages $30 billion.
Mr. Goizueta quickly became one of the county's biggest celebrity executives; others followed. In the late 1990's, Andrew S. Grove of Intel and Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon.com became only the fourth and fifth business executives to be named Time magazine's Man of the Year.
Chief executives became the standard against which all other leaders were judged. Political analysts compared the management style not only of President Bush but also of people like Phil Jackson, the basketball coach, to that of a chief executive.
Somebody even imagined Jesus Christ to be sitting in a corner office. Among the stacks of management self-help books published during the 1990's was "Jesus CEO"
Now, by contrast, the image of the chief executive is under attack even from within.
"I've been in business for 40 years -- 25 or 30 years in senior management," said Mr. Grove, Intel's former chief executive and still its chairman. "And I find myself feeling embarrassed and ashamed by what I see in corporate America.
"The same way the market sentiment shifted toward an unbridled exuberance," he said, "the values of a lot of people managing companies in this market environment drifted toward, 'Me, me, me.' "
Many big investors say the current crisis, paradoxically, has its roots in their last push to reform the chief executive's job description.
Frustrated by executives who continued to receive large salaries even when their company's stock was flat or falling, institutional investors in the late 1980's pushed boards to align executives' interests with those of shareholders. So directors handed out piles of stock options to their top executives, giving them the right to buy shares in the future at a previously fixed price.
But knowing that large options grants had made their wealth dependent almost entirely on the company's stock price, executives had an incentive to do anything in order to improve the profits they were reporting, investors are emphasizing now.
Indeed, in the last two years, hundreds of companies have revised earlier earnings reports that turned out to be exaggerated. Even if the stock then tumbled, many executives who had followed a regular program of exercising their options and selling their stock became far richer than their predecessors.
"If you're a C.E.O. and you get compensated for driving the stock up, the balance sheet is like someone else's piggy bank you can loot to run up your own compensation," Mr. Cleland, the investment adviser, said.
Shareholder resolutions on executive pay and other issues, while rarely binding, have begun to receive more votes than they have in the past. More than 50 percent of shareholders have voted for some, as they did at Starwood.
"When we started doing this five years ago, these proposals were getting 10, 20 percent of the vote," said William Patterson, director of the office of investments at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "They were viewed as coming from a bunch of shareholders and workers whining about executive compensation."
Now, labor unions and other longtime critics have been joined by investors like Mr. Miller, who is famous for generating a better return in his mutual fund than the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index every year since 1991.
Corporate governance is now the second-most important factor Legg Mason fund managers use in making investment decisions, trailing only the relative value of the stock, Mr. Miller said.

The Corporate Response
Diverting Attention And Changing Policy
For some executives untainted by the recent scandals, the smartest move is to point out the other guy's flaws.
One Schwab ad parodies other Wall Street firms, which have been criticized for promoting the stocks of some companies to win their banking business. "Let's put some lipstick on this pig," a supervisor in one ad tells the brokers under his command, urging them to push a poor stock.
Most executives, however, say that they need to counter the newly nefarious image of business. "All of us feel tarnished by much of what has gone on," said John W. Snow, the chief executive of CSX, a transportation company, and a member of a committee of executives, former government officials and others that plans to issue corporate-governance guidelines later this year.
General Electric has made one of the biggest attempts to remove the tarnish. Mr. Immelt has spent much of this year trying to convince investors that the balance sheet responsible for Mr. Welch's fame was really as stellar as he had said. The company has released pages of new financial information and, in a first, announced the company's quarterly earnings on a conference call with analysts and reporters rather than through a press release.
But Mr. Immelt's audience remains skeptical: G.E.'s stock, a symbol of the 1990's bull market, has fallen more than 25 percent so far this year, about twice as much as the S.& P. 500.
Many board members say they, too, have become more active in recent months. But directors have been pronouncing themselves newly vigilant for much of the last decade, and governance experts said it is too early to know whether there will be significant changes this time.
Archie W. Dunham, the chief executive of Conoco, the oil company, said the audit and compensation committees on which he sits at other companies have spent much more time questioning executives since Enron's fall.
"Maybe 12 months ago or two years ago, we could have accepted a summary from the vice president of human resources" on Conoco's executive pay plan, Mr. Dunham said. "Now we're asking for raw data."
Elsewhere, a few directors seem to have lost their jobs for failing to be sufficiently vigilant. David C. Hayden resigned last month as the chairman of Critical Path, a provider of corporate e-mail systems, after having made millions of dollars selling company stock before the S.E.C. discovered accounting violations at the company. Mr. Hayden, who has not been charged with wrongdoing and who said he had not known of the violations when he sold the stock, had also been the chairman of the E*Trade compensation committee that approved Mr. Cotsakos's big payday.
But the strongest sign of the change in chief executives' image may be coming from the companies looking for new leaders. About a week ago, the board of Qwest Communications International, a telecommunications company being investigated by the S.E.C. for its accounting practices, forced the resignation of Joseph P. Nacchio, its chief. Mr. Nacchio was an aggressive manager who had taken on more debt than the company could comfortably manage once the industry hit hard times. He also criticized the few Wall Street analysts who suggested the company could be in trouble.
His successor, Richard C. Notebaert, is widely considered to have a more humble approach. At Ameritech, another telecommunications company he previously ran, Mr. Notebaert often conceded his mistakes and sometimes described seemingly smart decisions as mainly lucky.
"The No. 1 criteria in every C.E.O. search we do today is integrity," said Gerard R. Roche, the senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, a top executive-search company. "That used to be assumed. No one had to mention it. Not anymore."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
A House as His Home, but a Museum as His Dream

BYLINE:  By Douglas Frantz 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, June 24 

 BODY:
Sakip Sabanci is a billionaire with, he says, a mission. First, he wants Turks to have a museum that meets international standards. Then he intends to reverse the flow of cultural masterpieces departing Turkey for the last couple of centuries. Finally, he is dead set on instilling a sense of philanthropy in the country's business elite.
 "I want to better Turkey, and art is a very important part of that effort," Mr. Sabanci (pronounced sah-BAHN-ja) said the other day, shaking both fists for emphasis. 
 Mr. Sabanci certainly has the wherewithal to finance his dreams. He is chairman of Sabanci Holding SA, one of Turkey's largest industrial conglomerates. The family foundation spent $40 million building what quickly became one of Turkey's most respected private universities and financed a string of other cultural and educational projects.
With the grand opening of the Sakip Sabanci Museum in a hilltop park overlooking the Bosporus in Istanbul on June 8, Mr. Sabanci, a diminutive man of outsize achievements in the business world, accomplished his goal of bringing an international-quality museum to Turkey.
Istanbul is blessed with wonderful museums, from the Ottoman palace of Topkapi to archaeological and religious treasure houses. But none meet international standards for fire safety, earthquake resistance and other factors that would allow them to act as hosts to major traveling exhibitions.
Mr. Sabanci and an advisory board, which included Makrukh Tarapor from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, put together a plan to remedy that omission.
The result is a stunner -- the stately Sabanci family villa was transformed into a state-of-the-art home for Mr. Sabanci's renowned calligraphy collection along with furniture and decorative arts. Attached to the villa by a covered walkway is an all-new contemporary, 15,000-square-foot, glass-walled pavilion for temporary exhibitions. Both buildings meet the standards required by curators and insurers for traveling shows.
For the museum's gala opening, which drew the country's political, business and social A list, the pavilion displayed 140 paintings from Mr. Sabanci's collection. The exhibition contains works by the most famous Turkish painters like Osman Hamdi and Ibrahim Calli.
But the museum's centerpiece is the calligraphy, acknowledged as the premier private collection in Turkey and one of the world's best. The current display features the 70 illuminated books, scrolls and wall plaques that were shown at the Metropolitan in New York in 1999 and at the Louvre in 2000. 
The two-story villa's galleries are atmospherically lighted, with deep blue walls that create the feel of a jewel box. On those walls are Koranic manuscripts and verses rendered in exquisite script on marbled paper that trace 500 years of unbroken Ottoman rule.
The idea for the museum, Mr. Sabanci said, grew out of his visit to the United States several years ago. Mr. Sabanci's father was a cotton sharecropper in Turkey who built a conglomerate that today has 30,000 employees and 65 companies, with interests ranging from auto manufacture and banking to hypermarkets and chemical plants.
One of the company's strategies has been to form joint ventures with leading foreign corporations like Toyota, Bridgestone, Philip Morris and DuPont. The idea was to learn from one another, and it rubbed off on the cultural side.
Mr. Sabanci said the inspiration to create a museum sprang from a visit with the duPont family in Wilmington, Del. "They turned the family house into a wonderful museum," Mr. Sabanci said. "I realized that an institution's success and contribution cannot be solely judged on economic criteria." 
Mr. Sabanci was living in the mansion overlooking the Bosporus, which his father had bought in 1951 as a summer home. When Mr. Sabanci described his plan, friends told him he was crazy to open his house -- and treasures -- to the public while he was still alive.
"They told me to wait until I died, but I wanted to do it now, when I am strong and in control," said Mr. Sabanci who, at 69, shows no sign of relinquishing control anytime soon. 
As in France, culture is the province of the government in Turkey and there are few private cultural institutions. Likewise, charity is traditionally dispensed from the mosques and private philanthropy is a largely untested concept.
To direct the museum, Mr. Sabanci turned to Emin Balcioglu, a Turkish architect who ran a Turkish cultural center in New York. Along with overseeing the $6.5 million renovation of the villa and construction of the new gallery, Mr. Balcioglu consulted experts to upgrade Mr. Sabanci's collections.
"A private collector buys for his taste or because he got a good deal," Mr. Balcioglu said. "There were gaps we needed to fill to provide a sequence."
For instance, 123 paintings were acquired, bringing the collection to 318, probably the largest private or public holding of quality contemporary Turkish paintings. The calligraphy needed few additions, because Mr. Sabanci had been a major and careful collector for years.
The museum will also run education and training programs through its affiliation with Sabanci University. Chief among them will be a laboratory to conserve and restore paper. Of the 130,000 historic manuscripts in Istanbul, Mr. Balcioglu estimated, 30,000 need restoration.
As for Mr. Sabanci's other goals, he said that he had seen progress in building a domestic market for Turkish art and cultural artifacts and that Turkish buyers were repatriating works bought years ago by Americans and Europeans. 
He is optimistic, too, that private philanthropy will expand among other rich Turks. Toward that end, he happily ushered a number of them through his museum on a recent Saturday evening, laughing as he joked about leaving the house, with its art and furnishings, three years ago, taking with him only his pajamas.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Over all, I understand the point Maureen Dowd is driving at: exercise to keep the body healthy pales in importance to solving the world's political, social and economic ailments ("Hans, Franz & W.," column, June 23). Yet she gravely misses the benefit of the president's fitness endeavors. 
 First, exercise balances the president's life, thereby enabling him to carry out his presidential duties more effectively. It is quite possible that without exercise Mr. Bush would actually perform worse, not better, as our president. In short, contrary to what Ms. Dowd states, there may not be a trade-off between toning the body and toning the mind.
Second, Mr. Bush is setting an example that the rest of America should emulate. What better way to solve the current health care and prescription drug crisis than to make Americans less needy of such services?

HEADLINE: Let Them Sweat 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ATTOCK, Pakistan 

 BODY:
When the G-8 leaders meet this week, cowering in a Canadian mountain resort beyond the reach of organized anarchists, here's a way for them to bolster terror-infested third world countries like Pakistan.
 They should start an international campaign to promote imports from sweatshops, perhaps with bold labels depicting an unrecognizable flag and the words "Proudly Made in a Third World Sweatshop!" 
 The Gentle Reader will think I've been smoking Pakistani opium. But the fact is that sweatshops are the only hope of kids like Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old boy here in Attock, a gritty center for carpet weaving. 
Ahmed, who dropped out of school in the second grade, earns $2 a day hunched over the loom, laboring over a rug that will adorn some American's living room. It is a pittance, but the American campaign against sweatshops could make his life much more wretched by inadvertently encouraging mechanization that could cost him his job.
"Carpet-making is much better than farm work," Ahmed said, mulling alternatives if he loses his job as hundreds of others have over the last year. "This makes much more money and is more comfortable."
Indeed, talk to third world factory workers and the whole idea of "sweatshops" seems a misnomer. It is farmers and brick-makers who really sweat under the broiling sun, while sweatshop workers merely glow.
The third world is already battered by heartless conservatives in the West who peddle arms and cigarettes or who (like the Bushies) block $34 million desperately needed for maternal and infant health by the United Nations Population Fund. So it's catastrophic for muddle-minded liberals to join in and cudgel impoverished workers for whom a sweatshop job is the first step on life's escalator.
By this point, I've offended every possible reader. But before you spurn a shirt made by someone like 8-year-old Kamis Saboor, an Afghan refugee whose father is dead and who is the sole breadwinner in the family, answer this question: How does shunning sweatshop products help Kamis? All the alternatives for him are worse.
"I dream of a job in a factory," said Noroz Khan, who lives on a garbage dump and spends his days searching for metal that he can sell to recyclers. He earns about $1.40 a day, and children earn just 30 cents a day for scrounging barefoot in the filth -- a few feet away from us, birds were pecking at the bloated carcass of a cow, its feet in the air.
Of course, Western anti-sweatshop activists mean well and aim only for improved conditions and a "living wage." But the reality is that the bad publicity becomes one more headache for companies considering operating in international hellholes (where the only lure is wages so low that it would be embarrassing if journalists started asking questions about them), and so manufacturers opt to mechanize their operations and operate in somewhat more developed countries.
For example, Nike has 35 contract factories in Taiwan, 49 in South Korea, only 3 in Pakistan and none at all in Afghanistan -- if it did, critics would immediately fulminate about low wages, glue vapors, the mistreatment of women. 
But the losers are the Afghans, and especially Afghan women. The country is full of starving widows who can find no jobs. If Nike hired them at 10 cents an hour to fill all-female sweatshops, they and their country would be hugely better off.
Nike used to have two contract factories in impoverished Cambodia, among the neediest countries in the world. Then there was an outcry after BBC reported that three girls in one factory were under 15 years old. So Nike fled controversy by ceasing production in Cambodia. 
The result was that some of the 2,000 Cambodians (90 percent of them young women) who worked in those factories faced layoffs. Some who lost their jobs probably were ensnared in Cambodia's huge sex slave industry -- which leaves many girls dead of AIDS by the end of their teenage years. 
The G-8 leaders will never dare, of course, begin a pro-sweatshop campaign. But at a summit that will discuss how to bring stability and economic growth to some of the world's poorest nations, it would be a start if Westerners who denounce sweatshops would think less of feel-good measures for themselves and more about how any of this helps people like Ahmed and Kamis.

HEADLINE: Meeting Fire on Its Terms 

BYLINE:  By Stephen J. Pyne; Stephen J. Pyne is a professor in the biology department of Arizona State University and author of "Year of the Fires: The Story of the Great Fires of 1910."

DATELINE: ALPINE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
A wildfire near here has burned more than 500 square miles, and it and other fires burning now in the West will have swept over hundreds more before they are put out or burn themselves out. America is fighting the fires -- as it fights Western forest fires every year -- as if it were conducting military campaigns. Helicopters circle overhead, airplanes drop heavy loads of firefighting chemicals, uniformed firefighters march to the front and lines of refugees stream out of burning towns.
 There is a way out of the vicious spiral that replays these scenes, sometimes with this year's degree of severity, sometimes with less. But it requires that we rethink fire management in ways that demand adjustments in much of American society, not simply at its fire agencies. 
 Fires flourish in the American West partly because much of the landscape is inherently fire-prone. It undergoes rhythms of moisture, producing trees and brush in wetter years that will fuel forest fires in the dry ones. And it is subject to dry lightning -- electrical storms without rain. It is natural for such a place to burn, and the species that live naturally in these areas are adapted to periodic fires. Within nature's economy, fire is an agent of creative destruction.
But people have enhanced this natural susceptibility to fire. They kindle fires. They have changed public wild lands in ways that increase their flammability. And for many decades they actively sought to abolish fire, disrupting historic rhythms and making the inevitable fires more ferocious.
There are three strategies for dealing with the fire-prone West: convert the land to something less combustible, do the burning ourselves or rely on suppression. The United States needs to use all three options -- and in innovative mixes.
Converting combustible land works best where fire is dangerous and damaging -- in areas around houses, for example. What many areas need is a kind of woody weeding, which removes woody vegetation that has replaced natural grasses -- but not logging, because the debris or slash left from clear-cutting is among the most hazardous fuels imaginable. By allowing some landscapes to become overgrown with small woody plants, we have created a living equivalent to slash.
Yet limited controlled fires do not necessarily reduce the overall fire hazards. Putting fire back into the landscape is not the simple reverse of taking it out -- it is more like reintroducing a lost species. The fire will behave according to its habitat. The fires we introduce deliberately must be set where we have readied the landscape for them, by clearing thickets and brush, for example, and restoring some natural grasses.
As for suppressing fire, it is at best a temporary act. It deprives a fire-prone land of the good fires it needs -- small and contained, in areas where fuels have grown up naturally -- and encourages large fires that can savage it.
We can improve each of these strategies. We need to agree that some places need grasses restored, and we ought to devise better ways to do it without either scalping the land or allowing growth to clog landscapes. We need to invent better techniques for burning. Presently our burns are most successful in blocks of uniform fuel like slash or prairie. We need to learn to initiate burns in complex forests, and this will require new techniques.
In the United States, technology has rarely been used as a substitute for manpower in fighting fires. We conduct our military-style campaigns, using thousands of firefighters, when we ought to find ways to combine fewer, better trained special forces with high technology. We also need to create rural fire brigades as a kind of volunteer fire militia that can assist in firefighting, particularly when housing developments are threatened, as an alternative to blanket evacuations that empty towns of any force that could stand against the flames. All of this will not eliminate fire, but it can limit the devastating fires and help promote ecologically benign ones.
Although every summer seems to bring another analysis of the "fire problem," America does not have one fire problem. It has many fire problems. Some, like the construction of houses along the forest fringe, are amenable to technical solutions, like zoning laws and fire codes that would abolish wooden roofs, for example. Some, like the need to accept fire in wilderness, must be dealt with politically. Others require site-by-site assessments and site-specific practices.
We must shun the fire fundamentalists: those who would abolish fire or accept only natural fire in the wilderness, and their sympathizers who seek to exploit fire only to animate some other agenda -- like logging or opposition to it. We, as a species, hold a monopoly over the manipulation of fire, and it's time we accepted the responsibility that comes with that power.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
TheArmy is helping to pay for a 'stay in school' campaign aimed at students and their parents.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
A PUBLIC service campaign encouraging students to stay in school is, in a first for such efforts, aimed at parents rather than children.
 The commercials, which rely on humor, were created free by Bates USA in New York and carry the theme "Don't drop out on your kids." The ads show adults in a classroom exaggeratedly practicing parenting skills like affection and how to ask "How was school today?" 
 The commercials are the second part of Operation Graduation, coordinated by the Advertising Council in New York on behalf of the Army. For the Army, the goal is not to recruit troops but to help offset a startling statistic: each year, half a million students drop out of high school, an average of 1,300 students a day, according to the National Center for Education Statistics in Washington. 
"Teenagers often act as though their parents' opinions don't matter, but research indicates parents really wield a lot of influence with their kids," said Naomi Verdugo, assistant deputy for recruiting and retention for the Army in Washington, explaining the campaign.
The Army is paying $1 million to $1.5 million for the campaign's marketing costs including production. The campaign is separate from the $95 million the Army spends annually on advertising to attract recruits. Those ads are created by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group.
Though Ms. Verdugo handles recruitment, she says the campaign is not directly related to recruitment. The Army does, she says, try to make sure that most recruits are high school graduates.
"Anything we can do to get more young adults to graduate from high school means that the pool of people eligible for the opportunities the Army offers is larger," Ms. Verdugo said. In addition, promoting education in donated advertising space -- with ads bearing the Army logo -- is not bad for the Army's image.
The spots aimed at parents show a class of adults being trained by an instructor on how to be involved in their children's lives. They depict parents learning how to hug a child or pat one on the back. One ad shows a parent practicing to say "You did great on that test. I'm real proud of you." The song "I've Got the Power" by Snap plays in the background.
The campaign does not abandon the youngsters, though. There are also humorous spots carrying the line "Dropouts make 42 percent less money than graduates" to emphasize the economic toll taken by young people who quit school. The ads are aimed at boys and girls ages 11 to 15.
In one commercial, a homeless man offers his cup of change to a young man who dropped out. In another, a dropout is eligible for only one job in a thick binder of openings. The job: advertising for Frenchy's House of Fries by wearing a French fry costume and holding a poster on the street. The theme of the ad is: "Stay in school. Give yourself a chance."
The effort is one of about 40 public service campaigns coordinated by the Ad Council in New York, which will begin distributing the ads next month to media outlets that are asked to donate time and space. Last year, the Operation Graduation campaign received $67 million in donated time and space, ranking seventh among the council's campaigns, according to the council.
So why make changes?
"Our research consistently indicates that parents have the greatest influence on their children's lives," said Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive at the Ad Council. "We knew that by targeting parents with messages about the critical role they play in their kids' lives just by being involved, these P.S.A.'s could play a significant part in reducing the alarming number of students who drop out of high school."
The two new themes replace earlier real-life testimonials featuring young people who talk about the benefits of returning to school after having dropped out. Those were created by Publicis in New York, part of the American operations of the Publicis Groupe. The earlier campaign also had some commercials and radio spots in Spanish, which were developed by Conill Advertising in New York, part of the Saatchi & Saatchi division of Publicis.
The Operation Graduation campaign began in November 2000, Ms. Conlon said, after the council was contacted by Louis Caldera, the secretary of the Army. As one of the largest employers of youth in the country, the Army continues to support the campaign under its new leadership; Mr. Caldera is now on the council's board.
The new campaign includes radio, outdoor and online ads and also has the sergeant major of the Army, Jack L. Tilley, serving as a spokesman talking to students.
Humor has replaced serious ads that research found did not relate to the intended audience, said Rob Slosberg, executive vice president and group creative director at Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide division of the Cordiant Communications Group.
"Humor isn't anything new," Mr. Slosberg said. "But certainly it helps get their attention."
Perhaps the lighthearted jokes do not reflect the larger meaning the campaign has taken on for those who work on it.
"School is not just about getting a better job or making more money," said Mr. Slosberg, who is the father of two. "It's getting kids off the street, getting them in the state of mind to be more successful in whatever they do."

HEADLINE: ON THE GROUND; 
In Dallas

BYLINE:  By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
Dallas visitors could comfortably do business in the same chain hotels and expense-account steakhouses as anywhere else. But they can also find lodgings, restaurants and entertainment that forthrightly reflect their Southwestern setting.
 Visitors staying downtown will find night life blooming around its edges, especially in the Deep Ellum neighborhood. Those coming for trade shows in the vast wholesaling district may find the convention hotels nearby most convenient, but the hotels downtown and in the more residential Oak Lawn and Turtle Creek neighborhoods are just a few miles away. Those bound for the offices stretching more than 20 miles north from the city center, however, should seek a more suburban base. 

HOTELS
The MANSION ON TURTLE CREEK (214-559-2100, about $325) is built around a Spanish colonial-style mansion that serves as one of the best, but most expensive, New Southwest restaurants. Business counterparts will admire your taste as well as your travel budget. To see how Dallas business leaders live, ask for directions to walk, drive or jog along Lakeside Drive in Highland Park.
As producer of Arts & Letters Live, the invariably sold-out readings at the Dallas Museum of Art, Kaye Cattarulla puts actors and writers up at the MELROSE HOTEL (214-521-5151, $169 on weekends to $209 weekdays) in Oak Lawn, using words like "an old-hotel feel," "renovated perfectly" and "manageable" to explain why. Its piano lounge, the Library, can turn business adversaries into best friends. 
The HAMPTON INN (214-742-5678, $69 to $149, depending on date), is not your usual budget motel. It is in a renovated 23-story building within an easy walk of major office buildings as well as the West End, where restaurants and clubs are installed in renovated warehouses. Continental breakfast is included. 
The choices in North Dallas, an easier drive to suburban offices, include the WESTIN GALLERIA (972-934-9494, $255 but often negotiable to the $200 range). It is attached to the Dallas Galleria and its more than 200 stores, for incomes ranging from middle management to chief executive. Farther north, the HOTEL INTER-CONTINENTAL DALLAS (972-386-6000, $179), has fancier rooms but no mall.

DINING OUT
In at least one respect, Dallas can be a budget traveler's paradise. Deals that in other towns would have to be discussed or celebrated over haute cuisine or porterhouse and cabernet can be done over barbecued brisket or enchiladas.
In recent years, Mexican restaurants have become more Mex than Tex. Jonathan Thalheimer, a leading lawyer in town who specializes in real estate finance, often takes clients to CIUDAD (214-219-3141, $115 for dinner for two including wine and tip). "It's Mexico City Mexican," he said. Arches, folk art and Mexican tiled floors create a warm interior, while many diners head for the patio. 
Regarding barbecue, the good news is that the best place to go with business associates happens to be the best in general. SAMMY'S BARBECUE (214-880-9064, about $25 for two, with beer and dessert) only serves lunch, but can be rented for economical evening parties. "It's family-run, family-operated," Mr. Thalheimer said. "The guy who owns it is there all the time." The late Stanley Marcus liked it so much that it could have been called Stanley's. 
From south of Mexico's border with Central America, try Salvadoran at GLORIA'S. The menu also offers Mexican and what it calls Salvatex. Five locations, ranging from quietly to raucously casual, include the close suburb of Addison and the more distant Frisco. At the Oak Lawn location (214-521-7576, $60 for dinner for two, with beer), try the terrace, facing the scarlet explosion known as a Texas sunset.

ENTERTAINMENT
Deep Ellum has the best club scene, starting with TREES (214-748-5009). The district's restaurants include MONICA'S ACA Y ALLA (214-748-7140), where Ciudad's owner offers moderately priced Tex-Mex.
Hear true Texan -- country, folk, the Brave Combo polka band or the act that Kinky Friedman cleaned up for his gig at the White House -- at POOR DAVID'S PUB (214-821-9891) on Greenville Avenue, another night life locale.

ON YOUR OWN
For shopping, head to the original flagship NIEMAN-MARCUS (214-741-6911) downtown. Next, go to one of the three WESTERN WAREHOUSE locations. If you are then exposed to the classic Texas insult, "All hat and no cattle," say your airline wouldn't let you check a herd.
At the former Texas School Book Depository, the SIXTH-FLOOR MUSEUM (214-747-6660) commemorates President John F. Kennedy's life and his 1963 assassination on the floor where Lee Harvey Oswald fired.
If you have time, see the stockyards, museums and lively downtown of Fort Worth, 33 miles west by road and much farther in spirit.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Top Drugs for Aged Easily Outpace Inflation 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
A consumer group said today that prices of the 50 drugs most often prescribed for elderly people rose last year at nearly three times the rate of inflation.
 The report was issued by the consumer group, Families USA, as House Republicans tried to round up votes for their bill to provide prescription drug benefits to the elderly under Medicare. The bill, approved last week by two House committees, is scheduled for a vote on the House floor this week. 
 Doctors, hospitals and some other health care providers have endorsed the bill, in part because it would increase the payments they receive for treating Medicare patients. 
But groups representing retail druggists, including the National Association of Chain Drug Stores and the National Community Pharmacists Association, attacked the bill today, saying it would slash their reimbursement and pressure elderly people to use mail-order pharmacies as a cost-saving measure. 
The report from Families USA said prices for the 50 drugs most used by the elderly rose an average of 7.8 percent last year, compared with the 2.8 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index for all items but energy. (Energy prices, which fell last year, were excluded from the calculation because they have been particularly volatile.)
Prices for more than one-third of the drugs, 18 of the 50, rose at least three times the rate of inflation. The average annual cost of a drug on the top-50 list was $1,070. The drugs with the highest prices, each listed at more than $1,400 a year, were Celebrex, for arthritis; two ulcer drugs, Prilosec and Prevacid; Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering agent; and Plavix, which helps prevent blood clots.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota who did much of the research for the report, said drug companies appeared to be raising prices in the expectation that Congress would soon add drug coverage to Medicare. As a corollary, he said, the government may put new pressure or limits on drug prices.
The House Republican bill, with a 10-year cost estimated at $350 billion, would pay federal subsidies to insurance companies to induce them to offer drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. It is similar to a bill that the House passed in June 2000. The vote then was close, 217 to 214, so House Republican leaders are taking nothing for granted this week.
One conservative Republican, Mac Collins of Georgia, has indicated that he will vote against the bill. Several other House Republicans, including Ernest Istook of Oklahoma, have expressed concerns about the bill's cost or its effects on pharmacies.
"Making big promises may win some votes," Mr. Istook said today, "but somebody has to pay. Instead of using taxpayers' money to pay overblown prices, we should work to reduce what prescriptions are costing. Medicare is on wobbly legs already. Adding this $35 billion in annual spending could make the whole thing collapse."
Families USA said the data in its report came from a Pennsylvania program that helps more than 240,000 low-income people buy prescription drugs.
Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association, said the report ignored the fact that drug prices could vary widely, even in the same neighborhood. "Seniors may want to shop around to find the best value," Ms. Cottrell said.
Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, another spokesman for the trade group, said the report did not take account of discounts negotiated by managed care organizations and other bulk purchasers of drugs.
Social Security benefits, a major source of income for the elderly, are increased each year to keep pace with the Consumer Price Index. "Seniors live on fixed incomes that, at best, rise with inflation," said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA. "Drug prices are rising much faster than inflation. So drugs are consuming a larger share of seniors' budgets, and, over time, they are becoming unaffordable."
Of the 50 drugs most often prescribed for the elderly last year, the report said, 40 were brand-name medicines and 10 generic drugs. Prices for the brand-name drugs rose an average of 8.1 percent, it said, while generic-drug prices rose 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD; 
Airline Tries to Quell Seating Storm

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
ON the supposition that there is no need to try to say something better when it has already been said perfectly, I am indebted to the editorial page of The Rocky Mountain News of Denver for the following trenchant comment last week regarding reports that Southwest Airlines has begun cracking down on extra large people by making them buy two airplane seats: 
 "Our worry is that the outcome of all this will be one more indignity inflicted on the hapless air traveler. In addition to making you take off your shoes, empty your pockets, unbuckle your belt, dump out your carry-on, show your ID -- twice -- and submit to hand wanding, they'll tape- measure your behind." 
 Southwest says it intends to do no such thing. Instead, says the airline, which has been scrambling for days to undo the public relations damage caused by headlines like "Southwest Changes Policy on Wide-Bodies," it will depend on its ticket and gate agents to ensure that people who don't fit completely in one seat pay twice. 
That puts it bluntly, of course. But those travelers and some of the people who represent them say that it is time for more direct communication on the subject of airline seating. 
"There is a lot of hostility toward fat people on airplanes," said Robert E. Bain of Lorton, Va., a frequent business traveler who retired from SRI International, a California-based research institute. 
"The bottom line is most people are far from being within the boundary of comfort" in any economy-class seat on an airplane, he said. That includes average-size people as well as big ones, he added. 
On Southwest and on most other airlines, space is unforgiving. Depending on the model of the plane, economy-class seats are 17 to 18 inches wide. That's less than the width of most standard desktop computer keyboards.
Mr. Bain's point, that everyone is uncomfortable in economy class to begin with, underscores a tendency to objectify people that is especially pronounced on an airplane, where most passengers fret about cramped conditions anyway.
Southwest's point, which the airline tried to clarify with a lengthy statement intended to quell what it called the "sensationalism" over the issue, is that airlines are low-margin businesses and, increasingly, every seat counts. Last year, on average, "only six seats per aircraft accounted for Southwest Airlines' profit," Colleen Barrett, the president and chief operating officer, said in that statement. 
"Our policy isn't about a person's weight or shape," Ms. Barrett said. "We have no intentions of having scales, sizing templates, measuring tape, etc. That certainly isn't a way to treat people, and we have never considered any such thing."
The policy, she added, simply reiterates one that has been in place since 1980, requiring a customer whose size encroaches on the adjacent seat to buy a second ticket. The furor occurred when Southwest informed its gate and ticket agents that effective tomorrow, when new boarding procedures using electronically issued passes are set to begin, the employees were responsible for enforcing the policy regarding large passengers.
Southwest is trying to counteract "the horrible publicity" generated by news of the policy, said Allen Steadham, the director of the International Size Acceptance Association (www.size-acceptance.org).
"There's a lot of potential here for trouble. First of all, what qualifies a ticket-counter person to make a judgment call for who's going to fly based on their size?" he asked, adding that with a formal policy being enforced, agents who used to use good judgment to accommodate large passengers without a fuss on undersold planes will now be more vigilant about insisting on the purchase of the extra seat.
Aware of the public relations debacle that is generally acknowledged to have accrued to Southwest, a much disliked competitor that is also the only profitable major domestic airline, other airlines have been careful in recent days to emphasize their accommodating attitudes toward large passengers. Otherwise, "we're going to let Southwest have its time in the sun on this one," a rival airline executive said yesterday. 
Many large passengers, especially regular business travelers, routinely book two coach seats anyway. Airlines provide seat-belt extension straps to large people who need them, and in cases where those extensions are inadequate, airlines sometimes quietly ask that person to buy a second seat. But in many other cases, very large passengers are quietly accommodated beside seats that are already empty. 
According to Mr. Steadham, American Airlines, which already has the most spacious economy-class seating in the industry, is particularly known for "not making a big hassle out of it" and finding ways to unobtrusively work with large people on crowded flights, even if it means rebooking them on another less-crowded flight to allow them to have extra room. 
In that regard, there have actually been overall improvements over the years, said Mr. Bain, the retired consultant. Mr. Bain said that he expected the current commotion might in fact impel major airlines to accelerate their discussions with groups representing large people. Among proposals under discussion is one to redesign a row or two with larger seats, perhaps sold at higher prices.
In the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Bain recalled, "I often would be treated with contempt when flying," adding: "I remember flying T.W.A. from the coast to New York all the time. I used to try to buy two seats, but they wouldn't allow you to buy seats that were right next to each other" as a way to discourage heavy people.
William J. Fabrey, the president of Amplestuff.com, a mail-order company in Bearsville, N.Y. that sells travel and other products for large people, said that he was most concerned about the uncertainty that formal policies like Southwest's cause for large people, who often arrive at the airport dreading the travel experience ahead anyway. 
"The bottom line, as I see it, is nobody should be embarrassed when they're boarding a plane," he said.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Company Profits Doubled Last Year, Survey Shows 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
Mortgage company profits about doubled last year as Americans refinanced a record $1.2 trillion in home loans to get the lowest rates in 30 years, according to a survey of lenders. 
 The average pretax net income for making a home loan was $1,212 in 2001, in contrast to a net loss of $37 a loan in 2000, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said. 
That more than made up for a loss of $17 a loan on fees to service, or administer mortgages as old loans were repaid early. 
 "In any refinancing boom we expect to see a profit shift toward production and away from servicing," said Marina Walsh, an analyst with the trade association. "What made last year different was the sheer volume of loans." 
The average pretax net income for mortgage companies rose to $119 million in 2001, from $59 million in 2000, according to the survey of 51 United States companies by the trade group and the Stratmor Group, a mortgage consulting company. The average return on required equity for the companies rose to 31.8 percent, from 15.8 percent. 
Refinancing volume was more than double the old record of $750 million in 1998, Ms. Walsh said. Including loans to purchase homes, $2 trillion was lent in 2001, breaking the 1998 record of $1.5 trillion, Ms. Walsh said.

For OPEC, Watchword Is Wait and See

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna tomorrow, it is likely to decide to do nothing but wait to see what happens to the worldwide demand for oil, industry experts said.
 Yet in such unpredictable times, with one conflict worsening in the Middle East and the rumor of another rising, the 10-member cartel's inaction amounts to a gamble that could send the price of oil rocketing in the coming months. 
 To maximize their revenue without provoking a global recession, most OPEC members want the price of crude oil to stay at around $25 a barrel, the level at which it has been hovering for the last 13 weeks. The Energy Information Administration, the analysis arm of the Energy Department, estimated that global demand for crude oil, at 76.2 million barrels a day, has remained flat the first half of this year, thanks to a warm winter and the lukewarm economic recovery. As a consequence, OPEC, which provides about 35 percent of the world's oil, has all but decided that there is no reason right now to increase its output, industry analysts said. 
In choosing to focus on the short-term price rather than inventory data, however, OPEC risks having oil prices shoot higher if, for example, the summer driving season in the United States leads to a larger-than-expected surge in gasoline consumption or if the Bush administration moves sooner rather than later to attack Iraq.
"When you have a situation in which OPEC is trying to aim for a certain price window at a certain time and demand is coming back, then it gets dangerous," said Yasser Elguindi, a director at Medley Global Advisors, a New York consulting firm. "There are so many different variables out there right now that could send prices higher, like an early harsh winter or if war kicks up."
Mr. Elguindi said that industry experts and economists were debating whether the relatively high price of oil had slowed the economic recovery. "Is oil demand down because we've had high prices or because of extraordinary circumstances like 9/11?" he said. "That hasn't been answered yet. But it seems that high oil prices are helping to choke off some of the demand at the margins."
The cartel has reason to think that current supplies are adequate. It is officially producing 21.7 million barrels a day now. But unofficial production over the quotas is rampant, perhaps as high as 1.5 million barrels a day, according to Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Venezuela, for example, has been selling from storage and producing at least 250,000 barrels more than its official quota of 2.5 million barrels a day, Mr. Goldstein estimated. After nationwide strikes brought the country's oil industry to a standstill this spring and led to a coup and countercoup, Venezuela is scrambling to make up for the oil revenue it lost earlier this year by producing more than its quota.
While some of OPEC's own members are producing more than planned, so are some large oil-producing nations outside the cartel that had agreed to hold down production to keep prices in the mid-$20's range. Russia in particular never really kept its word, and now Russia, Norway and the other non-OPEC countries have formally ended their pledges.
Adding to the abundance of supply is weak demand in Asia, and OPEC is not banking on its quick revival.
"They have made a political decision to react to the market's needs, not anticipate them," Mr. Goldstein said. "We think 9/11 demand will be back and if we have a normal autumn and winter, then we think we will have oil demand grow this winter by 2 percent or higher." OPEC, he warned, may not be ready for such a jump in demand and prices could go up sharply.
The price of oil now also has a war premium factored into it, the cost of jitteriness about what might happen to supplies from the Persian Gulf if the United States began an attack against Iraq. This premium rises and falls with the Bush administration's belligerence toward Saddam Hussein. But the White House appears determined to destabilize Iraq, and industry analysts who have regular contact with administration officials say it is only a matter of time before action is taken.
At a meeting in Beirut this spring, the gulf states publicly embraced the Iraqi leader, apparently sending a message to Washington -- and to the oil markets -- that they would not support an invasion of Iraq. But industry analysts and Middle East experts said that in the "you're with us or you're against us" world articulated by the Bush administration, the major oil producers, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, would very likely and rather quietly support the United States.
"They won't support it at first," said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm. "But at some point, you have no other option than to support the effort. If the Bush administration goes in and you are opposing it and they win, you look stupid."
Most industry experts think that an embargo by the gulf states would be unlikely in the case of an American attack on Iraq. But supplies could be disrupted if there were attacks on tankers, oil fields or ports in the Persian Gulf.
To protect against that, the United States and its allies would have to begin stockpiling crude oil, as well as diesel and jet fuel for the war effort, before any attack is begun, experts said. And much of that help would probably come, however discreetly, from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer and an American ally.

HEADLINE: Town Looks for Luck to Shift as Crews Try to Outwit Fire 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SHOW LOW, Ariz., June 24 

 BODY:
This is a town that was named for a stroke of luck, so maybe the fact it was still standing today is not so surprising.
 Working overnight and all day, fire crews cut lines to the south today and "back burned" an area between the town and the fire, a strategy to protect the largest area of population under siege by the worst forest fire in Arizona history and the biggest in the nation this year. 
 "This has been some of the most climactic fire behavior in the United States in the last 50 years," said Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the Fire Service, describing a ferocious blaze that has crunched through more than 330,000 acres of northern Arizona in the last seven days.
"But we slammed the door on it with a major frontal assault on the back side," Mr. Paxon added, and that provided many people here a glimmer of hope for the first time in days -- strange as that seemed in such a surreal atmosphere. 
Today, the sky here was orange- gray in spots, purple in others, as if some psychedelic smog had rolled in. Air was heavy with the taste and smell of smoke. Ashes fell like snowflakes, and apart from the steady buzz of activity at the fire command center, Show Low was silent.
The town's 8,000 residents had been evacuated, along with 17,000 others from neighboring communities, and streets were deserted. Businesses were shuttered. The only traffic came from fire trucks and law enforcement vehicles. 
But with new teams of firefighters arriving by the hour and the march of the fire slowing a bit, officials expressed optimism that the town could be saved, although they conceded that small "spot fires," caused by falling cinders, could damage or destroy homes.
"A lot of ash is falling," said Jim Clawson, law enforcement liaison for local governments, "but I'm hoping in a couple of days we can get a bottle of Champagne to pop the cork."
Time will tell. What fire officials feared most was that the blaze -- now known as Rodeo-Chediski fire, after separate fires converged on Sunday -- would hook around the fire lines, charge through the back burn and head to town.
Fire lines are wide troughs dug by bulldozers and work crews to clear out trees, shrubs and underbrush. Sunday night, crews ignited the material between a new five-mile line in Cottonwood Canyon, south of town, at a time when the blaze was not moving that way.
By doing that, a crucial defensive tactic, a shift of wind would not provide the fire fuel needed to roar toward Show Low.
Through much of today, the strategy was working. Slowed by softer winds, the fire grew by 39,050 acres on Sunday, compared with 103,450 the day before. It was enough of a stall to allow area residents for the first time in days to start thinking about what they might return to after the fire has passed.
For many, it was not an altogether pleasant thought.
"This hits you right in the heart," said Charles Sprung, a plumbing contractor and the son of a fire chief who worked the lines on Sunday and awaited the return today of his two sons, J. R. and Josh, who were working the lines today.
The Sprungs have lived in Show Low for 26 years. "This has hurt us," Mr. Sprung said. "How many people don't know what they're coming back to? They're going to be devastated. They don't have a clue what this is going to do to our little economy."
Two groups, especially, are certain to be hurt by the fires -- residents of the Show Low area and the 13,000 White Mountain Apaches who live on the reservation to the southwest. So far, the reservation has absorbed about 55 percent of the fire; the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which includes the White Mountains, the rest.
Show Low was named by a local rancher who won a hand of cards in 1876, when his opponent said, "Show low, and you win." The rancher, Croyden E. Cooley, drew a 2 of clubs and, by agreement, won his opponent's ranch and the right to name the town. The main street here is called Deuce of Clubs Drive.
Like generations who followed, Cooley was drawn to the majestic beauty of the place. In recent decades, it has become a strong magnet for tourists, second-home owners and retirees. Revenues from tourism keep the town alive.
Timber mills provide the Apache with much of their revenue. Chief Dallas Massey said today the fire had burned away 160 million board-feet of trees, and that the two mills are closed -- crushing blows to the tribal economy.
"That's major by terms of the effects it will have on us," he said. "We'll be feeling that for years to come now."
For the most part, the Apache and other area residents live in harmony. But not always. Chief Massey said tribe members were preparing last fall to conduct prescribed burns, as they have in the past, in Hop Canyon, an area southwest of Show Low. Neighbors complained because they did not want to smell smoke, he said. So plans were canceled.
When the fire roared through Hop Canyon over the weekend, officials began fearing the worst for Show Low. The fears turned to a mass mobilization of personnel and equipment to save the town, which meant more assets at the southeastern flank to coax the fire into other directions and, today, structural firefighters were assigned to patrol Show Low streets to respond to spot fires.
They became part of a firefighting force that today grew to 2,233 fighters on 60 crews, 52 bulldozers, 108 fire engines, 22 water-carrying vehicles, 8 helicopters and 3 tanker planes.
And more help was on the way. Several crews arrived today, including the Lewis and Clark Hotshots from Great Falls, Mont. A team of 20 members drove for two days to get here, parked their truck and awaited instructions.
For one team member, Matt Stott, 19, this was just his second fire. He pronounced himself "excited, but at the same time a little nervous because this is such a big fire."
Montanans are used to big fires. The biggest ever in American history burned 4 million acres of Montana and Idaho in 1910. Ever since, firefighting has been an especially honorable vocation. And now, Mr. Stott said, more so.
He would never put himself in the same category as "city firefighters," he insisted, particularly those who responded to the World Trade Center attacks last September. "They have a lot tougher job."
But they did him and his co-workers a favor, he said.
"After 9/11, people seem to be more open-minded toward us, more appreciative," Mr. Stott said. "I think they realize that we're out there, putting our necks on the line for them. That's our job."

HEADLINE: Smokers Gasp, Not Just From Cigarettes 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
One state after another is raising cigarette taxes in this year of gaping budget deficits, tapping a source of easy revenue. But the three states in the New York region are going even further, effectively forming a high-tax district of their own.
 If New Jersey raises its tax on each pack of cigarettes to $1.50, a measure that is moving quickly through the Legislature, it will be tied with New York for the nation's highest cigarette tax. Connecticut, at $1.11 a pack, would be No. 5. And in New York City, which will add $1.42 starting Monday, smokers will be paying $7.50 a pack. 
 The tax increases keep most of the region's smokers geographically locked in -- only those who live near Pennsylvania, where the average price of a pack is $3.60, can save much by crossing state borders -- while pushing the average price above $5 a pack. The national average is about $3.75.
But location isn't everything. Smokers can save $20 a carton -- and $40 a carton if they live in New York City -- by buying through the Internet, on Indian reservations, in low-tax states like Virginia and Kentucky or from illegal sources. And assuming that they will, many tax experts and economists say the revenue projections accompanying the new cigarette taxes are disingenuous or erroneous.
For years, state tax officials have been able to predict fairly accurately how many people will quit smoking or turn to other sources after a tax increase, and have adjusted their revenue projections accordingly. But now, at least in New York and New Jersey, the incentive for tax evasion, and the ease of using the Internet to do it, is greater than ever. The question is how many will cheat.
In New Jersey, Gov. James E. McGreevey proposed an increase of 50 cents, to $1.30 a pack, but the figure was raised to 70 cents in the State Assembly, which approved it yesterday. The Senate rejected an amendment matching the raise, but it will be subject to negotiations before a vote on the bill.
State officials' projections anticipate a drop in cigarette sales of about 15 percent. If sales remained steady, the proposed tax increase to $1.50 a pack would bring in $338 million, but the state projects $275 million in new revenue.
In Washington State, which raised its tax to $1.42 from 82 cents on Jan. 1 and is now second to New York State in the price of cigarettes, sales have dropped about 17 percent, said Bret Bertolin, the senior forecaster at the state's economic forecasting council. The council has projected a 19 percent decline for the year, Mr. Bertolin said.
Most Washington residents live too far from state borders to shop in Oregon or Idaho, though convenience stores there have reported a boom in cigarette sales, and state officials doubt that many smokers have quit. Rather, they guess, most of the missing sales have gone to Indian reservations, where cigarettes are sold free of any taxes, or to Internet vendors.
New York State's most recent increase, to $1.50 a pack from $1.11, was less drastic than Washington's, and tax officials say it is too early to tell what effect the increase has had since it took effect in April. Gov. George E. Pataki projected that it would raise $251 million.
Robert L. Shepherd, the former deputy commissioner for tax enforcement in New York State, said he expected growing Internet sales. "Instead of purchasing a carton for $70 in New York City or $50 in Trenton, you get it for $30 over the Net," he said.
Mr. Shepherd said smuggling would increase, too, with "guys putting a few cartons in a gym bag and selling on the street, $3 or $4 a pack."
Mr. Shepherd, a lawyer who now represents distributors who supply convenience stores with cigarettes, among other goods, predicts that the $1.50 tax will actually cost the state money. He cites the example of Canada, which imposed a $5-a-pack tax in 1991 and lost most of its sales to smuggling. Tax collections increased when the tax was halved three years later.
"I think with $1.50 they'll pass the tipping point, yes." Mr. Shepherd said of the New York tax.
A report last year by Forrester Research, a Boston-based market research company, projected that by 2005 the Internet would account for 14 percent of cigarette sales. The report predicted that states with the highest taxes, like New York and California, would eventually lower their rates to keep up revenues.
Others are skeptical of such claims. Marc Carey, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, said that agents had seen no notable increase in smuggling since April.
Kurt M. Ribisl a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina, said that no state tax increase had ever caused a decline in revenue. A survey taken after a 50-cent cigarette-tax increase in California three years ago showed that only 5 percent of buyers had turned to no-tax or low-tax sources.
Nonetheless, Mr. Ribisl said that tax evasion would rise and that Internet sales would account for much of it. In a study he published last year, Mr. Ribisl found 88 Internet vendors, 49 of them on Indian reservations. In updating the survey this year, he found 195 vendors.
Those sellers are largely beyond official tracking systems, and certainly bootleggers are. A federal law requires mail-order merchants to report the names of buyers to the buyers' states, but few do, and the law is rarely enforced. Buyers are required to report purchases from Indian reservations or Internet sellers and immediately pay the state tax; when asked if anyone ever does this, Mr. Shepherd replied: "Never. Never."
Whatever the wisdom of the tax increases as fiscal or law enforcement policy, many public health advocates say the less calculable benefit of discouraging smoking justifies any tax increase.
Professor Ribisl said tax increases consistently cut consumption, even if smuggling did rise. And when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed raising New York City's tax, he said his principal goal was deterring teenagers from smoking. "The numbers are clear," he said. "You raise cigarette taxes, the kids smoke less."
By and large, the rest of the country agrees. This year 10 states have raised taxes. Massachusetts is considering overtaking New York with a tax increase to $1.51 a pack, and in Pennsylvania the governor has proposed raising the tax to $1.
Still, a few states hold out. A proposal to raise Delaware's 24-cent tax has died in the Legislature, and Virginia refuses to budge from 2 1/2 cents.
"They tried to raise it by a penny -- a penny!" said David Brunori, a lawyer and contributing editor to the journal State Tax Notes and a Virginia resident. "And the Legislature said, 'Oh, come on, that's not fair,' and defeated it. A penny!"

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Tax Credits For Ground-Zero Jobs 

BYLINE:  By Stacy Albin (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that small businesses in Lower Manhattan that continued operating after the Sept. 11 terror attack are eligible for tax credits for employing others. 
The plan calls for companies to receive up to $2,400 in tax credits for each part- and full-time employee. Citing a recent tax code change, the I.R.S. announced yesterday that companies that operated on or south of Canal Street until the attack, and that currently employed no more than 200 employees, were eligible.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Wheeze, New York Shudder 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
The worry ricocheting through the New York region's transportation agencies yesterday was that if push came to shove in Amtrak's fight for emergency help from the government, the railroad would not just shut down its own trains, it would park them in the tunnels under Pennsylvania Station.
 Whether or not such a threat was really uttered in the talks in Washington between Amtrak and Bush administration officials, the very idea points up the little-known but enormously important place Amtrak occupies at the heart of the unwieldy thicket of interconnected agencies that make up the metropolitan area's railroad network. 
 Amtrak's trump card, in effect, is its real estate. As the owner of Pennsylvania Station, the tracks beneath it and the tunnels leading to it from Queens and New Jersey, Amtrak has its hand on a spigot controlling a flow of 1,100 trains and more than 300,000 passengers into and out of Manhattan each day. 
The largest contributor to that flow is the Long Island Rail Road, which moves 550 trains and 235,000 people to and from Penn Station daily. That railroad leases tunnels and tracks from Amtrak but employs its own dispatchers, electricians and track workers, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
For that reason, Mr. Kelly said, the Long Island would have the "technical capacity" to operate if Amtrak shut down. But he acknowledged that Amtrak would still have to grant permission. "If they don't," he said, "then you've got another problem."
The Long Island Rail Road has had longstanding contingency plans for responding to strikes by Amtrak workers, Mr. Kelly said. Those plans include running buses along the railroad's routes and running trains to stations with easy connections to the New York City subway system.
Though the Long Island Rail Road is bigger, the New Jersey Transit rail system is more vulnerable to an Amtrak shutdown, said James P. Fox, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation. Not only does Amtrak own the tunnels and much of the track on which New Jersey commuter trains run, he said, but Amtrak operates them, in exchange for a fee. So an Amtrak shutdown would make it impossible for New Jersey Transit to operate throughout most of its rail system.
A shutdown would idle 56 percent of New Jersey Transit's trains, affecting 82,000 commuters, or three of every four of its riders, Mr. Fox said.
The result would be chaos for the transportation network and for the regional economy, he said.
"I don't know how you plan for that," Mr. Fox said. "It'd be dishonest to tell the public there's a contingency plan you could put in effect that could mitigate that."
Mr. Fox said New Jersey Transit did not have enough buses to absorb more than 80,000 extra passengers. "It would take me 1,200 buses," he said. "First of all, we don't have 1,200 buses. And even if we go to the private sector, there aren't 1,200 buses to be had." 
Commuters in Westchester County and Connecticut would be far less affected by an Amtrak shutdown. Unlike the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad owns its track, and charges Amtrak a fee to use it, said Dan Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman. 
Mr. Brucker said an Amtrak shutdown would cost Metro-North about $850,000 a year it now receives as an incentive for on-time performance by Amtrak trains. But the only noticeable effect for commuters, he said, would be overcrowding on Metro-North's Port Jervis and Pascack Valley lines, which end in Hoboken and thus would most likely draw displaced New Jersey Transit riders.
In Connecticut, Amtrak operates the Shore Line East, a little-traveled commuter line that carries about 1,200 passengers a day between New Haven and New London, said Harry Harris, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation. A contingency plan calls for buses to replace the six or seven three-car trains that run daily, he said.
Mr. Harris said that some freight trains ran on Amtrak lines between New Haven and Springfield, Mass., but that there were no contingency plans to handle that traffic.

HEADLINE: United Wants Loan Backing From U.S.; 
<BY L>By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
United Airlines filed an application with the government yesterday for a $1.8 billion guarantee to back $2 billion in private loans, the largest such request since the Sept. 11 attacks crippled the industry.
 United, the country's second-largest carrier after American, is the biggest of eight applicants in the $10 billion loan guarantee program that was set up by Congress last fall. Officials of the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which administers the program, have said they want to see stringent business plans that show an ability to repay loans. 
 United submitted a plan that calls for cutting more than $950 million from labor costs over three years as well as forming a partnership with US Airways in which they would share revenue by booking passengers on each other's flights.
Executives at the UAL Corporation, the parent of United, said yesterday that they were close to completing such a partnership but that the agreement was subject to approval by the pilots' unions at both carriers. 
United said it needed the loan guarantee to help lift its cash reserves, which were $2.9 billion at the end of last quarter. But its application is expected to raise concern. It is likely to win some political sympathy because of its extensive route network and the fact that two of its jets were hijacked and destroyed on Sept. 11. But several industry experts say the government should not help out the airline unless it absolutely cannot obtain private financing. 
There are also serious doubts about United's ability to remake itself successfully because two of its largest unions have balked at concessions, and the union that has tentatively agreed to cost cuts -- the pilots -- says it will go along with the plan only if all employee groups contribute.
"United is the perfect candidate for the A.T.S.B. program," John W. Creighton Jr., United's chief executive, said in a written statement yesterday. "It was created to help carriers weather the liquidity challenges associated with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our nation. United was both a target and a victim of the attacks."
Jake Brace, the chief financial officer, said yesterday in a conference call: "Our access to capital markets is sure a whole lot different than it was last August."
The company reported losses of $510 million last quarter and $2.1 billion last year, the largest annual loss in the history of the industry. Two months ago, its cash was draining away at just under $5 million a day. United has had to turn to more nontraditional sources of credit, like Boeing, Airbus and high-yield financing companies, Mr. Brace said.
Some industry experts argue that the government should not give United a loan guarantee until the carrier has exhausted all its other avenues.
"It's not obvious why you should be a convenient lender for someone who can get private financing," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who teaches on government regulation at the Yale Law School. "They're not in immediate danger, and they have a substantial amount of liquidity left."
United's competitors have mixed reactions. Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental Airlines, said the government should definitely not give backing to United. Leo F. Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, said United should be considered an "appropriate candidate" but that the government should only give out a loan guarantee with tougher conditions than those imposed by commercial lenders.
The stabilization board recently rejected applications from two smaller airlines. Last December, it gave $380 billion in backing to America West but demanded the right to buy 30 percent of the company's stock. Analysts say the government probably would not ask as much from United because the carrier has more assets to put up as collateral.
"We think that given the fact that United was directly impacted by Sept. 11, and also the fact that United is such a large employer, we think that at this point they are likely to receive a loan guarantee," said Susan M. Donofrio, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "But the winds of Washington can certainly change on a dime."
When the bailout package totaling $15 billion was put together last fall, politicians overwhelmingly backed it because of fears that several large airlines could go into bankruptcy, hobbling the nation's economy and transportation network.
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said yesterday that Mr. Creighton called him last week to tell him United, which is based in Chicago, would apply for a loan guarantee. He added that he would write a letter of support to the stabilization board if United asked for one.
"Frankly, I think they're critical to the recovery of our national economy, not to mention our state economy," said Senator Durbin, who is also supporting a bill, backed by United, to expand O'Hare airport. 
Betsy Holahan, a spokeswoman for the stabilization board, said there was no timetable for a decision. Staff members will review the application before giving it to the three-member voting panel, comprising one representative each from the Federal Reserve Board and the Transportation and Treasury Departments. Mr. Brace said United made a presentation to the stabilization board's staff members last week and would soon talk to them about timing.
United has been working steadily the last couple weeks to reach concession agreements with its unions. Leaders of the pilots' union tentatively agreed to an immediate 10 percent wage cut that would be offset by raises averaging 7.9 percent from 2003 to 2005. The flight attendants and the machinists have refused to back down, and both unions said yesterday's filing would not make a difference in their positions.
"We can't talk concessions until they bring our pay up to the top of the industry like the rest of the world," said Bobbie Pilkington, secretary-treasurer of the United chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants.
The pilots' concessions, worth $520 million over three years, take effect only if other unions accept cuts.
"There's nothing in these concessions that will make United a more competitive carrier," said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It's just incremental cash flow to get these loan guarantees. What they truly need to do is make big changes to their business model."
An increased use of regional jets is crucial to the recovery plan, Mr. Brace said, as is a partnership with US Airways, which filed an application on June 10 for a $900 million federal loan guarantee. Last July, the Justice Department blocked a proposed merger of the two carriers. Federal officials could soon be asked to approve a code-sharing alliance, which allows the competing carriers to share revenue by booking passengers on each other's flights.
"We're quite close on the commercial agreement," said Greg Taylor, senior vice president for planning at United. "The issue is really to wrap up the union agreements."
US Airways has said that it is talking to all its competitors except Delta about a code-sharing alliance. It said yesterday that it was deferring payments on some aircraft while it tried to put together a revamping plan. But the deferrals could lead to a series of defaults and payment demands, it said, and that could ultimately force the airline to seek bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: Two Feuding Indian Tribes Are Recognized, but as One 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., June 24 

 BODY:
The Bureau of Indian Affairs granted federal recognition today to the Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes, a determination that will give tribe members access to an array of new government benefits as well as economic opportunities including the possibility of casino gambling.
 But in a twist, the bureau recognized the two Connecticut groups, which have long feuded with each other, as a single entity -- "the historical Eastern Pequot Tribe, of the Lantern Hill Reservation, North Stonington, Connecticut." This decision means that the two groups will have to reach an agreement to govern themselves as one. 
 The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who has long opposed federal recognition of the tribes, said that he would fight today's decision. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of the Department of the Interior, and the state has 30 days in which to appeal to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, an administrative body. 
"Our first impression is that this decision seems to defy fairness, law and fact," Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat, said at a joint news conference with United State Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican. "This decision only enhances my commitment to reform the system."
Applying for federal tribal recognition is a complex process that requires proof that the group has been continuously identified as a tribe since colonial times, that it was a distinct community, and that it has maintained authority over its members, who must be proved descendants. In March 2000, the Indian Affairs bureau recommended recognition for both groups, saying they met the criteria.
But in his final decision issued today, the assistant secretary for Indian affairs, Neal A. McCaleb, said that the historical evidence demonstrated conclusively that there had been one tribe, not two. "The final determination finds that there is a single tribe composed of both petitioners," the bureau said in a statement.
The Eastern Pequots began pursuing federal recognition in 1979. In 1990, a group of Paucatuck Eastern Pequot members began pursuing federal recognition on their own. The dispute between the two groups has centered on which represents the true descendants of the original Pequot tribe, which was nearly wiped out by war in the 17th century.
"After the Pequot War of 1637, the surviving Pequots were temporarily placed under the supervision of tribes allied with the English," the bureau said in its statement. "Those Pequots whom the colonial government removed from the supervision of the Eastern Niantic sachem Ninigret in 1654 were subsequently governed by two Indian rulers: Harmon Garrett and Momoho. The Colony of Connecticut purchased the Lantern Hill land for Momoho's Pequots in 1683. Since then there has been an unbroken history of state recognition and a reservation for this tribe."
At a news conference tonight, the chief of the Eastern Pequots, James A. Cunha Jr., said that tribe members were thrilled. He said he believed the two tribes could put aside their differences to enjoy the benefits of federal recognition. "Can we get along?" he said, when asked about the differences between the two groups. "Yeah, we can get along." He said officials from the two tribes would meet within the next several days.
The acting deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs, Aurene Martin, said in an interview that Connecticut's own recognition of the tribe was a major factor in granting federal recognition. "The two petitioners live on the same state-created reservation and have lived there continuously since 1680," she said. "They have common ancestry. Their recent disagreements with each other are just that: disagreements." She added, "The split seems to really have occurred in or about 1973."
Officials said it would take a long time, perhaps years, before the recognition of the tribe might result in any new casinos in Connecticut. The two other tribes in Connecticut with federal recognition operate highly successful casinos: the Mashantucket Pequots run Foxwoods and the Mohegans run the Mohegan Sun Casino. 
Ms. Martin said that federal officials would help the Eastern and Paucatuck tribes settle their differences.

HEADLINE: Saudi Effort To Revive Gas Deal Is Reported 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, June 24 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia is showing renewed interest in breaking the logjam holding up a landmark deal with eight major oil companies that would reopen the kingdom to foreign investment. 
 Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's effective ruler and the plan's champion, told Philip B. Watts, the chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, and Lee R. Raymond of Exxon Mobil, in separate meetings over the weekend, that the team of ministers hammering out the Saudi side of the deal would reconvene within two weeks, people in the industry and oil analysts said today. 
 Negotiations over the $25 billion, 20-year deal to develop natural gas resources could then recommence by the end of the summer, they said. 
Since the preliminary agreement was signed with great fanfare in June 2001, the two sides have missed two announced deadlines for a more definitive deal. They hit impasses over the share of revenue sought by the oil giants and over guarantees for additional gas reserves to run the water, power and desalinization plants the companies had tentatively committed themselves to build. 
Industry analysts say the unusual deal has suffered in part because of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The crown prince and the foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, have been distracted by the kingdom's peace initiative, and other Saudi officials, particularly Ali Naimi, the oil minister, who worked his way up through Aramco, the state oil company, have been reluctant to make any concessions to the oil companies. 
"In a sense, it was much more an institutional battle than an economic battle," said Fareed Mohamedi, the chief economist at the Petroleum Finance Company. "The institution of Aramco gets unnerved by all these oil companies coming close to its crown jewels."
Some analysts said the government might not have wanted to sign a major deal welcoming in foreign oil companies at a time of open public hostility toward the United States, nor at a time of criticism by Osama bin Laden and his followers over the presence of foreign troops in the holy land of Islam. 
But Saudi officials adamantly deny any direct link between delays in the gas deal and differences with the United States over Middle East policy. They have said repeatedly that their oil will be treated as strictly a commercial question, not a political weapon. 
Despite the difficult negotiations, oil company officials, industry analysts and diplomats expect a deal to go through ultimately, even if the twists in Middle East violence again distract the government. 
The kingdom intended the gas deal as a showpiece to advertise its openness to foreign investment. To let it fall apart now would send a negative signal at a time when the country desperately needs new private-sector jobs to alleviate unemployment estimated at 15 percent.
"If it does not go ahead, other companies looking at Saudi Arabia will say that if an oil company can't make it in Saudi Arabia, what chance do I have?" said Brad Bourland, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank. 
The energy giants, on the other hand, would find it hard to walk away from Saudi Arabia, where they were eased out of the oil business more than 20 years ago. The government has stated repeatedly that the gas deal will never regain them access to crude oil, but the idea remains too tantalizing to abandon lightly. 
The deal's odd nature has caused some of the delay. "It's a very different concept than has ever been tried before; usually you discover gas first and then build the downstream projects," said Walid Khadduri, an analyst with The Middle East Economic Survey.
Oil companies usually get 15 to 20 percent of revenue in gas development projects, to compensate them for the risk of exploration, and they are seeking similar terms in Saudi Arabia.
But in this deal, they also want those terms to apply to the downstream gas-using utilities they would build and run, and there the Saudi side has balked. Analysts said the recent rebound in oil prices has given Aramco and the Ministry of Oil breathing room to reshape the deal.
Saudi officials say that 8 or 9 percent is typical for utility projects in the region, and are somewhat weary of the oil companies pleading poverty when oil prices are hovering around $25 a barrel. If the oil companies stick to their demands for 10 to 12 percent, the Saudis have hinted, they may reopen bidding on the deal.
The Saudi side also asserts that the companies' demand for proven reserves for the utilities means they are trying to eliminate the risk that they nonetheless want to be compensated for with a fat return percentage.
"The companies are really bargaining for the minimum investment and exploration," one Saudi official said. "Instead, they want to take gas in large quantity that was already discovered by Aramco. They want to minimize their risk or not take any risk in terms of exploration and have a good return downstream."
The oil companies are concerned about becoming utility companies, especially given that Saudi Arabia has, for example, a patchwork of water companies and no unified rate for water bills. Analysts said they were also wary about depending on Aramco to make up any shortfall in gas, because the company's past emphasis on crude means some Saudi petrochemical plants already suffer from delivery shortfalls.
The Saudis say the whole point of the deal was to get the oil companies and not the Saudi treasury to pay the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to explore for gas. The Saudi government does not want to raise utility prices for consumers, nor to subsidize the companies' revenue demands from its depleted treasury.
"We want a fair deal, a good deal, where we feel comfortable," said Ibrahim al-Muhanna, the spokesman for the Ministry of Oil. "We want to serve our national economic interests and at the same time give the companies a reasonable return."
Exxon Mobil is the group leader for two projects under the deal. Its partners in the $15 billion South Ghawar project include Shell, BP and Phillips; a $5 billion project on the northern Red Sea coast will be divided with Occidental and Marathon.
Shell is the lead partner on the third of the deal's three main projects, a $5 billion venture in the south shared with TotalFinaElf and Conoco.

HEADLINE: Washington's Slow Pace in Trade Talks Annoys the Chileans 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile 

 BODY:
The United States first began wooing Chile as a free-trade partner more than a decade ago, only to back away when it came time to commit. Now the courtship has resumed, but American negotiators are finding to their chagrin that not only are they just one of many suitors, but they may no longer even be the preferred partner.
 Reflecting the new pecking order, President Ricardo Lagos went to Spain in May to sign a sweeping accord that establishes the European Union as Chile's closest economic and political ally. From start to finish, the negotiations took less than three years. 
 "We always thought an agreement with the United States would come before one with Europe," said Ronald Bown Fernandez, president of the Chilean Exporters Association. "Europe, after all, is 15 countries trying to speak as one. But after a dozen years of promises and nothing more from the Americans, both the government and the private sector here are disillusioned."
The agreement with the Europeans goes into effect on Jan. 1 and includes both trade and political components. Tariffs on nearly 90 percent of Chilean exports are to be eliminated immediately, with the rest to be removed over the next seven years.
In contrast, negotiations with the United States, revived in December 2000, are once again stalled. During an interview here, Mr. Lagos recalled that when he first met George W. Bush more than a year ago, "he told me that we would have an agreement by December -- well, we're a little bit behind schedule."
With barely 15 million people, Chile has a relatively small economy, about one-half of 1 percent of that of the United States. But the Bush administration is formally committed to achieving a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005, and Chile's neighbors see the negotiations with Chile as a test case.
Having been rather unceremoniously jilted once before, Chilean leaders are understandably skeptical about any timetable the United States proposes. Mr. Bush's father initiated trade talks with Chile in 1990, and after the Clinton administration secured congresional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Chile was told its admission would not be long in coming.
"We were invited to the party, and when we arrived, they said to us, 'We're not ready, but when we are, you'll be the first in line,' " said Felipe Larrain, a professor of economics at the Catholic University of Chile. "Well, here we are now in 2002 and we're still not in."
Since 1994 Chile has negotiated free-trade accords with both Canada and Mexico, begun talks with several Pacific Rim nations and become an associate member of Mercosur, the South American trade union. But it is the deal with the European Union, which has already surpassed the United States as Chile's principal trading partner and source of investment, that presents the strongest challenge to traditional American economic domination of the region.
More than any country in Latin America, Chile "is a country that has made all the right decisions and taken all the economic steps we would have urged them to take" toward an open economy, said William R. Brownfield, the American ambassador. Unsuccessful negotiations here, he acknowledged, would leave the rest of Latin America wondering: "If we cannot reach a free trade agreement with Chile, whom could we reach a free-trade agreement with in the Western Hemisphere?"
From the Chilean point of view, one of the main impediments has been the failure of the American Congress to grant "trade-promotion authority" to either the Clinton or the Bush administration. That "fast track" negotiating tool prevents Congress from altering any proposed accord once the White House submits it for a vote. In March, more than half the members of the United States Senate, weighing in on their feelings about the talks, signed a letter demanding that Chile open its markets further to American products. 
Prospects for a quick conclusion of the trade talks have also been clouded by the Bush administration's decision to invoke antidumping measures against foreign steel producers and by passage of an agriculture bill that grants $180 billion in subsidies to American farmers, who see Chilean fruit, wine and lumber producers as tough rivals.
"These are not exactly signals that point in the direction of free trade," Mr. Lagos said. Since Chile has both the lowest tariffs in Latin America and the highest growth rate over the past decade, Chileans feel that the time has come for the United States to practice what it preaches.
The accord with Europe, Chilean officials maintain, offers free trade and more. The political component in particular, they say, brings Chile as close to being a member of Europe as is possible for a country on the other side of the world.
"We see this accord as a sign of confidence in our policies and our institutions," said Osvaldo Rosales, the Foreign Ministry's chief trade negotiator. "An agreement with the United States continues to be a central priority," he continued, but "globalization doesn't wait." 
Ambassador Brownfield estimated that the two sides have "worked their way through about 75 percent of the issues." But the questions that remain are the most difficult, including agriculture, labor and the environment.
"I think we will still have a free-trade agreement, and I think we will have it by the end of this year," Mr. Brownfield said. "But both sides are going to have to make some tough decisions to bring this to conclusion."
Mr. Lagos begs to differ. "The ball is in the American court," he said.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
G.E. Is Selling Off Most of Electronic Commerce Business

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
General Electric said yesterday that it would sell 90 percent of GE Global eXchange Services, its electronic commerce unit, to Francisco Partners, a buyout firm in Menlo Park, Calif. 
 The deal, valued at $800 million, is expected to give G.E. a pretax profit of about $500 million. 
 The move did not surprise analysts. "Basically, the unit operates a computer network, and that's not a core competency for G.E.," said Martin A. Sankey of Goldman, Sachs, who rates G.E. stock a buy. 
Others noted that Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman, had been quite open about his wish to exit older businesses -- including lighting and appliances -- in which G.E. no longer has a technological edge.
Global eXchange Services, which started in 1965 as a business selling time-sharing services on mainframe computers, currently handles online buying and selling operations for the 100,000 or so business units of about 30,000 multinational companies.
"G.E. wants to help customers use digital technology, but it doesn't want to run online auctions for them," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities who also has G.E. on his buy list.
Global eXchange is not a fast-growth businesses. It had revenue of $602 million in 2001, down from $640 million the previous year. David Frail, a G.E. spokesman, said that the company sold a few of its own operations this year. Thus, he said, sales are on track for about $500 million this year, while earnings will be $50 million to $75 million. 
"G.E., like so many industrial companies, has discovered how difficult it really is to generate stellar returns from e-commerce," said Robert Friedman, an analyst with S&P Equity Research who has a hold rating on G.E. stock.
Still, the sale seems to run counter to G.E.'s goal, first stated by John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman, and often reiterated by Mr. Immelt, to reap ever more revenues from services. Mr. Frail insisted that G.E. wanted only to sell services that were adjuncts to other G.E. products -- say, maintenance contracts for aircraft engines. "Global eXchange can be taken to the next level a lot better by a company that focuses on Internet technologies," he said. 
He gets no argument from Harvey F. Seegers, president of Global eXchange Services. He said G.E. gave his tiny unit short shrift when capital investment dollars were handed out. Moreover, he said his attempts to attract top talent were stymied because he could not offer equity. 
Mr. Seegers, who will remain with Global eXchange, said he expected Francisco to take the company public in three to five years and to distribute stock options to crucial employees immediately. "We can now bill ourselves as a half-billion-dollar start-up with earnings and cash flow and other economic fundamentals that distinguish us significantly from the competitive pack," he said.
By the time it goes public, Global eXchange may be much bigger. David Stanton, a partner in Francisco, said his firm might, through acquisitions, build a larger e-commerce company around the G.E. unit. 
"This is a perfect deal, one that lets us sleep well tonight and eat well tomorrow," Mr. Stanton said. "This business has predictability, stability and resilience, and it has lots of growth potential." 
In fact, the sale may benefit G.E. in ways having little to do with electronic marketplaces. Many analysts expect G.E. to exit some low-return leasing and insurance businesses. They say the $500 million gain will offset any charges it incurs from closing other units.
"A half-billion gain gives them flexibility to do some restructuring," said Mr. Heymann of Prudential.
G.E. acknowledges the soundness of the theory, if not the fact. "We are evaluating a number of possible actions at certain businesses," Mr. Frail said, "and they will likely require restructurings in the second half of this year."
Investors seemed to read little into the news. G.E. shares moved with the market, rising 65 cents, to $29.60.

HEADLINE: Better Welfare Reform 

 BODY:
With the welfare reforms of 1996 expiring, Congress must build on the successes of the past while fixing the problems created six years ago. Tomorrow the Senate Finance Committee will take up a bill proposed by its chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, that improves greatly on the punitive welfare measure passed earlier this year in the House. It increases financing for child care for welfare recipients and it backs away from the harsh new work requirements of the House bill. The senators should increase child care financing still further. It should also expand welfare assistance and health benefits to legal immigrants. 
 Current law requires 50 percent of welfare recipients to work up to 30 hours a week, with some exceptions for hardship. The House called for a work requirement of 40 hours a week, a proposal that would create grave difficulties for poor women wrestling with lack of transportation and child care. Mr. Baucus's proposal would keep the 30-hour requirement and add money for child care, although not nearly enough. The bill would also require the states to get 70 percent of their recipients to work -- an unrealistic goal given the sluggish economy and the lack of money for support services. 
 The bill's other potential problem relates to the need to reverse one of the grave injustices of the 1996 law, which stripped legal immigrants of welfare benefits. Legal immigrants are frequently the parents of American citizens or children who will become citizens later. It makes no sense to deprive them of help to meet their basic needs. The Bush administration endorsed giving legal immigrants food stamps. Although the House bill ignores them completely, legal immigrants should be entitled to welfare benefits and to Medicaid and child health benefits as well.
Measures to extend benefits to the poor and provide child care for parents struggling to hold jobs are widely opposed in Congress because they allegedly cost too much. Yet some the same people opposing these measures favor tax cuts, including estate tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. There is one word to describe their priorities: disgraceful. A society that wants to encourage work should be a society that provides its neediest population with the means to reach that goal.

Israel stepped up its West Bank offensive, killing six Palestinians with a missile strike on suspected militants in the Gaza Strip and encircling Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah. A11

The spiritual leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said a new Israeli operation against Hamas and Mr. Arafat's placing him under house arrest would not halt suicide bombings. A11

A CNN executive apologized in Israel for CNN's giving more attention to the statements of a suicide bomber's mother than to the parents of one of his victims. The executive's visit was also prompted by Ted Turner's remark that both sides in the conflict could be considered terrorists. A11

Salvador Torture Trial in Florida
Dr. Juan Romagoza singled out Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a retired general from El Salvador, saying he believed that General Vides interrogated him during 24 days of torture by El Salvador's military more than two decades ago. General Vides and another retired general, Carlos Guillermo Garcia, are being sued under the Torture Victims Protection Act by Dr. Romagoza and two other people. A8

Yugoslav General Dismissed

Justices Strengthen Role Of Juries in Capital Cases
Juries rather than judges must make the crucial factual determinations that subject a convicted murderer to the death penalty, the Supreme Court ruled, 7 to 2. The decision invalidated the death penalty laws of five states and cast doubt on the laws of four others. Nearly 800 people are on death row in the nine states where judges ultimately determine sentences. A1

Workers Battle With Wal-Mart
Current and former Wal-Mart workers say their managers, under pressure to hold down costs, often force or press employees to work hours that are not recorded or paid. The accusations are at the heart of a legal battle spanning 28 states. A1

Providence Mayor Convicted
A federal jury in Rhode Island found Vincent A. Cianci Jr., 61, guilty of a racketeering conspiracy charge stemming from the prosecutors' contention that a criminal enterprise operated out of his City Hall office. He could receive up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He was acquitted of 11 other charges. A14

Pledge to Keep Trains Running
The Bush administration pledged to keep Amtrak running beyond a threatened shutdown deadline tomorrow, but without a clear plan to supply the railroad with cash, Amtrak officials did not pull back from the brink of a halt. A1

Senate Logjam Threatened
Senator John McCain, irked by F.E.C. rulings he believes will undermine campaign-finance legislation he helped sponsor, said he would work to block all nominations before the Senate until a new member was appointed to the six-member elections panel. A19

Drug Costs Surpass Inflation
A consumer group, Families USA, said prices of the 50 drugs most often prescribed for elderly people rose an average of 7.8 percent last year, compared with the 2.8 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index. A19

Mr. Louima's testimony echoed previous appearances on the stand, while the defense sought to show that Mr. Schwarz was the victim of mistaken identity. B1

Officers' Convictions Restored
A federal appeals court reinstated conspiracy convictions against five Orange, N.J., police officers convicted in the beating and pepper spraying of a man who died in police custody in 1999. The judge had voided the jury's guilty verdicts. B1

Search for Bodies Ends
The Fire Department officially ended its effort to recover human remains in the vicinity of ground zero, as a crew of four firefighters carefully supervised the collection of the last bags of possible body parts from a bank building next to the site of trade center's twin towers. A1

The Higher Cost of Smoking
Smokers in New York City on Monday will be looking at $7.50-a-pack cigarettes, partly because of a new city tax. Smokers in New Jersey and Connecticut are not faring much better, as governments there and elsewhere look to offset budget deficits with higher taxes on tobacco. B5

HEADLINE: The Reality Thing 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You can say this about the Bush administration: where others might see problems, it sees opportunities.
 A slump in the economy was an opportunity to push a tax cut that provided very little stimulus in the short run, but will place huge demands on the budget in 2010. An electricity shortage in California was an opportunity to push for drilling in Alaska, which would have produced no electricity and hardly any oil until 2013 or so. An attack by lightly armed terrorist infiltrators was an opportunity to push for lots of heavy weapons and a missile defense system, just in case Al Qaeda makes a frontal assault with tank divisions or fires an ICBM next time. 
 President George H. W. Bush once confessed that he was somewhat lacking in the "vision thing." His son's advisers don't have that problem: they have a powerful vision for America's future. In that future, we have recently learned, the occupant of the White House will have the right to imprison indefinitely anyone he chooses, including U.S. citizens, without any judicial process or review. But they are rather less interested in the reality thing.
For the distinctive feature of all the programs the administration has pushed in response to real problems is that they do little or nothing to address those problems. Problems are there to be used to pursue the vision. And a problem that won't serve that purpose, whether it's the collapse of confidence in corporate governance or the chaos in the Middle East, is treated as an annoyance to be ignored if possible, or at best addressed with purely cosmetic measures. Clearly, George W. Bush's people believe that real-world problems will solve themselves, or at least won't make the evening news, because by pure coincidence they will be pre-empted by terror alerts.
But real problems, if not dealt with, have a way of festering. In the last few weeks, a whole series of problems seem to have come to a head. Yesterday's speech notwithstanding, Middle East policy is obviously adrift. The dollar and the stock market are plunging, threatening an already shaky economic recovery. Amtrak has been pushed to the edge of shutdown, because it couldn't get the administration's attention. And the federal government itself is about to run out of money, because House Republicans are unwilling to face reality and increase the federal debt limit. (This avoidance thing seems to be contagious.)
So now would be a good time to do what the White House always urges its critics to do -- put partisanship aside. Will Mr. Bush be willing to set aside, even for a day or two, his drive to consolidate his political base, and actually do something that wasn't part of his preconceived agenda? Oh, never mind.
I think that most commentators missed the point of the story about Mr. Bush's commencement speech at Ohio State, the one his aide said drew on the thinking of Emily Dickinson, Pope John Paul II, Aristotle and Cicero, among others. Of course the aide's remarks were silly -- but they gave us an indication of the level of sycophancy that Mr. Bush apparently believes to be his due. Next thing you know we'll be told that Mr. Bush is also a master calligrapher, and routinely swims across the Yangtze River. And nobody will dare laugh: just before Mr. Bush gave his actual, Aristotle-free speech, students at Ohio State were threatened with expulsion and arrest if they heckled him. 
It's interesting to note that the planned Department of Homeland Security, while of dubious effectiveness in its announced purpose, will be protected against future Colleen Rowleys: the new department will be exempted from both whistle-blower protection and the Freedom of Information Act.
But back to the festering problems: on the economic side, this is starting to look like the most dangerous patch for the nation and the world since the summer of 1998. Back then, luckily, our economic policy was run by smart people who were prepared to learn from their mistakes. Can you say the same about this administration?
As I've noted before, the Bush administration has an infallibility complex: it never, ever, admits making a mistake. And that kind of arrogance tends, eventually, to bring disaster. You can read all about it in Aristotle.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Clear Terms, Murky Future

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
Since October, President Bush has been saying more explicitly than any previous president that he believes in the principle of a Palestinian state, one that could live side by side with Israel in peace and security.
 Today, however, after a week of renewed Palestinian suicide bombings, Mr. Bush declared the price of statehood for 4.5 million Palestinians, and it will be high: the removal of Yasir Arafat as the Palestinian leader. 
 Once that occurs, and "with intensive effort by all," Mr. Bush said, an agreement to create such a state, with an elected leadership, a rule of law, and an open economy "could be reached within three years from now, and I and my country will actively lead toward that goal." 
With this address, Mr. Bush opened a new period of American diplomacy in the Middle East that immediately raised the question of whether it can succeed, since it defers indefinitely the political negotiations that Palestinians, backed by Arab leaders, have been demanding to end Israel's occupation of the West Bank and to reach a final settlement on statehood. An important question is whether Mr. Arafat, whom Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel would like to exile and Mr. Bush would like to remove from office, will have any incentive to cooperate with this new American policy. 
The policy is still short on the details of how a cease-fire could be put in place -- how the Israeli Army might be coaxed out of the West Bank or how Palestinian security institutions might be rebuilt to prevent suicide bombings. Those are important factors in creating conditions for a political process that could move forward. 
For all the risks in a policy that sends a sharp message to Mr. Arafat that he is irrelevant, the recent track record of splitting differences in the Middle East has been a dismal failure. "Everything is shoved down the road so, and it was so conditional," said Richard W. Murphy, a onetime assistant secretary or state for the Middle East who served Democratic and Republican administrations. He added that Mr. Bush could face a "dilemma" if -- in defiance of American pressure to remove the icon of their national movement -- Palestinians re-elect Mr. Arafat at the first opportunity, which is expected to be next spring.
"Arafat never struck me as the kind who would want to step down in the name of national interest, because he thinks he knows it better than anyone else," Mr. Murphy said.
A significant risk is that while Mr. Bush waits for Palestinians to live up to the benchmarks he set forth from the Rose Garden of the White House, the violence will simply continue, or even intensify.
It was also unclear how changing the Palestinian leadership would actually proceed after the United States and European countries helped Palestinians carry out local and national elections over the next year, or how those elections would be carried out at all if violence and Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories continued.
Martin S. Indyk, who served as a top Middle East strategist in the Clinton administration, applauded part of what Mr. Bush said. "It was a moment of clarity," Mr. Indyk said. "It was right for him to remove the ambiguity from American policy when it came to the question of Palestinian leadership because not only has Arafat failed the test of leadership, there is not an Israeli leader who would negotiate an agreement with Yasir Arafat, so there does have to be a change."
Mr. Indyk added that he was concerned that Mr. Bush offered too little clarity to Palestinians. "He needed to give definition to what the Palestinian state would look like and that would give the Palestinians a greater sense of what they would get in return for ditching their leadership." he said. 
Though Mr. Bush's speech tilted heavily toward the view of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has been arguing since September that Mr. Arafat is no different from Osama bin Laden, some Arab officials and Palestinians focused on the positive elements. 
"Finally, we have an American policy, and that is an essential part of the exercise," said a foreign policy adviser to an Arab government allied with Washington. "Now, of course, he had to score points with Israel so they will withdraw from the West Bank, and maybe he tilted too heavily against the Palestinian leadership, but I think some good will come of it."
This Arab adviser said he did not think most Arab leaders were alarmed that Mr. Bush had taken a muscular stand on the need to create a democratic and transparent state for Palestinians.
"The democratization of the Palestinian leadership is a point well taken, and obviously it was targeted against Arafat, but there will be elections there and we will see," the adviser said.
Putting the best face on the speech in Washington was Hassan Abdulrahman, Mr. Arafat's official representative here. The president, he said, "spoke of many things that we wanted to hear, an end to the Israeli occupation, and he challenged Israelis to freeze the settlements, withdraw their troops and respect Palestinian rights."
Asked whether he understood the speech to be a direct challenge to Mr. Arafat's rule, Mr. Abdulrahman was evasive. He pointed out that Mr. Bush never used Mr. Arafat's name in the speech when he called for new leadership.
For now, Mr. Abdulrahman said he preferred not to focus on the "ambiguity" of Mr. Bush's remarks, and added: "He asked us for elections that may produce a new leadership. We are committed to elections and Yasir Arafat is committed to elections."
Still, a number of experts expressed concerns that Mr. Bush has set out a task that Palestinians will be hard put to perform. 
Stephen P. Cohen of the Israel Policy Forum said that while Mr. Bush today charted a vision of a solution that marks "an advance over where the United States has been in the past," the prescription the president laid out "still has the basic framework which is that the Palestinians have to act first."
Mr. Indyk had another worry after listening to Mr. Bush's speech. If it heralds a new and sustained engagement by the president himself to push Palestinian reforms, he said, "they can begin to pull the parties out of the abysss."
But, Mr. Indyk added, if Mr. Bush is trying satisfy the calls from Arab leaders to act on the Palestinian problem before moving "on to Baghdad" to topple Saddam Hussein, then the policy "is not going to work."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL; 
The President's Words of Warning: 'Things Must Change in the Middle East'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's speech yesterday on his Middle East proposals, as recorded by The New York Times:
 For too long the citizens of the Middle East have lived in the midst of death and fear. The hatred of a few holds the hopes of many hostage. The forces of extremism and terror are attempting to kill progress and peace by killing the innocent. And this casts a dark shadow over an entire region. 
 For the sake of all humanity, things must change in the Middle East. 
It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation. And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve. Israeli citizens will continue to be victimized by terrorists and so Israel will continue to defend herself. And the situation of the Palestinian people will grow more and more miserable.
My vision is two states living side by side in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror. Yet at this critical moment, if all parties will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the darkness with the light of hope.
Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty. 
If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively support their efforts. If the Palestinian people meet these goals, they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt and Jordan on security and other arrangements for independence.
And when the Palestinian people have new leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state, whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle East.
In the work ahead, we all have responsibilities. The Palestinian people are gifted and capable. And I'm confident they can achieve a new birth for their nation. A Palestinian state will never be created by terror. It will be built through reform. And reform must be more than cosmetic change or veiled attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions based on democracy, market economics and action against terrorism.
Today the elected Palestinian legislature has no authority. And power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few. A Palestinian state can only serve its citizens with a new constitution which separates the powers of government. The Palestinian parliament should have the full authority of a legislative body. Local officials and government ministers need authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively.
The United States, along with the European Union and Arab states, will work with Palestinian leaders to create a new constitutional framework and a working democracy for the Palestinian people. And the United States, along with others in the international community, will help the Palestinians organize and monitor fair multiparty local elections by the end of the year, with national elections to follow.
Today the Palestinian people live in economic stagnation made worse by official corruption. A Palestinian state will require a vibrant economy where honest enterprise is encouraged by honest government. The United States, the international donor community and the World Bank stand ready to work with Palestinians on a major project of economic reform and development.
The United States, the E.U., the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are willing to oversee reforms in Palestinian finances, encouraging transparency and independent auditing. And the United States, along with our partners in the developed world, will increase our humanitarian assistance to relieve Palestinian suffering.
Today the Palestinian people lack effective courts of law and have no means to defend and vindicate their rights. A Palestinian state will require a system of reliable justice to punish those who prey on the innocent. The United States and members of the international community stand ready to work with Palestinian leaders to establish, finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary.
Today Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. This is unacceptable. And the United States will not support the establishment of a Palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure. This will require an externally supervised effort to rebuild and reform the Palestinian security services. This security system must have clear lines of authority and accountability and a unified chain of command. America is pursuing this reform along with key regional states. 
The world is prepared to help. Yet ultimately these steps toward statehood depend on the Palestinian people and their leaders. If they energetically take the path of reform, the rewards can come quickly. If Palestinians embrace democracy, confront corruption and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a provisional state of Palestine.
With a dedicated effort, this state could rise rapidly as it comes to terms with Israel, Egypt and Jordan on practical issues such as security. The final borders, the capital and other aspects of this state's sovereignty will be negotiated between the parties as part of a final settlement. Arab states have offered their help in this process, and their help is needed.
I've said in the past that nations are either with us or against us in the war on terror. To be counted on the side of peace, nations must act. Every leader actually committed to peace will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce homicide bombings. Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the flow of money, equipment and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. Every nation actually committed to peace must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these groups and oppose regimes that promote terror like Iraq. And Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations.
Leaders who want to be included in the peace process must show by their deeds an undivided support for peace.
And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel and the entire Arab world.
Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity in democracy. A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security that Israel longs for. So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.
As we make progress toward security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to Sept. 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop.
The Palestinian economy must be allowed to develop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life. Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian and international workers must be allowed to go about the business of building a better future. And Israel should release frozen Palestinian revenues into honest accountable hands.
I've asked Secretary Powell to work intensively with Middle Eastern and international leaders to realize the vision of a Palestinian state, focusing them on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian reform and institution building.
Ultimately Israelis and Palestinians must address the core issues that divide them if there is to be a real peace, resolving all claims and ending the conflict between them. This means that the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement negotiated between the parties based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders.
We must also resolve questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian refugees and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and a Syria that supports peace and fights terror.
All who are familiar with the history of the Middle East realize that there may be setbacks in this process. Trained and determined killers -- as we have seen -- want to stop it. Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian peace treaties with Israel remind us that with determined and responsible leadership, progress can come quickly.
As new Palestinian institutions and new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform, I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final-status agreement. With intensive effort by all, this agreement could be reached within three years from now. And I and my country will actively lead toward that goal.
I can understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian Authority has rejected your offered hand and trafficked with terrorists. You have a right to a normal life. You have a right to security. And I deeply believe that you need a reformed, responsible, Palestinian partner to achieve that security.
I can understand the deep anger and despair of the Palestinian people. For decades you've been treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict. Your interests have been held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement that never seems to come as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve democracy and the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving economy. You deserve a life of hope for your children. 
An end to occupation and a peaceful democratic Palestinian state may seem distant. But America and our partners throughout the world stand ready to help, help you make them possible as soon as possible. If liberty can blossom in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of men and women around the globe who are equally weary of poverty and oppression, equally entitled to the benefits of democratic government.
I have a hope for the people of Muslim countries. Your commitments to morality and learning and tolerance led to great historical achievements. And those values are alive in the Islamic world today. You have a rich culture and you share the aspirations of men and women in every culture. Prosperity and freedom and dignity are not just American hopes or Western hopes; they are universal human hopes. And even in the violence and turmoil of the Middle East, America believes those hopes have the power to transform lives and nations.
This moment is both an opportunity and a test for all parties in the Middle East. An opportunity to lay the foundations for future peace. A test to show who is serious about peace and who is not. The choice here is stark and simple. The Bible says: I have set before you life and death, therefore choose life.
The time has arrived for everyone in this conflict to choose peace and hope and life. 
Thank you very much.

BUSH DEMANDS ARAFAT'S OUSTER BEFORE U.S. BACKS A NEW STATE; ISRAELIS WELCOME TOUGH LINE

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
President Bush told the Palestinian people today that they must replace Yasir Arafat as their leader before the United States will support an independent Palestinian state. 
 Removal of Mr. Arafat was only one of several major changes that Mr. Bush demanded of the Palestinians in a blunt speech delivered in the Rose Garden this afternoon. He also called for an end to Palestinian terrorism, and for free elections and economic reforms to end corruption. 
 His speech was tougher on the Palestinians than any of his previous statements and was intended to bring an end to almost 19 months of bloody attacks against Israel and harsh military counterattacks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The United States had never before made the creation of a Palestinian state conditional on the removal of Mr. Arafat. 
While he never mentioned Mr. Arafat by name, Mr. Bush made the price of Palestinian statehood clear: "Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership so that a Palestinian state can be born," he said. Transcript, Page A10. 
Mr. Bush effectively endorsed the position of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, which he had until now resisted: that no negotiations can take place until Mr. Arafat is replaced. 
Israeli officials were delighted. "I thought all the way through the speech, this is the carrot, now comes the stick," a senior Israeli official said. "There was no stick -- because we don't deserve the stick." Page A11. 
In recent days, Israel has sent tanks and troops into six of the eight major Palestinian cities and towns as part of a new policy to seize and hold Palestinian-controlled territory until all attacks halt. Israel announced the policy last week, after back-to-back suicide bombings in Jerusalem killed 26 Israelis. 
Today Israel stepped up its West Bank offensive and killed six Palestinians with a missile strike in the Gaza Strip. Two others were killed early on Tuesday in the West Bank, The Associated Press reported. Once again Israeli tanks encircled Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah. 
While many Palestinians condemned the president's conditions, Mr. Arafat, making no immediate comment on his own fate, characterized the speech as "a serious effort to push the peace process forward." 
Israeli officials, meanwhile, rejoiced that Mr. Bush was asking Israel to do relatively little, at least until the Palestinians first move to restore security and end terror attacks.
In the view of Israeli officials, Mr. Bush gave Mr. Sharon a free hand to continue his present West Bank offensive. Certainly, the president was uncompromising in his condemnation of Palestinian suicide attacks, saying, "A Palestinian state will never be created by terror."
The president said that if the Palestinians carry out the requested reforms, the United States will back a provisional Palestinian state. No timetable was given, but Mr. Bush said it could "rise rapidly."
This provisional state, whose form was left vague in the speech today, would be the first stage toward a final settlement and the creation of a Palestinian state with firmly defined borders "within three years from now."
Mr. Bush gave the speech fewer than 24 hours before he is scheduled to arrive in Canada for the opening of the annual summit meeting of industrialized nations. That meeting may now be dominated by Mr. Bush's efforts to press European leaders, along with Japan and Russia, to support his new approach.
Significantly, Mr. Bush made no call today for Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank until the Palestinians begin to end the violence, a sharp contrast to his call in his most recent previous speech on Middle East policy, on April 4, when he demanded a pullback by Israeli forces. Ultimately, the president suggested, Israel should withdraw from much of the land occupied since 1967.
Mr. Bush said: "I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty. If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively pursue their efforts."
This was a departure from the usual White House formulation that Mr. Arafat had been a "disappointment" and that he should act to quell terrorism.
Mr. Bush gave no specific clue as to which Palestinian leader he envisaged replacing Mr. Arafat, and it was not immediately clear that any of those now in leading positions could meet the criteria set. 
A senior administration official said that an earlier draft of the speech did not include an explicit call for Mr. Arafat's removal, but that the back-to-back Palestinian suicide bombings last week had "crystallized" the American resolve that there be new leadership.
The official said Mr. Bush inserted the sentence calling for the removal of Mr. Arafat as a precondition to Palestinian statehood late Saturday afternoon in his private office in the White House residence.
Some Palestinian leaders complained that the demands were so broad -- from free elections to an end to corruption to the breaking up of terrorist groups targeting Israel -- that Mr. Bush's speech could only be viewed as a stalling tactic.
Notably missing from the speech was any firm timetable to move toward Palestinian statehood, which President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt had pressed on Mr. Bush during a meeting at Camp David earlier this month. But the lack of a timetable was another victory, for Mr. Sharon, who has long said that talk of statehood is "premature."
Mr. Bush instead tied the timing to the arrival of democracy, an end to rampant corruption and a rejection of terrorism. He said, referring to Palestinian leaders, that "if they energetically take the path of reform, the rewards can come quickly."
Mr. Bush and administration officials were vague about the practicalities of how the United States would help the Palestinians pursue those reforms. An administration official would say only that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell would put together a "work plan" that could include the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other donor countries to build a Palestinian state, similar to the process that the United States is leading in Afghanistan.
Mr. Bush said that the Palestinian state would have to be built "through reform," and that "reform must be more than cosmetic change or veiled attempt to preserve the status quo." He added, "True reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions based on democracy, market economics and action against terrorism."
Administration officials did not specify the standards for determining whether the reforms have been met, and they left unclear who would be the final judge -- the United States, Israel, the United Nations or another group.
Officials also refused to answer questions about whether the Bush administration would now cease all contacts with Mr. Arafat, who regularly talks to Secretary Powell. "We'll have to see," one senior official said. But some administration officials said they would be willing to consider allowing Mr. Arafat to remain as a figurehead leader of the Palestinian people, an idea Israeli officials have suggested they will support.
While the speech was heavy with Mr. Bush's demands of the Palestinians, he also spoke of their suffering. At one point he addressed them directly, saying: "For decades you've been treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict. Your interests have been held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement that never seems to come as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve democracy and the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving economy. You deserve a life of hope for your children."
Administration officials had delayed the speech several times as violence flared in the Middle East, but then worked extensively on its final shape over the weekend. Secretary Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, met on Friday and then again on Sunday to review it.
On Saturday morning, after Mr. Bush ran in a three-mile race in Washington, he asked to see a final version of the speech. He read it over, an official said, then at 5 p.m. that day called in Ms. Rice, his longtime confidante Karen P. Hughes and Michael Gerson, the chief White House speechwriter. It was at that point, the official said, that Mr. Bush added the sentence calling for the replacement of Mr. Arafat.
Another official said Mr. Cheney played a significant role "internally, shaping the broad outlines of the speech" over the last several days. The same official said that Mr. Rumsfeld's view that "terrorism should not be appeased" was reflected in the speech.
Mr. Bush decided on Sunday night that he would give the speech this afternoon, after returning from a political fund-raiser in Newark.

HEADLINE: Blows Keep Coming for an Argentina Long inCrisis 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 25 

 BODY:
The president says it may be impossible to reach any agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the head of the central bank is giving up and going home, and the economy minister embarked tonight on a desperate quest to pry $18 billion from foreign lenders. 
 For Argentina, an already disastrous economic crisis is suddenly threatening to become even more calamitous. 
 "Argentina needs a very rapid agreement, but it doesn't depend on us," a dejected President Eduardo Duhalde said in a television appearance here late on Monday. "I hope we don't have to wait until September, because the situation in the region is getting worse every day."
Mr. Duhalde spoke shortly after Mario Blejer, the president of the central bank and a former I.M.F. official with extensive contacts on Wall Street, said he was stepping down. His departure leaves the economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, who departed tonight for three days of meetings with the country's creditors in New York and Washington, as the undisputed chief of the government's economic team. 
The resignation of Mr. Blejer, 53, an economist with a doctorate from the University of Chicago, was not a great surprise. His health problems and his desire to rejoin his family, which lives in the United States, were widely known here, and he had earlier told Mr. Duhalde that he would stay in his post only until an agreement could be reached with the fund.
But clashes with Mr. Lavagna, especially over how to end a freeze on bank deposits that has crippled Argentina's banking system since December, hastened Mr. Blejer's decision; he is to leave his post at the end of the week. Investors reacted by pushing the value of the Argentine peso down 2.5 percent today to 3.86 to the dollar; it was pegged at one to the dollar for a decade until early January.
Mr. Blejer is to be succeeded by his deputy, Aldo Pignanelli, a little-known Peronist party loyalist who played a role in recent efforts to keep several banks from collapsing.
In his letter of resignation, Mr. Blejer complained that the central bank's "independence has been weakened repeatedly in recent times" and urged the government not to "submit it to self-interested pressures."
Like the monetary fund's negotiators, who have been meeting with Argentine officials here this month, Mr. Blejer favored a plan to end the banking freeze by forcing bank depositors to accept government bonds in place of their savings. With Mr. Duhalde's approval, however, Mr. Lavagna has instead put in place an optional conversion plan, which was quickly rejected by all but a few depositors.
Though the monetary fund's position "is correct from a macroeconomic point of view, it is not legally possible" to force depositors to accept bonds, Eduardo Amadeo, a spokesman for Mr. Duhalde and a member of the Argentine negotiating team, said in an interview here today. "The court is not going to approve this. There is jurisprudence on this, and it is quite clear."
Another important figure quit the scene today when Raul Alfonsin, who was president from 1983 to 1989, resigned his Senate seat. Mr. Alfonsin, a member of the Radical Party, had been an ally of Mr. Duhalde, a Peronist, but found himself at odds with other Radical leaders, who argued that it was a mistake for the party to be associated with what they called Mr. Duhalde's disastrous policies. 
A team from the monetary fund left Buenos Aires last Friday without saying publicly that any headway had been made toward an agreement that would restore Argentina's credit line with the fund, which was suspended in December. On Monday, David de Ferranti, vice president of the World Bank for Latin America, said that any agreement between Argentina and its creditors still requires "quite a lot of time to work out."
"The fund had a mission to Argentina that left a day or so ago without progress," Mr. De Ferranti told reporters at a meeting in the Netherlands. "It's slow going. I wish it were possible to say that there was a solution that would be soon to occur. That is not obvious yet."
Argentine officials argue, on the other hand, that they have done many of the things the fund has demanded, often over strong internal opposition. They cite a pact to impose fiscal restraint on provincial governors and the revocation of bankruptcy and "economic subversion" laws that were said to discriminate against foreigners. The main impediment to a deal now, they say, is more psychological than substantive.
"The fund doesn't believe us," Mr. Amadeo said. "They don't trust us. They have no confidence in us, given the history of the Argentine political class, and that has made the negotiations long and difficult."
An even more basic problem, he said, is that "if the fund continues to believe that we are cheating them, there is no solution and we're stuck in a Catch-22." He added, " There has to be a minimum of good will and belief that we are no longer deceiving anyone."
In recent declarations, Mr. Duhalde and other officials have indicated that they see July 15 as something of a deadline for the talks. Argentina has already defaulted on most of its foreign debt, but payments of more than $1 billion still come due that day, and the government has implied that if it has no deal by then with the fund, it will have no choice but to default on those payments, too.
Some analysts here argue that the apparent hardening of Argentina's position stems from the recent market turbulence in neighboring Brazil and Uruguay, which is also showing signs of affecting Chile and Mexico. Argentine officials say the crisis is now regional, which increases their leverage in negotiations by putting pressure on lenders and foreign governments to prevent the situation from worsening.
"The group in power thinks that they can blackmail the I.M.F. and the United States government through the threat of contagion in Brazil," said Carlos Escude, a former foreign ministry official who has written several books on Argentine foreign policy. "But they are wrong to think they can wield that club," Mr. Escude said, because the monetary fund is "more likely to come to Brazil's rescue" and let Argentina sink.
With no accord to restart the economy, the pressure on the Argentine currency is mounting. Some currency exchange offices were charging four pesos for a dollar today, and Carlos Saul Menem, the former president who is running for the office again, warned that rate could easily slide to seven to the dollar by the end of the year. 
The government has responded by intervening in the market to support the peso, a move most economists here have criticized as a doomed and dangerous use of dwindling foreign reserves. Since January, Argentina's reserves have dropped from $13 billion to less than $9.8 billion, with the government now spending up to $50 million a day to stave off a run on the peso.
The way things are going, Argentina will soon fall below the minimum level of $9 billion in foreign reserves required under its existing agreements with the monetary fund. But government officials say that letting the peso float without intervention, as the monetary fund has advocated, would produce a politically disastrous burst of hyperinflation.
"It is important to obtain maximum stability" for the peso, Mr. Lavagna said Monday in remarks to a visiting Brazilian business group. "We have worked by using intervention to avoid an excessive movement," keeping the peso's decline fairly slow, he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines; Home Sales Are Lower but Brisk 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Americans' anxiety about corporate scandals and the job market sent consumer confidence down to a four-month low in June, the Conference Board reported yesterday. 
 The agency, an independent research group in New York, said its consumer confidence index fell to 106.4 from a revised 110.3 in May, the second-biggest drop since the attacks last September. Analysts had expected a little worse -- a reading of 106.0. 
 In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes declined in May, though the figure was still among the highest levels on record. 
"It's been a very difficult month for the financial markets," said Gary Thayer, chief economist for A. G. Edwards & Sons. Nevertheless, Mr. Thayer said, "consumers are still feeling better about things than they did six, seven months ago." 
The Conference Board's index, based on a monthly survey of some 5,000 households, is closely watched because the level of confidence drives consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. June's figure is the lowest since February, when consumer confidence stood at 95.0 during Congressional hearings into the Enron scandal. The drop from last month was also the largest since a drop of 11.7 points, to 85.3, in October, after the terrorist attacks. 
"Weak labor market conditions, generally soft business conditions and waning public confidence in questionable business practices have helped erode consumer confidence," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center. 
Respondents reporting that jobs were "hard to get" increased to 23.1 percent, from 21.8 percent in May. Those saying that jobs were plentiful decreased to 20.1 percent, from 21.2 percent. The estimate of job prospects in the next six months weakened. 
In their report, the Realtors said sales of existing homes edged down 0.3 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.75 million. Even with the drop, sales in May were considered brisk and the fourth highest in a month since the association began keeping records in 1968. 
"Housing is continuing to be a significant factor in sustaining the U.S. economy," the association's chief economist, David Lereah, said. "Going forward, the trend should be a gradual decline in home sales activity, but they'll stay above last year's record." 
In 2001, a record 5.3 million existing homes were sold. The association expects sales figures this year to surpass that.

HEADLINE: Security Tight For G-8 Talks At Idyllic Spot In Canada 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, June 25 

 BODY:
The photo ops are guaranteed to promote Canada as a pristine oasis of Rocky Mountain tranquillity when President Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders discuss the world's problems Wednesday and Thursday in the resort village of Kananaskis.
 But the Canadian security forces are preparing extraordinary measures in this normally quiet Victorian capital and around western Alberta Province to control the kind of violent demonstrations that marred the last such meeting of industrial world leaders, in the Italian port city of Genoa, and the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City last year. 
 A wide assortment of protest groups have been quiet about their exact plans. But they have organized a few thousand demonstrators from around Canada and the United States to march this week against globalization, free trade and perceived corporate greed, while supporting ratification of the Kyoto treaty as an antidote to global warming. 
Kananaskis, the leaders' picture-postcard meeting place 60 miles west of Calgary, consists of three small hotels, a post office and a general store set in the shadow of soaring Mount Kidd and amid two lush golf courses. They are not likely to see any protests there, which is perhaps the main reason Prime Minister Jean Chretien chose the spot.
His goal was to minimize the amount of time leaders spent in high-security motorcades and maximize the time talking face to face, without the distraction of protests and journalists. He has said he will try to focus the leaders on Africa, hoping they will agree that it needs more aid, trade and investment -- especially in those countries that strengthen democratic institutions and pursue free market policies.
However, in light of President Bush's demand on Monday that Yasir Arafat be replaced as Palestinian leader before the United States will support an independent Palestinian state, it now appears likely that the leaders will try to resuscitate a Middle East peace process.
Another likely topic is recently increased subsidies for American farmers and higher American tariffs on steel and softwood lumber.
Mr. Chretien told reporters on Monday that although he was committed to allowing free, peaceful protest, he would not tolerate violence. Canada was shaken in April 2001 by the scene of thousands of protesters clashing with police officers at the Quebec summit meeting of hemispheric leaders, which resulted in nearly 400 arrests and injuries to 300 police officers, protesters and bystanders.
With Ottawa the expected site of most protests this time, federal officials are girding in readiness to face a group of demonstrators who call their coalition Take the Capital. There is concern that anarchists may try to rush Parliament Hill, the symbol of Canadian democracy.
To minimize possible damages, workers have taken down the wrought-iron lighting fixtures that line the parliamentary entranceway and built a steel and concrete bunker around the Centennial Flame monument, which was first lighted on New Year's Eve 1966 to commemorate the country's 100th birthday.
The National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography and other cultural and business institutions will close early on Wednesday or not open at all during the summit meeting.
"We are entitled to have demonstrations," Mr. Chretien said. "I even organized some in my youth. But they have to be peaceful. Nothing has to be destroyed, and the police force is taking the required measures."
As for the Kananaskis region, only one road runs through it, which will simplify the security task for the 4,500 police officers and 6,000 soldiers protecting the leaders. The plan is for the forces to block the road and secure a 15-mile perimeter around the village. Any protesters who try to break through the perimeter will face not only troops equipped with assault rifles but also the possibility of an encounter with cougars, wolves and grizzly bears.
A 330-mile-radius no-flight zone has been extended over the village, with any violators to be either forced or shot down by CF-18 fighters or ground-to-air missiles. The total cost of security for the two-day meeting has been estimated to exceed $200 million.
In Calgary, city workers erected a concrete barrier around City Hall and another fence around the media center where international journalists will receive summit briefings. The city government has rented two armored vehicles capable of withstanding gunshots for riot control.

Palm Reports a Narrower Loss As Hand-Held Sales Rebound

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 25 

 BODY:
Palm Inc., the world's largest maker of hand-held computers, said today that its fourth-quarter loss had narrowed as expenses dropped and sales rebounded from a year earlier, when product delays cut its revenue in half.
 The net loss fell to $27.5 million, or 5 cents a share, from $392.1 million, or 69 cents, a year earlier, Palm said. Sales in the quarter ended May 31 climbed 41 percent, to $233.3 million from $165.3 million reported for the quarter a year ago, its lowest quarterly sales as a public company. 
 The company has reported losses in five of the past six quarters as the nation's slowing economy has led consumers and businesses to spend less on electronics, crimping sales at Palm and rivals like Handspring, which licenses the Palm operating system. Many consumers who want an electronic organizer already own one, and current users see few reasons to buy another, analysts said.
"It's really a weak market for hand-held devices," said Stephen Sweeney, a Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst who has a hold rating on the shares. "There really isn't a reason to upgrade."
Palm shares rose to $1.64 in after-hours trading following the announcement. They fell 8 cents, to $1.59, in regular trading and have lost 70 percent of their value in the last year.
Excluding certain costs, the company said, the loss in the recent period would have been $17.8 million, or 3 cents a share. On that basis, the company matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. The company reduced total expenses, including the amortization of good-will and restructuring costs, to $259.2 million in the recent period, compared with $767.9 million a year ago.
As part of its plan to split into two independent companies, Palm said, Todd Bradley, president of the division that makes computer hardware, will become chief executive of that unit, called Palm Solutions Group, on Sept. 1. David Nagel, the former chief technology officer of AT&T, is the chief executive of PalmSource, which makes operating-system software for hand-held computers.
The executives will report to the Palm chairman and chief executive Eric A. Benhamou, who will remain in his posts until Palm breaks into two companies. After the split, Mr. Benhamou will be chairman of both.

HEADLINE: Auto Union and Honda Dispute Safety Record at Plants in Ohio 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: MARYSVILLE, Ohio, June 19 

 BODY:
Honda's four factories in central Ohio, including its sprawling assembly plant here that makes the highly popular Accord, turn out quality cars and motorcycles that are among the most profitable in the industry. But the United Automobile Workers says that the stellar efficiency comes at a price -- injury rates more than double the average for the American auto industry.
 The union, which has never successfully organized an assembly plant solely owned by a foreign auto manufacturer in the United States, compiled the injury data from federal records and hopes to use the information as the cornerstone of its campaign to represent Honda's workers. It plans a public forum on June 26 in Springfield, not far from this city about 30 miles northwest of Columbus, and made the data available in advance to The New York Times. 
 According to federal safety logs collected by the union, there were 23.5 injuries that caused lost workdays for every 100 workers at Honda's two auto assembly plants in Ohio in 2000. That was more than double the auto industry's average rate of 10.5 such injuries per 100 workers. (Lost- workday injuries are defined as those requiring time away from work or that lead to restrictions at work.) 
The union attributes the injuries to Honda's demanding production rates, its widespread use of temporary workers who have less training than permanent employees and the absence of independent safety advocates in Honda plants to help injured workers find suitable jobs.
Honda says that the safety logs, which the Labor Department requires companies to maintain, unfairly inflate its injury rates because the company aggressively reports even minor injuries and does not rush injured workers back to the job. Under new workplace rules imposed by the Bush administration this year, the company's injury rates will be cut in half, Honda adds.
"Regulations are subject to interpretation, and we interpret them very broadly," said Rick Schostek, a vice president and general counsel for Honda of America Manufacturing. "We record everything that comes to our attention."
A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that any changes in reported injury rates would be largely consistent across the auto industry, so the new rules would not erase differences from one company to another.
Even higher injury rates were reported by Honda in 1998 and 1999, prompting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, an arm of the Labor Department, to conduct a five-month inspection of the Marysville plant. The agency found 40 serious safety violations in the factory, which produces some Acura models as well as Accord sedans and coupes. The company paid more than $100,000 in fines.
Many injuries to auto workers involve repetitive stress from drilling bolts or lifting parts over and over again. Other injuries are far more serious and include exposure to various industrial chemicals, workplace accidents and debilitating injuries to backs, shoulders and elbows.
Apart from the most serious injuries, workers at Honda's auto assembly plants also tend to be hurt more often than those at the typical auto factory. At Marysville, the total number of reported injury and illness cases in 2000, including those not causing a lost workday, was 51.5 for every 100 workers. The company's assembly plant in East Liberty had a rate of 71. The industry average was 22.7.
But Jim Samuel, a spokesman for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, said his agency's own information reflected well on Honda.
"We consider them a pretty good self-insured employer and one that appears to be actively engaged in making a safer workplace," he said.
Another agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, has recently questioned injured Honda workers as part of an inquiry, though it declines to say for what.
By most accounts, Honda's plants are tough places to work. "You can walk down our assembly line and ask anybody what their injury is," said Daniel Lowe, a 34-year-old Honda assembly line worker and union supporter who said he recently suffered a double hernia. "They've all had one."
Dozens of current and former workers were interviewed for this article, some provided by the union, some by Honda and some contacted separately.
"Torn A.C.L., hernias, rotator cuff tears, herniated disks, carpal tunnel is really bad," Mr. Lowe added. "It's incredible the stories you hear." 
Georgine Johnson, a 61-year-old former Honda assembly line worker, said she had had surgery to alleviate a herniated disk in her neck aggravated by loading motorcycle gas tanks onto a rack. "They try to get rid of you, absolutely," she said. "They lay in waiting for the least little thing." 
Honda dismisses that notion.
"They've recently come upon safety, and they're planning to use safety as their wedge for organizing," Mr. Schostek said, referring to the U.A.W. "Our approach to workplace safety has a philosophy to it, it's proactive, it's comprehensive, and it's respectful."
He said that higher rates of injuries requiring lost work days reflected "friendly leave-of-absence policies."
He added, "We don't force associates back to work before they believe they're ready."
Lynna Jessee, a team leader who supervises 14 workers, said workplace safety was a constant consideration. The union, she said, is "taking a few isolated incidents and making something big out of nothing."
Arguing that safety records of the Big Three union plants are better than those at Japanese-owned factories is not easy. The much larger and older operations of the Big Three have had numerous fatal accidents the last two decades, while Honda's Ohio plants have avoided fatalities. At Ford Motor, where six workers died after an explosion at its River Rouge plant in 1999, the lost-workday rate was 20.4 in 2000, compared with 23.5 for Honda, though some of Ford's plants are half a century old.
Still, safety might be the most potent wedge for the union because foreign automakers have countered the union's organizing efforts by increasing salaries and retirement benefits.
"We're not making it a central issue, it is a central issue," said Bob King, the U.A.W. vice president for organizing. "We build a campaign based on what the workers say the issues are." 
Keeping unions out has helped foreign automakers maintain significant leads in manufacturing efficiency. Last year, the average Honda automobile produced in North America required 31.2 hours of labor, according to Harbour & Associates, a consulting firm, compared with 39.3 hours for General Motors. 
Such gaps translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, though some workers complain of difficulty keeping pace.
"There's many times on the assembly line where the adrenaline is high just because people are trying to keep up," said Russ Thomas, who works in Honda's engine plant in Anna, Ohio, and is a U.A.W. supporter who has taken fellow workers on tours of a Ford engine plant nearby.
Once serious injuries occur, being classified as disabled at Honda requires navigating a formidable phalanx of interlocking insurance and diagnostic companies, not to mention Honda itself, some workers contend.
"From the medical side, when someone does get hurt, Honda contests everything, even if it's an obvious injury," said Brenda Ober, who has worked at Honda for 20 years.
Mr. Schostek, the Honda spokesman, disputed that as well. "One of the features of our workplace is that we provide many, many, many avenues for an associate to raise a concern," he said. If a worker's immediate supervisor dismisses a claim, he said, other alternatives include going to higher levels of management within the company and an "800" number to make complaints anonymously.
While the Big Three look to close factories, foreign automakers build. Most of their recent development has been in the Deep South, where labor is less expensive and local law discourages unions.
The Marysville plant can produce nearly half a million cars and covers an area the size of roughly 1,000 football fields. Inside is a warren of catwalks and assembly lines, bleeping robot-controlled carts cruising aisles beside associates, as Honda calls management and worker alike. Scoreboards tally the day's production goals. 
"It was intimidating," said Mr. Lowe, who started in 1994 by putting rear bumpers on Accords. He is an Air Force veteran, and his combative streak is apparent from an eager grin and the U.A.W. pocket protector worn over his Honda-issue jumpsuit.
"It was the fastest work I ever had to do in my life," he added. "The first three months, ice packs on my wrists, my ankles and my lower back, not to mention the endless amounts of Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Alleve, painkillers by the bucket." 
Ray Castle, an assembly line worker at a separate Honda motorcycle plant in Marysville, said: "My brother and father-in-law work at Ford. Over there, people talk about how long they've got till they retire. At Honda, people are trying to get something else going, going back to school, so they can get out."
Other workers disagree that work at Honda is worse than elsewhere. "You're going to have that in any plant," said Stan Parshall, a worker at Marysville who has worked for Ford. Though he supports the union, he said "factory work is factory work."
The jobs remain popular here, in part because the pay and benefits far exceed those of most other jobs in the surrounding area. Mr. Castle said that when he got a job at Honda he "hit the lottery." Other workers say when a cycle of injuries begins they stay to get benefits but risk becoming unemployable. 
During a recent visit to Honda's plants, the company displayed numerous efforts to improve workplace safety and said it was always adding ergonomic enhancements. A new section of movable floor at Marysville lowers workers to a comfortable height; a redesigned door speaker snaps in place, eliminating repetitive stress from bolting. 
"We're always constantly implementing new ideas," said Brian Bodey, a Honda team leader. "It only helps us all if everybody's healthy."
But Frank White, the U.A.W. organizer here, said workers have no recourse when they think otherwise.
Certainly, bringing OSHA logs to light is not relished. The union said it had fought for years to obtain logs from Nissan, which it has repeatedly failed to unionize. Nissan's representatives did not return nearly a week's worth of calls on the subject.
Mr. King, the U.A.W. organizing chief, said Toyota first declined to provide the logs. "Then they gave it to us on dark red paper and used the smallest possible print," he said. "And then they blurred it."
Rick Hesterberg, a Toyota spokesman, said "copies that we provided were completely legible."
The union is still in the process of collecting and compiling injury information on workers at those companies.
At Honda, the union argues that the company has unfairly tried to make the tactic of collecting logs an issue itself.
Tim Garrett, a Honda vice president, sent employees a letter earlier this year warning that their privacy was being invaded and that the union was seeking personal information to pass among co-workers.
The logs consist of lists of thousands of names, each with two or three words by it: "Hernia right abdomen." "Laceration upper forehead." "Strain Lumb Back." "Contusion upper ribs." "Trig Fingr." "Contusion Right Foot." "Inhalation Multiple Whole Body." "Flash Burn Right Eye."
"We felt we should inform you and your family," Mr. Garrett wrote, "that the U.A.W. may obtain this personal and medical information."

HEADLINE: Watching as the Trains Pass, Then Having to Take the Bus 

 BODY:
The tracks pass right by Co-op City on their way to Penn Station, but no commuter train takes the 55,000 residents of the housing complex in the Bronx to Manhattan. They must take either a bus and a subway (a trip of more than an hour), or an express bus that is usually faster but that on bad traffic days can take about 90 minutes to reach 34th Street and Fifth Avenue.
 "We're exactly 15 miles from Penn Station, and you can't get there from here," said Dan Gallo, a railroad consultant who is working with Co-op City residents to advocate for train service into the area. "You can wave at the Amtrak trains coming by at 90 miles per hour, but they won't stop for you." 
 Metro-North Railroad is holding three public hearings this week to discuss two proposals that the organization has been studying to open the commuter rail system's first service into Penn Station. Metro-North trains currently run to Grand Central Terminal.
The first proposal would add New Haven line trains and route them through three new stations in the Bronx, Co-op City, Parkchester and Hunts Point, over Amtrak's Hell Gate line. The second would add Hudson line trains and send them down the West Side of Manhattan, stopping at new stations at 125th Street and 59th Street. The plans are not mutually exclusive.
Another option, to extend the Harlem line into Penn Station, was eliminated because of projected low ridership and the need for new track construction.
About 20 new stations were considered along the two routes. Among those eliminated: City Island, Pelham Parkway and Westchester Avenue in the Bronx; Astoria and Sunnyside in Queens; and points along the West Side of Manhattan, from the George Washington Bridge down to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
Officials do not yet have construction cost estimates, but compared with other commuter projects, the changes would be relatively cheap, because no new rail construction is required.
There is a major sticking point, though: Penn Station is crowded now with Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road trains, and officials estimated that it might be as late as 2011, when the Long Island Rail Road plans to begin running trains into Grand Central, that space could open up for rush hour trains. Off-peak service could begin earlier.
"Right now we're in the throes of an operations analysis at Penn Station," said Todd DiScala, the project manager for Metro-North. "When we're done we're going to talk to Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road and say, 'What do you think, guys, can you fit us in?' For three years they've been saying, 'We can't fit you in.' "
Paul Lipson, executive director of the Point Community Development Corporation in Hunts Point, sees the addition of a station there not just as an easier way to get to Manhattan, but as an opportunity for the area's many poor residents to look for work in Westchester County. "There is no downside," he said.
West Harlem residents are warier, wondering how a station would affect development along the piers and affect traffic into the area, said the chairman of Community Board 9, George Goodwill. "But it would probably bring some economic gain to the area," he added. A draft environmental impact statement is expected by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Lawyers See Logic In Ruling On Schools 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
The reversal of Justice Leland DeGrasse's decision on the financing of New York City schools was probably predictable, legal experts said yesterday, since appellate courts are generally reluctant to second-guess fiscal decisions by state and local governments.
 But some education experts said that even if Justice DeGrasse's decision went down to defeat in the state's highest court, his scathing critique of conditions in city schools had had a significant impact on the terms of the debate over whether schools were getting money and other resources that they needed. 
 In its reversal yesterday, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court said that Justice DeGrasse had applied "an improper standard" to what constituted a sound basic education and that the equivalent of an eighth- to- ninth-grade education was sufficient for New Yorkers to function as productive citizens.
Justice DeGrasse's decision would have required the state to increase school spending by up to $1 billion a year. Stephen Gillers, vice dean and a law professor at New York University, said yesterday that courts were reluctant to impose fiscal decisions on government unless there was "smoking-gun evidence of discrimination or conscious violation of civil rights." 
Justice DeGrasse found that the school financing system violated federal civil rights laws because it disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic students who lived in New York City. But the appeals court said the plaintiffs had not proved a "causal link" between the financing system and educational opportunity.
The Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group whose lawsuit led to yesterday's ruling, said that it would appeal to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
By legal standards, Mr. Gillers said, the state constitutional guarantee of a "sound basic education" is a vague one, making this a difficult case to win.
"I think the New York Court of Appeals is also going to be shy about second-guessing an economic decision, especially in a tough economic time and with the mayor taking over the school system," he said.
But the appeals court did not dispute Justice DeGrasse's criticism of city schools for their underqualified and underpaid teaching force, their large class sizes, their obsolete computers, leaking roofs and broken toilets. 
Under the glare of Justice DeGrasse's decision, experts said yesterday, state and city officials have already taken it upon themselves to begin remedying some of the problems he identified. 
Michael A. Rebell, director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said yesterday that he doubted teachers would have won raises of 16 percent to 22 percent over 30 months if Justice DeGrasse had not given credibility to their claim that the wages of city teachers were not competitive with those in the suburbs.
"The range of the increase was something that entered the vocabulary with the judge's decision," Mr. Rebell said. "It very much entered the psychology of people on all sides and allowed for a major breakthrough."
Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor, said that what the appeals court criticized as an "aspirational standard" had nonetheless set the tone for what parents and teachers now expected of the schools. Justice DeGrasse's decision, he said, "colored the entire debate, and has had a tangible impact because it was written with such clarity."
Still, Mr. Levy and others were disappointed that the appeals court did not accept the argument that New York City schools should offer the same standard of education as suburban schools. "No judge on that panel would send their kids to a school that provided for the kind of education that they say is adequate for New Yorkers," said Robert Berne, vice president of academic affairs at New York University and an expert on New York City schools.
Mr. Berne accused the appeals court of arguing that because some children could learn with uncertified teachers and in large classes, such circumstances were not inherently bad. "I don't think you can argue from an exception," he said. "That's just bad legal argument and bad public policy."

HEADLINE: Golf and Water in San Antonio Civic War 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
The scorching summer heat has arrived, deepening a drought and ushering in a familiar ritual here in the nation's 10th-largest city: watering restrictions. The long-term situation is so serious that local officials have mused about desalinating ocean water or importing fresh water from a few hundred miles away.
 All of which explains why a civic civil war has broken out over plans to develop a golf course. Not just any golf course, but a resort sanctioned by the Professional Golfers' Association; and not just any location, but a pristine expanse atop the fragile Edward Aquifer, the city's primary water source. 
 Boosters say that the proposed golf course development, P.G.A. Village, would enhance San Antonio as a resort destination, and that strict environmental regulations will protect the aquifer. But critics say that the regulatory accord developers reached with the city is weakened by loopholes and that the project is precisely the sort of thing the city should not approve, even if development on the property is inevitable.
"It's an emotional issue," said Mayor Ed Garza, who has sought to mediate the dispute. "Any time water issues have surfaced, it has become very emotional and volatile."
Emotions began escalating in April, when the City Council approved an agreement with the Lumberman's Investment Corporation, which plans to build the project on a 2,800-acre parcel north of the city but under city jurisdiction. 
Community groups immediately began a petition drive to force a referendum on the project. Under a city statute, opponents needed about 68,000 signatures, or 10 percent of the electorate, to do so. They collected more than 79,000.
But in late May, the county clerk invalidated roughly 30,000 of those signatures. In light of accusations that too many names had been thrown out, the clerk reinstated some, but opponents were still about 9,600 signatures short.
 On Tuesday, opponents submitted petitions with an additional 26,000 signatures. The county clerk has 10 days to rule on their validity. The project's affiliation with the P.G.A. lends a glamour and national cachet that supporters contend will further establish San Antonio as an elite tourist destination. It would become the second golf resort operated by the P.G.A., the other being in Port St. Lucie, Fla. The resort would include two hotels and a total of about 4,500 houses, condominiums and time shares.
Local business groups and many elected officials argue that the project will provide jobs and prestige and is environmentally preferable to subdivisions. The developer says that the resort will cover only 800 acres, with the rest designated for golf courses or left as it is.
"There isn't a project around that's in the same universe as far as the amount of space they are dedicating to nondevelopment," said William T. Kaufman, a San Antonio lawyer working for Lumberman's. "The city negotiated very hard." 
David Carpenter, a city councilman who supports the project, noted that existing zoning allows the developer to build up to 9,000 houses on the land, which he says could bring greater environmental harm. "You take the lesser of two evils," Mr. Carpenter said. 
But opponents say that city officials have been duped by the developer. The primary issue is the fragility of the aquifer. The development would sit atop the aquifer's "recharge zone," a fragile area where rainwater seeps through limestone to refill the aquifer below. 
Environmentalists, including a group called Save Our Aquifer, contend that the monitoring of water quality in the aquifer provided under the deal is too loose to ensure that fertilizers and other pollutants do not seep in. Critics say the project could also be exempt from some watering restrictions.
George Rice, a groundwater hydrologist active in Save Our Aquifer, said that a 2000 study by the United States Geological Survey detected low levels of pesticide contamination in samples from the aquifer, reflecting the pressures from existing development. Mr. Rice said that more monitoring wells than planned would be needed as a safeguard, and that stiffer standards should be included in the deal to ensure compliance.
"Some contaminants from the golf course will get into the aquifer," Mr. Rice said. "The question is, how much?"
Community groups also are pushing the P.G.A. and the hotel operators to pay all employees what they call a living wage, indexed over time to inflation. Finally, opponents were outraged to learn that developers had quietly won state lawmakers' approval to set up a special taxing district that gives them the authority, to collect taxes they could use to offset the development costs. Opponents say the developer will save more than $50 million in property taxes because of the district. The district would remain in existence for a finite number of years, a figure that is still being negotiated. 
The dispute has prompted some city officials to begin asking how development should be handled over the aquifer's recharge zone. There are 800,000 acres of land spread over several counties atop the zone, of which 45,000 acres are developed, almost all of that inside Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. 
Mayor Garza, an urban planner, is meeting with the developer and opponents. He said he hoped to avoid a referendum. The major issues are whether the developer will submit to tighter environmental scrutiny and allow wage indexing. 
"We're very close," the mayor said. "But we're not going to please everyone."

FEDEX SHARES FALL ON FIRST-QUARTER EXPECTATIONS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The express shipper FedEx Corporation said yesterday that it expected first-quarter earnings to fall short of Wall Street estimates, hurt by a slow recovery in crucial parts of the economy. Stock in FedEx fell $8.02, or 14 percent, to $48 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
FedEx said it expected to earn 40 to 50 cents a share in the first quarter, below the estimate of 54 cents by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. FedEx executives said the first-quarter estimate reflected a slower-than-expected rebound in the technology and manufacturing sectors. Fedex, based in Memphis, Tenn., made the forecast as it reported results for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31.

HEADLINE: Enron Criminal Investigation Is Said toExpand to Bankers 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD and DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Criminal investigators examining the Enron debacle have expanded their inquiry to focus on activities at the commercial banks that provided billions of dollars in loans and other financial services to the company, according to current and former Enron executives and others involved in the investigation.
 Federal prosecutors are investigating whether individual bankers illegally benefited from deals involving Enron-related entities, potentially at the expense of their employers, people involved in the case said. A number of bankers have been questioned about such self-dealing, lawyers said, and the government is said to be weighing whether to bring charges in one such matter. 
 The government has also stepped up its examination of an Enron-related partnership called Chewco. The financing for the partnership included loans from Barclays Bank structured in ways that hid them from Enron's auditors, according to Congressional testimony. The discovery of the hidden loans ultimately played a central role in the financial crisis last fall that led to Enron's collapse. 
The Manhattan district attorney's office, meanwhile, working independently of the federal Enron task force, has opened its own inquiry into an array of transactions and financial institutions tied to Enron. According to current and former Enron executives who have been questioned by the Manhattan investigators, these include a series of deals between Enron and J. P. Morgan Chase that have been described in private lawsuits as disguised loans to the energy company.
While investigators for the district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, have begun interviewing witnesses in Houston, where Enron is based, and overseas, the Manhattan prosecutors do not appear to be close to bringing any charges, people involved in the case said. There is no indication that the banks themselves are targets of the inquiry.
Combined with the recent conviction of Enron's former accountant, Arthur Andersen, these latest lines of inquiry signal that investigators are putting the conduct of the company's financial advisers under a harsh light, even as they consider bringing charges of fraud and related crimes against Enron's former top executives.
Banks had complex financial relationships with Enron, and the full details of those only began to emerge amid the debris of the collapsed company. Like most companies, Enron borrowed money to finance its operations. But banks also provided cash for the company's off-the-books partnerships and for outside investors in those entities. Some financial institutions and bankers were themselves investors in the partnerships.
Major New York banks, meanwhile, engaged in circular trades with Enron that allowed the company to obtain billions of dollars in loans without disclosing them to shareholders, according to trading records and court documents.
The federal investigation of banking matters related to Enron stepped up in recent weeks, even as much of the Justice Department's task force on the scandal was occupied with the long-running criminal prosecution of Andersen.
According to people involved in the case, some of that effort was handled behind the scenes by William Kimball, a task force prosecutor who specializes in securities-related cases. Mr. Kimball, an assistant United States attorney in San Francisco, has long worked with Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Washington-based task force.
Mr. Kimball was said to be focusing on matters related to Chewco, which was formed by an Enron financial executive in 1997 to engage in transactions with Enron. Under accounting rules, at least 3 percent of Chewco's capital had to come from independent investors for Enron to keep the partnership's financial results off the company's books. 
At least part of the outside equity for Chewco purportedly came from Barclays through an entity called Big River, whose sole member was another entity called Little River. But Andersen learned that the money from Barclays was actually a loan secured by $6.6 million in cash collateral.
Since the supposed equity investment was actually a loan, Andersen insisted that Chewco failed the 3 percent test and its finances had to be consolidated with those of Enron -- a decision that was a big factor in a huge restatement of Enron's financial results last November.
In recent weeks, Mr. Kimball, the prosecutor, was said to have been interviewing numerous participants involved in the structuring of the Chewco transaction, including bankers from Barclays. Telephone calls to a bank spokesman went unanswered late yesterday. However, a spokesman for the bank had previously said that it did not believe that there was "any basis" for a claim against it. Bank officials have also said there was no personal investment by Barclays executives in the deal.
Separately, according to people involved in the case, bankers interviewed by the government have repeatedly been pressed about whether they enriched themselves in dealings with people or entities related to Enron. 
In an instance involving at least one American bank, these people said, prosecutors have discovered evidence of such self-dealing, and were said to be deciding whether to bring indictments. The identity of the bank and the employees involved could not be immediately determined.
The investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office has been proceeding for at least several weeks. Witnesses said that they had been questioned about transactions between Enron and Morgan that involved an off-shore entity known as Mahonia Ltd. In addition, at least two witnesses were asked by investigators about a transaction that involved Citigroup and an off-shore entity called Delta. 
Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for Morgan, declined to comment, as did Daniel Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup. 
Mr. Morgenthau, who has a long-established reputation for fierce independence, has frequently investigated both banking matters and cases involving off-shore financial maneuvers. At this stage, people involved in the case said, his investigation appeared to be completely independent of the federal inquiry. 
In the Mahonia deals, according to records of the transactions and energy industry experts, Enron appears to have used natural gas trades with a series of offshore companies linked to Morgan to move hundreds of millions of dollars in loans off its books.
The gas-trading transactions have led to charges in bankruptcy court that Enron and Morgan intentionally misrepresented the nature of the deals to obtain surety bonds from insurance companies. With Enron's collapse, the insurers, including the St. Paul Companies and Liberty Mutual, are balking at making payment.
The transactions involved a web of corporations -- several of them based in the Channel Islands -- including Mahonia and Stoneville Aegean Ltd. that at first blush seem independent but whose records show are linked companies with ties to Morgan.
The companies traded gas in a circle, with Enron both being required to deliver the commodity on a future date and being owed the same amount of gas for delivery on the same date at the same price. 
The transactions involving Citigroup and Delta, which is based in the Cayman Islands, functioned in a similar way, according to a lawsuit filed by Enron shareholders. According to that suit, Citigroup used Delta to carry out $2.4 billion of financial "swaps" with Enron that "perfectly replicated loans and were, in fact, loans," but were not disclosed on Enron's books.
One current Enron official who reviewed the deal said that it was done to improve the company's cash flow through a transaction that appeared on the books as a trading liability rather than as debt. That helped Enron in its dealings with the rating agencies, the official said.
The Manhattan investigators have obtained documents related to both the Mahonia and Delta transactions, according to current and former Enron executives who have been interviewed. 
Some of those witnesses have also recently been interviewed by investigators from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

HEADLINE: Reduction In Budget Cut Relieves Arts Groups 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
After years of strong budget support from the city, arts groups will have to weather a cut in funds under the municipal budget adopted last week. 
 But the 5 percent reduction agreed to by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council is a vast improvement over the 15 percent cut initially proposed by the mayor, arts groups say, particularly considering that the city has a $5 billion deficit to close and a downtown to rebuild. 
 "Given the extremis this city is in, I think this is as good as we can expect," said David E. McKinney, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has seen the number of visitors drop significantly since Sept. 11, though attendance is beginning to climb back up. 
In dollar terms, the original cuts of $19.1 million to the Cultural Affairs Department's $127 million budget were reduced to $6 million. Arts professionals say the restoration makes a major statement about the importance of culture to the mayor and to the mostly new city council members as they completed their first, difficult budget negotiations. 
"We are very pleased," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, chairwoman of the Cultural Institutions Group, which represents 34 organizations whose buildings or land are owned in whole or part by the city. 
"What this means is jobs, services and programs are going to be saved," added Ms. Hopkins, who is also president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "I don't know about all of them, but some of them."
It is still unclear how cultural projects in the city's capital budget will fare -- the recent agreement covered only the expense budget -- and many of the city's cultural groups are waiting anxiously for that verdict since they have ambitious building projects under way or in the planning stages. The New York Hall of Science in Queens, for example, is six months into its first significant expansion since the 1964 World's Fair, a $68 million project, 60 percent of which is being financed by the city.
The cut to the expense budget is expected to be applied in equal proportions to each of the Cultural Institutions Group members -- like Carnegie Hall, the Bronx County Historical Society and the Staten Island Botanical Garden -- and to the more than 500 cultural institutions that make up the so-called "program group" of organizations that are not city-owned. These programs were also cut 5 percent, down from 13.4 percent.
"Reducing a 15 percent cut to 5 percent is an accomplishment," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide arts advocacy group. "In the context of the revenue gap, I think the cultural community did O.K." 
Even in the flush years of 2000 through 2002, the preliminary cultural budget cut proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reached as much as 24 percent, although the council then restored that money. This year's restoration, say those involved, was accomplished relatively harmoniously, at a time when numerous other groups, from the Fire Department to social service agencies, were campaigning ardently to preserve their programs. They attribute the success in part to a mayor who has demonstrated a philanthropic commitment to culture, a council that has traditionally supported cultural groups and a more aggressive lobbying effort on the part of cultural institutions. 
In April the Cultural Institutions Group hired a new lobbyist, Ethan Geto, who has relationships with many of the deputy mayors and has represented cultural groups. In addition the group enlisted organized labor to a greater degree than in the past, since many employees at cultural institutions are union members. It was the first time, Mr. Geto said, that the cultural groups had coordinated strategy with District Council 37, the largest municipal union. 
Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, A.F.L.-C.I.O., the umbrella group that represents the city's unions, also actively advocated for the cultural industry. "This is an organizational first for us," he said. "It was clear to me this was a role the labor movement should be playing on an ongoing basis."
Mr. McLaughlin wrote a strong letter in May to the council, stating in part, "When attendance plummets and workers at the institutions get fired, there will be much less money circulating in many communities in all boroughs."
Cultural groups contacted city officials, meeting with borough delegations, individual council members and the commissioner of cultural affairs, Kate D. Levin, who also advocated for a restoration of money. "It's the first time we've been that proactive," said Lowery Stokes Sims, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem. 
The Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group, held two conferences on the importance of the arts to the New York economy, with one in April specifically for the City Council at Baruch College, where members were each presented with 18-pound briefing books on culture in the city.
"It's the first time the cultural community ever really got together and spoke with one voice," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the alliance.

HEADLINE: Making Bush's Vision Realistic 

BYLINE:  By Dennis Ross; Dennis Ross, envoy to the Middle East in the Clinton administration, is director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After much hesitation and internal debate, President Bush has changed the ground rules on American involvement in ending the conflict in the Middle East. His call for a new Palestinian leadership as well as new democratic institutions and new security measures has raised the bar for Palestinian statehood. His central message is that the Palestinians are not entitled to a state -- they must earn it. 
 Only when the Palestinians demonstrate that they can reform their government can the creation of a state be possible. The Israelis are also called on to respond to a credible Palestinian transformation by negotiating an end to the occupation. 
 The vision Mr. Bush outlined in his speech on Monday is forceful, but it is far more an exhortation for reform than a plan. Even as exhortation it faces significant problems. What happens, for example, if Yasir Arafat, still an important symbol for many Palestinians, is re-elected in free and fair elections early next year? How will President Bush go about making his vision of transformation a reality? Will he give the Palestinian people a way to achieve what they need to achieve? Will his statement this week have any more effect than Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech last fall or his own speech on April 4?
I hope so, but I am doubtful. The words are right, but I do not see the mechanism for connecting diplomacy to the realities on the ground. Secretary Powell has been asked by Mr. Bush to work intensively with others "on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian reform and institution building." Who on the Palestinian side will he work with? In the period before elections and the creation of new institutions, who other than the remnants of the Palestinian Authority can Secretary Powell find to stop the violence? And make no mistake: no diplomatic effort, no reform process, no political talks will have any chance of success if the violence continues, because the day-to-day situation of terrorism and reprisals is a force that will continue to overwhelm any plan. 
Acts of terror like last week's suicide bombings will continue to produce Israeli responses. No country would be passive in the face of such attacks. But the Israeli responses are inevitably placing Palestinian towns, villages and cities -- indeed, the whole Palestinian population -- under an increasingly tight siege. In such circumstances, simple movement, not to mention institutional reform, will be impossible to carry out.
Therefore, the first order of business has to be stopping the violence. The Israelis will not pull back unless they have a reason to believe that the terror will abate. And certainly at this point they will not trust Palestinian promises.
The United States will need to take the lead. In the near term, stopping the terror means working with those Palestinians in the Palestinian Authority who still have the means to fight terror and aiding them as they act to fulfill this mission.
Since it is neither practical nor realistic to assume that such efforts are possible throughout all of the West Bank and Gaza, why not try a rolling approach to new security measures, starting in Gaza? The Palestinian security forces are basically intact in Gaza, and the Israeli presence is far less intrusive there than it is in the West Bank. With Palestinian intellectuals taking out ads in the newspapers calling for a halt to attacks against Israeli civilians, now is a good time to test whether any part of the Palestinian Authority is willing to act forcefully against Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
If the Palestinian security forces do act, a similar effort could begin in different parts of the West Bank. They could start by taking action, for example, in the Jericho area, the only city in the West Bank where the Israeli army currently does not have a presence. If the Palestinians perform adequately in Gaza and Jericho, the Israelis could pull back forces from those areas and eventually from other areas where Palestinian security forces act to counter terrorism. 
This rolling approach could then be linked to the beginnings of a reform process in Palestinian state-building. This approach would not expose the Israelis to new threats of terror and would provide some proof of Palestinian intentions. Equally important will be the readiness of the Palestinian Authority to condemn by name and confront Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades and others. 
Palestinian leaders allied with Mr. Arafat will claim that to confront Hamas and others they need to be able to show the people what will be gained. Mr. Bush is not likely to satisfy this counterdemand. But American support remains important to Palestinian statehood, and he has indicated that such support depends on Palestinian performance. 
At the same time, it is significant that Mr. Bush reiterated his call for a politically and economically viable Palestinian state, with details to be fleshed out in future negotiations. Assuming Palestinian performance, we should insist on reciprocal Israeli moves designed to provide the Palestinians the space to develop. We should also provide financial assistance for Palestinian institutional reforms. 
Of course, the Palestinians have to show the world that there will be only one authority and that independent militias with their own agendas and weapons will not be tolerated. This is the best test of whether statehood is possible in the near future.
If the Palestinians are not ready to accept this challenge, the probable outcome will be Israeli reoccupation of Palestinian areas or unilateral separation. The former is not sustainable over time, and the latter, though more likely, would be an admission that diplomatic solutions are simply unavailable for the foreseeable future. In such a circumstance, the wall that the Israelis have begun to build in the West Bank will be more than just an obstacle to terrorists; it will also dash Palestinian hopes for a viable state any time soon.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Aleading forecaster says this year will be better than expected.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ENCOURAGED by robust ad spending from movie studios and political campaigns and by upturns in the fortunes of broadcast television networks and radio stations, a leading advertising industry forecaster has significantly increased his estimates for this year.
 But before a beleaguered media industry gets too giddy, persistent signs remain that the comeback will continue to be uphill, prompting Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive at the WPP Group in London, the world's largest agency company in revenue and billings, to repeat that a full recovery is unlikely before 2004. 
 The sharply improved estimate was made yesterday by David Peeler, president and chief executive at CMR in New York, the division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending in major media. In January, Mr. Peeler predicted that ad spending in 2002 would rise a scant 1.5 percent from 2001. He has now raised his prediction to 2.5 percent, banking on a second-half gain of 6.2 percent to more than make up for a decline of 0.4 percent in the first half. 
Besides the much higher spending in categories like entertainment and political advertising, Mr. Peeler's optimism is fueled by additional spending in Hispanic media and the stronger-than-expected sales last month of commercial time by the broadcast television networks ahead of the 2002-2003 season, in what is known as the upfront market.
"We took a look at upfront trends over the last five years, and a positive upfront has a positive impact, filtering down into other advertising expenditures," Mr. Peeler said in an interview after he spoke a conference, AdWatch: Outlook 2002, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The broadcast networks took in an estimated $8 billion this year, compared with $7 billion last year.
"Let's keep this in perspective," Mr. Peeler said. "Two-point-five percent up is still down 6.7 percent from 2000," the record year for ad spending, "but it's better than last year," when ad spending tracked by CMR fell 9.8 percent from 2000.
"Someone asked me, 'Should we break out the Champagne?' " he added, laughing, "and I said, 'Yes, but not the Cristal.' "
"If consumer spending were to start to fall off, advertising spending would fall off right behind it," Mr. Peeler added. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, and marketers will often reduce their ad budgets if they think consumers are beginning to keep their wallets and purses closed.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that consumer confidence declined to a four-month low in June, impaired by worries over employment and corporate scandals. Though such a decline was expected, further declines could start to slow consumer spending.
Also, "some devastating event in the Mideast or along the lines of 9/11 could potentially derail what we're seeing now," Mr. Peeler said.
"Sept. 11 caused $300 million to leave the marketplace in one week," he added. That is the estimated value of commercial time and ad space canceled by marketers immediately after the terrorist attack.
One of those attending the Adwatch conference, Christopher Dixon, global strategist for media at UBS Warburg in New York, said he was struck by Mr. Peeler's "categorization of the movie industry as constantly creating new brands, as each new movie that comes out accounts for $10 million, $20 million, $30 million in ad spending."
"The movie business has been pretty strong so far this year," Mr. Dixon said, pointing to the strong box-office performances of films like "The Bourne Identity," "Lilo and Stitch," "Minority Report," "Spider-Man" and "The Sum of All Fears," "and the power of the box office is having a little more impact on advertising" than had been anticipated.
Mr. Dixon also said he was impressed that, according to CMR data, almost $100 million has been spent year to date on political advertising, with the bulk -- an estimated $900 million or more -- still to come in September, October and November.
"Political advertising is a big stimulus for several media," he said, "particularly spot television" in local markets.
In terms of specific media, results vary widely.
For instance, in April, radio enjoyed its largest monthly increase in revenue, 4 percent, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York. Until that gain, radio revenue had trailed results from 2001; now, they are even with last year.
The good news continued the next month.
"Our discussions with management teams across the industry indicate May, a traditionally strong month, was up approximately 4 percent," Paul Sweeny, an analyst who follows the radio industry for Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, wrote in a report released yesterday. "We also see indications that June and July will also be strong."
As a result, Mr. Sweeny said, he expects radio revenue this year to rise 4 percent to 5 percent from 2001. Mr. Peeler's estimate is even higher, calling for a gain of 6.7 percent.
Among other media, CMR now predicts the largest gains in ad spending in 2002 will come for Spanish-language TV networks like Univision and Telemundo, up 10.4 percent; spot TV, up 8.9 percent; radio; local newspapers, up 5.7 percent; and the Internet, up 5.3 percent.
At an annual conference last week for publishing executives and investors, top managers said they thought that ad spending was improving for newspapers, but that they were worried about how strong the recovery would be.
Among media that CMR projects will take in less ad revenue than last year are business-to-business magazines, down 11.4 percent; consumer and Sunday newspaper magazines, down 2.8 percent; and national newspapers, down 1.7 percent.
As for Sir Martin, he repeated remarks he made at the WPP annual meeting on Monday: that the rebound in ad spending would be slow through 2002 and 2003 and would not gain momentum until 2004, when results would be stimulated strongly by spending for the Summer Olympics and the presidential election.
Mr. Dixon of UBS Warburg characterized Sir Martin's forecast of a shallow recovery as "a more somber outlook than some others," adding, "He's trying to be very cautious and manage down expectations."

HEADLINE: African Opportunity 

 BODY:
Africa has enjoyed too few of globalization's benefits and suffered too many of its costs. The continent's future should get the attention it deserves at this week's summit of Group of 8 democracies in Canada. On the table Thursday will be an African proposal for a new economic bargain that should push President Bush, the leaders of seven other industrialized nations and the presidents of South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal and possibly Algeria beyond the usual platitudes about cooperation. 
 The proposal, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, resembles Mr. Bush's plan for directing increased American foreign aid to countries following enlightened policies. African nations would commit to fair elections, respect for human rights, better education and health care, and financial accountability. Western countries would deliver more aid, freer trade and increased private investment. Mechanisms still to be spelled out would review performance on both sides. To be credible, the reviewers must be fully independent of government. African leaders in particular have too readily excused each other's shortcomings in the name of African solidarity. 
 Africa's record of political and economic achievement has been mixed in recent years. Multiparty elections have increased dramatically, but not all of them have been free and fair. Earlier this year, Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, used fraud and violence to rig his re-election. In contrast, Mozambique, Botswana, Senegal and Ghana, among others, have held admirably honest elections. Several countries, including Ghana, Uganda and Mozambique, have followed market-based economic policies with generally successful results. Elsewhere, in places like Nigeria and Angola, pervasive corruption has cheated ordinary citizens and discouraged needed investment. 
Two spokesmen for the proposed new economic partnership with the West, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, have damaged their credibility by failing to press effectively for new elections in Zimbabwe. Mr. Mbeki also sabotaged health care in his country by opposing, until very recently, the use of drugs that block transmission from mothers to children of the virus that causes AIDS, while Mr. Obasanjo has failed to curb corruption and has tolerated serious human rights abuses by Nigeria's armed forces. 
The G-8 leaders need to raise these issues with their African guests, although Mr. Bush seems to be the only one inclined to do so. They should also be prepared to direct ample resources to Africa's decently governed countries.

HEADLINE: Right Stuff for an Airline Loan: Political Pull 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25 

 BODY:
As it scrambled early this month to put together an application for $900 million in federal loan guarantees that it says are vital to its survival, US Airways encountered a more immediate problem: a provision in a Senate spending bill that would have cut the size of the loan guarantee program.
 So US Airways began a lobbying onslaught that drew on all the political leverage enjoyed by a major employer with operations in many states, a record as a generous campaign contributor and a claim to being a part of the nation's transportation backbone. 
 Because it has major hubs in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, it quickly lined up support from the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation. The governor of Pennsylvania, Mark Schweiker, wrote to President Bush. Members of both parties from other states where the carrier has a presence, including North Carolina and Virginia, pledged their support. The airline's employees called, faxed and e-mailed their pleas to Capitol Hill, saying it would be unfair to scale back the program. 
The Senate then voted 91-to-4 a few weeks ago to strip out the provision, removing an obstacle to the airline's getting what it wanted.
But US Airways still faces hurdles, including a provision in the House version of the spending bill that would delay any further loan guarantees until the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, maybe too late to keep the airline out of bankruptcy proceedings. 
Even if it irons out the problems it faces in Congress, US Airways -- and other struggling airlines that have applied for government help, including United, a unit of UAL, which on Monday sought $1.8 billion in loan guarantees -- must then persuade a federal panel to grant the assistance.
When it was conceived in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the loan guarantee program enjoyed bipartisan support and was widely seen as a measured response -- along with $5 billion in cash aid disbursed to the airline industry -- to the brief grounding of air traffic after the attacks and the slide in air travel.
But Washington has since become somewhat divided about the program, forcing carriers seeking aid to take an aggressive stance toward convincing Congress and the panel, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, that they really need and deserve the help.
"Generally speaking, the administration is disinclined to carry out the program with vigor," said John Heimlich, director of economic and market research for the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's trade group. "They strongly believe in pure market solutions. Having said that, I think they will faithfully execute the law."
Congress has considered cutting or delaying the program. The Bush administration has left some industry executives and analysts with the impression that it is ideologically uncomfortable dispensing government aid to industry and unhappy at the prospect of picking winners and losers in a free market. And while more airlines are seeking help through the program after leaving it untapped in the months after Sept. 11, healthy carriers and foreign competitors have said they are upset at the idea of their rivals receiving government subsidies.
Analysts say United and, to a lesser extent, US Airways stand a good chance of winning the loan guarantees. One previous applicant, America West, has been successful, receiving $380 million in loan guarantees late last year, but only after agreeing to strict terms, including granting the government a chance to acquire up to 30 percent of the company. 
Two smaller carriers were turned down. Applications from four airlines -- Evergreen International, Spirit Airlines, National Airlines and American Trans Air -- are pending.
United and US Airways have the advantage of size. They serve hundreds of airports and have thousands of jobs on the line at a time when the administration is keenly sensitive to the political implications of the weak economic recovery. And no administration wants to be responsible for turmoil among airlines during the summer vacation season.
"Under the guidelines, the way they're written, United qualifies because if it hadn't been for the terrorist attacks, they wouldn't have been in as much distress," said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University in Washington. 
"US Airways will get it because they're in the state of Virginia, in Pennsylvania and North Carolina," Mr. Jenkins said. "That's six senators and 30 congressmen. No ifs, ands or buts -- they'll both get it. This thing is, in fact, political now, because it's Washington and everything is political."
But other experts said neither United nor US Airways was likely to have an easy time with the stabilization board, and might end up with less than they are asking for. They said America West was forced into intensive negotiations over its application and ultimately agreed to much tougher terms for the loan guarantees than it had first sought. 
Betsy Hollohan, a board spokeswoman, said the panel would "walk a fine line between helping the air carriers that need the help and protecting the interests of taxpayers."
Both US Airways and United said they expected their applications to stand on the merits.
"We've presented a viable business plan," said Susana Leyva, a spokeswoman for United. "It's not a political issue, it's a financial issue."
David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways, said, "They want assurances we can pay back the loan, and we're going to give them assurances that we can pay back the loan."
But Mr. Castelveter said the carrier would also continue to make its case in the political arena.
"Our elected officials realize how important this is to us and the constituents in the districts they represent," he said. "We would be happy to see our loan application approved by whatever means that takes."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: GROUP OF 8; 
Bush, in Canada, Is Facing Skepticism on Arafat's Role

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta, June 25 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived here tonight for the annual summit meeting of major industrialized nations, but instead of basking in compliments for his actions to combat terrorism, he faced skepticism over his demand that Yasir Arafat be replaced. 
 Mr. Bush got a first taste of the diplomatic dance he is likely to see more of here when he met this evening with the meeting's host, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada. Mr. Chretien embraced the idea of a "quick election" in the Palestinian territories, but then said: "The president talked about perhaps it will be better to replace Mr. Arafat. I don't have the specific point of view on that." 
 Mr. Bush himself said little about his speech today. Asked about Israel's continued incursions into the West Bank, he said, "Everybody has got a right to defend themselves," but, sensitive not to tip the balance too far in one direction, quickly added, "There also had to be a vision toward a way forward."
Administration officials professed to be unfazed by the criticism, and aboard Air Force One today Mr. Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said the reaction to the speech "has been good." White House officials appeared to be hearing the parts of the reaction they wanted to hear, just as Arab and European allies seemed to choose only parts of the speech for praise.
But as leaders of the Group of 8 from around the world arrived here tonight and flew by helicopter to Kananaskis, a remote mountain resort 60 miles into the Canadian Rockies where they are sealed off from protesters and the press, there was little doubt that Mr. Bush's attempt to force Mr. Arafat from power would dominate the unscripted moments of the meeting. 
France, Germany and the European Union all criticized some aspects of Mr. Bush's approach before their leaders arrived here, even while praising the president for setting a loose timeline of three years for the creation of a Palestinian state and for calling for Israel's eventual withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders.
But it was clear that Mr. Bush, who obviously hoped for an endorsement of his Mideast approach by the leaders here, will have to argue his case. "I would not be surprised if the leaders discussed with the president their thoughts about the speech," Mr. Fleischer said.
Among the skeptics it is clear he will have to convince is Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, who is due here late on Wednesday. Mr. Annan warned today that the American insistence on free elections among the Palestinian people could easily backfire. "You could find yourself in a situation that the radicals are the ones that get elected, and it would be the result of a democratic process and we have to accept that," Mr. Annan said.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who will join the political discussions here but not the economic strategy sessions, said before he left Moscow that it would be "dangerous and mistaken" to remove Mr. Arafat because doing so "would only radicalize the Palestinian movement." 
What makes the dynamic at this meeting potentially the most interesting, though, is that Mr. Bush and the rest of the leaders will be arguing not only over Mideast policy, but also over a broad agenda of other differences that were submerged for months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
At the summit meeting last year in Genoa, Mr. Bush and his allies promised to pick up the pieces on their differences over the Kyoto protocol on global warming, but in the year since there has been little progress.
Trade tensions have worsened: European leaders made it clear they believe Mr. Bush has turned his back on his commitment to free markets by blocking steel imports and raising subsidies to farmers. 
"I very much rely on the Canadians to be more outspoken here when it comes to criticizing" the United States, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, told reporters as he visited Mr Chretien. "Because I -- speaking not only for Germany, but also for Europe -- have to say that we who sit in glass houses should ideally not be throwing stones."
Perhaps in an effort to defuse the criticism before it starts, Mr. Bush's trade officials have been rapidly issuing exemptions from the steel tariffs. That allows the president to argue at home that he acted to protect the American steel industry, and tell his allies that their most important products will not be affected. 
But today Robert S. Miller Jr., the chairman of Bethlehem Steel, charged that "granting a large number of exemptions will negate the original purpose of the president's imposition of tariffs -- the recovery of the American steel industry." 
The Europeans are also complaining that the farm bill that Mr. Bush signed last month will greatly increase American subsidies to farmers. The Europeans, Canada and Japan do the same, of course -- today Canada was found in violation of World Trade Organization rules governing dairy supports. But Mr. Bush has seriously undercut his argument that these subsidies should be gradually eliminated.
Of course, these differences will be politely couched in public: since the summit meetings began in 1975, there has been an unwritten rule that the leaders emphasize their common goals, which in this case will include increasing aid to Africa and working out a common method of increasing airplane security. 
The summit meetings were also created to keep the global economy from veering off course, and there is concern that the major economies may be headed for more trouble. 
The sharp fall in the American stock market, along with renewed financial crises in Latin America and yet another year with little sign of economic recovery in Japan, are rekindling concern that whatever economic progress seemed under way early this year has ended.

HEADLINE: The View From Tehran 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
So a senior Iranian official is explaining to me how the world looks from Tehran: Let's see, he says, Iran helps the U.S. organize the Northern Alliance, a longtime Iranian ally, to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan -- a regime Iran staunchly opposed. ("We are civilized fundamentalists," unlike the Taliban, sniffed an Iranian official.) Once the Taliban were out, Iran quietly aided the U.S. in forming the interim government in Kabul. Not a single Iranian was involved in Sept. 11, not a single Iranian has been found in Al Qaeda, and Iran's nuclear reactor is under international inspection. Iran has the most democracy and freest press of any Muslim country in the Middle East. And as a thank you, President Bush labeled Iran part of the "axis of evil."
 Pakistan, meanwhile, created the Taliban, gave sanctuary to members of Al Qaeda, supported Islamist terrorists in Kashmir, built an Islamic nuclear bomb, and its leader, a military dictator, got $1 billion in aid from America. Saudi Arabia financed the Taliban, has hundreds of its citizens in Al Qaeda, has private charities that support Hamas and Islamic Jihad, funds Islamic fundamentalist schools all over the world, was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers of 9/11, has no democracy, and its leader, Crown Prince Abdullah, was invited to President Bush's ranch. 
 I confess, I did laugh when it was all put that way. But I am not here to defend Iran, which has supported terrorism both against its own citizens and abroad. I would, though, defend the notion that Iran is the one Muslim Middle East country that is politically alive, full of ferment, with certain overlapping interests with the U.S., and worth a fresh look as to how it might be nudged in the right direction -- not just branded evil and ignored.
Iran has three power centers. There is Iran-E -- the evil conservative clerics, intelligence services and shock troops of the regime, who still have a monopoly on all the tools of coercion and are responsible for Iran's support for Hamas and Islamic Jihad and the killing of Iranian intellectuals a few years ago. Then there is Iran-C -- the rational conservatives among the clerics and bazaari merchants, who backed the Islamic revolution out of a real revulsion for the Shah's secular despotism, but who favor democracy and the rule of law. For now, Iran-C is aligned with Iran-E.
Finally, there is Iran-R, all the reformers -- the economically strapped middle class, the rising student generation and former revolutionaries who are fed up with clerical rule. They want more democracy and less imposed religion, and are leading the opposition in Parliament, but have the least power.
That's why the key to peaceful change in Iran is a break within the conservative ruling elite. The key is to get Iran-C, the rational conservatives, to break with Iran-E, the dark conservatives, and forge a new alliance with the reformers. It's not impossible. There are many members of Iran-C who realize that clerical rule -- particularly of the incompetent, isolating and arbitrary variety found in Iran today -- is increasingly resented by the population and could eventually threaten the whole Islamic revolution.
What can the U.S. do? Most reformers said they would be helped by the U.S. resuming diplomatic ties and easing economic sanctions. Others told me the U.S. should go to the U.N. and publicly identify, with evidence, any Iranian officials involved in terrorism. "We ourselves don't know who's doing what, and if the U.S. put out the names it would freeze these people inside," said one reformer. (When an Iranian cleric recently proposed a small new tax to support the Palestinian uprising, it was rejected by the Iranian Parliament.) Others said the U.S. should speak up in defense of every Iranian who wants to run for office, or start a newspaper, and is being blocked by the clerics. The clerics claim Iran is a Muslim democracy, and America should constantly challenge them to prove it.
I don't know if all this advice is correct, but I do know that Iran is in flux and worth a new look from Washington -- not because the dark forces here are innocent of supporting terrorism, but because they are guilty of it; not because it would strengthen those dark forces, but because many here think it would weaken them; not because Iranians themselves have been unwilling to courageously confront those dark forces, but because they have; not because it would delay the demise of those dark forces, but because it might just hasten it.

HEADLINE: A Threat of Derailment 

 BODY:
Reckless brinkmanship in Washington is threatening to disrupt the Northeast's economy and jeopardize millions of Americans' summer travel. The Bush administration has said it will find a way to provide Amtrak with the $200 million it needs to hobble on until the end of the current fiscal year, but it has yet to do so. David Gunn, Amtrak's president, has warned that without a transfusion, the railroad will be forced to shut down. 
 Apart from its failure to attend to Amtrak's immediate needs, the administration has been sluggish about proposing a national rail policy. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta has generally endorsed ideas offered in February by the Congressionally established Amtrak Reform Council. These include ceding policy making to the states while ending Amtrak's passenger monopoly and its ownership of the Northeast corridor tracks. Yet he was alarmingly vague on how to move from today's crisis to the brave new world of competitive rail travel. 
 Amtrak has been starved of investment capital since 1971, when the government freed the railroads of the burden of passenger service. It has also done a mediocre job of serving its customers and managing its finances. Mr. Gunn, Amtrak's president since only May 15, has already begun to reorganize the company, establish more credible accounting and trim layers of management. Mr. Gunn may have to agree to further reforms in exchange for a bailout, but Mr. Mineta must not use this emergency to advance the administration's privatization agenda. Once the immediate shutdown has been prevented, he must join Congress in determining what kind of passenger rail system the nation needs. 
Amtrak has requested $1.2 billion for the next fiscal year. Mr. Mineta says he does not want to go beyond the $521 million it received this year. That is shortsighted. The railroad ought to obtain full funding while a long-term strategy is developed. Essential to that strategy is high-speed rail service in corridors like the Boston-to-Washington route. Congress must then decide whether it wants to pay for less essential coast-to-coast service. 
For too long, Congress and the railroad's previous management perpetuated the fantasy that Amtrak could be self-sufficient. No other transportation system is. The danger is that the administration may be about to trade in one fantasy for another. The new fantasy is that Amtrak can be killed off because there are private train operators eagerly awaiting their chance to compete and states with surplus funds to devote to rail.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Gives Itself 2 Weeks, in a Lightless Tunnel 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25 

 BODY:
Amtrak officials said tonight that they had found enough cash to operate for about two more weeks but warned that continued inaction by the White House and Congress would force the railroad to shut down by July 8 or 9.
 Several days of intensive negotiations with the White House have resulted in promises of about $100 million in loan guarantees, about half of what the nation's passenger railroad needs, said David L. Gunn, the new president of Amtrak. Democrats in Congress have made progress on an emergency infusion of cash for Amtrak, but in neither case have proposals moved far enough to insure continued operations, Mr. Gunn said. 
 "At this point, none of the proposals have gelled to the point where we can take it to the bank," Mr. Gunn told reporters. "I spoke to the commuter agencies today and told them we're working with both the administration and Congress to try to resolve the issue, but I did give them a time line for a shutdown based on our current cash projections."
Because it would take about four days to shut down the railroad, he said Amtrak would decide by July 4 or 5 whether to close down four days later. Passengers planning July 4 vacations can safely buy tickets as long as they are planning to return by July 8, he said.
A shutdown of Amtrak would strand not only its 60,000 daily customers but also hundreds of thousands of commuters on state-operated lines like New Jersey Transit, which use Amtrak's switches and tracks.
For the last two days, high-ranking Bush administration officials have repeatedly said they would not allow Amtrak to stop running, but Mr. Gunn said tonight that the administration had found nowhere near the $200 million the railroad needed. Beyond the $100 million or so in loan guarantees, Mr. Gunn said the White House had asked Amtrak to consider a series of measures, like collecting debts more quickly or mortgaging Union Station in Chicago, none of which he said would help.
"We listened to their ideas, and while I wouldn't say it was a dry hole, there wasn't a lot of water in it," Mr. Gunn said. "We can't just make up the rest of the $200 million."
Without being specific, administration officials said they believed a solution was near.
"No one wants to see Amtrak die," said Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation. "We're very, very close to coming to a solution to help Amtrak."
Separately today, supporters of Amtrak in Congress -- mostly Democrats and Northeastern Republicans -- worked to insert $205 million for the railroad into an antiterrorism spending bill. But the bill became the subject of partisan squabbling and horse-trading between the houses, and it was not clear whether it could be passed in time.
In a letter to President Bush, 45 Senate Democrats, 4 Republicans and an independent said a shutdown of Amtrak and associated commuter railroads would produce chaos and cripple the economy. An overhaul of the railroad is legitimate, they said, but only after its immediate cash crisis has passed.
House Republicans offered to consider the request in exchange for getting their way on an antiterrorism spending bill. But the Bush administration said little about its plans, saying only that a bailout of Amtrak would have to be accompanied by significant changes that could make Amtrak profitable.
"We are determined to keep Amtrak service going but also to see the beginning of change from Amtrak," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in an interview.
Referring to the Amtrak board, Mr. Daniels continued: "This board, very honestly, if they were serving in a private capacity, would have probably been forced to resign, if not face severe sanctions at this point. Taxpayers are going to be hit for more money for Amtrak, so it is time for Amtrak to begin to change."
Mr. Gunn said the White House did not insist on huge changes in exchange for an aid package but had not come through with the full amount. That reluctance infuriated several Amtrak supporters in the Senate, 17 of whom gathered in the Capitol to denounce the tepid support for a national railroad system.
"This is not a complicated problem," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. "It takes one simple thing, for the president to lead. After 9/11, when the airlines were starting to shut down, the president led and Congress led, and stood up and said we're going to come up with $15 billion. Now all the president has to do is raise his hand and say, '$205 million, a very good idea, send me it immediately.' "
But some Senate Republicans, including Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, said the government should not bail out Amtrak, and House Republican leaders were even blunter in their disdain for the railroad and its three decades of dependence on the federal treasury. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said he had no particular affection for the railroad and referred to its partisans as a "parochial" pressure group interested in their corner of the world.
"There are a lot of members of the House of Representatives who don't have all this heartfelt affection for Amtrak," Mr. Armey said, "and they keep wondering about the number of years that we have tried to sustain this operation that doesn't seem to be able to get on a profitable basis."

HEADLINE: In the Role Of Manager At the Public Theater 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
In the latest attempt to establish effective two-pronged leadership at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the board has named Mara Manus executive director to share the helm with the producer, George C. Wolfe.
 "We think she's the ideal choice because she combines an incredibly strong financial background and at the same time has spent her life on the creative side of the business," said Kenneth B. Lerer, chairman. 
 Ms. Manus, who starts her new post in August, has her work cut out for her; the Public has spent the last year trying to get its house in order after two costly Broadway flops, projected budget deficits and the departure of two key donors from the board in protest over management. In addition, the theater has started a $50 million building-improvement plan, which may include the construction of a new 499-seat theater at its East Village home. 
The previous executive director, Fran Reiter, left last fall after less than a year in the job because she clashed with Mr. Wolfe and other Public Theater executives. Earlier attempts to have someone run the business side at a lower level were also unsuccessful. 
Nevertheless, in an interview yesterday at the Ford Foundation, where she is a program officer for economic development, Ms. Manus, 42, said she expected to have sufficient authority to make a significant impact. "We both report to the board," Ms. Manus said. "I wouldn't be leaving this job if I didn't think it could work."
A theater "needs to be as institutionally strong as it is artistically strong," she added.
Although she has never run a theater, Ms. Manus said she felt that the position "capitalized on my nonprofit management strengths, my love of art and working with artists." 
Before joining the Ford Foundation in 1998, Ms. Manus spent four years as president and executive director of Chrysalis, a nonprofit organization in Los Angeles that helps poor people enter and re-enter the work force. At Chrysalis, Ms. Manus helped eliminate a deficit and increase the budget from $1 million to $3.8 million. 
"Nonprofits are businesses," she said. "They have a double bottom line" -- to secure the artistic mission and the financial stability of the institution.
From 1991 to 1995 Ms. Manus worked as a production executive at MCA/Universal Pictures, Azoff Entertainment and TransPacific Films. While her grant-making work at the Ford Foundation has been concentrated on work force development, Ms. Manus says about 80 percent of her loan portfolio has involved arts groups around the country, including theaters, dance companies and museums. 
Part of the appeal of the Public job, Ms. Manus said, was the opportunity to apply what she has learned about the similarities between nonprofit organizations in general and nonprofit arts groups in particular. "I realized crises were not the result of a bad season," she said, but in fact were issues related to the lack of management capacity, board governance, overhead costs and debt. 
Raised in Manhattan, Ms. Manus is one of three daughters born to Janet Wilkens Manus, a literary agent, and Justin Manus, an attorney. She earned a bachelor's degree in communications at Stanford University in 1981 and an executive education certificate in nonprofit management from Harvard Business School in 1997.
As to the role Mr. Wolfe should play in running the Public as distinct from her own, Ms. Manus said: "Ultimately, artists should be doing art and not be running institutions, just as executive directors should not be mounting productions."
Although Mr. Wolfe has said in the past that he welcomed the idea of being relieved of some administrative tasks, Public Theater executives have said Mr. Wolfe had difficulty delegating key business decisions and sharing power. Thus, the Public Theater has been something of a one-man operation, compared with, for example, the Manhattan Theater Club, run by Lynne Meadow and Barry Grove, and Lincoln Center Theater, run by Andre Bishop and Bernard Gersten. 
Carol Fineman, a spokeswoman for the Public, said Mr. Wolfe could not be reached but relayed this e-mail comment from him: "I'm very excited about Mara joining the Public Theater as the new executive director. She has all the qualities that you look for in a professional partnership and collaboration. She is open, available, generous, very direct, very smart and a true leader. I could not be happier."

HEADLINE: Spam: An Escalating Attack of the Clones 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
AT 2 a.m., the red squiggle begins to rise. Sharply. 
 The workers sitting in the dimly lighted room barely look up at the white screen on the wall that tracks the deluge of unwanted e-mail to millions of In boxes. They already know it's happening. 
 Their computer monitors are filled with e-mail meant to appeal to the lonely and insecure: Free XXX video. Debt consolidation. Breast enhancement. Viagra. Work from home. Beat cellulite. 
It is the middle of the night on the West Coast, but spam attacks -- e-mail messages sent to multiple addresses often lumped together as "undisclosed recipients" -- are bubbling up from all corners of the Internet. Spam doesn't sleep. 
Click and type. Cut and paste. Save. Export. That is how spam filters are created in the round-the-clock war room run by Brightmail, a company that performs filtering for Internet service providers like Earthlink, MSN and AT&T Worldnet as well as companies trying to keep their e-mail systems unclogged.
In the war room, the steady pulse of keyboard and mouse clicks is punctuated by brief declarations. 
"I got the Viagra," calls out one 20-something employee as he clicks to create a simple filter.
"I need help on the breast enhancement," announces another.
Spammers are like fruit flies. They multiply. They are elusive. Worst of all, they evolve quickly. The most aggressive spammers have become very sophisticated, constantly varying subject lines, "from" addresses and body text.
Joe Long, a war room employee, remembers when times -- and spam -- were simpler. Two years ago, he and his colleagues would sometimes be able to parry all the attacks and clear their to-do list. "That never happens now," Mr. Long said.
For in addition to becoming more sophisticated, spammers have become more prolific. These days, more and more junk e-mail is finding its way into In boxes.
Brightmail says the volume of spam it encounters has almost tripled in the last nine months. The company adds that 12 to 15 percent of total e-mail traffic is spam; a year ago, that figure was closer to 7 percent. Brightmail, which maintains a network of In boxes to attract spam, now records 140,000 spam attacks a day, each potentially involving thousands of messages, if not millions. 
Statistics like these are supported by anecdotal evidence from computer users, who report that they are seeing more unwanted e-mail every time they log on. Hounded by spam, some computer users have simply abandoned e-mail addresses.
No one knows precisely why spamming has increased so much. One reason may be that it is an inexpensive form of marketing favored in a slumping economy.
Another may be that it is relatively simple to do -- it is not much harder to send one million e-mail messages than it is to send one.
But some analysts say that the increase may also result, paradoxically, from the efforts to curb spam. A kind of arms race may have developed, those analysts say: the more efforts are made to block unwanted e-mail, the more messages spammers send to be sure that some will get through.
Whatever the reasons, individual complaints about e-mail are echoed by Internet service providers, some of which say that 50 percent of incoming e-mail traffic is spam. 
Consumer advocates and politicians are complaining too, and proposing new laws to fight spam. Governmental agencies are also announcing new initiatives in the battle.
Clearly, spam is a part of electronic communications that everyone loves to hate. But it is also something that no one, it seems, can do much about. Here are the reasons.

Regulation
The Federal Trade Commission currently receives 40,000 spam complaints a day at its Web site, www.ftc.gov/spam. It has an e-mail address, uce@ftc.gov ("uce" stands for "unsolicited commercial e-mail"), to which people can forward spam e-mail that they receive. To date, the commission has collected more than 12 million such messages, which are kept in what is affectionately known as the refrigerator, a computer database in the commission's Internet lab. 
But the commission cannot and does not regulate unsolicited commercial e-mail. There are currently no federal laws against spam.
Spam is a form of commercial speech. While commercial speech enjoys some protection under the First Amendment, it is also subject to regulation -- but such regulation needs to be established by legislation. 
So in a majority of spam cases, the trade commission's hands are tied. Even pornographic spam (including that sent to children) falls outside its mandate. 
"We can only do what our statute allows us to do," said Brian Huseman, who coordinates spam issues for the commission. And that statute empowers the commission to fight fraudulent and deceptive marketing practices. 
So the F.T.C. is focusing on the spammers that do fall under its jurisdiction. To date it has filed 32 spam-related fraud cases, including one against a company that sells nonexistent ".usa" domain names and another against a company that distributed programs that forced computer modems to dial international calls. 
Only a fraction of spam is outright fraud; most spam e-mail is aimed at selling legitimate products. Brightmail categorizes only 4 percent of spam attacks as intentionally fraudulent.
The trade commission has tried to extend its definition of "fraudulent" to encompass more than the most blatant fraud. The commission is investigating whether businesses that sell bulk e-mailing tools and lists have deceptive marketing practices. The goal is to cut off spammers' resources. 
The commission also recently sent warning letters to companies that have nonworking "remove me" options at the bottom of their e-mail messages. (A commission survey showed that 63 percent of "remove me" options either did not work or resulted in even more e-mail.) 
However, the F.T.C.'s definition of what constitutes fraud is very specific. For example, a false subject line ("As you requested" or "Human Resource Policy changes") or a false return address does not legally constitute fraud. The e-mail's content must actually be misleading in a way that affects consumers. 
"Just because it's false doesn't mean it's deceptive under our statute," Mr. Huseman said.

Federal Legislation
Ideally, consumer advocates want the spam equivalent of the 1991 federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which prohibited prerecorded telemarketing calls and junk faxes. The trade commission was also given power to enforce the legislation. 
A broad anti-spam law has been approved in Europe. On May 30, the European Parliament passed a ban on unsolicited commercial messaging. Electronic marketing can be aimed only at consumers who have given prior consent. 
In contrast, more than a dozen spam-related bills have been introduced in Congress over the last two years, and most of them have languished. Of the handful that have made progress, the most recent is the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing act (a contorted title that yields the acronym Can Spam), which was unanimously approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last month. The Can Spam bill would, among other things, let the F.T.C. impose civil fines up to $10 per unlawful message, require valid "remove me" options on all e-mail and authorize state attorneys general to bring lawsuits. 
Now it must be voted upon by the full Senate, and two other independent spam bills are moving slowly through the House of Representatives. But interest groups are lobbying to tone down the strongest aspects of spam legislation.
Those lobbyists are not spammers. They are some of the country's largest corporations and commercial associations: Citicorp, Charles Schwab, Procter & Gamble, the National Retail Federation, the Securities Industry Association and the American Insurance Association. The groups argue that many of the bills would unfairly restrict e-mail marketing and put electronic commerce at a disadvantage. 
"We would like the bill narrowed so only pornographic, fraudulent and deceptive spam are targeted," said John Savercool, the vice president of federal affairs for the American Insurance Association. "We think that is where the consumer angst is." 
But Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, a Republican sponsor of the Can Spam bill, says that consumer frustration goes beyond pornography and fraud. "I get enough applications for credit cards, offers to consolidate my debt and advertising for Viagra in my mailbox," he said. "I don't need it on my computer too." 

Litigation
With little happening in Congress on anti-spam legislation, 25 state governments have taken the lead and passed a variety of spam-related laws. They range from Delaware's 1999 outright ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail to more indirect limitations. Most states ban false return e-mail addresses, require "remove me" provisions or demand labels on sex-related messages. 
But laws, whether federal or state, may serve as a deterrent only when they are enforced. And enforcement of these state anti-spam laws is more the exception than the rule. Despite hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints to state agencies, only Washington State has filed a lawsuit based on anti-spam legislation. Other states that do not have anti-spam laws, like New York, have sued or charged spammers by using laws on deceptive marketing and computer hacking. The cases are pending.
Legal experts say the problems with local spam laws are manifold. First of all, most do not prohibit spam. "Even if the laws were enforced effectively, they wouldn't address most of the spam problem," said David E. Sorkin, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago who runs a site called Spamlaws.com. "The implied message is that if you weren't lying about it, it would be O.K. to spam people." 
Second, spam transcends state (and national) boundaries, and many of the state laws stipulate that they take effect only if a spammer can "reasonably know" that the recipient is a resident of a particular state. 
Third, spammers are elusive. Lawsuits generally need to nail down a physical presence to proceed. When the F.T.C. sent warning letters to spammers with false "remove me" options, more than 20 percent of the letters came back because the addresses registered with the domain names were false. Telemarketers are easier to identify because telemarketing is expensive and as a result, such companies need assets. All a spammer needs for business is a computer, an Internet connection and an inexpensive CD containing spamming software and tens of millions of e-mail addresses.
"Most of the spammers are not wealthy people," said Stephen Kline, a lawyer for the New York State attorney general's office. "It's tough if you are going after someone with very few assets to get restitution for consumers or justify the costs." 
So most spam-related lawsuits have been brought by companies and individuals motivated more by a sense of a crusade than by the prospect of a financial reward. In March, Morrison & Foerster, a California law firm, filed a lawsuit against Etracks, an e-mail marketer, for sending e-mail to its servers. Etracks says that it works with permission-based marketing, a contention that Morrison & Foerster disputes. 
Some I.S.P.'s, including CompuServe and AOL, have filed suit against spammers to prevent them from sending unsolicited e-mail to users of those services. But using lawsuits to combat spammers is like trying to catch swarming fruit flies by hand. For every one you manage to catch, there are 10 more undeterred ones pestering you.

Technology
To date, the most effective weapon against spam is technology. "Spam requires a technology solution because it is a technology problem," said Ken Schneider, chief technology officer at Brightmail. 
But even technology is limited, since spam is e-mail and e-mail is designed to flow easily. Only 5 percent of all enterprises will be able to filter 90 percent of spam in 2002, said Joyce Graff, research director at Gartner Research.
Businesses have tried to throw up all types of defenses. Many reject mail coming from computers that are known to have been hijacked for spam. Some I.S.P.'s reject e-mail sent in bulk. That often results in the rejection of legitimate noncommercial messages sent to addresses on mailing lists. 
Other technological approaches limit e-mail to preapproved senders or senders who respond with a password -- approaches that slow down the transmission of e-mail. Users can also buy personal In box protectors. 
Brightmail, which has one of the most sophisticated services, says the best spammers are always a step ahead of its defense mechanism. They evade Brightmail filters by randomizing the characteristics that filters look for.
"It's very difficult to fight," said Mr. Long, the war-room worker. "You get entrenched fighting it one way, and they go put a new tool against you." 
Spam may be an inescapable element of online existence. "Is spam going to be something we will all learn to live with, like increased airline security?" asked Enrique Salem, chief executive of Brightmail. "Or will it disappear?" 
For spam to disappear, a combination of coordinated international regulatory action, aggressive enforcement, software and human oversight is needed, Mr. Salem said.
The bad news is that until that magic combination comes about, spam will continue to clog In boxes. The good news is that it could help you look younger, feel more virile, become debt-free and get a college degree at home. Really.

Fighting The Urge To Flee

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AT 10 a.m. on Sept. 11, Jonathan Horn and his wife, Daria Saraf, their arms around each other, stood with their neighbors on the roof of their Mulberry Street co-op, watching the World Trade Center collapse. Twenty-four hours later they were on a bus to Newark, where they had found a car to rent. They drove for three days and nights, to a Wyoming dude ranch, where they had reservations to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.
 When they got back, they knew they could not stay. "We were afraid," said Ms. Saraf, 29. "Afraid we were a target, being so conspicuous by living in Manhattan." 
 During the winter and into the spring, they looked at houses in the suburbs, including over 50 in Bedford, N.Y. They narrowed their search to two and were ready to bid. 
So what leafy street are they living on now?
Mulberry.
"We started feeling guilty," said Mr. Horn, 31, who manages the Internet site of a Manhattan law firm. "We started feeling we should stand by our city."
The possibility that people like Ms. Saraf and Mr. Horn would flee New York resurfaced in the spring following Federal Bureau of Investigation warnings of terrorist threats. But the exodus never materialized. Gripped by a welter of feelings -- loyalty, guilt, financial pragmatism -- most New Yorkers are learning to live with the anxiety in a city that experts agree will always be high on the list of terrorist targets.
"After 9/11, we were all in shock, with many agents predicting doom and gloom," said Hall Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, the Manhattan brokers. "A lot of people were saying: 'I want to sell. I want to go. I'm scared at having my money invested in real estate here.' " After trying to sell last fall -- when there was no real market -- some took their places off the market or just decided not to list them at all. "They calmed down," he said. The statistics do not show how many people have moved out. They do show that the real estate market, buoyed in part by low interest rates, is as brisk as ever. The price of apartments and houses in Manhattan, including those in residential neighborhoods closest to ground zero, is 15.2 percent higher than a year ago, said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a large Manhattan appraisal firm.
In TriBeCa, a few blocks from the attacks, the recovery has amazed agents, bankers and statisticians. Luxury lofts that were trading for an average of $583 a square foot last summer are now bringing $635, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group.
And New York continues to be a magnet for newcomers. The Corcoran Group said that 28 percent of its sales in May were to buyers from other states and other countries, up from 19 percent in May 2001.
While city people have bought a healthy number of homes in the suburbs and in weekend-house territory, real estate agents say that many are casting about for a better investment than stocks. Others are looking for a country place where they will eventually live and work. "They are stretching -- spending right up to the limit -- to get the perfect country place," said Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's International Realty in East Hampton, N.Y. "They don't want to move again."
In Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn., there have been sales to families trying to escape from New York, but many more city dwellers looked around, grew excited about picket fences and center-hall colonials -- and then didn't bite.
Richard Kirshenbaum, an advertising executive, and his wife, Dana Geier-Kirshenbaum, a full-time mother, debated moving with their children to their house in the Hamptons -- he would visit on weekends -- or buying a suburban place. But either choice would have meant sacrificing time together. "It may be safer to be out of the city," Mr. Kirshenbaum said, "but we've chosen to stay right here, together as a family."
Ms. Saraf, from Mulberry Street, said she kept thinking of a favorite corner bistro or a favorite yoga teacher she would miss if she moved away. "I was afraid we'd be stranded, surrounded by things that were second-rate," she said.
Elaine Jassey, an agent at Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford, recalled one couple's seesawing. "He wanted to move," she said. "She wasn't sure." In the end, they bought the apartment next to them in the city and created a bigger one. "The anxiety receded," Ms. Jassey said.
Many of her customers are just waiting. "If there's another incident in Manhattan," she said, "they'll go into fast mode."
Kim Beatty, an Upper East Sider who is a portrait painter and the mother of an 8-year-old, has dreams of running under a bridge, her little girl in her arms, in a city under attack. She thinks about the Berkshires, although she has read that even there, the winds may blow nuclear particles through the hills. "It all depends on how much risk you want to parse out," she said. Yet she lingers, "at least for this year."
Of the undetermined number of families that did leave, some went to weekend homes on the South Fork of Long Island, a traditional vacation escape for New Yorkers, where they have experimented with one parent living with the children and the other commuting on weekends. One such couple, Mallory and Hank Weil, said they are feeling the strain.
Ms. Weil, 41, and her husband, who is 47, decided to sell their Murray Street loft shortly after the attacks. She took their children, Morgan, 8 and Jack, 6, and moved into their house in Bridgehampton, where she put the children in school. Now her husband, a criminal lawyer who was taking a deposition in Queens the morning of the attacks, spends weeknights in a rented city apartment.
Mrs. Weil has taken up a new career, selling real estate. She said she is happy, but her husband is not. "I'm lonely in the city," he said. He tries to spend Fridays and weekends in Bridgehampton. During the week, he said, "I just sit around at night, missing them."
Later, out of earshot, his wife said, "I guess I have issues, too." She feels as if she escaped "and my friends stayed -- I feel like a traitor."
Diane Saatchi, the president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in the Hamptons, said her sales did increase, to 106 between January and June of 2002, from 69 last year. But the buyers "are people known to us -- builders looking for tear-downs and vacant land, and longtime renters who are asking, 'If not now, when?' " They are not rushing to take their money out of Wall Street or leaving the city in panic, she said.
Mr. Newbold of Sotheby's did find some buyers selling stock to invest in real estate. "More people are deciding they sleep better at night with a key to the front door than a stock certificate," he said.
The East Hampton schools superintendent, Dr. Jan Furman, said 11 new students enrolled there as a result of Sept. 11 -- insignificant in a school population of 2,000, she said. Schools in Amagansett, Westhampton, Southampton and Bellport on Long Island either had no increases or slight ones that officials attributed to the construction of new housing.
Selma Thompson, 44, did not move immediately, although "my son went to P.S. 150 in Independence Plaza."
"He saw the planes," she said. "He saw the world collapse before his eyes."
She and her husband, Chat Gunter, 59, a professor at New York University, tried to hang on in temporary housing after evacuating their downtown loft. But after their 7-year-old son began hiding in closets and refusing to go to school, they moved into their weekend place in the Poconos.
"We drove out to the country when they started bombing Afghanistan," she said. "And then we couldn't think of a reason to bring the children back."
Ms. Thompson said that last summer she would have described herself as "a film producer wearing black Donna Karan." Now she is a country woman. Her husband returns to the city when he must. "We put the boy in a small Montessori school for this year," she said. "If he's distraught, he's better off being distraught up here."
"They lost one of the great fans of New York," she added. "No one loved New York anymore than I did."
Some who left for greener pastures only nine months ago are moving back. Rachel Youree, a social worker, and her husband, Shelly Mossey, who owns a bicycle messenger service, moved from Manhattan to a house in Palisades, N.Y., a week before the attacks, seeking fresh air and a place for their greyhound, a retired racer, to run.
Now they are moving back to a apartment they are renting in Battery Park City, with a view of ground zero. "We didn't exactly plan to move there -- it wasn't a conscious thing -- but they are offering great deals," Ms. Youree said. "And yet, when you think of it, I guess it may be some kind of guilt."
Mr. Willkie, of Brown Harris Stevens, has seen clients return from the groomed lawns of Connecticut, "professional couples saying, 'I can't stand commuting from Weston -- I miss my apartment.' "
And then there was the woman who fled to Canada.
"She was bored stiff," he said.

HEADLINE: Giving Aid to World Trade 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Yergin; Daniel Yergin is co-author of "The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
By meeting in an idyllic retreat in the Canadian Rockies, leaders of the Group of 8, a conference of the leading industrial powers plus Russia, may succeed in avoiding the critics of globalization. But they will hardly be getting away from the question of global poverty. Confronting Africa's appalling economic distress is at the top of their agenda.
 One of the great tests for globalization will be its inclusiveness -- what it does to improve the plight of the terribly poor in developing countries. Sept. 11 has pushed the question even more to the fore, as is evident in the 50 percent increase in foreign aid -- reaching a level of $15 billion in three years -- proposed by the Bush administration in March. 
 But the debate is often upside down, with critics of globalization contending that it causes poverty. On the contrary, globalization -- in the form of expanded trade and investment -- offers the most significant means for reducing poverty. Foreign aid can play a very important role in relieving hardship and helping poor countries improve health, education and national infrastructure. It can also help build legal and lending institutions, making it possible for the poor to participate in market economies and poor countries to participate in the global economy. Such improvements can attract long-term foreign investment that creates jobs and encourages transfers of technologies to poorer nations.
It is trade, however, that is the primary engine for economic development. The best proof is from some nations in Asia. Four decades ago, Asian countries were among the poorest in the world. They varied widely in their political systems, but the common theme among the economically successful countries was their engagement with the world trading system. The results have been extraordinary. In 1960 South Korea was as poor as India. Today its per capita income is 20 times higher than India's.
In the last decade, India has also moved to participate more actively in the world economy through trade. Within India, this engagement has stimulated growth rates, and now India is on its way to becoming a force in the world economy. It's hard to imagine the Internet as we know it without India and Indian technologists.
Singapore provides an even more dramatic example. In the late 1960's, it was so poor that its very survival was problematic. Today its per capita income is higher than Britain's.
For developing countries to benefit from trade, the first requirement is better access to markets in developed countries and increased flows of investment. That was the message of the developing countries that was lost in the din of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999.
What would expanding trade mean for poorer nations? Sub-Saharan Africa, hit by falling commodity prices, poorly governed and unable to attract even much domestic investment, missed out on the manufacturing-led trade boom of the late 20th century. But if it were simply to regain the share of the world's non-oil exports that it held in 1980, it would have earned $161 billion in 2000 -- not the $69 billion it actually earned.
Developing countries need to work to make themselves, as Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, has put it, "relevant" to the world economy in terms of education, skills, legal systems and economic culture.
At the same time, industrialized countries need to reduce barriers to imports from the poorest countries, a principle that has been increasingly recognized by the United States and the European Union. But it's a principle that needs to be put into practice.
For expanded market access to work, it must be accompanied by adjustment mechanisms in the industrial countries for workers that are adversely affected. But it would be a great error to think that giving poorer countries a share of global trade means a loss for the industrial countries.
In the 1990's, world trade, American imports and American exports all doubled. In that same decade, 17 million new jobs, on a net basis, were created in the United States. By any calculation, that's a pretty good deal, and one well worth remembering in these troubled economic times.

HEADLINE: Fed Statement On Rate Stance 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. 
 The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity is continuing to increase. However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated. The committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain. 
In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals. 
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Robert D. McTeer Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. 
Voting against the action: none.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Reforming the Italy's extreme labor restrictions in Italy is no slice of tiramisu.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
ANYONE who believes that the European Union or globalization will lead to the harmonization of national laws and the end of sovereignty should take a close look at labor law reform in Italy.
 Italy has about the toughest restrictions in Europe on firing workers, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Article 18 of the Labor Code, passed in 1970, mandates that after a short probationary period, an employee fired from a company with 15 or more employees can bring a lawsuit challenging the dismissal. If the suit is successful, as is often the case, the employer is forced to rehire the worker and pay back wages and social insurance contributions, as well as a large fine. 
 When given a hypothetical choice of a labor market where it is hard to find a job but hard to be laid off or one where it is easy to find a job but easy to be laid off, 71 percent of Italians preferred the former in a poll of 1,000 individuals conducted in April by Tito Boeri, an economist at Bocconi University in Milan, for the Debenedetti Foundation. 
So Italians value job security -- and have lots of it.
The problem is that the law is administered unevenly across regions, and serious offenses are often not considered just grounds for dismissal. A bank employee involved in money laundering, for example, was recently held unjustly dismissed and ordered reinstated by a judge. 
Firing protections also affect worker performance. Examining data on 858 newly hired bank employees, Andrea Ichino, an economist at the European University in Florence, found that the absenteeism rate more than doubled after workers had completed the three-month probationary period. With little fear of dismissal, some employees provide less than peak effort when they do show up for work. 
Even worse, the uncertainty and expenses associated with dismissals have a chilling effect on hiring. A study led by Stefano Scarpetta of the O.E.C.D. released last week found that the average American company that survives two years increases its employment 160 percent, while the average Italian one that survives as long grows only 20 percent. Although many factors are undoubtedly at work, stiff firing restrictions probably account for some of Italy's lower job growth. 
"The cost of the job security of the father," Professor Ichino argues, "is the insecurity of the son." Italy's jobless rate hovered around 10 percent in the last decade. Because its safety net has as many holes as Swiss cheese, high unemployment contributes to the remarkable fact that more than half of people in their 20's -- and nearly a quarter of men age 30 to 39 -- live with their parents. "The family is the main institution that provides unemployment insurance benefits," Professor Ichino said.
In November, the government proposed modest reforms to relax firing restrictions. For a trial period of three years, the law would have exempted small companies that grew beyond the 15-employee threshold from the stringent restrictions. It would also have exempted temporary employees and underground employees who are added to the books from the count of employees.
These modest reforms have run into strong resistance. Marco Biagi, a socialist lawyer who advised the labor ministry of the center-right government on the proposal, was assassinated in March. Massimo D'Antona, who advised the previous government on similar reforms, was assassinated three years earlier, apparently with the same gun. In April, unions staged the largest general strike in 20 years, derailing the reforms for now.
Many economists and labor lawyers who advise the Italian government on firing restrictions have been asked, for their protection, to notify the police of their movements, and several professors have discreetly removed their names from their doors. 
Even worse than the physical threat, Professor Ichino said, is the attitude of labor unions and left-wing politicians toward reform-minded scholars, especially those on the left. In a speech to workers at Fiat last week, for example, Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communist Party, said of left-leaning academics involved in labor law reform: "Someone should stop them." Because many economists and lawyers involved in labor market reform come from a pro-labor tradition and believe that their modest proposals will help the unemployed, the take-no-prisoners attitude of labor unions and left-wing politicians has caused disillusionment among many intellectuals.
Professor Boeri sees a way out. His poll found that 59 percent of Italians would favor reforms to relax firing restrictions if they were combined with an expansion of unemployment benefits and job search assistance. 
The government is negotiating for a compromise along these lines with the second- and third-largest labor unions, but the fate of the reform is unclear. The largest union, which is not participating in the negotiations, opposes changes to Article 18 and has threatened to sue the government if it makes changes. To many Italians, firing restrictions have come to represent a symbol of commitment to labor, rather than a specific policy that may stand in the way of a reasonable compromise that would help the unemployed and enhance flexibility. 
Across Europe, Professor Boeri has found a trade-off of firing restrictions and unemployment insurance coverage: countries with weaker protections tend to provide unemployment benefits to a higher proportion of job seekers.
If it proves to be difficult for Italy to make a small step toward this trade-off, one that preserves firing protections for most incumbent workers and improves unemployment benefits and flexibility, it will probably require a severe crisis to provoke the major concessions that would bring Italy's rigid labor market closer to that in the rest of Europe.
Rome was not built in a day, and it is unlikely that extreme employment protections will be dismantled any time soon.

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26 

 BODY:
Faced with corporate scandals, skittish financial markets and an economic recovery that has little traction so far, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, saying it was not yet clear how soon the outlook would improve.
 As it has all year, the Fed said it expected the economy to pick up, and it hinted again that it planned to raise rates eventually. 
 But it acknowledged that the rebound appears to have lost some momentum, perhaps only temporarily. And it concluded that the risks remained evenly balanced for now between an economic rebound and a slowdown that could lead to another recession or a broad-based decline in prices. 
In its statement, the Fed did not mention the stock market's dive, the dollar's weakness or the corporate malfeasance that has undermined confidence among investors in the United States and around the world. 
But analysts said those factors weighed on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee as it decided for the fourth consecutive time to leave official interest rates at their lowest levels in 40 years.
In a unanimous decision to hold rates unchanged, the Fed left its main tool for influencing the economy, the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks, at 1.75 percent, where it has been since December. The Fed lowered rates 11 times last year, by a total of 4.75 percentage points, as the economy slid into recession and then suffered from the disruptions caused by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. 
Economists, after assuming early this year that the Fed would be raising rates by summer, said they did not now expect any increases before the fall, and maybe not until next year.
In setting policy, the Fed committee confronted unusually strong cross-currents in the economy. 
There was fresh evidence today of an improving outlook, in the form of a record increase in new-home sales last month and a solid pickup in orders for durable goods. Many analysts are forecasting improving corporate earnings this year. Inflation is dormant. And overall economic growth, while markedly lower in the current quarter than the 5.6 percent annual pace in the first quarter, remains reasonably healthy. 
But there is a long list of potential pitfalls remaining. Unemployment may not yet have reached its peak. The economy, after benefiting early this year from businesses' restocking their inventories, has yet to register any substantial rebound in capital spending by companies. 
The huge and expanding trade and current-account deficits are weighing heavily on the dollar, raising the risk of a destabilizing decline in the currency's value. Tension in the Middle East and concern about further terrorist attacks continue to cast a shadow over the economy. And a parade of revelations of corporate fraud could drive stock prices even lower, further undermining investor confidence.
"Inflation has been beaten into at least temporary submission, the economic recovery looks a little fragile, and stocks are plummeting," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "It's not the easiest moment to figure out what to do, but on balance the Fed can afford to wait and see what happens."
The weakness in the financial markets has even set off speculation that the Fed could cut interest rates again this year, although analysts said a rate reduction remained a long shot unless stocks plunged further or the economy suffered some other kind of damaging shock.
The Fed began its two-day meeting on Tuesday afternoon, just before WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, disclosed that it had overstated its cash flow by more than $3.8 billion over the last five quarters. The disclosure made WorldCom the latest in a string of prominent companies to restate its earnings, a trend that has undermined faith in corporate financial information and, more broadly, called into question the kind of aggressive capitalism that distinguished the American economy in the 1990's.
"It certainly feels like death by a thousand cuts," said Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC in New York.
In a report today, Mr. Morris said he now expected the Fed to leave rates unchanged for the rest of the year "due to equities and a growing list of corporate and geopolitical risks."
With questions increasing about how much of the economy's apparent potential is real and how much was a result of misguided financial engineering, the Fed today re-emphasized its belief in a "robust underlying growth in productivity." 
Productivity, or output per hour, is the crucial gauge of business's ability to produce more for less and is the most basic measure of an economy's capacity to grow without generating inflation. After languishing for two decades, the growth rate of productivity began picking up in the mid-1990's, and to the surprise of many economists held up well last year during the recession, even accelerating at times.
The Fed otherwise struck a measured, and in some ways ambivalent, tone in its assessment of the economy, and offered only the vaguest of timetables for improvement.
"The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity is continuing to increase," it said.
"However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated," the statement continued, alluding to the short- and long-term measures of economic activity the Fed has been tracking most closely in assessing the outlook. "The committee expects the rate of increase in final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain."

HEADLINE: 2 Argentines Killed in Protests on Economy 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 26 

 BODY:
At least two people were killed here today and dozens more injured and arrested when protesters demanding jobs and food clashed with police in the worst riots since political turmoil late last year helped topple Argentina's government.
 The public has grown increasingly impatient with the long-running and crippling economic crisis that is threatening President Eduardo Duhalde, whose Peronist party is allied with the groups that organized the protests. Mr. Duhalde came to power in January after riots in December that killed 27 people and brought down the government of Fernando de la Rua. When appointed, Mr. Duhalde became Argentina's fifth president in less than two weeks. 
 The violence today occurred as Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna was beginning a three-day trip to the United States in an effort to persuade banks and international lending institutions to reinstate an $18 billion credit line suspended in December. Since then, Argentina has defaulted on most of its $141 billion in public debt, and the peso has lost 75 percent of its value against the dollar, triggering a deep economic and social crisis here.
As a result, the popularity of Mr. Duhalde, a caretaker president who was chosen by Congress to head an emergency national unity government, has been sliding. In moments of frustration, he has talked about moving up a presidential election scheduled for late 2003 in order to leave office early. 
The confrontation began when several hundred demonstrators, many carrying banners and chanting slogans criticizing the government and the International Monetary Fund, blocked a bridge that connects Buenos Aires with the southern industrial suburb of Avellenada. As police and national guardsmen advanced to dislodge them, the protesters, some armed with slingshots and gasline bombs, fled, smashing shop windows, overturning cars and burning a bus.
Spokesmen for a local hospital said the two victims, young men in their early 20's, had died of gunshot wounds. Masked protesters claimed that police had fired on them from rooftops and the streets, but the police commissioner, Mario Migin, said that his men were armed only with nightsticks and weapons that fired plastic bullets and tear gas canisters.
Many of the protest groups are closely allied with or in some cases even reportedly financed by Mr. Duhalde's Peronist party. Their noisy and sometimes violent demonstrations helped to bring down Mr. de la Rua in December, and since then they have marched almost daily, usually unimpeded by police, to protest the economic collapse that has left one quarter of Argentina's work force unemployed.
But commuter complaints of blocked roads and bridges here have been growing, as have the objections of storeowners along protest routes who say that they are losing business, and Mr. Duhalde appears to have responded to their requests for order. Police commanders said today that they have now been authorized by the government to use force to prevent the blockage of highways and bridges by the pickets.
The march today was supported by some Peronist members of Congress, indicating that internal divisions are widening and that Mr. Duhalde's political position within his own party is weakening.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Up 8.1%; Orders for Goods Rise, Too 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes increased 8.1 percent in May, the biggest advance in six months, the Commerce Department reported today.
 The increase was larger than expected and pushed up sales of new single-family houses to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.03 million, a record monthly level. 
 In another report, the department said that the nation's factories, the area hardest hit in the recent economic slump, showed signs of improvement in May, with orders for durable goods rising 0.6 percent. The advance in durable goods -- items expected to last at last three years -- came after a 0.4 percent increase in April. 
The housing market has been a bright spot in the slump, in large part because of low mortgage rates. Also motivating buyers, economists say, is the strong appreciation in housing values, especially as the stock market has weakened. 
Economists had forecast that new-home sales in May would rise 0.5 percent, to an annual pace of 920,000. 
By region, home sales jumped 26.4 percent in the Northeast, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 67,000. In the South, sales rose 10.6 percent, to a pace of 482,000, and in the West, they were up 4.3 percent, to 289,000. Sales in the Midwest increased 2.7 percent, to an annual 190,000. 
In April, new-home sales rose 3.9 percent, according to revised figures -- considerably stronger than the 1 percent rise previously reported. 
The 0.6 percent increase in new orders to factories in May was the largest since a 1.7 percent advance in February, and represented the fifth increase in six months. 
The latest snapshot of manufacturing activity shows a sector of the economy recovering after a long slump in which hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost.
But yesterday's report and other manufacturing data suggest that this rebound has limits. In part, the statistics reflect that businesses, worried about the staying power of the broader economic recovery, seem reluctant to make new investments in plants and equipment. 
Shipments, a good barometer of current demand, were flat in May, after a 3.4 percent jump in April. Factories reported that new orders for fabricated metal products rose 2.4 percent in May, after a 1 percent rise the month before. 
Orders for computers and other electronic products rose 1 percent, compared with a 2.9 percent increase in April. 
Orders for cars fell 2 percent in May, after a 12.1 percent jump. And orders for electrical equipment and household appliances declined 2.1 percent, in contrast to a 10.3 percent advance.

HEADLINE: The Governor's Turn 

 BODY:
New York's Legislature has been putting the finishing touches on this year's session, proudly declaring that the lawmakers have created a legislative banquet when really they have only chopped a few carrots. Very little has been done so far in Albany beyond the required budget, and it's time for Gov. George Pataki to demonstrate his leadership skills. The governor should make certain that legislators from both houses stay in session while he directs, nudges, coaxes and convinces them that it is time to finish the many tasks left unattended. 
 The list of undone matters in Albany should shame any veteran New York politician, from the governor to the newest member of the State Assembly. It should be especially embarrassing to those trying to get re-elected this year by boasting about their experience and effectiveness. There is no minimum wage agreement, no extension of unemployment insurance benefits for those who lost their jobs as a result of Sept. 11. Despite Mr. Pataki's promises, there is no reform of the cruel Rockefeller drug laws. There is no Superfund cleanup agreement, no compromise on finding a use for the urban brownfields containing low-level toxicity. There is no relief from sky-high interest rates on home loans that trap the elderly with promises of paying off bills with home equity. There is no statewide antismoking law, despite a new study that demonstrates how secondhand smoke is even more deadly than we thought. 
 These are only the bills that have risen closer to the surface in Albany than other important initiatives, like campaign finance reform or election reform, that languish in the state's legislative swamps.
As is usually the case for New York's lawmakers, each side is devoting most of its energy to find ways to blame the other for their mutual inaction. The Assembly Democrats accuse the Senate Republicans and the Republican governor of intransigence. The governor and the Senate leadership point their finger at Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Round and round it goes, spinning out legislation that every year grows smaller and more provincial. The Legislature successfully found a way to husband the state's dwindling population of monkfish and to regulate tattoo parlors. But such necessities as the barest increase in minimum wage languish on conference tables while the governor and officials determine whether they can get re-elected this year without them. For the legislators, it might not matter. Their seats are almost all safe, and their reputation is too dismal to be easily refurbished. For Governor Pataki, however, it's not too late.

HEADLINE: OPEC Decides on No Change In Oil Production Levels 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: VIENNA, June 26 

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided today to leave crude oil production levels unchanged, despite what industry experts expect will be a considerable increase in demand that could send prices higher.
 OPEC, at its meeting here, seems willing to push prices as high as it can without provoking a global recession. The economies of the 10 voting members of the cartel are heavily dependent on oil revenues, and the thinking here seems to be that prices are now favorable to members but not so steep as to provoke an economic slowdown. The cartel has traditionally been slow to react to higher prices by increasing supplies but has been quick to cut output to bolster falling prices. 
 The price of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 44 cents, to $26.76, on the news of the decision, which had been expected before the meeting.
The factor that may prevent oil prices from spiking sharply if demand surges is that OPEC members are already producing far above their official quotas. On paper, the cartel is pumping 21.7 million barrels of oil a day, but industry experts estimate that member countries are exceeding that by about 1.5 million barrels a day. If demand rises in July and August as the United States enters its peak summer driving season, OPEC members may quietly increase production before the group's next meeting on Sept. 18. 
"They are managing the message to speculative traders by sticking to the quotas," said Roger Diwan, managing director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting company. "But they are managing the oil markets by adding volumes."
Mr. Diwan said he thought that OPEC might overproduce by an additional one million barrels a day before the September meeting to keep prices from jumping higher. And many experts attending the meeting here thought that OPEC might decide to increase production officially before September if prices ran up quickly. OPEC has said in the past that it is comfortable with oil prices in the range of $22 to $28 a barrel.
If the cartel is in fact increasing the flow of oil to stabilize prices, why not just formalize it? "I think their theory is that the price of oil would fall like a stone if they increased production formally," said Mehdi Varzi, president of Varzi Energy, a London consulting firm. "If they were to go up 1.5 million barrels a day formally, the market would assume they were producing another one million barrels on top of that."
Global oil demand was essentially flat in the first half of the year, according to the Energy Information Administration, the analysis arm of the Energy Department. Winter was uncharacteristically warm, and the economic recovery has been tepid. But Mr. Diwan said that between now and the end of the year, demand for oil could rise by 2.5 million barrels a day to 3.5 million barrels a day. Americans will be driving more in the summer, and a normally cool autumn and winter in the United States and Europe could increase the demand for heating oil. 
The president of OPEC, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said the cartel estimated that demand would rise much more modestly by the end of the fourth quarter, by about 400,000 barrels a day.
But OPEC seemed to recognize that several unknown factors could rapidly drive prices higher. The recovery could strengthen, for example, or Iraq might take its oil off the market again in its continuing wrangle with the United Nations about the pricing of its oil exports under international sanctions.
Most worrisome, it appeared, was the possibility of an American military action against Iraq, a move that has been threatened by the Bush administration. In the long term, that might lead to a government in Iraq friendly to the West and the revival of the Iraqi oil industry, which would increase global supplies and lead to lower prices. But in the short term, supplies could be disrupted, if, for instance, Iraq were to use chemical and biological weapons in the Persian Gulf region, Mr. Varzi said.
"We're ready and prepared to take whatever actions are required by the market," Mr. Lukman said at a news conference in response to a question about the possibility of a conflict in Iraq. "And that includes putting more on the market if prices become overheated."

Lawmaking: A Monopoly Of 3 in Albany

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
FOUR months. It took the newest member of the State Senate -- so eager to become a lawmaker that she ran again after losing the first time -- just four months to figure out Albany's open secret.
 The place doesn't work. 
 "I don't think I was naive," said Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan's East Side who anticipated a tough time as a Democrat in the Republican-dominated Senate. But not this tough. "The minute you walk in there, all the secrets come out and you really learn firsthand how bad it is. I had no idea, literally, how absurd it is." 
Ms. Krueger, who won a special election in February, finds it so absurd that she wrote a recent fund-raising letter to her constituents called "Top 10 things I did not know or want to know about the State Senate." The Assembly is different on details but not in style or substance. Ms. Krueger's little list underscores an intractable Albany reality: how the governor and two legislative leaders (those celebrated "three men in a room") control their domain.
For instance, legislators do not have to bother to vote for bills in person. If they register as present at the beginning of each day's session, they are recorded as voting yes on any measure that comes to a vote. Quite the convenience, especially for the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who allows floor votes only on those bills he wants approved anyway.
The Krueger letter notes that legislators often do not know what is in the bills they sponsor, and rarely hold public hearings of the standard Congressional variety. In an interview about her first four months, the senator talked about a hearing on school reform that started out as a committee hearing -- until Ms. Krueger said she intended to participate. A fax arrived, stating that the hearing would be held not by the bipartisan committee but by a "majority task force" -- for Republicans only.
A Republican colleague told her she could create her own minority task force and hold another hearing. She demurred. "It's silly," she said. "Why would we hold a second hearing with the same people? Why wouldn't you have a hearing open to all legislators? I was told we don't do it that way." So she went to the hearing and sat in the audience.
Senators cannot count on getting advance copies of bills or on getting details. Ms. Krueger asked, for instance, how $620 million of $1.2 billion in economic development projects could depend on revenue from Indian casinos that had not yet been built. She was told, she said, to trust the governor. The new senator, who will face Andrew S. Eristoff, the Manhattan Republican Party chairman, in November, wants to stay in Albany: "I am not so cynical that I don't believe there are opportunities to change things." 
Another Democratic senator, Daniel Hevesi of Queens, has decided to leave after two terms. "It's very difficult for me to have the type of impact I'd like to have," he said. "It's not just because I'm a Democrat in the Senate, but because the system of governance in Albany is so broken that I don't believe it functions any longer as a representative democracy. There's no debate, no discussion, never any hearings."
ERIC LANE, a professor at Hofstra Law School and former counsel to the Senate's Democratic minority, said the system perpetuated itself -- in both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Senate. Leaders reward loyal legislators with perks, financial goodies for their districts and campaign contributions. And most legislators play along.
"The most important thing to realize is: members agree to it," Mr. Lane said. "They can go home, don't have to do the grimy work of legislation. That's left to the professional staff that reports to the leadership."
The impact is not an abstraction. Consider the situation today. The current session is ending. Even the most concerned legislators do not know whether they will be voting on a higher minimum wage, a gay rights bill, tort reform or the Rockefeller drug laws, on measure after measure whose fate is a mystery. Little public discussion creates little public attention, leaving it all to those three men and their staffs.
"It's a very closed-down group of men making these decisions," Mr. Lane said. "Every step of the process is totally controlled."
How can it change? Incrementally, by electing more concerned legislators, Ms. Krueger advises. But the legislative re-election rate in Albany is 98 percent. 
There must be other ways. A future Matters column will examine a few of them. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 1, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Metro Matters column on Thursday about the State Legislature misstated the title of Andrew S. Eristoff, who intends to run against Senator Liz Krueger. He is no longer chairman of the Manhattan Republican Party. He resigned on May 1 to run for the Senate.

HEADLINE: 1 Cinema Divided by 951,000 Citizens Equals Detroit 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 26 

 BODY:
Cory Jacobson had a good feeling about "Juwanna Mann." Mr. Jacobson is a co-owner of the year-old Phoenix Theater, this city's only first-run movie theater. At first, he did not think much about the premise of "Juwanna Mann": Basketball player is suspended, cross-dresses to join a women's league, falls in love with teammate, wacky mayhem ensues. 
 But he liked the preview and was encouraged by his usual field research: watching the crowd from the back of the theater while trailers play. "Family films play exceedingly well," he explained. So do "films with African-American characters predominantly, comedies, thrillers, horror films, action pictures." 
 What does not work at the Phoenix are "Woody Allen films, films that are stuffy dramas" and art films, unless, like "Monster's Ball," they have Halle Berry, in which case they do just fine. 
That the Phoenix, with 10 screens, is the sole cinema in a city of 951,000 people sums up Detroit's continuing economic malaise since the race riot of 1967 spurred an exodus of the middle class. Business followed, including the movie theaters.
"I don't know if companies are afraid to invest in the city," said John Jennings, 38, a fourth-grade teacher sent by children to refill a popcorn tub during "Scooby-Doo."
"Thankfully, these owners were brave enough to invest," Mr. Jennings continued. "A one million population city should have at least six theaters. I think that was the number before the riots. And we should have some minority-owned theaters."
Theaters are not lacking. They just require a drive to the suburbs. "We're sustaining 20 theaters in the area, easy," said Kwame Kilpatrick, the city's new mayor. "We could use that traffic here." 
Mr. Kilpatrick's predecessor, Dennis W. Archer, helped bring large-scale development back to the city, including a new baseball stadium for the Tigers and a football stadium in the works for the Lions. Compuware, the software company, is building a headquarters downtown.
But suburbanites slingshot in to watch the Red Wings or attend the opera, see little to keep them and drive back home. The lack of smaller destinations, be they restaurants or shops, hinders gentrification, and a lack of mass transportation helps buffer suburb from city.
Mr. Kilpatrick has said he will focus on development on a smaller scale. "For years, the city was going after the huge businesses," he said. "It was, bring in a Nordstrom. Now we've changed our strategy. We want to encourage foot traffic."
But as the population has shrunk to less than a million in the 2000 census from almost two million in the 1950's, persuading businesses to return, or raising capital, remains difficult.
"The banks are not terribly cooperative in financing small businesses in the city," said Timothy Bates, a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. 
Last year, when a downtown theater closed, the city was briefly left with no cinema. "We lost business to construction of new theaters in the suburbs," said Rick King, a spokesman for AMC, which used to run a theater in the Phoenix's building.
The Phoenix is on Eight Mile Road, a long and sometimes bleak stretch that divides city from suburb. Mr. Jacobson, 38, and his partner, Charles Murray, 26, bought the theater last year after securing a loan from Comerica, a local bank. 
They painted the dilapidated building tan and blue, redid the rotting concession stand, added candy dispensers and video games, and named it Phoenix, after the mythical bird rising from the ashes. 
Mr. Jacobson said they were ahead of schedule on a three-year plan to recoup a $1 million initial investment and might develop another city theater.
On a recent Saturday, "Scooby-Doo" played on three screens. In the lobby, a man in a Scooby suit worked the crowd while Michelle Murray, Mr. Murray's wife, collected dollar bills for photographs. 
The lack of competition allows the theater to get any movie they want, and Mr. Jacobson and Mr. Murray spend almost half their time figuring out what to play. Tastemaking is a nuanced task for two white guys in a predominantly African-American urban setting. "Spider-Man" outsold "Star Wars" by nearly 4 to 1 in their first weeks. 
When appropriate, home movies play. On a recent visit, for instance, Mark Beater, 34, was preparing to propose to his girlfriend. Mr. Murray cued up a tape of Mr. Beater, in tuxedo, professing his love. It played before the 7:15 p.m. showing of "Bad Company." 
Why pop the question here? 
"She's hard to surprise," Mr. Beater explained. 
Soon, the bride-to-be was crying. Family members were crying. A theater manager was crying. 
"I used to come out here all the time and it really became terrible," Mr. Beater said. "Everything is nice now. This is no dump anymore."

A Hand Over the Nose, a Hand Still in Stocks

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Americans' faith in stocks is being sorely tested.
 Each day brings another corporate misdeed, another top executive in trouble, another company restating a profit as a loss, another auditor under fire for an accounting error. At the Securities and Exchange Commission, accounting investigations are being started at a record rate. 
 Many people on Wall Street are wondering when investors will say enough is enough and pull their money out of stocks and mutual funds, in favor of a mattress or some other safe place. But so far, investors have not withdrawn in droves from the stock market. Stocks fell sharply early in the day after disclosures of WorldCom's accounting fraud of nearly $4 billion, but erased most of the losses in the afternoon. 
Even the people most cynical about the state of corporate ethics have been reluctant to sell the bulk of their stocks and move money into bonds or money market funds, in part because interest rates are low. 
The resilience of the market shows that many people still believe that stocks are the best long-term investment. In fact, their only hope of fulfilling their retirement plans is to achieve investment returns greater than those available in the bond market. So they stay invested in stocks, hoping for the best.
And it may be that for all the talk of disgust with corporate America, people do not necessarily feel that way about the stocks they own. That would echo polls over the years that showed Americans thought little of Congress, but were favorably impressed by their own representative in Congress.
A survey of affluent Americans, released this week by the U.S. Trust subsidiary of Charles Schwab, found that two-thirds did not trust management of publicly traded companies and that three-quarters questioned the reliability of corporate financial statements. But less than a quarter said they had moved money into safer investments.
The dollar has slid in value recently in a reflection of an overall loss of confidence in American investments. Until this year, the dollar had been strong because foreign investors were plowing more than $1 billion a day into investments here, much of it into American stocks. That flow has slowed this year.
But if the reaction to the spreading scandals has only gradually affected the value of investments, it is more apparent in the way in which corporate America is now being treated. President Bush called WorldCom's accounting "outrageous" and promised that the government would "go after" companies that misled investors.
Corporate chieftains were heroes to many in the 1990's; now they are often objects of scorn. A cartoon in one financial publication, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, showed two quarreling boys who had been separated by their mother. "He called me a C.E.O. first," one boy explained in justification of his actions.
Clearly, the revulsion is growing among ordinary Americans. "People really are shocked by these revelations," said John Olson, a leading securities lawyer, reflecting on the conversations he has had with friends and relatives. "There is a loss of confidence in corporate America."
The S.E.C.'s attitude is shown not only by the fact it has begun 128 investigations of corporate accounting and reporting issues this year, a pace that Steve Cutler, the commission's director of enforcement, said yesterday was unmatched in recent years. It is also reflected in the suit the commission filed against WorldCom yesterday. That suit asked for a court order barring the company from destroying documents or making large payments to executives, and for the appointment of a monitor to ensure that it complied with such an order. In the past, the commission usually took for granted that corporations would not do such things. But that confidence has vanished.
Investors who have suffered losses in the scandals at WorldCom and other companies are angry. To many, the obvious self-dealing is the most outrageous. Executives at Enron and at Adelphia Communications appear to have enriched themselves at the expense of their companies, which is to say at the expense of the public shareholders. L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief executive, is accused of using the company in a scheme to evade personal taxes.
But it is the manipulation and falsification of financial statements that raise the most questions about the integrity of the American financial system. WorldCom said Tuesday that over a period of just 15 months it had counted $3.9 billion of spending as capital expenditures rather than as expenses. That made operating cash flow, and profits, look much better than they really were. It is not clear if results from earlier periods were similarly inflated.
WorldCom is not some dot-com whose share price soared on hopes for the future despite a lack of accomplishments in the past. It is one of the largest telephone companies in the country, one that had boasted of strong cash flow. That cash flow now appears to have been greatly exaggerated, but it attracted investors, who now have suffered huge losses.
The potential problem for American financial system is that reliance on corporate financial statements is a necessary element. Small-scale capitalism can flourish without such trust, as one grocery store partner keeps his eye on the other one, but large enterprises must attract capital from investors who have no direct way to monitor the results and must rely on financial statements.
Many in the financial system now believe that action must be taken to preserve that trust, but most tend to think that any reforms should affect other players. Accountants from the remaining Big Four accounting firms have focused their fire on Arthur Andersen and on accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, rather than on the failure of auditors from other firms at companies like Adelphia. Wall Street firms have been more willing to criticize corporate managements than to look at their own failings.
Whether this series of scandals brings lasting changes may depend on what happens to the economy, and to people's investments. The 1929 crash eventually produced the regulatory network that we now have, but that happened only after the economy had descended into the Great Depression.
Since then, the financial system has withstood numerous episodes of investor doubt. "There's always a loss of confidence in a bear market," said Chuck Clough of Clough Capital, a money management firm. "In the 1970's, people worried that OPEC controlled the world."
That passed, and this scandal could as well, assuming the economy performs reasonably well. People may eventually conclude that today's scandals, rather than showing fundamental problems with the system, reflected an era, when the rewards to corporate executives were huge if the stock did well and the temptations to cheat were correspondingly great.
"What the accounting mayhem covered over was a deeper problem that the corporate sector could not sustain profits of the mid-90's," Mr. Clough said. "You couldn't see it in the income or cash-flow statements because they were too easy to jimmy." But, he added, corporate balance sheets showed rising debts -- an indication that perhaps the profits were not as real as people assumed they were.
For now, the declines in the stock market are causing pain for many people, particularly the better-off people with the most investments. But low interest rates are offsetting the pain for many for whom the size of the monthly mortgage payment is far more important than the height of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve left the interest rate it controls at an extremely low level of 1.75 percent. That came despite indications that the economy is growing. "The Fed has to defer to the stock market," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, arguing that the weakness of share prices is forcing the Fed to keep rates low regardless of the effect that might have on the dollar or on inflation. 
In that way, the accounting scandals may be helping many people. But the risk remains that they will grow to the point that investors, here and abroad, conclude that financial statements, and the American financial system, are not to be trusted.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Plunge Then Rebound In Reaction To Scandal

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON with JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
Stock prices plunged and then recovered yesterday after WorldCom's announcement that it had overstated its profits, leaving major market indexes just above their post-Sept. 11 lows.
 With investors uneasy about corporate accounting scandals, economic weakness, the falling dollar, and the possibility of future terrorist attacks, stocks have slid relentlessly since March. Yesterday, only the late-day rally saved the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index from closing below their lows of Sept. 21, when stocks bottomed after the attacks. 
 The losses this year compound two years of declines in the Nasdaq and S.& P. 500, the most important indexes. Since the technology stock bubble burst in March 2000, the S.& P. 500 is down more than a third, and the Nasdaq has plunged 72 percent, the biggest drop in any major market gauge since the Depression. 
This year's declines have come even though Wall Street's worst fears after the attacks have not happened.
The economy, which was shrinking at the time of the attacks, avoided a deep recession and rallied strongly in the first quarter of this year. Most forecasters do not expect a second recession, although hopes for a vigorous recovery have faded. The United States has not suffered another major terrorist attack.
But none of that has comforted investors, who now find that the boom of the late 1990's left stocks very expensive by historical standards and that the confluence of technological innovation and geopolitical stability that supported those gains may not be repeated for many years.
At the same time, a series of accounting scandals has shaken the faith of investors in the honesty of Wall Street and corporate America and led some foreign investors to reduce their holdings of United States stocks. Chief executives, accountants and Wall Street analysts have all faced criticism from investors -- some of whom gladly overlooked conflicts of interest and dubious accounting practices when stocks were rising.
"There's general unease about the market because of mistrust of C.E.O.'s, mistrust of corporate accounting, mistrust of analysts," said Steven L. Colton, manager of the $370 million Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth and Income fund. "People are wondering what the actual earnings numbers really are."
Yesterday, the S.& P. 500 fell 2.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 973.53, its lowest level since Sept. 21, when it closed at 965.80. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.34 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,429.33, just above its Sept. 21 low of 1,423.19. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day essentially flat, losing 6.71 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to close at 9,120.11.
In a sign of the market's struggle to find direction, telecommunications and financial companies, along with any company perceived to have accounting issues, were much lower. But information technology and drug stocks, which have been battered this year, rose sharply.
For most of the day, the indexes were much lower. The Dow briefly was down more than 200 points and the S.& P. 500 off more than 20. Yesterday was the third consecutive day that the indexes tested but did not break their Sept. 21 lows, and the market's refusal to break through those bottoms may signal at least a temporary halt to its recent declines.
In fact, many professional investors and strategists argue that stocks are reasonably priced, or even cheap, at current prices. Since March, the S.& P. 500 has declined nearly 17 percent, while profit estimates have risen.
Meanwhile, inflation appears quiescent, and interest rates on 10-year Treasury notes have fallen to 4.75 percent. With the S.& P. 500 expected to earn $57 a share in the next 12 months, it is now trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of only 17, for an "earnings yield" of 5.9 percent. In general, when the earnings yield on the S.& P. 500 is significantly below the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury note, investors should sell bonds and buy stocks, analysts say.
Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, said he believed that stocks were poised for a strong rally. "The bulk of what I would call the fundamentally driven people are more focused on when this market is going to bottom out than are looking to get out," he said. 
But the professional optimism of Wall Street forecasters has left at least some individual investors cold. Having suffered through two years of losses, they say they have little faith in the profit figures that analysts and companies are offering.
William Pfeffer, a 71-year-old retired stockbroker from Chicago, said he was optimistic after Sept. 11 because he had watched the markets weather several other national and corporate crises during his 50 years of investing. But news reports of corporate fraud have undermined his confidence, he said.
"It's unconscionable what's going on," Mr. Pfeffer said. "Absolutely unconscionable. It may take as much as another generation before people regain confidence in Wall Street."
Mr. Pfeffer's portfolio has been damaged by several companies implicated in the accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom. Since Sept. 11, he has cut the amount of his portfolio in stocks from about half to less than 40 percent.
"I really think to build confidence back in these markets, some of these white-collar guys have to spend 10 years in jail," he said. "Wall Street too often gets off the hook. There are no consequences besides paying money."
Yet, as yesterday's sharp rally showed, some investors are holding their noses and looking for bargains. Nikita Seldon, a manager at Texas Instruments in Dallas, said he planned to buy technology stocks. "I believe in America, and I believe the markets will come back up," he said.
Roxana Milbury, a high school math teacher from Rahway, N.J., said she was unfazed by the recent corporate transgressions. Ms. Milbury noted that her portfolio, which is composed almost entirely of stocks, was losing money before Sept. 11. So she is holding on, although she does not expect a rally any time soon. "In my experience, what goes down real fast takes time to get back up," she said.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL AT WORLDCOM: THE OVERSEAS REACTION; 
U.S. Businesses Dim as Models For Foreigners

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 26 

 BODY:
It was not just WorldCom that took a beating today. It was also the United States itself, and the American gospel of how business should be done. 
 After years of pumping billions of dollars into the United States because it seemed the land of opportunity, foreign investors are pulling back. And people around the world who for decades have looked to the United States as the model for openness and accountability in business have been sorely disillusioned by the mounting waves of scandal. 
 "This is the most pessimistic sentiment against the United States that I have ever experienced in my career," said Wolfram Gerdes, chief investment officer for global equities at Dresdner Investment Trust in Frankfurt. "There is unanimous agreement that the U.S. is not the best place to invest anymore." 
The immediate impact is discernible in the value of the dollar, which has been sliding since March. It fell today to its lowest level against the euro in 28 months. The dollar has also fallen against the Japanese yen, and even gold has been rising steadily in dollar terms.
The loss of foreign confidence in the United States is important in itself, because of the huge deficit the United States runs in its trade with the world. To cover that deficit, America must attract a net inflow of $1.3 billion in foreign money every day. Even a modest decline in the flow can weaken the dollar and drive up the prices of imported goods. 
But the fall from grace is broader than just a turn in the monetary tide. The more enduring impact of the accounting and boardroom scandals may be the tarnish they spread on the "American model," a philosophy that emphasizes bare-knuckle competition, aggressive deal making, a high level of public disclosure and fantastic rewards for executives who deliver the goods.
Europe has had its own run of financial scandals, generally involving young technology and media companies, that match the worst cases to surface during the dot-com bubble. But Guido Rossi, a former chairman of Telecom Italia and now one of Italy's most outspoken advocates for modernizing the way companies are run in Europe, said: "What is lacking in the U.S. is a culture of shame. No C.E.O. in the U.S. is considered a thief if he does something wrong. It is a kind of moral cancer." 
There is a groundswell among executives in Europe against the American system of corporate accounting -- the so-called generally accepted accounting principles -- that was supposed to be the gold standard in disclosure.
Before Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom, America had been winning the argument on accounting standards. But now, a growing number of Europeans are convinced that the American system is both too complex and too easy to manipulate. "We always thought it was too good to be true in America, and this has proved it," said Angela Knight, the chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stock Brokers in Britain.
To be sure, American corporate practices in general remain at least as open and accountable as those in any other country, and they have raised the expectations that shareholders elsewhere have of their own companies. And most experts agree that the main problem is not with the principles themselves but with people who are determined to distort their companies' financial results. 
European corporations like Vivendi Universal are reeling from shareholder wrath over their inscrutable finances and unsupportable debt. Deutsche Telekom, Germany's biggest telephone company, is for the second time in two years fighting off charges that it grossly overvalued billions of dollars worth of real estate before it went public six years ago.
In Germany, Italy and elsewhere, many of the biggest companies remain shielded from takeovers by byzantine cross-holdings and capital structures and by laws that arm entrenched management with a variety of defenses against their own shareholders.
Nor are Enron-like problems unknown elsewhere, as shareholders in HIH, a major Australian insurer, and Asia Pulp and Paper discovered last year when the companies plunged into default.
Indeed, advocates of improved corporate governance in countries like Japan say they only wish their companies were as accountable as those in the United States. The problem now, they say, is that the scandals in America will be used by opponents of openness and accountability to justify their intransigence.
"This has disappointed many people who tried to work to modernize themselves along the lines of the American model," said Haruo Shimada, a professor of economics at Keio University in Tokyo, who has pushed for freer markets in Japan and has been an adviser to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
In Russia, where corporate governance has all too frequently meant blatant theft and Machiavellian intrigue, corporate executives say the scandals prove that Russia is not so different from the United States after all.
"At a certain point, Americans began thinking that they were the ideal," said Anatoly M. Karachinsky, president of Information Business Systems, one of Russia's largest information-technology companies. "But there are no ideal laws."
The American model has put down roots around the world that are too deep to be uprooted entirely by the recent wave of scandals, especially in developing countries like India that have pushed hard to modernize in recent years. Executives there said that a decade ago, an Enron or WorldCom collapse might have tipped the policy argument against Westernization of the economy, but there is no turning back now.
What has happened instead, in India, Russia and elsewhere, is a painful loss of face for the consultants and accountants representing American companies. "The scandal has been unhelpful, especially since we, as a profession, operate on a reputation and the implicit trust that follows," said Gautam Dalal, chief executive of the Indian arm of KPMG.
In Western Europe, corporations have been gravitating toward American management principles for much of the last decade. They raise money on Wall Street, and a growing number now list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, obliging them to report their results according to American rules.
But those rules have also met growing resistance. The New York Stock Exchange recently invited Porsche to list its shares. Porsche will not make a decision until December, but its executives have openly balked at some of the requirements that would go with such a listing. Porsche refuses to publish its financial results quarterly, as American companies must, because executives worry about being held hostage to short-term pressures.
The American practice of executive enrichment is also coming under attack. Appalled at the tens of millions of dollars that executives at Enron and many other companies received through stock options, the chairman of Germany's biggest steel manufacturer cautioned his peers this week against following suit. "I warn people not to simply take over rules from the United States without first reflecting on them critically," said Gerhard Cromme of ThyssenKrupp. 
German companies, led by Volkswagen, are adamantly fighting proposals by the European Commission that would make hostile takeovers easier. Advocates of the new rules say they would force companies to become more accountable to their shareholders, but German leaders say they would create an "unfair playing field." 
European leaders are also pushing for greater acceptance of their auditing rules, known as the international accounting standards, as an alternative to American rules. The great virtue of the international accounting standards, which all European Union companies will have to adopt by 2005, is that it is a simple and fairly compact list of basic principles. The American system, by contrast, is made up of volumes and volumes of decisions reached over the years on the finest nuances and shadings of every issue. 
European critics (and a growing number of Americans) say the American system permits companies to follow the letter of the law while violating its spirit -- to "tick boxes rather than use sound judgment," said Peter Wyman, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
Whether the international standard wins out over the American standard or not, global investors are clearly anxious to see some kind of meaningful accounting reform before they plunge back into the United States. A survey this month by UBS Warburg and the Gallup Organization found that only 32 percent of European investors now rank the United States as the most attractive market in the world. 
But investors do not have many other places to go. European economic growth is expected to remain slower than American growth for the foreseeable future, Japan remains moribund and other markets are seen as fraught with risks.
"The one major currency area that has been able to play the role of safe harbor is the American area," said Jurgen Muller, a senior economist at DaimlerChrysler. "Everybody in the world is staring at the U.S. economy. Everybody is waiting for the U.S. economy to boom again."

HEADLINE: Signs of Progress Seen in Closing Trenton Budget Gap Before Sunday's Deadline 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26 

 BODY:
With four days remaining for New Jersey to adopt a budget, the mood in the State House has become an odd blend of fiscal crisis and summer recess.
 The State Constitution requires that a balanced budget be approved by July 1, and with that deadline approaching, Republican lawmakers complained today that Gov. James E. McGreevey had still not released a detailed spending plan because his budget for the 2003 fiscal year would lead to higher property taxes. 
 Democrats retaliated by blaming Republicans for the fiscal trouble Mr. McGreevey inherited when he took office in January, and said they had made contingency plans for a government shutdown in case a balanced budget was not in place by midnight Sunday. 
Yet despite all the talk of fiscal doom and crushing deadline pressure, officials from both parties managed to find time this week for some of the less urgent chores of elective office. The budget negotiations scheduled for Thursday are expected to end by midafternoon so state leaders can attend fund-raisers: Republicans have an event featuring Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Democrats will hold a party before a Jimmy Buffett concert in Camden. The Democratic State Committee will also hold its annual convention in Atlantic City Thursday night through Saturday morning, whether or not a budget agreement has been reached.
Leaders of the State Senate, which is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, have scheduled sessions for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, although legislators from both parties said they hoped to avoid working into the weekend.
But even as the rhetorical battle between the parties heated up today, there were fleeting signs of progress. Senator John O. Bennett, the Republican co-president of the Senate, said the two sides had moved closer to an agreement on the most divisive aspect of the budget: the plan to raise more than $1 billion in additional revenues from corporate taxes.
"One way or another, I think we'll have a budget in place," Mr. Bennett said.
New Jersey's fiscal problems have so thoroughly dominated state politics during the past eight months that lawmakers from both parties seemed eager to play out the endgame of the budget process. The day after he was elected last November, Mr. McGreevey began warning New Jerseyans that tough times were looming and that Republicans had left the state's finances depleted.
By March, Mr. McGreevey had unveiled his own $23.7 billion budget plan, a 9 percent increase in spending, which raised revenues by draining the surpluses in an assortment of special state trust funds, and proposing to sell bonds against the state's portion of the tobacco settlement.
But the slumping economy has made the budget process more difficult because state tax revenues continue to decline and Wall Street analysts have lowered New Jersey's bond rating three times.
While a complete appropriations bill had not been made available to Republicans by this evening, the McGreevey administration did release a summary of its updated budget proposals, which call for spending $400 million less than in the governor's original plan.
Mr. McGreevey has dropped plans to increase casino taxes by $33 million and to raise $12 million by making rural communities pay for the state troopers assigned to patrol them, said an aide to the governor who insisted on anonymity. The summary also calls for reducing spending for health and senior services by $47 million and environmental protection by $8 million.
Republicans said they suspected that Mr. McGreevey was reluctant to release the appropriations bill because its details would anger the public. Mr. Bennett said that by freezing school aid, Mr. McGreevey would force communities to raise their property taxes.
"The budget bill has been hidden because it is bad for New Jersey," Mr. Bennett said.
The governor brushed aside those criticisms, saying that both he and the treasurer had conferred with Republicans about the budget plans, and that the delay was caused by the complexity of the state's fiscal problems.
"Ultimately, New Jersey cannot repeat the mistake that was made over the past two years," Mr. McGreevey said. "New Jersey must have a balanced budget based upon sound revenue projections and not fanciful expectations."
One expense yet to be determined is the amount allocated for legislators' pet projects, which New Jersey politicians refer to as Christmas tree items and add hundreds of millions to the state budget some years. Richard J. Codey, the Democratic co-president of the Senate, said that this year's budget would be too tight to allow for any such spending. 
But after 10 years in the minority, many Democratic legislators are eager to be heard now that their party has attained a split in the Senate and controls the governor's office and General Assembly. The McGreevey administration also needs at least one Republican vote to win approval of the budget in the Senate.
But Mr. Codey cautioned that Republicans were in no position to make harsh criticisms or costly demands. "They dug New Jersey into a big hole," he said. "It's their job to dig out of the hole, and we'll help them."

HEADLINE: Beloved Yet Guilty, Providence Mayor Won't Run Again 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., June 26 

 BODY:
Two days after being convicted of corruption, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. announced today that he would not seek election to a fourth straight term in November.
 "It's time for me to move on," Mr. Cianci said. "It's been a great ride. It's been a great experience." 
 The 61-year-old Mr. Cianci, a charismatic and beloved figure in Providence even after his indictment, announced his decision even as he held out hope that a federal judge would reverse his racketeering conspiracy conviction next week.
On Monday, Mr. Cianci was found guilty of one count of conspiracy. At the same he was bringing about Providence's revitalization over the past 12 years, prosecutors said, he and his co-defendants had turned Providence into a "city for sale," where jobs, contracts and tax breaks could be had for payoffs.
The state attorney general has ruled that Mr. Cianci may remain in office until he is sentenced in September. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
Mr. Cianci has been mayor of Providence for 21 years, first serving as a Republican from 1975 to 1984, when he was forced to resign after pleading no contest to charges of assaulting the man who had been having an affair with his then wife. He was re-elected as an independent in 1990.
During his tenure, Providence has gone from a down-and-out New England city to a gem of urban renewal. The city is now featured in a television network drama bearing the city's name and has new parks, a $460 million shopping mall and more than $300 million in transportation improvements.
"The question is whether or not the city of Providence is something that I can leave now with a great deal of nostalgia and a lot of good memories," Mr. Cianci said on Tuesday.
He said today that it was time to return to private life, regardless of whether his conviction is overturned.
"This is a final decision," he said.
Mr. Cianci was convicted of conspiracy to solicit bribes in the form of campaign contributions.
