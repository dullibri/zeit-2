HEADLINE: Some Insurers Halt Coverage for Vans Linkedto Rollovers 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
After deadly rollover crashes of 15-passenger vans that killed or injured young athletes, church choir members and summer campers, a growing number of colleges and churches are prohibiting or severely limiting the use of the vehicles, and some insurance companies are refusing to insure the vans as costly lawsuit settlements threaten to cut into their profits.
 Accidents involving athletes from Urbana University, Kenyon College, DePaul University, the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Prairie View A&M University within three months led federal officials to issue a well-publicized warning about the vans two years ago. 
 But the officials, from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, concluded that the vans, which are also commonly used by airport shuttle services and day care centers, were not inherently dangerous. Many of the problems, it said, are attributable to inexperienced drivers piloting fully loaded vehicles.
Last April the agency repeated its warning. The Marine Corps, which, like other military services, uses the vans widely, distributed the safety alert to all of those using the vehicles. Capt. Shawn Turner, a Marine spokesman at the Pentagon, said last night that the corps was considering limiting the use of the vans because of safety concerns. 
When carrying only a few passengers, the traffic agency said, the vans have a rollover rate that is similar to other light trucks and vans. But when fully loaded, the likelihood of a rollover is six times the usual. The insurers say the vans, even when lightly loaded, sometimes roll over if the steering wheel is jerked in an emergency maneuver.
The Ford Motor Company, which accounts for about 80 percent of the 21,000 15-passenger vans sold annually, acknowledges that its E350, Econline and Club Wagon models can be tricky to handle. But Carolyn Brown, a Ford spokeswoman, said: "If it is not overloaded and if it is driven properly, it is a very safe vehicle."
The problem with 15-passenger vans is similar to what Ford experienced two years ago with its Explorer sport utility vehicle. Both have high centers of gravity and thus can tip over more easily than cars if they have to negotiate sudden turns, as when a tire blows out.
Ford has been building similar vehicles for 40 years, Ms. Brown said, adding that sales were on the rise. "We would see no reason why an insurance company would not feel it was a worthy vehicle to insure," Ms. Brown said.
But the Colorado School Districts Self-Insurance Pool, the biggest insurer of public schools in that state, stopped issuing new coverage for the vans on July 1. And, on top of the average premium cost of $750 a vehicle, it imposed a $500 surcharge for customers with up to 10 of the vans.
GuideOne, a leading insurer of churches and their vehicles, announced last week that it had stopped selling new policies. Two other big church insurers, Church Mutual and Brotherhood Mutual, have issued safety advisories.
P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group that represents major insurers including State Farm, said other companies were deciding case by case whether to insure the vans.
Fatal rollovers, however, have continued -- most recently in late June, when a Ford Econoline van carrying firefighters in Colorado crashed, killing five passengers. Between 1990 and 2000, the large, heavy vans were involved in 388 rollovers, killing 558 people, government records show. Comparable figures for other vehicles were not available.
Jeff Wigington, a lawyer in Corpus Christi, Tex., who has represented plaintiffs in half a dozen cases involving fatal crashes with the vans, says they ought to be recalled.
Other assessments have not gone that far, at least not publicly. But Jim Wallace, the chief executive of GuideOne, called the vehicles "inherently dangerous."
"Our underlying claims experience has been bad on these," he said. "We've had a number of heart-wrenching claims. They tend to be Sunday school classes going on retreat or on missions to help others. These things turn over, and a lot of people die or get injured."
GuideOne, based in West Des Moines, Iowa, said it would continue coverage on the 10,000 vans it already insures. But it is raising rates 20 percent to 25 percent and is trying to persuade van owners to replace them with small school buses.
Federal officials say they are powerless to recall a vehicle that may be difficult to handle but that has no specific mechanical defect.
"This is not a defect issue," Dr. Jeffrey Runge, the administrator of the federal agency, said through a spokesman. "It's a behavior issue with drivers and passengers."
The spokesman, Rae Tyson, added: "These vehicles don't handle like a passenger car, they handle more like a truck. And people who drive trucks understand you have to be particularly careful to avoid a situation that could lead to a rollover."
Critics of the traffic safety agency say it is as weak in response to the dangers of the 15-passenger vans as it was to the Ford Explorer problem.
Mr. Wigington called the agency's warnings in this case "merely a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound."
"With the Ford Explorer," he said, "it wasn't until many people died and there was a public outcry that the manufacturer took steps to redesign the vehicle."
The 15-passenger vans are popular in public school fleets because of their ample capacity and modest price -- usually less than $30,000 compared with $35,000 or more for a bus of similar size. Congress moved to ban them for public school use in 1974 because they were regarded as far less safe than standard school buses. But it left several loopholes that Representative Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, is trying to close with new legislation. His bill would also prohibit colleges and universities from using the vans.
"We're strongly with Congresssman Udall on this," said Wayne Scott, president of the American Association of Classified School Employees, a union that represents school drivers and other school employees except teachers in 40 states. "They're tremendously dangerous vehicles."
In Tennessee, the Department of Human Services, which oversees day care centers that use hundreds of the vans to transport small children, is imposing new requirements for drivers and by 2005 will ban the use of the vehicles. The University of Virginia has banned them, and the University of Texas athletic department has stopped using them while the university develops a systemwide program on their use, with some restrictions.
Dave Williams, who is in charge of insurance for the three vans of the First Baptist Church of Raytown, near Kansas City, Mo., said that until hearing from GuideOne he had had no inkling that the vans might be dangerous. "I was very grateful," he said, adding that he immediately made plans to replace the vans. He said that he was not surprised by the premium increase and that he planned to stay with GuideOne.
Eliminating a category of coverage is unusual for insurance companies. When claims begin rising, they usually simply increase premiums. In its 55-year history, for example, GuideOne has never eliminated a line of coverage for safety reasons. GuideOne and the Colorado insurer said they would stop issuing new policies out of concern for the safety of their customers and their own bottom lines. GuideOne said that of the crashes in which it paid out more than $100,000 in claims for injuries in the last five years, the cost for those involving 15-passenger vans averaged $492,000, compared with $350,000 for other vehicles.
But Cheryle Sullivan, the chief executive of the Colorado insurance pool, cited another reason. With such widespread notice of the dangers of the vehicles, she said, a court might determine that anyone using one was so reckless that the insurance would be nullified. GuideOne and the Colorado company both said that within a few years, they hope to have none of the vans on their books.
The national traffic safety agency, which began investigating the vans after several crashes involving college athletes, issued a warning to consumers in April 2001, focusing on the propensity of the vehicles to tip over. In that warning and a second one last April, the agency said only experienced drivers should operate the vans. It also stressed the use of seat belts. In another report on the vans, the agency said the overwhelming majority of the people who died in 15-passenger van crashes were not wearing seat belts.
After the government warning in April, Ford issued an advisory cautioning against "sharp turns, excessive speed and abrupt maneuvers."
In most states, people can drive these vans with a standard driver's license. But in January, GuideOne will require its customers either to get a commercial or a chauffeur's license or to pass a defensive driving course.
Richard Schaber, a spokesman for Church Mutual in Merrill, Wis., said his company felt an obligation to continue insuring the vans. "The 15-passenger van is the church vehicle of choice," he said. "So we need to insure them."

HEADLINE: Pataki Is Using Fiscal Tricks To Avoid Cuts, His Rivals Say 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki rode into office eight years ago as a fiscal conservative, railing about the fiscal gimmicks and spendthrift policies of his Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo.
 So it is no small irony that the two Democrats seeking to oppose him in this year's election -- one of them Governor Cuomo's son -- have leveled the same sort of charges against him. 
 The Democrats, Andrew M. Cuomo and H. Carl McCall, assert that the Republican governor cobbled together this year's budget with one-shot revenues and accounting tricks to avoid making cuts in an election year. They have also accused him of squandering the biggest surplus in state history by raising spending since 1998 instead of paying off debts. 
Mr. Pataki counters that New York, unlike most other states, avoided severe service cuts and tax increases this year because he had built up savings over his two terms. His aides say that the current budget is still on a sound footing, even taking into account weaker-than-expected revenues in the first third of the fiscal year.
It is too early to tell if the budget will fall apart right after the election, as Mr. Cuomo and some of the more pessimistic Albany lawmakers predict, budget analysts said. Yet the state's financial position could sharply worsen later this year unless the economy rebounds, they said.
What is certain is that the state will face an enormous budget shortfall next year of $5 billion to $7 billion, no matter who becomes governor, budget experts say. In essence, Mr. Pataki has pushed off painful cuts until next year by exhausting the state's reserves. "Because there were no real spending reductions here, it made next year's problem much worse," said E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute.
In New York State, the governor proposes the budget for each fiscal year, beginning April 1. The Legislature can approve, strike out or reduce appropriations. Lawmakers can also add money for some programs, but the governor can veto those additions. A tradition of back-room budget negotiations has developed. The leaders refuse to pass the governor's budget until spending is passed for their priorities. This year was no different, despite the faltering economy, plummeting revenues and the fiscal fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks.
In January, Governor Pataki proposed a $88.6 billion budget, of which about $59 billion would come from state taxes and fees and the rest from federal grants. His proposal raised spending $4 billion and contained few major cuts aside from a freeze on education spending.
By early May, Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders had agreed to add $600 million in spending, even as April tax revenues came in low. The final budget raised spending by 3 percent from the previous year, though budget officials were lowering predictions of income tax revenue by $2.5 billion, or 10 percent.
The only way for the governor and the Legislature to make ends meet was to spend down the state's savings and sweep out various pots of money earmarked for special purposes into the general fund. The budget spends about $3.1 billion in one-time revenues that will not be there next year, including savings. It leaves the state with a bare $710 million in reserves.
Since the budget passed, the revenue picture has not improved. Tax collections in the first four months of the fiscal year were $259 million below predictions, a drop the administration says owed more to the timing of payments than the economy. Mr. Pataki has stuck to his May prognosis that the state will collect about $40 billion in taxes this year, about $1 billion less than last year.
But the governor has carefully avoided saying what the budget gap will be next spring. In January, he predicted the state would have a $2.8 billion hole to fill.
That figure, however, does not take into account the spending added by the Legislature or the steep drop-off in income tax revenues the administration now predicts. When those are factored in, along with the one-shot revenues, the gap is likely to be at least $5 billion and could rise to $7 billion, several budget analysts said.
The Democratic candidates have tried to make the budget a campaign issue. Mr. McCall, who as state comptroller oversees spending, has criticized Mr. Pataki for raising the state's indebtedness during earlier economic expansion. He also has tried to pick away at Mr. Pataki's image as a fiscal conservative. "He squandered the biggest surplus in history," Mr. McCall said last week. "He didn't do the things I suggested, like paying down some of our existing debt or putting money in reserve."
For his part, Mr. Cuomo has painted the budget agreement between Mr. Pataki, the Assembly's Democratic leaders and the Senate's Republican majority as an election-year fraud. Casting himself as a reformer, Mr. Cuomo has tried to tar Mr. McCall with the same brush, charging he also is part of the "dysfunctional culture of Albany."
Mr. Pataki acknowledges that the state faces dire straits next year but denies that the budget is irresponsible. He points out that he came into office with a $5 billion deficit left by Governor Cuomo and has since presided over seven years of surpluses and four credit-rating upgrades.
Mr. Pataki cut the budget during his first two years in office and held spending flat in the third. Over the next four years, however, he raised state spending 16 percent higher than the inflation rate, with the largest jumps in election years. The red-hot economy of the 1990's made it possible for him to raise spending, cut taxes and still build up more than $3 billion in savings. Borrowing also rose about one-third, or $10 billion.
Michael McKeon, the governor's spokesman, dismissed Mr. McCall's criticisms as politically motivated and said Mr. Cuomo, who was in his father's administration, was being hypocritical. "I don't think the Cuomos have any standing," he said. "They left the cupboard empty."
But some budget watchers say tax collections are not improving and spending cuts may be needed in December. Income tax collections, the heart of the state's revenues, were especially sluggish from April through July, bringing in $2.1 billion -- or 23 percent -- less than in the same period last year. 
"It's hard to see how they meet their plan," said Elizabeth Lynam, a researcher with the Citizens Budget Commission. "Most of what they expected to lose for the entire year they already lost in the first quarter."

HEADLINE: The Case For Sanctions 

BYLINE:  By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank is a professor of economics at Cornell University's Johnson School of Management.

DATELINE: ITHACA, N. Y. 

 BODY:
From his approach to pollution abatement as governor of Texas to his approach to corporate malfeasance as president, George W. Bush has made voluntary compliance his motto. Explaining his initial opposition to strict criminal sanctions in the recently passed corporate fraud law, for example, he said that while tougher laws might help, "ultimately the ethics of American business depend on the conscience of America's business leaders."
 There are indeed limits to the law's ability to regulate human behavior. And public officials should try to nurture our inclination to do the right thing. But the downside to voluntary compliance is that it overlooks the critical role played by enforcement in society's efforts to curb self-interest for the common good. Granted, even laws and regulations with teeth might not be able to prevent offenses like the ones confessed this week by Michael J. Kopper, a former Enron financial executive. But without such enforcement measures, we are asking those who comply voluntarily to shoulder an unfair burden. 
 Consider the forces confronting honest executives as they weigh how to report their company's earnings. They know that many entries in the company's financial statements entail subjective judgments. Some, for instance, hinge on estimates and assumptions about the future, others on imperfect models for imputing monetary values to nonmarket assets. A broad range of earnings estimates could be defended as reasonable.
And therein lies the problem, because a company's ability to finance future growth depends strongly on how its reported earnings compare with those of its rivals. Indeed, this is how the capital markets decide which companies are most likely to succeed. Stock prices of corporations that report relatively low current earnings often fall sharply in the short run, increasing the risk of failure in the long run.
So it is difficult to see how even the most scrupulous executives could justify calculating their company's earnings on the basis of strictly neutral, let alone pessimistic, assumptions. On the plausible presumption that most other companies will report earnings near the optimistic end of the reasonable range, failure to do likewise would be to understate the company's relative prospects.
The problem is compounded by the fact that the standards defining acceptable accounting judgments depend on context. When almost all companies issue optimistic earnings reports, such reports come to be viewed as normal. Even the most cautious executives then feel pressure to report their earnings even more optimistically, in turn creating room for their more aggressive counterparts to push the envelope further.
Given this dynamic, and the enormous sums at stake in the battle for corporate survival, careful monitoring and stiff sanctions against violators are essential. It is one thing to ask people to forgo ill-gotten gains but quite another to ask them to commit economic suicide.
If we want people to restrain themselves for the common good, the sacrifices we demand must be made by everyone. This applies to areas outside of business as well. To ask athletes not to use steroids in the absence of effective sanctions is to penalize those who comply while rewarding those who don't. To ask people to be scrupulous in their tax filings in an audit-free environment is to reduce the effective tax rate for dishonest taxpayers while increasing it for honest ones.
Congress was wise to include criminal sanctions in its recent corporate fraud legislation. Major League Baseball would do well to include random testing and stiff penalties in the steroid ban under consideration. And President Bush should rethink the wisdom of the sharp cuts in the I.R.S.'s staff and budget, which have reduced the tax audit rate by more than half since 1996.
As Adam Smith himself was well aware, the invisible hand of the marketplace does not always produce the greatest good for all. When individual and social interests conflict, voluntary compliance must be supplemented by sanctions potent enough to matter. As President Ronald Reagan put it, "Trust, but verify."

HEADLINE: Talk-Show Tips for Bill Clinton 

BYLINE:  By Ben Stein; Ben Stein, a writer and actor, is the host of "Win Ben Stein's Money."

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif. 

 BODY:
Dear Mr. Clinton,
I hear you might host a television talk show. Congratulations.
 But before you put on your lavaliere mike and your earpiece and slick back that roguish mane of gray hair, here's some advice I offer as a former host of a nighttime talk show, as the potential host of an upcoming daytime talker and as a former toiler in the White House. 
 First of all, on a "talk show," the host has to let someone else talk. Even an informed, lovable former president does not get to talk the whole time. Are you prepared to let the woman whose husband has left her for a younger man, the sex expert, the makeover stylist or the free-trade economist be the center of attention? That yearly salary of almost $50 million doesn't seem like so much now, does it? (It is, for the record, about 100 times more than what I am supposed to be paid for my daytime show, but then you are 100 times more famous and have about 100 times more hair than I do.)
Second, as the network has probably told you, daytime talk shows are aimed primarily at women. This means you provide these women with tips on their health and their looks and their finances. You make them feel as if you are their advocate, the way Phil Donahue did in years past and still does. You give them hope and information and a touch of excitement. But in general you do not get to spend time with them.
Third, on television, with a busy schedule of "gang taping" lots of shows far in advance so you can still be the headline act at those big-bucks real-estate seminars in Shanghai, you have to show up on time, not on B.C.T., Bill Clinton Time, which is two hours late. If you get the union crew into overtime and then double time and then "golden" time (something like triple overtime), you get into serious trouble. Do you really want to get into trouble with people who are paying you $50 million? (Not that I'm obsessed with this figure.)
If these problems don't faze you, you may be perfect for the job. After all, the essence of daytime talk is to feel the audience's pain, and we know you are the maestro there. A large part of this gig is just being a sexy and sympathetic man of a certain age, and you've got that locked up (until my show starts, that is). So you might want to think up some gimmicks. Start your own book club, for example. (Resist the temptation to assign "Earth in the Balance.")
I just want to warn you that once you start earning $50 million (did I mention that amount already?), you're going to start to wonder why you have to keep working at all. Trust me, you have to. So go for it. Your program may yet be the ultimate reality show about death and resurrection. Just please leave a few million viewers for me.

HEADLINE: Sustaining the Planet 

 BODY:
With the American president a conspicuous exception, leaders from nearly 100 nations will begin assembling next week in Johannesburg to address the future of life on this planet. At the heart of the conference is a formidable if now familiar challenge -- figuring out ways to bring economic well-being to billions of people now trapped in poverty without destroying the land, water, air and biodiversity required to sustain life itself.
 It will be the third such meeting in three decades, and if the past is any guide, the Johannesburg conclave -- known formally as the World Summit on Sustainable Development -- will be long on good intentions and short on specific solutions. Even so, it is a meeting well worth having. The Stockholm summit in 1972 inspired the industrialized nations to begin cleaning up their air and water. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 produced treaties on global warming and biodiversity that, while vague, officially committed at least the industrialized nations to address two major environmental threats that had long gone unattended. In the last decade these challenges have not receded, while others have arisen. 
 President Bush's absence is regrettable, and reinforces his well-deserved reputation -- flowing in part from his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming -- for indifference to environmental problems and reflexive hostility to multilateral remedies. If anyone can dispel that impression, however, it is Secretary of State Colin Powell, who will lead the American delegation. Though his visit will be brief, Mr. Powell at least shares the view that environmental degradation and poverty can destabilize nations as surely as actual warfare. 
There is little doubt that current patterns of development are unsustainable over the long term. As the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, recently observed, fish stocks continue to shrink, tropical rain forests (and associated species) continue to recede, and agricultural productivity declines while the number of mouths to feed grows. 
In 25 years, two-thirds of the world may be living without enough water. Meanwhile, use of fossil fuels means increased global warming. Millions die every year from tropical diseases, waterborne germs and parasites and the pollution that results from the unshielded indoor combustion of primitive fuels. Eliminating these diseases must be part of any development program.
Sustainable development may mean higher short-run costs. It can also generate longer-range savings. The Times has reported a large German insurance company's estimate that the consequences of global warming will cost as much as $300 billion annually by 2050. Health problems arising from poor sanitation, habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity also carry a high economic price. For these and other reasons, the conference's organizers have rejected the notion that nations must choose between economic growth and environmental protection. Both are indispensable. 
Mr. Bush's opposition to Kyoto means that global warming will not get the attention it did 10 years ago in Rio. However, Secretary Powell has generally expressed support for Mr. Annan's agenda, and is expected to announce a package of health, environmental and food programs aimed at helping Africa after he arrives. In the conference's aftermath, he needs to go further and lead an effort to reconfigure American foreign aid as a whole to underwrite sustainable development.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Steel Tariffs Put G.O.P. On the Spot In Campaigns

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
When President Bush set aside his free-trade principles in March and imposed steep new tariffs on imported steel, many critics said he had sacrificed sound economic policy to win political support in important electoral states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.
 That contention may or may not be valid, and White House officials say they had numerous good reasons for protecting a long-troubled industry. 
 But as became clear Thursday, when the administration backpedaled a bit by exempting 178 kinds of steel imports from the new tariffs, protectionism carries its own political risks.
Even though steel companies have benefited from the new tariffs, many American manufacturers have complained about sharply higher prices and difficulties in obtaining specialized kinds of steel that are available only from foreign suppliers. 
Thursday's partial reversal was an attempt to smooth over those competing interests, opening the path to the kinds of steel that are difficult or impossible to buy from American producers.
But instead of smoothing the waters, it provoked immediate protests from American steel producers, which had opposed more than half of the exemptions and said the effect of the benefits accrued from the original ruling would be sharply diluted.
For Republicans fighting to hold onto their tiny six-seat majority in the House and to win the one seat needed to reclaim the Senate, that poses a problem.
Pennsylvania alone has at least two hard-fought House races in areas that produce steel or have experienced the closing of big mills. Ohio and Indiana each have at least one serious election battle in a steel area, and voters throughout the region are anxious about imports of many types.
G.O.P. candidates, who normally pride themselves on their pro-business credentials, are already on the defensive about public anger over Enron and other corporate accounting scandals. Now lawmakers in steel states may have to confront accusations of not doing enough to support their home industry.
Representative Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, is in a combative race against Ed O'Brien, a longtime local leader in the United Steelworkers of America. Bethlehem Steel has already shut its operations in the district, but tens of thousands of retired steel workers are still there.
"The steel industry is already gone," Mr. O'Brien said in a phone interview today. But, he added, the proliferation of new exclusions from the steel tariffs makes it easier to attack his opponents' credibility as an advocate for ordinary workers.
"My opinion from the get-go was: What is it they were really trying to do to save our industry? Was this just a pre-election plot to give candidates a chance to play as if they were on the side of workers?"
Representative Phil English, a Pennsylvania Republican who represents Erie and is chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, acknowledged that the Bush administration's most recent twist on steel had caused heartburn.
Today, one day after companies like U.S. Steel and Weirton Steel said they were "very disappointed" by the administration's latest move, Mr. English found himself defending the need to "balance" competing interests.
"We know that many people in the steel industry are concerned," Mr. English said, "but also recognize that the administration has some very difficult balancing to do in order to get the details right."
Indeed, he added, there is delicate political balance even with Pennsylvania. "The criticism I've been hearing from my district is more from steel consumers, who have been seeing the price of their supplies go up," he said.
There are ample reasons to complain. Many steel prices have jumped 35 percent to 60 percent since the tariffs were imposed, and many American manufacturing companies have complained loudly about being unable to obtain many kinds of steel that come only from foreign suppliers.
Few people dispute that the American steel industry is in dire trouble. More than 30 companies are in bankruptcy proceedings, and most others are running big losses.
But many experts say the industry's biggest problem is high "legacy costs" -- jargon for the costs of health and pension benefits for tens of thousands of retired workers, costs that are a hangover from the years before steel mills drastically reduced the employment levels.
For many, if not most, steel products, prices in the United States are higher than those in Europe and elsewhere. According to studies by the American Institute for International Steel, a lobbying group that represents steel importers, the spread between American and foreign steel prices has widened greatly since the tariffs were imposed.
To the extent that President Bush was hoping to bring the G.O.P. more blue-collar votes, the steel tariffs provide at best a mixed benefit.
All of the American carmakers have sought exemptions for steel imports they say they cannot acquire easily elsewhere. So have manufacturers of appliances and electrical equipment, and scores of smaller metal-forming companies that are themselves in steel-producing states.
The Bush administration's latest attempt to strike a balance cheered up many steel-using companies as well as leaders in Europe and Japan who are still bitterly fighting the American barriers.
But the puzzle of steel protection has hardly been resolved. Next week, the International Trade Commission is expected to decide on whether American producers of cold-rolled steel are being injured by imports and therefore need protection, too.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Cuomo in the Clinton Years

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN (NYT)

 BODY:
 Andrew M. Cuomo began running these two similar television advertisements on his record as the secretary of housing under President Clinton. One, "Real Results," will be broadcast upstate; "Real Resume" will be broadcast in the New York City area.

PRODUCER -- Squier, Knapp & Dunn

ON THE SCREEN -- Both commercials show dual screens against a dynamic blue-and-white background. Each screen flashes images of Mr. Cuomo. When the narration turns to his time as the head of housing and urban development, both screens show him with President Clinton.
As the male narrator touts Mr. Cuomo's accomplishments, official-looking citations appear on the screen: "Source: Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged." and "Source: the White House, Nov. 8, 1999."
Later, a blue lowercase "ny" appears on a white background, superimposed with the words "Andrew Cuomo for governor. Strong leadership. Real results. 

THE SCRIPT -- "Andrew Cuomo has a record of real results. He started a nonprofit that took 75,000 people off our streets and into jobs and housing." (In the downstate ad, the voiceover adds, "The New York Times labeled it 'a national housing model.' ")
"As President Clinton's secretary, Cuomo overhauled a $30 billion agency. He managed a $500 billion mortgage fund bringing home ownership to record highs." (In the upstate ad only: "Cuomo delivered $1.6 billion in economic development aid to upstate New York.") Both ads say his economic development programs created "300,000 new jobs nationwide."
"Andrew Cuomo. Strong leadership. Real results."

ACCURACY -- There are many claims in this ad, and there are many opinions on Mr. Cuomo's record at HUD. His other claims are equally difficult to sort out. During his tenure at HUD, government auditors criticized the agency for lack of financial controls, although they noted some improvement. One scandal that plagued the agency was the disclosure that 500 properties, many in Harlem, had been sold to real estate speculators and left undeveloped.

SCORECARD -- At 44, Mr. Cuomo has a far shorter resume than his rival in the Democratic primary, H. Carl McCall, but with this ad he makes the most of it, emphasizing his management experience even while it keeps Mr. Cuomo, who polls say tends to inspire dislike, from directly addressing the camera. The array of facts, figures and images might make viewers dizzy. SHAILA K. DEWAN (NYT)

 INFLATING A DOG
The Story of Ella's
Lunch Launch.
By Eric Kraft.
Illustrated. 242 pp. New York:
Picador USA. $25.
 STARTING in the mid-1970's, Eric Kraft began publishing (initially self-publishing) a series of eccentric novels and stories about a winsome Long Island boy named Peter Leroy. Every few years since, he has provided another installment to this sprawling collection. Because the books aren't written in chronological order, they don't trace Peter's life so much as add more layers to it, moving freely back and forth from Peter's middle years to his childhood in the fictional town of Babbington, on Bolotomy Bay. They include photographs, diagrams, fragments of plays and other ephemera, forming an unpredictable, gentle and often charming literary collage.
"Inflating a Dog," the latest Peter Leroy volume, is a novel about physical and spiritual buoyancy. It's about keeping boats afloat and hopes aloft, and how, in one summer of Peter's adolescence, he manages to do both. It isn't Kraft's best work, but it has some lovely moments.
At 56, Peter is looking back at a period in his early teens when his mother, Ella, was losing faith in herself and life's possibilities. In an attempt to become something more than a bland housewife, Ella had started various crackpot businesses, from candy making to "high-heel-low-heel convertible shoes." None succeeded. "Most of the time," Peter observes, "there was a deadness in my mother's eyes, the blankness that comes with the expectation that nothing will make today different from yesterday or tomorrow different from today."
In 2002, we would label Ella "depressed," but in the wonderful invented idiom of the book she is "deflated." In the town of Babbington in the 1950's, Peter reports, teenagers had devised a very precise vocabulary to describe the phenomenon of enthusiasm and all its nuances. They had started with the phrase "blown up" -- or, more elegantly, "inflated" -- to capture the feeling of being filled with amazement, delight and inspiration, and had come up with ever more exact locutions: "When we suspected people of faking or exaggerating a response, we said that they were pumping themselves up. People who tried too hard, particularly those who wanted to make very sure that everyone saw how blown up they could get in the inflationary presence of art or nature, we called blimps or gas bags."
Over the course of the summer, Peter has two projects: to inflate his mother and to seduce Patti Fiorenza, a schoolmate of cartoonishly exaggerated sexual allure. The plot revolves around Ella's purchase of a leaky clam boat (clams are a recurring Kraft motif, his madeleines) and her plan to offer catered cruises. Peter believes it is essential that Ella never discover the seriousness of the boat's leak. "Hope," he explains, "is like a warm breeze that lifts and lofts and carries us on when we hardly have the will to carry on otherwise." Every night he sneaks away and pumps out the boat, so that his mother can proceed in ignorant bliss and, with luck, regain her zest for life. (The book's title comes from a mystifying episode in "Don Quixote" in which a madman inflates a dog, a difficult feat that is presented as the equivalent of keeping Ella's dream intact.)
NO one who has ever taken a creative writing course can have escaped the admonition to show, not tell. Well, so much for that old saw. Kraft does both, but his showing is far less effective than his telling. When he sets his characters in action, the book wobbles. The plot is undeniably original, but also far-fetched and haphazard; it's not particularly funny, just kooky. Kraft is unfailingly and refreshingly generous with his characters, but, perhaps because many have figured in earlier novels, they aren't richly developed here.
On the other hand, when he sits back and starts telling us, for example, about the invented language of 1950's Babbingtonians, we're hooked. Kraft's erudite asides and abstract musings are what make "Inflating a Dog" fascinating and sophisticated reading.

 DESPERATELY SEEKING
CERTAINTY
The Misguided Quest
for Constitutional Foundations.
By Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry.
208 pp. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press. $30.
"WHAT you suggest may be all very well in practice," complained the apocryphal French philosopher, "but it will never work in theory." American law professors laugh uneasily. In recent years legal academe has been hungrily pursuing theoretical cachet. Law journals, once narrowly focused and written largely for judges and practicing lawyers, now feature work based on economics, history, philosophy and deconstructionist theory. Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry are concerned that the result -- in constitutional law, at least -- offers little help (and possible harm) to those who must argue or decide cases. Farber teaches at the University of Minnesota and Sherry at Vanderbilt. Their previous book, "Beyond All Reason," assailed the legal left for what they viewed as its relativism and sloppiness. In "Desperately Seeking Certainty," they rebuke six thinkers they see as shoehorning the Constitution into idiosyncratic theoretical pigeonholes.
The targets span the spectrum. Three -Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, the former judge Robert Bork and the University of Chicago professor Richard Epstein -- are distinctly on the right. Two others -- Bruce Ackerman of Yale and Ronald Dworkin of Oxford and New York University -- are old-fashioned liberals. The sixth, Akhil Reed Amar of Yale, defies easy characterization but is also on the left side of the spectrum. What all six share, the authors say, is "foundationalism" -- a belief that scholars can find one master key to interpreting the Constitution -- as well as "a penchant for novelty" that slights traditional approaches to constitutional interpretation. In particular, Farber and Sherry argue, these theorists devalue the common-law method of argumentation that builds on previous cases, and they pick each man apart in successive chapters that are lively and clear, but of somewhat uneven quality.
The unevenness arises because the six thinkers are not really comparable. Bork, for example, was once a brilliant academic, but in the years since the Senate rejected him for the Supreme Court, he has settled for lip-synching the current conservative line. The authors, in fact, are able to attribute a consistent theory to Bork ("originalism," or absolute commitment to the specific results supposedly intended by the Constitution's framers) only by ignoring much of his most recent book, "Slouching Towards Gomorrah," which argues against judicial review altogether. Scalia, who espouses a more nuanced form of originalism, is a first-class intellect -but as a judge on a nine-member court, he must decide concrete cases and win votes from colleagues, meaning that his work cannot attain perfect consistency.
Dworkin and Epstein discern their individual moral beliefs in the Constitution's general phrases. Dworkin, as a liberal philosopher of law, sees the document as requiring "equal concern" from government toward each citizen, and he instructs judges to apply this principle in accordance with the best moral reasoning available. Farber and Sherry point out that the plasticity of moral concepts means that in some ways Dworkin's position may not even be amenable to meaningful discussion.
Epstein, a libertarian thinker, sees property as the foundation of morals, and regards limits on its use as akin to robbery or trespass. This theory provides a clear prescription for judges -- strike down most economic regulation -- but it has little basis in history, case law or even most moral theory.
Ackerman contends that American history reveals recurrent periods of "higher lawmaking," when popular consent changed the meaning of the Constitution, even without formal amendment. But as Farber and Sherry note, he restricts this useful insight to three "constitutional moments," the founding, Reconstruction and the New Deal. It won't wash, they argue: "Constitutional change often occurs gradually and incrementally, not in momentous upheavals during which the People arise from their slumber."
Amar states that the Constitution and Bill of Rights were written largely to protect majority, not individual, rights. For example, he sees the First Amendment's protection of free speech as focused all but exclusively on popular assemblies, not the lonely dissenter.
AMAR calls his method "intertextualism." Simply put, an intertexualist examines how a term is used elsewhere in the Constitution, and provides an interpretation that makes the meaning consistent. Unfortunately, as the authors indicate, words often shift meanings in context. In addition, "Amar's history is too simplistic, too neat, and for that reason alone it is unlikely to be fully accurate." 
"Desperately Seeking Certainty" is at its best on the attack; the authors' criticisms are clear, sensitive and usually fair (though a certain well-known law school repeatedly evokes snideness, as in: "Perhaps, like Amar, Ackerman has been too long steeped in the rarefied atmosphere of the Yale Law School and too little exposed to what We the People have really been up to.") It is only a small disappointment -- and hardly a surprise -- that their solution is less cogent than their critique, and is also devoid of predictive or prescriptive value.
Farber and Sherry suggest that judges should use "the common law method that builds principles up from individual cases rather than down from abstract theories." But they provide little discussion of how that is properly done. They also argue for "legal pragmatism," which they define rather vaguely as "constitutional law as an evolving compromise." They might be a bit more forthright in noting that this definition of pragmatism offers little to constrain judges from enacting their policy preferences.
Farber and Sherry recognize that they have not provided a full explanation of how the Constitution should be interpreted. They promise a sequel that will set out "the implications of a pragmatist approach to constitutional adjudication." When it appears, of course, the authors' six targets will have their chance at revenge.

 REDESIGNING HUMANS
Our Inevitable Genetic Future.
By Gregory Stock.
277 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company.
$24.
 GREGORY STOCK has written an enthusiastic book in support of germ-line manipulations -- that is, making genetic modifications to eggs, sperm and embryos that can be passed on to future generations. Like previous explorations of the subject by the ethicist Joseph F. Fletcher, the lawyer John Robertson and the biologist James Watson, among others, "Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable Genetic Future" serves as an apologia for those scientists and physicians who are already edging toward such work in a piecemeal fashion in research labs and in vitro fertilization clinics around the world. It advocates the wholesale adoption of genetic manipulations with the purpose of finally taking control of human evolution. This, the author writes, "is the ultimate expression and realization of our humanity."
Because of the breadth of his scientific knowledge and his considerable flair as a writer, Stock -- who heads the program on medicine, technology and society at the School of Medicine of the University of California, Los Angeles -- is a forceful advocate. First and foremost, he says, such manipulations are inevitable -- an assertion he makes not only in his subtitle but repeatedly throughout his book. Stock may be correct, for many factors are driving genetic experimentation forward, including professional ambition, greed and the desperation of infertile couples who will submit to just about anything in order to have a child.
And it should be added that eugenic considerations have already entered into this enterprise (even though Stock states at one point that in the infertility field, no one "cares about such wild notions as human redesign"). Numerous practitioners of in vitro fertilization, starting with Robert Edwards of Baby Louise Brown fame, have discussed their goals for "improving" the species. Meanwhile, would-be parents readily buy into schemes to improve birth outcomes -- as they have done at least since the days of ancient Greece.
But to argue the inevitability of all this is to sidestep the paramount issue, which is how to balance the desires of researchers and of the potential consumers of laboratory technologies against the good of society. After all, scientists, when asked, will nearly always say that they would like to get on with their work unhampered by any sort of regulation.
However, unfettered science has not historically shown itself to be in the best interest of society, any more than unfettered government, religion or business have. The fact that biomedical tinkerings have brought benefits for some does not constitute a sufficient reason for concluding that the practitioners of the embryonic arts should have the right to pursue any and all lines of experiment. Nor is it an adequate argument to say that if banned, germ-line manipulations would simply move offshore or go to the black market. That may be true. But if the fact that people will seek to avoid the law were a reason not to have a law, we would have no laws at all.
Stock's overarching claim is that germ-line modifications will "write a new page in the history of life, allowing us to seize control of our evolutionary future," an echo of the classic eugenicist dream. New technologies will allow humans to make fundamental alterations to their individual genetic compositions and those of their children. The net effect, he says, will be to draw "reproduction into a highly selective social process that is far more rapid and effective at spreading successful genes than traditional sexual competition and mate selection." In the future, he claims, we will be "much more than simply human."
But Stock's assumptions regarding population biology and evolution are suspect. For example, he assures us that we needn't worry about any impact that germ-line alterations might have on the gene pool (like reducing genetic diversity) because the number of altered children would be quite small. But if the net effect of all those laboratory-engineered births is so negligible, how then can there be the major evolutionary changes he predicts? Moreover, while it is clearly possible to affect the genetic circumstances of small, reproductively isolated populations, most population geneticists would agree that the goal of bringing about substantial changes in a pool of six billion humans (and growing) is near to impossible, especially any time soon.
So the great collective enterprise Stock envisions will in all likelihood be limited only to the small percentage of people who can afford or gain access to these technologies. And then the issue becomes what these bermenschen might do with the rest of us.
STOCK frequently acknowledges problems with a particular line of experimentation, or impediments in the way of some of his predictions. But in each case, once he is done listing objections, he proceeds to a bold proclamation that effectively moots them all.
Nor do moral and ethical concerns slow him down for long. He declares, "If biological manipulation is indeed a slippery slope, then we are already sliding down that slope now and may as well enjoy the ride." The lesson he takes from history is that eugenics itself wasn't wrongheaded, just the nationalistic, totalitarian applications of it. "Given Hitler's appalling foray into racial purification," he writes, "European sensitivities are understandable, but they miss the bigger picture."
For Stock, this bigger picture is clear. The future is a time in which individuals will be able to go into a clinic and, through a simple procedure, obtain embryos fitted with chromosomal modules that will slow aging, eliminate disease and enhance personality, temperament, intellect and beauty. It's a pleasant enough fantasy. But even if evolution could be steered in a positive direction, why presume that humans have the wisdom to do so? "Redesigning Humans" is an act of both boosterism and reductionism. It admits but then ignores the enormous complexity of biological systems; it places biology firmly above social, ecological and economic considerations; and it reduces concepts like success in life to the purely physical, as if health and longevity were the only issues that mattered. Isn't it pretty to think so?

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
Women Seeking Men, None Too Carefully

BYLINE:  By Celestine Bohlen

 BODY:
Uma Thurman first saw "Hysterical Blindness," a bitter and funny play about women desperately seeking love in New Jersey, in 1997, the night before it closed Off Off Broadway. She had gone without expecting much but came away so moved and impressed that she decided to try her hand at producing and turn the play into a movie.
 "I found myself laughing and crying," Ms. Thurman said in a recent interview. "These characters were so familiar to me; I could see myself in them. It reflected life in both a secret and truthful way, and as a play about women -- I found it refreshing to have a view from the inside out, about how women feel about themselves." 
 Tonight on HBO, the characters who so captivated Ms. Thurman onstage five years ago will reappear in a film directed by Mira Nair ("Mississippi Masala," "Monsoon Wedding") and produced by Ms. Thurman, together with Jason Blum and Amy Israel. 
 In the film, which was the centerpiece of the Sundance Film Festival this year, Ms. Thurman plays the central character, Debby. "I think the responsibility falls very squarely on actresses these days to find good parts for themselves and others, at a time when cinema is not very actor-centered but concept- centered," she said over the telephone from Beijing, where she is filming "Kill Bill," a movie by Quentin Tarantino.
 At an Oscar party in Hollywood, Ms. Thurman asked Juliette Lewis, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting role in "Cape Fear," if she would be interested in playing Beth, a young single mother who is Debby's best friend.
 Debby is an intense, high-strung woman in her 20's who has a job as a warehouse clerk by day and at night stakes out the local bar, ready to pounce on any man who pays her the least attention. Beth, more easygoing, joins her in this continuing game of random, hope-filled flirtation, frequently leaving her 10-year-old daughter, Amber, at home alone. Meanwhile, Debby's mother, Virginia (Gena Rowlands), who has been single since Debby's father walked out on the two of them, is gingerly slipping into a new and kinder relationship with Nick, played by Ben Gazzara. Nick is an older man with honorable intentions but is instantly suspected by Debby, who is as suspicious as she is gullible, most of the time overlooking facts that are staring her in the face.
 The play, written by Laura Cahill, is set very specifically in 1987, in an era that has special meaning not only for Ms. Cahill, herself a Jersey girl who graduated from high school in Perth Amboy in the early 80's, but also for Ms. Thurman, who sees that decade as both poetic and tragic. "The 80's look like 'Happy Days' since Sept. 11," she said.
 In the film, the place is defined geographically as northern New Jersey -- Bayonne, to be precise -- where highways and bridges crop up in the background as a constant reminder of another, bigger world beyond the bars, the diners and the working-class neighborhoods that set the parameters of Debby's dreams.
 Ms. Cahill wrote "Hysterical Blindness" in 1994 and has since gone on to write more plays, including "Mercy," about single life on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which was staged in 1998. But in adapting the script of "Hysterical Blindness" for the movie, she found herself exhilarated by the freedom that comes from working with a camera.
 "I had always wanted to go places with the script that you can't go onstage, so I was really happy to be able to do more," Ms. Cahill said. "It is not just about the emotions that were in the play, but it is also about what everything looks like -- the inside of the kitchens, the cars. In a movie you can do so much more."
 The proximity of New York City, where Ms. Cahill now lives, didn't figure in the stage version, but she said the shadow of the city was there for her growing up in New Jersey. "You are just over the bridge, and yet there are people I grew up with who would never come to New York," she said.
 That insularity has changed somewhat, she added, giving the movie the faint aura of a period piece. "I think the world is more open now than it was then," she said. "The economy got better since then, and people are a little more evolved."
 What attracted both Ms. Thurman and Ms. Lewis to the project was Ms. Cahill's unvarnished, unsentimental glimpse of the ways women deal with the opposite sex and with one another -- not just in North Jersey in the 80's, but in other places, at other times.
 "I don't think human nature is ever dated," said Ms. Thurman. "One of the great strengths of Laura's writing is that it is based on human observation."
 Those observations don't make for a very pretty picture: Debby and Beth are both self-centered and shortsighted, and the object of Debby's desire, a construction worker named Rick (Justin Chambers), has little to say for himself or to Debby, who has deluded herself into thinking that beneath his complete indifference is a man who cares. Rick and Debby don't have conversations; they have sex instead.
 "I had never seen this female point of view told so honestly -- the obsessiveness, the self-inflicted humiliation and people getting stuck in patterns of behavior that are passed on from generation to generation," said Ms. Lewis. "It was so honest, without artifice and without romanticizing. I love that."
 The difference between generations is shown through Virginia, Debby's mother, who is more patient than her daughter and more trusting in her relationship with Nick. "The way we approached men, the way we looked for love and relationships was so drastically different from our mothers," said Ms. Cahill. "We were probably too aggressive, and they were maybe too passive."
 But among themselves, the three generations of women, including the watchful and very perceptive Amber, are honest about what they want and what they are willing to do to get it. They have few secrets from one another, and that honesty and the affection that it generates is what keeps them close, and makes them real.
 "When I first started writing the play, I was just writing down the things that my friends and I were going around saying," Ms. Cahill said. "I really like to write what people say."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 8-25-02; 
Acceptance

BYLINE:  By Walter Kirn; Walter Kirn is the author, most recently, of "Up in the Air." He is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
The news this year has offered Americans the chance to become connoisseurs of disillusionment. We've learned that high-level corruption, like fine wine, has an assortment of characteristic top notes, subtle accents and distinctive mouth feels that make for a range of tastes and aftertastes. Some scandals, like the priestly abuse of children, cause nausea. Others -- the big-money kind -- embitter. But just when the public must feel that it has sampled every vintage of deception, along comes the story of Princeton University's office of admission and its illicit visits to a Web site maintained by its counterparts at Yale to allow applicants to the freshman class to check whether they've been accepted. The staff poked through the files of several hopefuls, including that of Lauren Bush, the president's niece, who applied to both schools. 
 To what end, this bout of hacking? To gain some advantage in the competitive game of landing top talent and boosting the school's ratings in US News & World Report's next college guide? Or, as Princeton's own investigation of the incident suggests, were they merely testing the Yale site's security? (Or lack of it?) 
 Whatever the motives behind the furtive keystrokes, which Princeton promptly dealt with by reassigning and censuring the hackers, it seems unlikely to blight the school's prestige, either among those who dream of studying there or the parents who have mortgaged their homes to make this possible. This was a near-miss, as scandals go, an embarrassing unmasking that didn't quite happen. And yet it offers a chance to reconsider the peculiar mystique of the Ivy League itself, one of the last sacred national monuments still standing in this season of crumbling clay feet.
As the solemn doormen who guard the V.I.P. rooms of the American meritocracy, Ivy League admissions committees exist on a exalted social plane somewhere between Mount Olympus and the ozone layer. As inscrutable as the National Security Agency, as seemingly omniscient as the College of Cardinals and as secretive as the chemists at Coca-Cola, these obscure bureaucratic Magi decide, by means of esoteric formulas that you imagine are written in Aramaic and stashed in the subbasements of Gothic clock towers, precisely what combination of College Board scores, altruistic community involvement and ability to return a kickoff should qualify someone for a junior membership in the power elite. Their authority is intimidating and final, like the Federal Reserve's. They're the unmoved movers behind our human economy. 
The wonder is that, with all their influence, we agree to leave them alone in their maneuverings. While most other powerful social institutions, both public and private, must answer to an array of politicians, consumers, lawyers, inspectors general and organized pressure groups, the Ivies retain an aristocratic autonomy that the public seems loath to challenge or to second-guess. It's odd. Since who goes to Harvard this fall may substantially determine who runs the country 20 years from now, we all, in a sense, have an interest in Harvard's decisions -- and yet it's not an interest we pursue. Instead, we trust Harvard to come to its own judgments. Such blind faith just isn't like us. 
When so many Americans decline to exercise their right to be cynical, particularly nowadays, it can only be because there's something huge at stake -- a myth we sense we can't afford to tamper with. Here, it's the myth of the Ivy League degree as a real reflection of human excellence and as something for all young Americans to shoot for, even if it's assumed that most will miss and many others will give up before trying. It's a reason for immigrants' children to finish their homework. It's a reason for middle-class parents to buy savings bonds. Its intrinsic desirability and prestige are cultural counterweights to rather less noble but more relentless drives for money and fame and power for their own sakes. When the country loses its faith in C.E.O.'s, stock prices sink, but should it grow convinced that the system of meritocratic advancement itself is broken or corrupt, ambition and morale plunge. 
Our faith in any exclusive organization depends, of course, on how it has treated us personally. I'm a Princeton graduate myself, and for years I've harbored the self-serving belief that those who offered me a place there were indeed infallible judges of human potential who plugged my statistics into their patented formulas and sat back, stunned at the results. Had I been shown the door, I might think differently, but I doubt many people would have wanted to hear my gripes -- least of all those who were cramming for the College Boards that week or practicing jump shots from dawn to dinnertime. Sure, we suspect that the game is rigged at some level (Lauren Bush, best known to the public as a fashion model and a political relative, got yeses from both Yale and Princeton -- surprise!); but that's different from believing that it's a sham and that only a fool would would take his chances playing it. 
Princeton will be forgiven its little trespass, both because it appears that no harm was done to anyone and because when its new freshmen arrive for classes, their parents, younger siblings and high-school English teachers will want to -- will need to -- feel the trip was worth it. They, or someone they love and want the best for, may be dreaming of making it, too.

HEADLINE: A Main Artery of the 1800's 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KIRBY; DAVID KIRBY, who lives in Brooklyn, writes frequently for The Times.

 BODY:
NEVER did I imagine calling myself a canal nut, but that is what I became after researching and retracing the largely forgotten Delaware and Hudson Canal, an astounding feat of engineering performed in the 1820's to ferry coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River. Who knew that an old ditch could be so fascinating, and so beautiful?
 It turns out that thousands of inhabitants along the canal's route (and beyond) are equally enchanted by its story. I met many people who are passionately dedicated to preserving the memory of the canal, which closed in 1898 and now lies in ruins, and restoring the D & H to its place in American economic and social history. 
 The 160-mile journey from Carbondale, Pa., where anthracite coal was mined, to Kingston, N.Y., where it was loaded onto boats for New York City and elsewhere, is an odyssey into another America, when time was measured more in months than minutes, and when transportation technology was based largely on mules and gravity. 
I traveled on a cold weekend last April with my friend Jay, who lives in High Falls, N.Y., an important canal town about 20 miles northwest of Poughkeepsie. We made the trip in three days, driving about five hours a day on fine roads with endlessly scenic vistas. The journey is not just for history buffs. Many canal towns offer high-end dining, antiquing, shops and galleries with local artists. Between towns are hiking, biking, fishing, swimming, kayaking and birding. But it was the D & H we found the most beguiling.
Carbondale is the site of America's first underground anthracite mine, started not long after the end of the War of 1812 when "black diamonds" were mined here by two brothers from Philadelphia, William and Maurice Wurts. The war had ended with heavy restrictions on the export of British coal to America and, in 1824, the enterprising brothers brought anthracite to New York, where they heated a Wall Street coffeehouse with the newfangled fuel. Investors were so impressed, they bought out the million-dollar stock offer that day.
The company built an ingenious way to convey coal from mine to market. A "gravity railroad" was built to carry anthracite over Moosic Mountain and other ridges from Carbondale to Honesdale, Pa., where the canal began. Cars were hauled up a series of inclined planes by stationary steam engines at the head of each plane; they then were lowered down a series of planes on the other side of the mountain with an ingenious system of pulleys that brought the empty cars back up as the full ones glided into Honesdale.
In just three years, workers dug and blasted the 108-mile canal, lined it with clay, filled it with water to a depth of four feet, and built a berm, or towpath, for the pack mules to pull the barges along at one to three miles an hour. Engineers built 108 locks to lift and lower the barges.
Though the original source of the region's wealth, Carbondale today seems to be prospering the least. It's a somewhat sad, forgotten old company town with a bingo hall and thrift stores. Still, we loved its stoic beauty and faraway feel, its classical turn-of-the-century buildings and friendly residents.
Reminders of the D & H are displayed at the Carbondale Historical Society in City Hall, the remaining company office building (now a restaurant), and the forlorn monument in what's now called Gravity Park, on Route 6, where train cars got underway for Honesdale, 13 miles east.
Somehow, Honesdale escaped Carbondale's fate, and today is a vibrant town, its handsome Main Street lined with stately banks, antiques shops and homespun cafes. Old stone churches, some built on land donated by the D & H Company, grace the skyline. Even though the canal here was filled in long ago, Honesdale was its loading dock and served as an important link in the system, a badge it still wears proudly.
The Wayne County Historical Society is housed in an original D & H Company building in the center of town, near where coal was loaded onto barges. It includes a small, beautiful museum whose "Movin' Energy: The History of the D & H Canal" collection includes photos, maps, documents and other artifacts, a gravity railroad passenger car and a reproduction of the Stourbridge Lion, believed to be America's first commercial steam locomotive. Nearby, the Stourbridge Line, with old-fashioned cars, departs on excursions to surrounding attractions.
A 20-minute drive on Route 6 winds through deep woods and along the Lackawaxen River to Hawley, a lovely old canal hamlet. Antiques stores and architectural jewels, like the 1890 Presbyterian church, built in Queen Anne Stick style, abound. With 52 miles of shoreline, nearby Lake Wallenpaupack is the largest body of water in the Poconos and popular among anglers, boaters and campers.
Heading east on Route 590, we got our first glimpses of the D & H, with the canal on the left (partly filled in) and the river on the right. We realized we were actually driving on the old towpath.
A few miles on was Lock 31 and its canal house, a simple wooden two-story structure owned by the Rotary Club. Then the road forked and we followed the river on the right (at the "Woodlock Pines" sign). We stumbled upon rich remnants of the canal everywhere, including Kimbles, a canal stop now nearly deserted, and a cemetery with the graves of the Kimbles, the Rowlands and other families who operated the locks.
Lock 22 and its canal house are just down the road, and beyond, near Rowland, is Lock 19. Originally operated by the Rowland family, the locktender's cottage was purchased six years ago by Howard Leifman and Bill Voelkel, who are restoring the 1826 wood-and-stone house.
At Lackawaxen, five minutes farther by car, the canal met the Delaware River. In the 1800's the Delaware was slowed by a slack-water dam, allowing barges to be pulled across by rope. But timber-rafters on the river had to shoot rapids over the dam, and accidents were frequent. The canal company eventually hired Judge Thomas Ridgway to pay damage claims, and the stately Greek Revival house where he lived and worked is now the Roebling Inn on the Delaware, where we spent the night.
John Roebling, of Brooklyn Bridge fame, is the star architect of a major part of the D & H. When the canal was widened and upgraded in the 1840's, the company hired him to build aqueducts to traverse four different rivers, including the Delaware. (But the dam remained, as backup, and so did the accidents.)
Roebling's Delaware crossing, the country's oldest existing wire suspension bridge, was expertly restored by the National Park Service from 1985 to 1995, and includes a tiny but informative interpretive center in the tollhouse. The thought of coal barges crossing high above the river is astonishing.
The inn, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is run by Donald and JoAnn Jahn, who greet guests with warm smiles and expert local knowledge. Our comfortable room upstairs overlooked the river. Downstairs was a cozy parlor and dining nook, and outside, a sloping lawn to the pristine river, where beach chairs awaited summer.
We had dinner at Lackawaxen House, an old tavern and inn with stunning river views. The food was less than stunning, but not bad. Jay aptly labeled it "late 70's banquet hall cuisine."
Next morning, after a home-cooked breakfast at the Roebling Inn and a warm send-off, we crossed Roebling's bridge ( on the paved canal bed) to New York. The 21-mile drive south on Route 97, along the Delaware, is terrific, with many appealing stops for eating, fishing or canoeing, many with quirky names: Quicks Eddy, Pond Eddy, Sparrowbush.
Hawk's Nest is a spectacular stretch, reminiscent of the Rhine Valley, leading into historic Port Jervis, an important D & H town with rich canal heritage. The Minisink Valley Historical Society is housed here, adjacent to Fort Decker/St. John's Canal Hotel, a former tavern and trading post and now a fine little museum displaying artifacts from Colonial times through the canal era.
Much of the D & H in Port Jervis was filled in around 1900, after a drunken city elder supposedly toppled in and drowned. But accessible stretches of the canal bed and towpath remain, which the historical society is preserving as a public greenway.
Heading northeast on Route 209 to Cuddebackville, we stopped at the Neversink Valley Area Museum and D & H Canal Park. Roebling built another aqueduct here, across the Neversink River, and his stone abutments remain. The museum, which includes a full-size barge replica, was closed. But we walked the mile of fully restored towpath and water-filled canal, alone in the chill but entranced by the pastoral landscape.
The road north offers plenty of access to canal and towpaths, including the Basherkill wetlands and the Delaware and Hudson Canal Linear Park, a nearly completed 4.5-mile stretch of water and towpath, with wonderfully preserved locks and a drydock at Summitville. Other canal towns we visited included Wurtsboro (named for the brothers), Ellenville (whose library has a D & H collection) and Accord (formerly Port Jackson).
Arriving in High Falls, about 20 miles from Kingston, I checked into Locktender Cottage, a tiny, sagging but utterly appealing three-room, antique-filled B & B. It sits next to Lock 15 near another Roebling aqueduct ruin on Rondout Creek, its rusty ironworks visible in the stonework.
We dined at the 1797 Depuy Canal House, which owns the Locktender. The house is included in the National Register of Historic Places, and its interior is spectacular, with roaring fireplaces in every corner and Victorian cheer floating through the air. The service was warm, but the food, created by the owner and chef, John Novi, seemed a bit flashy and oddly overreaching for the setting. I had a lobster souffle appetizer with blue cheese and Pernod sauce ($16) and beef tenderloin ($37), which was good, but the $100-a-person tab (with wine, tax and tip) seemed excessive.
A delicious breakfast, at Chefs on Fire, a bistro in the Canal House's charming cellar, came with the room. We walked it off exploring Five Locks Walk. The locks here are deep and straight, their stonework mortarless and perfectly plumb, like Incan temples. There were several granite stumping posts, to which barges were once tied, and we traced our fingers along the polished rope burns left in the stone.
That afternoon we visited the splendid D & H Canal Historical Society and Museum in High Falls, with its working models of a lock and a gravity railroad, excellent photos and paintings, and canal artifacts.
Finally, we traced the remaining miles of canal. At charming Rosendale, we took Creek Locks Road, past more towpath and locks, until we hit Lock 1, in Eddyville. A tidal lock, it opened onto Rondout Creek, where barges completed the journey to Kingston, on the Hudson, with its still-vibrant waterfront and maritime museum.
Lock 1 marked the end of the canal, which closed when railroads rendered the mule barges obsolete. The lock stands as a final glorious ruin, a sentinel of a long-past marvel whose memory and remains so many still try to preserve.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
At Play With Weirdly Morphing Images and Sounds

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

 BODY:
IN 1967 there appeared a 45-minute film called "Wavelength." It instantly made its director, Michael Snow, one of the most famous avant-garde filmmakers in the world. The archetype of cinematic Minimalism, the film was dominated by a continuous zoom shot that originated at the rear of a loft and closed in on a small photograph of waves placed between the loft's windows (a photo taken by Mr. Snow of the East River in Manhattan).
 At the time, Mr. Snow, who is from Toronto, had been living in New York for five years and had become an integral part of the downtown Minimalist scene; his peers included Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Richard Serra, Jonas Mekas and Donald Judd. 
 But by 1973, Mr. Snow had moved back to Toronto for good. Now 72, he has hardly disappeared. Always a multifaceted artist, one who approached film as a latecomer from the visual arts, he has continued to make art installations and photos and films, all with an ingenious, witty, often moving conceptual underpinning, and to play and record music -- and to see his work shown and heard in museums, film festivals and jazz and new-music clubs all over the world. (This year alone there have been three different shows and festivals of his work in Berlin).
But the films became increasingly infrequent, in part reflecting their swelling ambitions and, hence, budgets. Now he's back. His new film, "*Corpus Callosum," will open at the Film Forum on Wednesday in its United States premiere. He's been working on it -- not exclusively, but persistently -- for 21 years, and it ends with three minutes of never-before-seen animation that he did in 1956.
The title, in the words of Mr. Snow's program notes, refers to "a central region of tissue in the human brain which passes 'messages' between the two hemispheres." (Is it a trend that vanguard filmmakers title their works after obscure parts of the human body? Consider Matthew Barney's "Cremaster" series.) Mr. Snow's title refers to his interest in linking abstract image and sound, an effort common to all his films.
The film is 92 minutes long and has two principal settings, which alternate: an anonymous modern-day office and a surreal living room, in which a boy (Mr. Snow's son Aleck, then 12) sits watching television as his parents come and go, and objects clustered on the far wall are removed or rehung manually (by production assistants directed audibly by Mr. Snow from off camera) or digitally. Sometimes they explode.
With all due deference to hemispheric connectivity, the real subject of "*Corpus Callosum" is transformation, or metamorphosis. Not through narrative; Mr. Snow has always forsworn that. The transformations come most strikingly through digital effects: bodies or whole scenes twisted and stretched and squeezed and then returned to "normal." But there are all sorts of other playful transformations. Ten different couples appear and reappear and recombine as the same central pair, the parents of the boy: transformation through costume and substitution. A giant erection (animated). A pregnant woman (real). A photo of a muscle-woman on the living-room wall. The ever-shifting sounds of the film: electronic tones alternating with the everyday busywork of Mr. Snow's instructions to his actors and assistants.
Parts of the film have been seen over the last couple of years, especially in an extract called "The Living Room," and the whole thing received its world premiere at the vanguard Rotterdam International Film Festival earlier this year. Because of its cryptic allusions to his past works, early critical reaction has stressed its autobiographical nature. J. Hoberman, in The Village Voice, called it "continuously self-referential" and "almost a self-curated retrospective of Snow's career." Peter Kubelka, writing online, suggested that it was "a video catalogue raisonne of his greatest hits."
Speaking from a pay phone at the Stephenville airport in Newfoundland, a goodly drive from the summer cabin he shares with his wife, Peggy Gale, a curator, and their son, now 19, Mr. Snow innocently denied any self-referential intent.
"I only do stuff to make the film," he insisted. "Everything is calculated for its use in the film."
In his notes, Mr. Snow refers to the film, with some self-parodistic wit, as a "tragi-comedy of the cinematic variables." By that he presumably means a film that blends structural rigor with comic playfulness. In recalling "Wavelength," one should note that it wasn't just a continuous zoom, although that sticks in the mind; and it wasn't just a beautiful piece of conceptual art: a film shot in a raw urban setting ending with peaceful nature. All kinds of implied melodrama flitted through the film, hinting at a murder. (The "actors" were the critics Hollis Frampton and Amy Taubin.) All kinds of bizarre things happen in "*Corpus Callosum," too, front and center, but they are presented with a glacial impassivity that highlights or undercuts the humor, depending on your point of view.
"In all my films I've tried to concentrate on a specific possibility of the medium," Mr. Snow said. "Zoom, spherical movement of the camera, different links between image and sound." In "*Corpus Callosum," besides the acted and digitalized transformations, there is a continuous tracking shot through the office, with the same or different characters appearing and reappearing and being subjected to the peculiar distortions Mr. Snow visits upon them.
Mr. Snow said that he has always managed to support himself with his art, a source of considerable satisfaction to him. "I've been able to continue a number of different lines in my work, and I take them all seriously," he said. "I prefer not to teach or lecture, although occasionally I do."
One of his steady activities is his Toronto-based trio, CCMC -- the name means different things at different times, he said -- which played the Manhattan club Tonic in February. "It's totally free improvisation," he said, "but it's definitely our music: we build on what we've done before." "*Corpus Callosum," he added, "is totally scripted."
Despite his economic self-sufficiency, Mr. Snow had trouble getting "*Corpus Callosum" made, which is one reason the principal shooting didn't take place until 1997 and the film was only completed late last year. Part of the problem was the cost of digital animation, even though that cost has come down considerably since he first started thinking about such techniques in 1981.
"I kept running out of money," he said. "We used computer-graphics students and recent graduates, but there's a very active computer-graphics scene in Toronto, and people kept quitting to go to better-paying jobs and then we'd have to figure out what they'd been doing and sometimes have to start from scratch."
The result is a sometimes rough-looking film, one that doesn't really stand comparison with the slickness of up-to-the-minute Hollywood special effects. Mr. Snow is a little defensive about that.
"There were a lot of ideas I had before they could actually be done," he said. "I suppose that doesn't affect how you see the film, but it's a matter of personal pride for me."

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
Learning the Moves of Harlem, Circa 1930

BYLINE:  By BARRY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE lore of the rent party looms large in the legend of Harlem. Appropriately, it takes over the spotlight at one point in "Harlem Song," the musical revue at the Apollo Theater that traces the history of the neighborhood. 
 Depression-era Harlemites pushed back the furniture and made their rent money by inviting the neighborhood in to eat, drink and dance, for a price. "But rent parties also had a social purpose," said George C. Wolfe, who wrote and directed the show, which opened earlier this month. "They were not merely economic occasions. Rent parties gave that great wave of migration from the South then pouring into Harlem a chance to Harlemize." 
 It is this acclimatizing function (and "Saturday night functions" are how Harlem residents referred to rent parties) that Mr. Wolfe has captured in "Miss Linda Brown," a jiving song and dance number ingeniously choreographed by Ken Roberson as a virtual catalog of Lindy steps and other swing dance specialties. In his review in The New York Times, in which he described "Harlem Song" as "an adrenaline-laced valentine to a neighborhood," Ben Brantley called the number "the show's emotional center and most memorable moment."
The performers who ignite it -- DanaShavonne Rainey, 23, and Gabriel A. Croom, 26 -- acknowledge that the era is new to them. "There's so much about Harlem history I didn't know," Mr. Croom confessed over coffee recently in the company of Ms. Rainey, who nodded in agreement. 
Ms. Rainey added: "We've been challenged to try and be authentic. I couldn't be Dana circa 2002. So I started studying pictures and films. What were people's postures like? How did they move?"
The music for their scene, an eccentric rural blues from the 1930's by Alvis Cowens, was unearthed by Mr. Wolfe in the vaults of Sony Records. "That song really helped us feel the characters," Mr. Croom said. 
For Mr. Croom, who was born in Buffalo and has a bachelor's degree in musical theater from the State University of New York at Fredonia, this is not an entirely new experience. "I had done some swing dancing in other shows," he said, "and I've gone to the Manhattan dance club Swing 46 on occasion, to Lindy."
For Ms. Rainey, who arrived in New York 10 months ago, following some time in Europe but still fresh from her hometown of Cincinnati, the Lindy was entirely new. "It was really humbling," she said. "I felt like a little kid learning how to walk."
Ms. Rainey, who graduated from Hollins University in Roanoke, Va., with a bachelor's degree in dance, is one of only two cast members (out of 14) in "Harlem Song" who survived an open call to get the job. "I got to New York in October," she said, "and auditioned for the show in April. I saw the ad in Back Stage and thought, 'Why not?' I'd been to the Apollo once a long time ago, but I got kind of emotional this time walking on that stage -- 800 dancers and li'l ole me."
To hear Mr. Wolfe describe it, choosing Ms. Rainey was almost elemental. "I remember turning to Whoopi Goldberg" -- one of the producers of "Harlem Song" -- "and saying: 'See that girl dance? That's probably what Josephine Baker danced like. Can't move a finger without her whole body moving too. Complete abandon.' That's what I was after."
Ms. Rainey's dance with Mr. Croom wound up the hoofing equivalent of a jazz cutting contest, that ageless African-American ritual of can-you-top-this competitiveness updated by Mr. Wolfe and Savion Glover in their Broadway show "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk." The cutting contest in "Harlem Song," though, had to be of its time.
"I'm the Geechee Gal and Gabe's the Bama Boy," Ms. Rainey explained, "fresh off the train and very country, I mean, real rubes, at this rent party. And all he wants to do is to get me dancing."
Mr. Croom laughed. "Which I do."
To Mr. Wolfe, their interaction has a revealing duality. "They pretend a sophistication, the surface of which they've learned, but they really don't possess," he said. "Harlem is in their language and dress but their Southernness is in their bodies. When they dance, who they really are comes out. The steps tell their story."
The sequence seems invented on the spot. Of course, it is anything but. "The coupling is very structured because of all the close partnering," Mr. Croom said. "When we're dancing around each other, though, it's pretty wide open. There's room for us to bring stuff in -- within the realm of reason."
Ms. Rainey offered an example. "I saw this old movie and there was this woman dancer in it, I don't know her name, but at one point she did something I thought was so wonderful -- this move where she kicked her leg way up, to the side, froze in midair and just sort of wiped her foot off: 'Awww! Awww!' And I thought, 'Yeah, I've got to take that and use it.' "
Mr. Croom smiled. "She surprised me with that leg thing. And it boosted my energy level. I thought: 'Oh, yeah?' "
Ms. Rainey smiled too. "He's also surprised me. There are certain moments when I say to myself: 'I see. You bein' for real!' And it does give you that edge. 'All right,' you think. 'I'll outdo you!' "

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
Theater's Memory Bank Expands

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN MANDELL; Jonathan Mandell, a former theater critic, is the editor of GothamGazette.com, a Web site about New York City.

 BODY:
DO not ask Philip S. Birsh, president and publisher of Playbill magazine, about "Kiss Me, Kate" or Swoosie Kurtz or Tony Kushner; he is more comfortable talking about his three Komori color printing presses. Mr. Birsh does not go to the theater that much.
 "I don't have time," he said recently as he walked through the Playbill printing plant in Woodside, Queens, overseeing another daily press run of about 60,000 Playbills, soon to increase to 80,000. "I'd like to see shows, but I have three children, and a company to run." 
 Some theatergoers and performers treat their Playbills as sacred objects, year after year collecting the only proof that they attended (or were involved in) a work of theater, something that by its nature cannot be saved or held. One Playbill staff member has been collecting copies of the magazine since 1937. But you need not have a job at Playbill to cherish the theater programs that have been distributed free in New York's legitimate theaters for the last 118 years. 
To the publisher, though, Playbill is a business -- "We're printers" -- and it has been a good one. In the eight years since he took over the company from his father, Arthur T. Birsh (who remains the chairman), the younger Mr. Birsh said, the magazine's circulation has increased some 350 percent, to 3.7 million copies a month.
In June, Playbill was given another opportunity to grow. Stagebill Media, Playbill's only national rival, announced that it was selling Stagebill magazine's publishing rights to Playbill. The program was, in effect, folding, after almost eight decades of publication.
The news alarmed representatives of performing arts centers around the country, 81 of which were clients of Stagebill or of Performing Arts magazine, a program that Stagebill Media had bought in 2001. Although Playbill has added a few new clients, many of the centers are scrambling to find a substitute means of obtaining programs. And the change has raised some questions: How will the end of Stagebill, and lack of competition, affect Playbill?
The program with the familiar yellow band across the top began in 1884, when an advertising man from Ohio named Frank Strauss came up with the idea of turning what for decades had been a simple handbill into a magazine that could serve as an advertising vehicle. Then as now, the company paid the theaters for the right to distribute its programs free to theatergoers, and made its money from the advertising.
Stagebill was started in the 1920's in Chicago. "New Yorkers don't realize that Stagebill dominated many markets outside New York, whether you go to Laguna Hills, Calif., or Dallas or Houston or Chicago," said Fred Tarter, who bought Stagebill from Primedia in 1998 and then ended his involvement two years later.
What Playbill purchased from Stagebill, Mr. Birsh said, was only its name, not the magazine, nor the contracts with its clients. So far it has picked up little more than a dozen of the theaters, auditoriums and concert halls that used Stagebill.
One of those not picked up is the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "We're still in the process of figuring out what we are going to do," said Jeff Levine, the academy's vice president of marketing and communications. "People will be showing up at BAM on Oct. 1, and they need to have a program in their hands."
Like many of the others, they are considering publishing their own programs, as they did until 1999. "Theater programs are very expensive," Mr. Levine said. "But they are also important. Our audiences are not one-time visitors. The program is the key tool to building up an ongoing dialogue with them." 
Mr. Birsh said his company will need time to decide who else it will pick up. "I'm sorry we can't afford to supply everybody," he said. 
The task of getting each Playbill into the hands of theatergoers every day is daunting, he explained, though it is worth it: the magazine has an automatic and affluent readership, attractive to advertisers.
Playbill is in effect simultaneously a daily, a weekly and a monthly. It must be printed and delivered six days a week, because the theaters in New York have no room to store it. In each issue, the middle pages, usually numbering 12, are devoted to a specific show, offering a list of scenes, a cast who's who and other information on the production. These pages (printed in Woodside along with the program's cover) are determined by the producer and, under a contract between the theater owners and Actors' Equity, must be printed anew every week to accommodate cast and other changes. The rest of the magazine (printed by outside contractors) is a monthly, and the articles in it are the same from one theater's Playbill to the next.
Publishing Playbill became more complicated when the Birshes expanded the program outside New York; for the first time, the magazine is being distributed in different editions to various cities, accounting for much of its increase in circulation. (It uses six printers throughout the country.) Several years ago, Playbill also created a classical arts division, which provides programs for performing arts centers like the Houston Grand Opera and Carnegie Hall.
The company has expanded in other ways as well: Playbill Online, a theater news service and discount club on the Internet (www.playbill .com); Playbill Broadcasting, a program on subscription satellite radio (a medium similar to cable television, though much newer); Playbill Books; and Playbill greeting cards and wrapping paper.
Before taking charge of Playbill, Mr. Birsh, 44, spent 12 years on Wall Street, in mergers and acquisitions. "It was soulless," he said. "What I like about working for Playbill is that we're in a community."
But he did learn a few things that have come in handy. "Acquisitions are a better source of growth than internal growth," he said. "Slowly, we've picked up a lot of publishing interests."
However this expansion works as a business strategy, it has left questions about its effect on the arts. "It was a very good thing for arts organizations that there was a competition between Stagebill and Playbill," said Carol Evans, a former editor in chief of Stagebill. Will the end of competition cause Playbill to act like a monopoly? 
"There is no monopoly in publishing," said Mr. Birsh, who noted that he has no plans to start charging theatergoers for the program. "Monopoly is not a good term anyway," he continued. "It implies abuse. I don't think there is a single incident in which we've acted in an abusive manner. We've basically survived; we're proudest of having remained profitable during these difficult economic times." Playbill is a private company, and Mr. Birsh declined to release figures about its revenues or profits. "We didn't put Stagebill out of business," Mr. Birsh said. "Their business practices put them out of business."
Martin Walker, head of Walker Communications, a magazine publishing consultant, agreed. "Stagebill closed because of inept management," said Mr. Walker, who had Stagebill as a client a decade ago during a previous ownership.
Scott Marshall, chief operating officer of Stagebill Media, would not comment, and Gerry Byrne, the chief executive officer, did not return several phone calls.
According to John Istel, the editor in chief of Stagebill until last December, there were five publishers in six years, a move to expensive new offices and a wrongheaded reorganizing of the sales staff. Yet Mr. Istel also said, "Once Playbill started bidding for the same accounts, it obviously drove the cost up."
Several years ago, when it inaugurated its classical arts division, hiring away Stagebill's senior editor, Cliff Tinder, to do so, Playbill began luring Stagebill clients like the Metropolitan Opera, Houston Grand Opera and Carnegie Hall to switch. "It became more and more expensive to compete," Mr. Istel said.
At the same time, some say, the editorial quality of Stagebill remained superior. "I think the performing arts patrons will miss Stagebill," said Mr. Tarter, the former owner. "Stagebill provided some extraordinary writers with a platform to do much more in-depth, long-form articles that were relevant to the performance. Playbill does sound-bite media, bits and pieces; their articles tend to be shorter." 
Whatever the relative merits of the writing, Mr. Levine of BAM said, "The real value that Stagebill brought to the performing arts was the customization." Each performing organization received a program designed specifically for it. "Every word in that program was about BAM, the current show or upcoming shows," Mr. Levine said. By contrast, except for the 12 center pages, Playbill's contents in New York City are the same. 
Will Playbill change its ways? 
"The New York City program will remain as it has for the past gazillion years," Mr. Birsh said. The Roundabout Theater Company and the Joseph Papp Public Theater, former Stagebill clients, for example, will now be distributing the standard Playbills that are offered in more than 70 theaters in New York, both on Broadway and off. (Playbill provides a variation, called Showbill, to the New Amsterdam Theater because the theater's owners, Disney, do not want a program with cigarette and liquor advertising, Mr. Birsh said.) Playbill began providing customized programs for performing arts centers several years ago, and, starting in the fall, it will produce individualized programs for a total of 16 of its clients, half of them new.
Mr. Birsh has heard the criticism dismissing the editorial contents of Playbill as mostly hype or pablum, without depth or context, pale cousin both to Stagebill and to theater programs in London. "Every so often, a member of the theater police criticizes us mightily," Mr. Birsh said. "We might not do the best job possible, but we do the best job we can."
He is unapologetic about his publication's promotional tone. "Playbill does not run negative articles about the theater," he said. "There are enough people hectoring theater. It's not fair for a producer to have to use a Playbill in his theater that has an article that is negative toward his production."
The publisher said he felt a responsibility to carry on a tradition of a program that has changed ownership only five times in 118 years. In 1974, Metromedia, a corporation better known for its television stations, was not happy with its investment in the then-ailing theater program, and was happy to sell it to its fifth owner, Arthur Birsh. Mr. Birsh, who had joined Playbill in 1961 and later oversaw it as a senior vice president at Metromedia, left Metromedia to run the magazine. 
"It's the best place to work," said Playbill's senior editor, Louis Botto, 78, the staff member who has been collecting the magazine since 1937, although he wasn't hired until 1978. 
"When I was 65," Mr. Botto said, "Arthur Birsh said: 'Remember, there's no retirement at Playbill. We expect you to die at your desk.' I said, 'I would prefer to die at an opening night.' He said: 'Please don't make it a Shubert opening. They wouldn't like that.' "

HEADLINE: A Night at the Movies, Fresh Air Included 

BYLINE:  By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
MOVIE multiplexes have popped up everywhere and yet there are still those people who would rather pack a blanket, a couple of lawn chairs, and maybe a picnic, and head to one of the three remaining drive-in theaters in the state.
 In 1967, there were 42 drive-ins in Connecticut, according to statistics kept by the United Drive-In Theater Owners Association in Germantown, Md. But owners of the three remaining theaters say that business is thriving and that on Saturday nights they frequently have to turn people away. 
 On a recent night, despite stormy weather, car after car pulled into the Southington Drive-In. There were families with carloads of children there for "Stuart Little II," and at the second screen, teenagers, college students and adults of all ages settled in for two new releases. 
Southington can accommodate 1,000 cars at its two screens. Admission is $7 and $4 for those 10 and under.
At the Pleasant Valley Drive-In, with one screen and room for 250 cars, more families came for an evening of family films. There, admission is $6; $4 for children ages 6-11 and free for children under 5.
The Mansfield Drive-In, with three screens and a capacity for 900 cars, is especially busy on Wednesdays, which is family night. Admission is $7 and $4 for children under 12.
The environment is a little different at each location.
Pleasant Valley is in a rural spot on Route 181 off Route 44, in between New Hartford and Winsted. The Southington Drive-In is just down the Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike from a giant indoor theater, and the Mansfield Drive-In, situated on 40 wooded acres, is also home to the Mansfield Marketplace, a large indoor and outdoor flea market.
The drive-ins are frequented by fans who quickly become nostalgic as they talk about the old days of the drive-in movies and the good reasons for keeping them around today.
At Southington, Ariana Eaton of Bethany said she loved to take her daughter Tanner Eaton-Carberry to the drive-in. "I used to bring her here as a baby," Ms. Eaton said. "I love being outside in the summer."
Donna McGrane of Winsted, who owns the Pleasant Valley Drive-In, said she bought the business seven years ago because she had grown up there. "My mom worked here when I was little and I just used to spend my weekends here," Ms. McGrane said as she sold tickets from a tiny clapboard ticket booth. 
"We're the smallest drive-in ever built," Ms. McGrane added. "But it is absolutely viable as a business. The overhead is less and the work is less. I keep everything small, and the ticket prices as low as I can." 
Pleasant Valley is much the way it was when it was built in 1947. The projectors are old reel-to-reel Navy surplus. The concession stand and ticket booth are original. The only modernization is the lack of speakers on poles. Customers tune in to the movie, usually a second-run film, on their AM radios.
"People come from all over," Ms. McGrane said. "One man who comes from Hawaii for a month every summer always comes here. People like to bring their kids here because it's small, not blacktop, and it's just like they remember it. Everything's original here."
The Southington Drive-In gets a lot of repeat customers as well, according to the owner, Sperie Perakos of Orange. "A lot of people came as kids and they want their kids to have the same experience," he said. "It's also very economical entertainment and a wonderful opportunity to have some family time.
"One couple comes every weekend from Long Island, and another couple comes from New Jersey every time we change the movie."
Others travel from Vermont or Massachusetts on a regular basis.
Tracy Cegelka of Southington and her friend, Joe Rosas of Naugatuck, both of whom begin college this fall, said they returned to the Southington Drive-In every few weeks during the summer. "It's more comfortable than being in a theater," Ms. Cegelka said, "and we like to be outside. It's also cheaper than the movies."
Leslie Horner of Southington, a graduate student who works in the Southington ticket booth, said she loves it at the drive-in. This is her fourth summer on staff and the drive-in, she said, is where she spends her summer.
"There were 42 drive-ins in Connecticut and over 4,000 in the country at one time," said Mr. Perakos, chairman of the board and a former president of the Connecticut Association of Theater Owners. "The peak was in the 1950's and 1960's, with the numbers tapering off in the 1970's. The total number went down to 800 and is now back up to 1,000."
Not only have some drive-ins re-opened in the 1990's, there have been new ones built in other states. Many drive-ins, like the one in Mansfield, added extra screens.
For Mr. Perakos, tracking the growth trend is important. Southington Drive-In is a family business, opened in 1954 by his father, and now owned by himself and his brothers, John and Peter Perakos Jr.
The senior Mr. Perakos once had the largest drive-in theater circuit in Connecticut, mostly single screens, with four in New Britain. He also owned one of the first Nickelodeon theaters, opened in New Britain in 1906.
Mr. Perakos and his wife, Nikki, said they were hooked on the business. "Sperie's family has been in this business a long time," Ms. Perakos said. "It's hard to give it up even if you could do better somewhere else. We are real night people and love the business."
Mr. Perakos added: "The old motion picture managers lived for their work. There was a dedication, a camaraderie that existed."
"If it's in your blood, it sets you apart from other civilians," Ms. Perakos said.
Southington's manager, James DuBois, has been in the business for 32 years.
He supervises a part-time staff of 25 to 30 people, including those in the ticket booth, concession stand workers, and what are known as ramp boys, the workers who make sure every car is parked just right so passengers can view the screen but do not block anyone else's view. 
"Drive-in fans are just like Nascar fans," Mr. DuBois said. "We have die-hards and they get mad if we don't change the movies often enough."
All three drive-ins have full concessions, plus certain specialties like funnel cakes at Pleasant Valley and deli pickles and steak sandwiches at Southington, or "everything for dinner," said Michael Jungden, owner of the Mansfield Drive-In and Marketplace.
Mansfield has a playground for children. This drive-in also has speakers on poles, the old-fashioned way for nostalgia's sake, Mr. Jungden said. Customers can tune in on their car's FM radios or use the outside speakers. 
The Connecticut drive-ins try to show family films, rated G or PG. Pleasant Valley stays exclusively with family fare. "I try to always have something for families," Mr. Jungden said. "That's the bread-and-butter part of the crowd."
A night out at the drive-in can mean a bit of adventure for everyone. Because movies start at dusk, it is usually a late night, and then there are the variables of the weather.
"I remember when 'Psycho' came out," Mr. Perakos said. "We filled up the whole place, served lots of coffee, and kept the drive-in open and filled it up all over again when the first showing was done."
In the old days, he added, they had dusk to dawn showings of five movies.
At a Pleasant Valley showing of "Godzilla," lightning struck the junction box, leaving everyone in the dark. All but a few patrons gladly accepted vouchers to return and see the film another night, Ms. McGrane said. 
"We've really kept everything the way it was," she said. "This is why people like to come here. It's a little bit of nostalgia for them."

Cablevision Plans to Close 26 of Its 43 Wiz Stores
 The Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE: CVC) plans to close 26 of 43 branches of the Wiz, its consumer electronics chain, as part of its restructuring. On Long Island, six of eight stores will be closed: those in Bay Shore, Bohemia, Huntington, Lake Grove, Massapequa and Plainview. The stores in Carle Place and Valley Stream will remain open. 
 Industry analysts have cited the Wiz subsidiary as a drain on Cablevision's profitability. Cablevision, which is based in Bethpage, would not say how many jobs would be affected by the closings.

Losses Widen at Allied
The Allied Devices Corporation (Nasdaq: ALDV) of Hicksville has posted a loss of $1.2 million for its fiscal third quarter, after sales dropped to $4.9 million. Last year, the company reported a loss of $519,000 for the same quarter on sales of $5.9 million.
Mark Hopkinson, the company's chairman, said the company did not expect an improvement in sales and earnings before 2003. "The economy is fragile, and erratic booking patterns have prompted us to be cautious," he said. Allied Devices develops automation and robotic equipment.

No Fallout, Kimco Says
The Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) of New Hyde Park says that it does not believe the liquidation of Ames Department Stores will affect its earnings either this year or next.
Kimco, which owns and operates shopping centers throughout the United States and Canada, leases eight stores to Ames with a total of nearly 640,000 square feet. It is also a co-owner of a 101,749-square-foot store leased to Ames.

Global's Net Income Drops
Global Payment Technologies (Nasdaq: GPTX) of Hauppauge, a manufacturer of coin-operated mechanisms used in gambling and vending machines, has reported that pro forma net income for the fiscal third quarter dropped to $77,000, down from $181,000 during the same quarter last year. Net sales dropped to $6.5 million, down from $8.6 million in the same quarter last year.
Thomas McNeill, the company's chief financial officer, cited the soft economy as the cause of falling sales. Compiled by Warren Strugatch

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Long Island; 
Hotels Sprout, Drawn by Mix of Potential Guests

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
WITH its stately pillars and curved driveway edged with white gas lamps, the 186,000-square-foot Inn at East Wind is a majestic sight along the rural tree-lined Route 25A in Wading River on the North Shore. 
 The 42-room hotel, which will have a 21,000-square-foot ballroom, is to open this fall at a time when some areas of Long Island have more hotel rooms than they can handle and others do not have enough. 
 Five of the eight new hotels that have opened since 1999 in Long Island excluding the East End opened this year, and more are under construction, according to Robert Lipper, president of Island-Metro Publications, which publishes the Long Island Lodging Guide quarterly and tracks the hotel industry on the Island.
The surge of new hotels, adding 722 rooms since January, helps to explain a drop in the occupancy rate to 68 percent in the first six months of this year from 72 percent a year earlier, Mr. Lipper said. 
"Most of the developers had made their plans two years ago when the market was good," he said. "Over two dozen more properties have been proposed, probably on the assumption that the economy will be on an upward trend."
Developers are optimistic because the Long Island hotel market has a "seven-day week, serving corporate travelers from Monday to Thursday, and on weekends, those attending social functions and tourist attractions," said Paul Fitzpatrick, senior managing director of Insignia/ESG Hotel Partners New York. It recently arranged the financing for a Hilton Garden Inn in Bohemia near MacArthur Airport.
Construction began in May on the 165-room $19.5 million hotel, which is being developed by Linchris Hotel Partners of Long Island, based in Hanover, Mass.
While the market appears to be saturated, there are still "underserved areas that can get away with new construction," Mr. Lipper said. "The town of Babylon has been desperately seeking a hotel for over a decade," he said, "and on the East End, Greenport, with its tourism, is an energy market and will have more demand." 
Of the five hotels that opened this year, two are in the town of Brookhaven. Because of an abundance of applications, the town, which has 26 lodgings and more in the planning stages, created a new zoning district classification last month to manage growth. Previously, lodging facilities were permitted on any property zoned for light industry. The new classification, which requires a hotel developer to get Town Board approval, includes restrictions like a minimum lot size of five acres and a maximum building height of 50 feet. 
"We don't want to control the market -- we're looking at it from a land-use perspective," said John Jay LaValle, Brookhaven's supervisor. "There are hundreds of acres of undeveloped land on our map zoned for light industry. We need it to attract jobs, not hotel development." 
In other areas, hotel projects are continuing. The Hauppauge-based Long Island Hotels expects to begin construction this year on a $20 million complex in Central Islip with a 170-room hotel and three restaurants. Melville Hospitality has proposed a 178-room Hilton Garden Inn and a 147-suite Homewood Suites next to each other in Melville, Mr. Fitzpatrick says. In Nassau, construction on a 120-room Hilton Garden Inn is about to begin in Westbury by the Briad Group of Florham Park, N.J.
To get customers, "most new hotels are taking them away from other hotels by their newness, with special opening rates and services," Mr. Lipper said.
The Inn at East Wind, owned by Kenn Barra of Wading River, has its own draw: a longstanding catering reputation and proximity to vineyards. The hotel is on 11 acres next to Mr. Barra's two existing catering halls, said to John Fields, the general manager. "The key attraction is the location, and our reputation as a caterer precedes us," he said. "We saw the need for hotel rooms for weddings and an upscale conference center on the East End." 
The catering company now serves at 16 weddings on a weekend, and "there has been a demand from corporations out west in Nassau looking to come for a country getaway," he said. 
The $15 million hotel is being built in several phases, beginning with the guest rooms, which will open this fall. The published prices for rooms will be $298 to $579 a night. Suites include Jacuzzis, and all rooms will have free high-speed Internet access. 
Construction has begun on the ballroom and a 100-seat pub with a lounge for entertainment, and they are expected to open in November. A full-service spa, four meeting rooms, two boardrooms, a restaurant and an indoor pool are scheduled for an opening in the spring of 2003.
"Even though the building is massive, we've tried to give it a quaint country inn atmosphere with the decor," which includes wood paneling and antique furnishings, Mr. Fields said. 
Site plans have been approved for a second hotel -- "but not as elaborate as East Wind country inn" -- about a mile west, he said. The proposed 50-room hotel will include a restaurant, tennis courts and an outdoor pool. 
Farther east, the village of Greenport, which has a historic main street and waterfront that attracts more than 500,000 tourists a year, needs more lodgings, said Audrey Wigley, director of the North Fork Promotion Council. The village has 150 hotel and motel rooms and 26 bed-and-breakfast rooms. "Every weekend during the summer we get numerous calls requesting lodging, and there is none," Ms. Wigley said. 
Construction is expected to begin in October on the 35-room Harborfront Inn, which will be the first newly built hotel in Greenport in 40 years. It is being built by KACE Development of Cutchogue and has been undergoing planning and zoning board reviews for the last eight months. 
According to the mayor, David Kapell, the "threshold issues have been resolved, including the controlling issue, which was the height." That has been cut to 35 feet from 47. KACE has volunteered to work with the village's historic review commission on the design of the hotel, he said.
Michael Kontokosta, who owns KACE with his brother, Dino, said rooms at the three-story hotel would range in area from 370 square feet to 900. Prices will average $185 a night. 
The hotel will be next to a newly built 3.5-acre waterfront park with a carousel and boardwalk. The park is on the site of the former Mitchell's Restaurant and Marina, which burned down more than 20 years ago. Its maintenance will be financed through a trust fund "in excess of $1 million" willed by Pauline Mitchell, according to Mr. Kapell.
The park is crucial to KACE's plans for the $3.5 million Harborfront Inn, Mr. Kontokosta said. "The location is perfect; we are capitalizing on the revitalization of Greenport, Mitchell Park and the waterfront's proposed 64-slip marina."
About 60 miles southwest in Babylon, there is an "obvious need for hotels," said Wayne Horsley, a town councilman. There are "some motels but no quality hotels in the town that would facilitate the business community or wedding guests," he said. 
He noted that on the Route 110 industrial corridor in Babylon and Huntington, Huntington has many hotels, "but the Babylon industry is underserviced." 
A commercial overlay district was created in Babylon three years ago that would increase the height limit for a hotel or office building in the 110 corridor to 55 feet from 35. Since then, a plan for one or two hotels at the state-owned Republic Airport, which is on Route 110, is being proposed by the Albany-based Republic Hospitality. 
"We're very excited," Mr. Horsley said. "This is our No. 1 economic issue."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Marketing Huntington to an Ever-Wider World

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
DENNIS SNEDEN works the phone, juggling calls from local merchants concerned with zoning issues and traffic problems on Main Street, while a caterer waits on hold to discuss plans for a fall festival in October.
 "Pretty much your typical local chamber stuff," said Mr. Sneden, 49, the chief executive of the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce. But lately, more of the calls are originating from outside Huntington -- from Nassau County and Albany, and from as far away as China -- as Mr. Sneden moves forward in his quest to expand the chamber's reach well past the borders of the town to encompass all of Long Island. 
 Since taking over the top staff position at the chamber in March 1998, Mr. Sneden, a former real estate salesman with close ties to the town's Republican administration, has more than quadrupled the organization's membership, to 1,300. And he has done it despite a fire that left the chamber homeless in March 2001. 
By successfully marketing memberships throughout Nassau and Suffolk, by starting what Mr. Sneden calls "my China initiative," an ambitious and attention-getting plan to open a branch office in China intended to help members do business there, and by holding an economic conference attended by Governor Pataki, Mr. Sneden has extended the chamber's reach. 
"Dennis has a lot of chutzpah," said Ron Lazar, one of three vice chairmen of the chamber and the senior managing director at Schacker Realty in Melville.
The chamber has a staff of 13 and a yearly budget of about $530,000, most of it raised by membership fees, events and sponsorships. On Sept. 9, it plans to move from its temporary offices in downtown Huntington to a $640,000, 4,600-square-foot, three-story converted house on Main Street it bought earlier this month. When it does, it will start afresh with a new name, the Chamber of Commerce: Regional Business Partnership. The group's original name will be in small print, with the words "Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce" around the perimeter of the logo. 
Mr. Sneden (pronounced SNEE-den) said the chamber had not abandoned the interests of the small local companies that make up its traditional membership base. "We're still focused on our members, only now our members are increasingly coming from other parts of the county, from Nassau, and even New York City," Mr. Sneden said. About 75 percent of the membership comes from Suffolk, 20 percent from Nassau and 5 percent from New York City.
The chamber's rapid growth, its new emphasis on economic development and its assertion of a regional identity make it a rival to the Long Island Association, which like the Huntington chamber is also 76 years old this year.
"I am not concerned about competing with the L.I.A.," Mr. Sneden said. "The mission of our group is to support the day-to-day business activities of our members. I see the L.I.A. as more involved more with lobbying and shaping legislation."
Nevertheless, developments have lately moved the chamber away from its traditional roots. In June, the board selected William Davidson, the director of government affairs for the Long Island Power Authority, as its new chairman, who will serve a two-year term. Among the new directors installed was Carol MacKenzie, a Suffolk County District Court judge. Earlier this year, Mr. Sneden hired Frank Gargano, whose uncle is Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, to forge stronger ties with the governor's office.
He has also put into place plans to promote the organization more widely. Last December, he hired Gary Ciccerello, an advertising executive formerly with Foote, Cone & Belding in Manhattan, to assemble 60- and 30-second television commercials promoting the chamber and its members, along with other marketing tasks. These ads began running earlier this year on Channels 12 and 55, and the chamber is negotiating with Channel 4, the NBC affiliate, to broadcast the ads throughout the region.
Mr. Sneden has also wrung considerable publicity from the chamber's effort, finally successful, to win All-America City recognition for the Town of Huntington from the National Civic League. 
"Dennis is full of energy and ideas, but he also has the ability to follow through on those ideas and see that they're implemented," said Frank Petrone, the town supervisor. "Dennis gets things done by building partnerships and creating networks."
In 1995, Mr. Petrone gave Mr. Sneden his start in local government when he hired him as the director of economic development. At the time, Mr. Sneden, a former deputy director of the Suffolk County Girl Scouts, was helping run his wife's real estate business. In 1996, Mr. Petrone promoted him to deputy supervisor. 
The chamber has traditionally had strong representation from the ranks of the shopkeepers in Huntington village, one of Long Island's most dynamic retailing areas. By the mid-60's the character of the business community in the town had changed with an influx of large and midsize companies that had relocated to the Route 110 corridor, and many of the newcomers joined the chamber, too.
But by the mid-90's, membership in the chamber was shrinking and morale was low, said Mr. Lazar, the chamber's vice chairman. Several veteran chamber members who admired Mr. Sneden's performance at Town Hall recruited him as chief executive, Mr. Lazar said. 
From the start, Mr. Sneden's visionary plans and managerial competence have been admired and supported by the chamber's board, Mr. Lazar said. "Dennis came in just at the right time," he said. "We were small and getting smaller all the time."
Mr. Sneden, who tends to end sentences with exclamation marks, said "We were down to 300 companies -- shoot me now!" 
To expand the chamber's profile, Mr. Sneden has drawn on his extensive network of contacts, including connections he has made with other executives and prominent members of 42 other chambers in Suffolk County, who meet under the auspices of the Suffolk County Coalition of Chambers of Commerce, a group he formed in 1998 and continues to run as president. The coalition brings a focus to the traditionally disjointed economic development efforts of the county's individual chambers, he said.
Mr. Lazar, the group's vice chairman, said: "Looking back over where we've gone lately, I think the fire gave us a new start by destroying all the old stuff. I think the fire was the best thing that ever happened to the chamber."

HEADLINE: Places Where the Buck Doesn't Even Linger 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
ON a sparkling August morning that felt more like fall than summer, Dick and Pat Nicholas of Glastonbury packed up their three grandchildren and made their first trip to the Old New-Gate Prison in East Granby.
 "This is a treasure," Mr. Nicholas said as he stood on the grounds of the old prison, a national historic landmark where scores of Tories were imprisoned during the Revolutionary War. "I think it should stay open." 
 So did the employees of the Connecticut Historical Commission. But faced with a 44 percent budget cut, the commission's director, John W. Shannahan, announced in July that he would have to close all four of the commission's museums next month. 
The closings generated enough publicity to prompt state leaders to restore financing to keep the museums open and to avoid layoffs. But Mr. Shannahan was still left with a 17 percent budget reduction that means job openings in his agency will remain unfilled. Similar belt-tightening is occurring across Connecticut now that a struggling economy has left the state without a budget surplus for the first time in a decade and has also forced officials to make cuts. 
"It was a difficult year because people had to rethink the manner in which they handle the budget," said the Speaker of the House, Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat of Stamford. "In Connecticut, we had been used to not only surpluses but giving money back to taxpayers."
In response, tuition at state schools is on the rise, temporary court employees have been let go and the funnel of money to nonprofit arts organizations has been slowed. On the local level, though the state increased educational cost sharing grants to municipalities, nearly every city and town in the state raised property taxes this year in part because of a net decrease in state aid and cuts in money for items like special education and road repairs, said James J. Finley, associate director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
"It's the worst municipal budget season we have seen in a decade," he said.
Judging by budget projections, it seems like the future may hold more of the same. 
"This is only the beginning of the problem," said State Senator Joseph J. Crisco Jr., a Democrat of Woodbridge who is co-chairman of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee. Mr. Crisco said there could be budget deficits of $1 billion each in the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years.
Connecticut is not alone in facing troubling budget issues. Across the country, state governments are grappling with a downturn in the economy that has caused a drop in tax revenues from personal incomes, capital gains and retail sales. 
"Budget crises are influenced by two things: how much you are spending and how much revenue you are getting," said Mark Robbins, assistant professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. "I don't know how the spending has changed, but certainly there's been revenue shortfalls.
"Connecticut has an income tax and a sales tax and a capital gains tax so there's a lot of sources there, but you would expect all of those sources to decrease when economic activity decreases." 
In fact, according to a report from Comptroller Nancy Wyman, the state ended the 2002 fiscal year with a budget deficit of $812 million in large part because of a drop in income tax revenues, which were $561 million less than original estimates.
The downturn in the stock market had a major effect on capital gains tax revenue, said Marc S. Ryan, secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. 
"That's the one that really hurt us," he said. 
At the same time, Connecticut faces rising expenditures for items such as Medicaid. Together, the problems meant state officials had to find a way to close a nearly $1 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and another $1 billion shortfall for the current fiscal year. After lengthy budget sessions, the General Assembly adopted a $13.2 billion budget on June 30, down from the $13.5 billion spending plan that was adopted a year ago.
To get there, the legislature cut several state agencies' budgets and increased taxes on items like cigarettes, diesel fuel and businesses. It also delayed cuts to the income tax, a sales tax exemption for computer services and the phase-out of the inheritance tax and the gift tax, Mr. Ryan said. 
Not many people were happy with the results. 
"There was a fine line and you had to get a balance," Mr. Crisco said. "As my grandmother always said, 'In life, if you want to be fair, you have to achieve balance.' " 
Consequently, it seems like people in all sectors are feeling the pinch.
At the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, a nearly 7 percent reduction in its programming budget meant the commission issued $1.2 million in grants for arts and cultural organizations, down from $1.6 million last year, said Kathleen DeMeo, communications specialist for the commission.
That in turn meant arts organizations like the National Theater of the Deaf, which typically receives about $35,000 from the state, did not receive anything this year.
"We understand the budget was a little bit less this year," said Pierre Patrick, a spokesman for the theater, which is appealing to the commission. "We thought we would get a little bit less, but we got zero." 
Mr. Patrick said the theater was counting on the money to help produce two major shows. Without the state money, the theater will probably cut back on the touring schedule of one of its productions, he said. 
"Really, throughout the years they have always been very, very supportive," he added. "Some organizations give less as years pass and we always expect that. It's just zero is a shock." 
At the Downtown Cabaret Theater of Bridgeport, the lack of any money from the commission means that plans to do the American debut of Ivor Novello's musical, "King's Rhapsody" are now on hold, said Richard Hallinan, the organization's executive producer.
At the Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra in Stamford, which did not receive any money from the commission, officials will be looking for new revenue sources, said Laurence Gilgore, general director and principal conductor of the Stamford organization.
"I think it's going to force companies like ours to be more clever, to never take anything for granted, to broaden as much as possible your funding sources," Mr. Gilgore said. "Individuals are going to have to reach deeper into their pockets. 
The same is true for students at the state's community-technical schools. Anticipating a tough budget year, the Board of Trustees of Community-Technical Colleges had imposed a tuition increase last year that would go into effect for the 2002-3 school year, said Mary Anne Cox, director of communications for the board. But the recent budget cuts prompted the board to impose additional fees of $2.25 per credit to help make up the shortfall, she said. That means a full-time student will be faced with a $2,034 bill compared with $1,888 for the 2001-2 school year.
That is bad news for Liane Dillard, an East Hampton mother of two who has been taking classes at Manchester Community College for nearly two years in an effort to obtain an associate's degree 
"I just think it's a shame," Ms. Dillard said. "It's going to put a lot more burden on me and my family." 
Still, even with the tuition increase, the community-technical colleges are by far the least expensive of any of the state schools, said Rifet Okugic of Newington, who dropped by the registration session at Manchester Community College on a recent morning.
"I have to pay for the tuition myself," he said. "It's much cheaper than the other schools."
In Storrs, the University of Connecticut experienced a 5 percent cut in its budget. In response, the school's trustees voted Aug. 13 to impose a midyear tuition increase that will raise the cost of classes for in-state undergraduates by $108 next spring, said Karen Grava, manager of media communications for UConn. That increase is in addition to the 3.9 percent increase in tuition the board had already adopted for the 2002-3 school year.
Also, the board raised undergraduate tuition for the 2003-4 school year by 8.72 percent to $5,260 for in-state students. In 2004-5 it will increase another 8.75 percent to $5,720, Ms. Grava said. 
In addition, the university is looking at other ways to cut costs at a time when the undergraduate student enrollment alone has grown from less than 20,000 to about 25,000 in the last five years.
"This is quite a challenge for us," Ms. Grava said. "We are growing and we need to supply students with classes and services, so it is a challenge to meet all the requirements we have to meet." 
The University of Connecticut Health Center had already been grappling with financial stresses because of pressures in the health care field, such as a reduction in federal reimbursements. But a $2 million cut in the $76.3 million it thought it would receive from the state prompted officials there to impose a hiring freeze as well as a managerial salary freeze, said James Walter, a spokesman for the health center. Layoffs are also under consideration, he said.
"Being in this environment over the past number of years with these financial pressures, we have adopted a course of action where we are constantly re-engineering our work force," he said. "We are cutting where we feel we need to. We are investing in our work force where we see opportunities to grow the health center and increase revenues, but we will be expecting layoffs at some point as a result of these cuts."
In the Judicial Branch, officials responded to the budget cuts by closing the adult drug courts in New Haven, Bridgeport and Waterbury as well as the juvenile drug court in Hartford, said Rhonda Stearley-Hebert, manager of communications for the Judicial Branch. Those courts tried to reduce substance-abuse recidivism among nonviolent drug offenders by offering a program that combined intensive judicial supervision with treatment, she said. The Judicial Branch expects it will save about $1 million by closing the courts. The branch will transfer offenders to other programs, she said.
In addition, judicial officials dismissed 62 temporary judicial marshals and 35 temporary assistant clerks last month, Ms. Stearley-Hebert said.
"There's going to be more work for less people, but we are not unlike any other state agency," she said. "We are going to do the best we can."

HEADLINE: Here, the Sandman Comes but Doesn't Leave 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY B. COHEN 

 BODY:
IT is a relaxing, four-day, four-night stay in a small New England city, complete with time for reading, movies and self-reflection. Management, after all, wants its guests to stay in bed until noon.
 But there are catches: no sunlight, no exercise, no visitors, no minibar, although the in-room movies are free. 
 You can make an occasional phone call, but receiving calls is not encouraged.
And those video cameras pointed at your bed? Just ignore them. 
Any takers?
The offer is from the sleep lab at Wesleyan University's Department of Psychology. People who sign up will be subjects in two four-day visits to the lab and be part of a two-year study to analyze how the external environment affects the internal biological clock. When completed, the research results may help those with irregular sleep cycles.
Mary Margaret Anderson, a 21-year-old Wesleyan student, got ready to take a four-day plunge at Wesleyan's Judd Hall in July. "Am I excited?" Ms. Anderson asked. "Well, I think it's going to be something different."
The objective of the study, run by Namni Goel, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and financed in part by the National Institute of Health, is simple: to measure whether and how sound can affect human circadian rhythms (the 24-hour internal body clock).
"Normally our internal clock is in sync with the external environment," Dr. Goel said. But when the two are out of sync -- as with overnight workers or jet-lagged travelers -- the body clock says sleep, the sun says otherwise, and nobody's happy.
For her study, Dr. Goel does her best to remove the variable of the external clock altogether -- hence the "no sunlight" rule. Because the effects of light as a stimulus have been studied, Dr. Goel chose another variable: sound.
Her subjects spend four nights in the lab, and on two of those nights they listen to two hours of stimulus before or after going to bed, depending on the study. The stimulus is either bird song enhanced with music or sounds imperceptible to the human ear, Dr. Goel said.
"It's supposed to be relaxing so they don't get bored, because they have to listen to it for two hours," Dr. Goel said, explaining her choice.
But the stimulus was not nearly as stimulating as one subject, Mei Mei Chan, had hoped. "Oh my god, you have to sit there in this chair and it's like," she paused and stiffened, "music."
"You just sit there; it's craziness," she said, laughing.
Ms. Chan graduated from Wesleyan this year and said she figured this would be a good way to fill time and help the university. She also received $350 for participating.
On her first of two visits -- each subject must participate twice to make the data reliable -- Ms. Chan watched at least 10 movies in four days. The second time around, she brushed up on her foreign language skills, renting films in German and French, and read economics books. 
When she was in high school, Ms. Chan said she conducted her own psychology experiment. She sent out a questionnaire about the colors people dream. "But my drawback was I couldn't have people in a sleep lab and hook them up to see what color they dreamt in," she said. "So my sophistication was much lower than this."
But in this experiment, subjects enter the lab, and the first thing they do after getting settled is have electrodes placed around their heads with an adhesive paste, Dr. Goel said. The electrodes monitor sleep data every night, from brain EEG's to rapid eye movement to muscle movement in the chin.
Ms. Chan's first night was easy. She got no stimulus so that her normal sleep patterns could be gauged. But sleep on the second two nights was interrupted at 5:45 a.m. with just enough time left for Ms. Chan to don her dark glasses, go to the restroom (the eyes of the subjects cannot be exposed to the light in the bathroom) and freshen up, before taking her stimulus seat at 6 a.m.
Using body temperature readings, salivary tests for the sleep-related hormone melatonin, and the sleep data from the electrodes, Dr. Goel analyzes the effects of the stimulus on the subsequent nights. She found that the effects of sound on sleep are much like those of light. A two-hour dose of stimulus before bed (as in the first study) actually pushes the internal clock backward, while the same dose after sleep will likely push the clock forward.
Although Dr. Goel is more concerned with the psychological effects than a real-world application of her study's findings, her experiment does show that sleep patterns can be altered through sensory stimuli. What that may mean is that people who have trouble sleeping could possibly find a nondrug-induced way to snooze, such as listening to music.
"I know people who've had problems with sleeping pills," said Daniel Raimi, 21, a Wesleyan student and a subject.
For him, should a practical application be derived from the experiments, all the better. "I think it would be great for people to have a healthy alternative," he said.
But all of the benefits of science aside, being a subject in this type of study isn't exactly easy, Ms. Chan said.
"At the end of the four days, I just felt like, O.K., this is worse than being a prisoner," she said of her first tour. "You can do anything you want to do, but you can't see light, and there's only so many movies you can watch."
When she left the building after her first of two four-day sessions, Ms. Chan found a new appreciation for freedom. But when she left the building after her second four-day session, her opinion had changed. That is because beneath several of the electrodes on her face, Ms. Chan developed rashes.
Dr. Goel said it was probably because Ms. Chan had worn makeup and lotion one day, something Dr. Goel had told her not to do.
Ms. Chan said the rashes were actually worse behind her ears, where she applied no makeup. She left the study appreciating its goals but lamenting her experience. Dr. Goel said that Ms. Chan was the only subject out of more than 75 to develop a rash.
The subjects all agreed that the nicest part of participating was the isolation it provided, the refuge from daily college life and college friends.
"I'm living with a bunch of students, and I think it was good for me to have some time by myself," said Ms. Anderson, who spent a good deal of her time watching movies.
As for Mr. Raimi, he spent his time practicing guitar. But his guitar time and his earlier helping-out-the-sick rationale notwithstanding, there was still the cash payment to think of.
"We have jobs, but they're part-time and there's a lot of things we like to do," Mr. Raimi said. "We have to have beer money, we have to go to baseball games, we have to buy CD's."
For unemployed college students with nothing better to do, the payment is attractive, Ms. Chan concurred. "But it's really not attractive for somebody who has something going on in life," she said.
Most attractive of all, though, was leaving, Mr. Raimi said.
"That was pretty exciting," he said, sounding relieved. "We got to be pretty close with the people administering the study, but we were definitely happy to leave."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Another Home-Shopping Network

BYLINE:  By ELLEN L. ROSEN 

 BODY:
FUELED by new hobbies and a new generation, selling products at home remains a bright spot in the economy. While longstanding companies like Avon and Tupperware now sell in retail outlets as well as through individual consultants, other companies are finding profits in events that can resemble old-style coffee klatches. 
 One of the most successful party-plan companies, as they are called, is Pampered Chef, an Illinois-based cookware company. And one of its more successful consultants is Penney Parkes, a Fairfield, Conn., resident who also covers Westchester. She came upon the business by happenstance, when a friend invited her to a show. 
 It turns out that Mrs. Parkes had a natural affinity for her new business. Part comedian, part chef, she easily sold $1,000 in products at a recent gathering in the West Harrison home of Anna Gallo. 
Michele Costa of New Rochelle, a consultant for Creative Memories, products, not only sells its products like specialized scrapbooks, adhesives and marking pens, but also organizes gatherings so others can work on their books together.
She started keeping scrapbooks five years ago and says her involvement was highly personal. "I lost my mother before my daughter was born, and I didn't have anyone to ask the questions of what it was like to be pregnant, when did I take my first steps?" said Ms. Costa, who has been a consultant for more than a year. 
Cathy Parlitsis of Somers got hooked on a new hobby three years ago when she and an aunt attended a party sponsored by Stampin' Up!, one of the newer direct sales companies. "Once the host handed me the stamp, I was a goner," she said.
Her income last year, excluding trips and bonuses, was close to $30,000.
In contrast to other party-plan products, the three best-known clothing lines sold through the home -- Carlisle, Doncaster and Worth -- are not offered at large gatherings. Rather, representatives transform their homes with display fixtures and invite clients by appointment.
Kathryn Parter of Larchmont, for example, who has represented Doncaster for the last 10 years, keeps her quarterly shows low-key and personal, an approach that keeps her clients coming back. While shopping in someone's home is not for everyone, "it is by no means Loehmann's," said one longtime client, Betsy Cherkasky of Larchmont. 
Jori Wolfe of Scarsdale uses a similar style in selling clothes manufactured by Etcetera, a casual offshoot of Carlisle. Mrs. Wolfe, who worked in the garment industry for many years, signed on with Etcetera last year when her family business closed. Children's companies abound as well; Connecticut-based Big Enough, for example, has 20 representatives in Westchester.
Running just a few parties a month -- sometimes in the representatives' homes but more often in the homes of others -- can result in annual incomes of anywhere from $30,000 to more than $100,000, say company spokesmen and consultants alike. (The host of the party typically receives a few free items and discounts off any purchases). The representatives also get discounts on merchandise and all-expense paid trips as bonuses for attaining certain sales levels. Prices for products sold at home generally are no higher than retail prices for similar items.
Success depends directly on the efforts of the representative, both in terms of selling products and in attracting new consultants, an equally important part of the job. Although the compensation formulas vary, they each follow some form of multilevel marketing; earnings typically accrue from commissions on sales and a small percentage of the sales made by people recruited to join the business. 
Vivian Frerking of Ossining, for example, has sold candles and accessories made by PartyLite Gifts for five years, and now runs about three shows a week.
She has recruited approximately 50 people on her team, about half of whom are still active, and is now a group leader. As a result, not only does she earn a 32 percent commission on her direct sales, but also 7 percent on sales made by the people in her central unit, and 4 percent from the sales of two recruits who have subsequently created separate units of their own.
A physical therapist by training, Ms. Frerking says she earned approximately $50,000 last year. In the past because of her sales volume she has won vacations to places like Hawaii, Aruba and Paris.
The newer entrants in this segment of the direct sales market have not eclipsed the industry stalwarts. Westchester is home to four Mary Kay representatives who are successful enough to drive the company's signature pink Cadillac. (According to a company spokesman, Randall Oxford, 15 other Mary Kay representatives in Westchester drive more anonymous General Motors cars that were also bonuses for good work. Altogether, there are 920 cosmetic representatives countywide). Tupperware, which also offers autos to some of their consultants as well, has 95 representatives in the county; Avon has roughly 1,700.
The Shaklee Corporation, one of the oldest direct-sales companies, has its representatives in the county. Angela Nesbitt of Larchmont is one of about 1,000 Shaklee representatives in the county. A few years back she had risen to partner at a management consulting firm in Manhattan, but quit because her long workday kept her from her children. Looking for work that would require fewer hours, she investigated Shaklee, which specializes in nutritional supplements and environmentally friendly products. She studied the company's business model and also "tested all the products because I was convinced they weren't as good as the claims." She was soon convinced and signed on.
Party-plan companies comprise less than a third of all direct-sales businesses, yet they are the growth engine of the industry, said Joseph Mariano, the executive vice president of the Direct Selling Association, a Washington-based trade organization.
According to figures provided by the association, party plan businesses raked in more than $7 billion nationwide in 2000, an increase of $2.7 billion since 1996. Last year, The Pampered Chef's domestic sales totaled $750 million, said a spokeswoman, Jane Edwards. Shelli Gardner, the president of 14-year-old Stampin' Up!, said total sales reached $114 million in 2001, and this year the company's sales are 40 percent more than where they were one year ago.
Mrs. Parter said she sold twice as many clothes in her July show this year as she had last summer, despite high temperatures and a slow economy. She attributed sales of $30,000 to $40,000, roughly doubled from her show in July 2001, to additional clients coming from referrals. 
Although the field seems dominated by women, there are avenues for men as well, even at Mary Kay, although Mr. Oxford, a company spokesman said that fewer than 1 percent nationwide are men. Carol Brown, a Mary Kay sales director who lives in White Plains, said 3 of the 65 consultants in her sales group are men.
But for the most part, the men involved play supporting roles, including taking care of the children when gatherings are held at night or on the weekends.
Mrs. Parlitsis said her husband, George, initially did not like her new hobby-turned-business and would introduce himself as the president of "Stamp-Out Stampers." He changed his tune, however, when his wife was sidelined with a back injury. Although she couldn't work, a paycheck kept coming in, based on commissions from the sales made by her recruits. He was impressed, Mrs. Parlitsis said, and as a result, he resigned his post as president.

HEADLINE: Dublin on the Thruway 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
McLEAN AVENUE meanders across Yonkers just above the Bronx border. While it winds and dips like an Irish country road, it is lined with so many pubs and other Irish businesses that one feels transported to Cork or Limerick. The local tongue is a lilting brogue.
 Irish immigrants first began settling here in the mid-1980's, and by 2000, the bars and sidewalks were teeming with young Irish people who had come for the jobs and the great craic, the Gaelic word for fun. The community seized claim to the unofficial title of Ireland's 33rd county. 
 But as the American economy has flagged and jobs have grown scarce, many Irish have returned home to look for work. Tighter restrictions on green cards and visas have kept others from replacing them. Things have grown quieter along the avenue that craic built. 
"Quite a few young people have gone back in the past couple of years, and the majority of them have stayed back," said Rory Dolan, a co-owner of Rory Dolan's, the most prominent bar on McLean Avenue.
There was fear, especially among merchants like Mr. Dolan, that the change would cause McLean Avenue to decline as as other short-lived Irish communities have But if anything, this bustling community along the New York State Thruway has grown stronger, residents say.
The area, which runs along McLean Avenue, roughly from the Saw Mill Parkway to the Bronx River Parkway, has become less of a rollicking party ground and more of a broad-based community. Swarms of Irish transplants are buying and renovating starter homes and establishing businesses, from construction companies to coffee shops.
What remains is a community with a strong middle-class backbone that no longer measures its vitality by the pint and the keg. Property values and rents have soared. More of the Irish who have remained here have steady jobs and legitimate immigrant status, and many are applying for United States citizenship.
In short, McLean Avenue seems to have reached trealbhaidh, a Gaelic term for maturation or coming of age.
"Especially for the young Irish, McLean Avenue has gotten to be the biggest Irish community in the New York area over the past decade," said Cait Moran, a spokeswoman for the Irish Consulate in Manhattan.
"Most Irish here have it in the back of their heads to maybe one day go back, and they're always watching closely to see how their friends and relations do when they return," she said. "But it's not seen as a depletion of the community. The neighborhood is strong enough to survive."
Adrian Flannelly, a popular Irish radio talk show host here, said the area had achieved a stability that other Irish communities in New York lacked.
"It used to be that you got off the plane and went straight to Inwood or Woodside or Woodlawn," he said. "Now the word on the street is that Irish have staked out McLean Avenue. If you want to move forward, to regularize your status, all roads lead there. It's an enclave with tremendous security and support. The stability of other Irish areas in New York is questionable, but look at McLean: You can't argue with success.
"It's not a passing thing," said Mr. Flannelly, chairman of Irish Radio Network USA and a board member of the Irish government's immigration task force. "The Irish community around McLean Avenue is here to stay. If you're looking for a 33rd county, this is the new one." 
Liam McLaughlin, who represents the area in the Yonkers City Council, said the community had developed strong political clout. Many of the Irish here are influential in the trade unions, he said, and the bar owners wield power in the larger business community. When Gerry Adams, leader of the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, visits the country, he always speaks at Rory Dolan's.
According to Mr. Flannelly, the politics and the troubles that have embroiled Northern Ireland, including differences between Catholics and Protestants, are not inflammatory issues in the community here, even though people here keep up with the peace process back home through Irish newspapers and news programs.
Northern Ireland politics just don't translate over here, he said, because people are coming over to make a better life for themselves. 
Mr. Dolan agreed. "Everyone lives together here," he said. "You have Catholics living next to Protestants. People don't care."
Mr. McLaughlin said the community is well-rounded now. "A lot of Irish have gone, but many have stayed too, and bought homes and settled in and taken root," he said. "You used to have young people tending bar and bouncing around the neighborhood, living in a house with four friends. Now they've met someone here and are buying homes of their own, fixing them up and settling here.
"Every time I drive by a house being worked on, it's seems to be someone of Irish descent, and not just on McLean Avenue, but they're moving up to the northwest and eastern parts of Yonkers."
There has been a strong Irish influence in Yonkers for more than a century. According to the 2000 census, of 196,086 documented Yonkers residents, 25,241, or 13 percent, claim to have Irish heritage. That is second only to Italians, who make up 18.8 percent.
The Irish neighborhoods in the New York area include Sunnyside and Woodside in Queens, Woodlawn and Bainbridge in the Bronx and Inwood in Manhattan.
After the decline of Bainbridge Avenue, an Irish hot spot of the 1980's and early 1990's, many Irish moved to Woodlawn and traveled up Katonah Avenue into Yonkers. Many of them, tired of living in apartment buildings were attracted to McLean Avenue with its affordable one-family houses.
The neighborhood, which was part Italian but with a sizable population of older Irish immigrants who settled here decades ago, was safe and convenient to Manhattan. Pubs began springing up, an essential foundation for any Irish neighborhood, and the Irish invasion into the area began. The community grew throughout the 1990's into a major destination for Irish arriving in New York. The American economy was booming and, even on weeknights, the bars were packed shoulder to shoulder. The sidewalks were so crowded with Irish people that it was often compared to Grafton Street, a busy thoroughfare in Dublin.
The area has not been without its problems. In the 1990's there were fears that McLean Avenue would become the next Bainbridge Avenue, which became affected by heavy night life, bar fights and police crackdowns. In 1996, to prevent over-saturation, the Yonkers City Council temporarily banned the construction of new bars along a stretch of McLean Avenue. And in 1999, there were problems with Irish immigrants using ecstasy and other recreational drugs.
But overall, the Irish influx has had a positive effect, said Lee Ellman, the planning director for Yonkers.
"You walk down McLean Avenue and you see a tremendous revitalization of the neighborhood," he said. "It has really become especially vibrant over the last 10 years, a tremendous upgrade. The storefronts had a 1950's look and were somewhat tired looking. Now there is a much more Irish aesthetic, a continental look to the facades."
One of those storefronts is Dympna Tully's business, Tully Travel, which has prospered since she opened it in May 1998.
"A lot of people have chosen to go back to Ireland for one reason or another," she said, "but a lot of young couples have also chosen to stay here and put their children in the schools.
"The area has taken on a lot better look and the stability has increased tremendously in the last few years. The housing prices have doubled, and it's impossible to find a house here. They're sold before they get put on the market."
In Westchester, ethnic enclaves can dilute quickly and recede into anonymity in residential neighborhoods. But it is hard to miss McLean Avenue. The area's picturesque pubs have names that could be set to a lively Irish reel. For starters, you have Mulligans, McGinn's, McGilligan's and McKeon's. Then there is the Well, the Lark's Nest, the Quays and the Snug. Add to that: Arthur Daly's, Ned Devine's, Burke's, Behan's, Bodhran's, Fagans, Fiona's, Cornyn's, Tara and Granuaile. For good measure, throw in: P. J. Clarke's, J. J. Mannion's, the Heritage, the Hibernian, the Leinster House and the Malt House.
Of course, there are also many successful businesses that do not traffic in Guinness Stout and Bushmill's whisky. For food, there is the Irish Coffee Shop, the Irish Country Kitchen, the Celtic Kitchen, Eileen's Country Kitchen and Katie's Cottage. There is Sean's Deli and the An Siopa Beag grocery. There are many Irish car services and law offices.
When the economy was better, even the many Irish immigrants without visas or green cards could find off-the-books work, assisted by the tight network of Irish businesses here. But now many who want to come to America cannot. In recent years, the United States government has made it harder for immigrants from many nations to get work visas and green cards, decreasing quotas and creating lotteries. After Sept. 11, immigration became even harder.
STILL, some young people from Ireland continue to come. And for any newcomer, a haven like McLean Avenue is vital.
"Having a support network is crucial to getting started," said Mary Tuohy, a director of the Aisling Irish Community Center on McLean Avenue, which provides cultural and outreach services.
The center, financed by community donations and a grant from the Irish government, offers everything from passport renewals to classes in yoga and Gaelic.
McLean Avenue is very unified, said Tom Riordan, another director of the center.
"It's actually tighter here than across the sea," Mr. Riordan said. "The Irish are clannish. At home, a Kerry man might help another Kerry man before a Donegal man. But here, Irish is Irish."
Mr. Riordan is a Killarney man and Ms. Tuohy is from Tipperary. 
They said, regardless of their home county, all Irish enjoy being able to get Irish products locally, like Irish newspapers or strong Irish tea. Irish foods can help stave off homesickness, and the small grocers along McLean Avenue stock bangers and rashers and pudding-style sausages. They have Batchelor's Baked Beans, Galtee bacon and kidney pies. Snacks like Tayto's chips and Cadbury chocolates are also on the shelves, as is Weetabix cereal, Jacob's Cream Crackers, and Oldlum's flour for making soda bread.
Besides food, the Irish import another touch-stone of home: sports. The Gaelic Athletic Association runs hurling and Gaelic football games on Sundays in Gaelic Park, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Gaelic football resembles rugby and hurling is something like field hockey for gladiators. For a $10 admission fee, there are four games and some of the world's best hurlers and footballers, most of whom play for teams named for the Irish counties they came from. The teams, financed by the local community, regularly pay for expert players from Ireland to fly here on weekends to play for them during the season, which runs from March through October.
"The teams are a starting point for a lot of Irish," said Tom Tuffy, president of the Sligo Supporters Club, which backs the Sligo team from New York.
"If you're a good footballer and a team picks you up, it will get you work and an apartment and get you moving in the right direction," said Mr. Tuffy, who moved here from Sligo in 1986 and started his own construction company in Manhattan. He soon bought himself a home a block north of McLean Avenue. "If they're footballers, they'll get work through the teams. A large percentage of people in the area come here and stay here because of their sporting abilities."
Danny Leavy, 32, who plays Gaelic football for the Westmeath team, came here nine years ago from the town of Rhode, in County Offaly, and got his job with the carpenters' union through the team. He bought a house just up from McLean Avenue two years ago.
He married an Irish woman here and they are undecided whether to start a family in Ireland or Yonkers. He bought his house for $276,000, he said, and now he can sell it for more than $400,000, but "I know I'll never earn as much working back home."
Inside the bar at Gaelic Park, Varina Carey drank beer with her teammates from the County Kildare Gaelic football team. Ms. Carey, 28, is from the town of Scotstown in Monaghan County. She came to New York in 1993 and headed straight to McLean Avenue. She has basically remained here since then, playing midfield for the team, working for a local accountant and hitting the pubs on the weekends. She said she is buying a condominium near McLean Avenue because "it's the handiest area for me."
Not only Irish immigrants enjoy McLean Avenue. Others are drawn to the neighborhood by Irish music festivals, live bar bands and Irish culture classes in small private schools and community centers.
The McNamaras, an Irish-American family in Tuckahoe, are regular visitors to the McLean Avenue area. The parents, Tom and Rosita McNamara, are constantly shuttling their five children a set of triplets, 11, and a set of twins, 17 to Yonkers for Irish dancing and music lessons. The twins, Elizabeth and Patricia, are world-class competitive step dancers who started at age 8 and have been to Ireland nine times for dancing events. The triplets are Maggie, Conor and Thomas. Maggie plays the tin whistle and dances, Thomas plays keyboard, and Conor plays the accordion.
It's the same with the Mahon family of Mount Vernon. Kathleen Mariah Mahon, 11, has taken step dance since she was 3. Her brother plays the tin whistle.
"Everything she knows about Irish culture, she learned from McLean Avenue, said her father, James M. Mahon. "We didn't even know what the tin whistle was, and now I'm spending $100 on one."
But for residents like Mr. Tuffy, this Dublin-on-the-Thruway is more than just a resource for Irish culture. It is home.
"You're 3,000 miles away from where you were born, yet you don't feel like you're that far away from home," he said. "In a way, it's our home away from home, but we're not going anywhere. We're here to stay."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Woodbridge, N.J.; 
Many Roads and Trains and 10 ZIP Codes

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
AT the intersection of the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike, Woodbridge is one of New Jersey's major crossroads.
 The Amtrak Boston-Washington line and New Jersey Transit's New York-Philadelphia train line meet at its Metropark station. Routes 1 and 9 join up just north of the giant 1.5-million-square-foot Woodbridge Center mall on Route 1. Routes 9 and 440 and the Parkway meet at the southern tip of the township in a spaghettilike snarl of overpasses, sending drivers north toward New York; south toward Philadelphia; west toward the giant Raritan Center Industrial Park, which is partially in Woodbridge; and east toward Staten Island. 
 The 27-square-mile municipality, which is in Middlesex County, includes 10 distinct, but unincorporated, sections and stretches across an equal number of ZIP codes. 
Each of the 10 sections -- Woodbridge, Avenel, Colonia, Sewaren, Iselin, Fords, Menlo Park Terrace, Keasbey, Port Reading and Hopelawn -- has its own central business district; and throughout the town, strip malls abound. Of the 10 areas, only Iselin, which is now a center for immigrants from India, has a specific ethnic flavor.
The town has seven major supermarkets and dozens of restaurants. Perhaps the best known is the Reo Diner on Amboy Avenue in the Woodbridge central business district, where generations of politicians and businessmen have gathered. 
Settled in 1664 and chartered by King Charles II of England in 1669, Woodbridge is New Jersey's oldest township. Among its earliest settlers was John Pike, ancestor of Zebulon M. Pike, who discovered the peak in Colorado that bears his name. The township is named for the Rev. John Woodbridge of Newbury, Mass., from which many of the original settlers came.
Among Woodbridge's claims to fame is that its former mayor, James E. McGreevey, is now New Jersey's governor. The current mayor, Frank G. Pelzman, said the Town Council had often discussed the notion of applying for city status, which would increase its eligibility for state aid, but had always rejected the idea.
"The word 'city' means 'massive,' " the mayor said. "And each of our areas wants to keep its individuality. However, they stay together as a township because of the economies of having one mayor, one police department and one school system." 
Although no major Revolutionary War battles were fought in Woodbridge, the Jersey Blues, a regiment that guarded the inner perimeter of Gen. George Washington's encampment in Valley Forge, Pa., was organized in the township. On April 22, 1789, General Washington stayed overnight at the Cross Keys Tavern -- now a private home -- in Woodbridge en route to his inauguration in New York City.
The town's only building on the National Register of Historic Places is the brownstone Barron Arts Center, which has stained glass windows and a clock tower. Built as a library in 1877, the center on Rahway Avenue holds art exhibits and concerts.
Fueled by low interest rates, the Woodbridge real estate market is very hot, with frequent bidding wars among prospective buyers, drawn in part by the town's excellent transportation system. 
"Recently, a split level in Colonia was listed at $209,900," said Ernie Dragos, owner of Dragos Sun Realty on Amboy Avenue. "Six agencies submitted contracts" on behalf of perspective purchasers, he continued. "A builder bought it at $212,500, updated the kitchen, installed new windows and did some other renovations, then relisted it three months later at $314,900. It sold at full price within 10 days."
Woodbridge has an extremely diverse housing stock. In Sewaren and Port Reading, along the Arthur Kill, some small Cape Cod or ranch houses go for as low as $170,000, and in the Estates neighborhood of Colonia, an enclave of large colonials on lots of an acre or more, houses can fetch more than $1 million, according to James J. Elek, owner of JJ Elek Realty on Main Street.
At the beginning of August, 204 homes were on the market in the Multiple Listing Service, ranging from $129,900 for a two-bedroom unit in a "half duplex" two-family house in the Woodbridge section up to $1.2 million for 5,000-square-foot custom colonial to be built on one acre in the Estates area. 
The majority of homes are 30 to 40 years old. Lately, however, builders have been tearing down existing homes on large lots and replacing them with several new homes. For example, on Trinity Place in Avenel, a builder recently purchased a small bungalow-type ranch for $145,000, knocked it down and is now building two four-bedroom homes on the site, with plans to list them for $325,000, Mr. Dragos said.
The town has 21 major condominium complexes, ranging in size to the 404-unit Wyndmoor development on Cricket Lane in the Woodbridge section. It also has 7,598 rental apartments in 69 complexes, the largest being the 802-unit Kensington Gardens in Fords. According to Mr. Dragos, town house condominiums range from about $170,000 for units with two bedrooms and two and a half baths in Woodbridge Commons off Gill Lane, within walking distance of the Metropark train station, up to about $270,000 for some three-bedroom, two-bath units with finished basements, decks and fireplaces off Highview Drive near Woodbridge center. 
Mr. Dragos lists his typical buyers as two-income families, including blue-collar couples, professionals seeking houses near their offices in Woodbridge and young couples who are drawn to the excellent transportation to Manhattan. Besides Metropark, the town has two other train stations in Woodbridge and in Avenel. 
Among those recently purchasing homes in Woodbridge were Martin A. Comiskey, a freelance photographer, and his wife, Barbara, who works as a supervisor at L'Oreal, the cosmetics company, in Cranbury, about 15 miles to the south. Two years ago, they moved from a mobile home in Avenel into a three-bedroom ranch on Lyman Avenue in the Woodbridge section. 
"We paid $154,900, and the day we started painting, someone offered us $20,000 more," Mr. Comiskey said. "Although we are only in this house two years, we wonder how we managed in a cramped two-bedroom mobile home."
He termed the area "very friendly," noting that neighbors had helped him put up Christmas lights and had helped his wife start a vegetable garden. Their son, Thomas, 20, attends Middlesex County College in neighboring Edison and their daughter, Barbara, 13, attends Woodbridge High School. Because the house is very close to Routes 1 and 9, Mr. Comiskey's main complaint concerns the heavy rush-hour traffic. "They are building more stores along Route 9, which will only make things worse," he said. 
The 13,250-student Woodbridge Public Schools system has 16 elementary, 5 middle and 3 high schools. The acting superintendent, Vincent Smith, complains that in each of the past 33 years except for 1991, voters have defeated the school budget, forcing the township and the school board to hammer out budgets.
"Failed budgets mean smaller budgets," Mr. Smith explained, "and we can't raise construction money through a bond referendum because the voters won't support it."
As a result, no new schools have been built since Colonia High was completed in 1967. Some of the schools are overcrowded, with the most severe problem at Colonia Middle School, where the average class size is 26, compared with a state average of 21. Although the media centers in the schools have Internet access, the classrooms do not, even though statewide 89 percent of classrooms are connected.
The district recently began an initiative called Technology 2000, supported by $1.5 million in district funds and $1 million in contributions from the township and the FedEx Corporation, to improve computer access throughout the district. 
In 2001, the last year for which the figures are available, students at all three high schools in Woodbridge scored below the state averages on both the verbal and mathematics portions of the College Board tests. Eighty-one percent of the graduates are going on to higher education. Each of the three high schools offers 11 or 12 advanced placement courses in the sciences, foreign languages, computers, history and English. 
"We are making too many tough choices," Mr. Smith said. "Our middle schools are cutting back on security officers; our heating systems, boilers and windows are shot; and our parking lots are full of patches. We need to get more parents involved and get our budgets passed."
Community United for Better Schools, a 50-member organization formed after the latest budget was defeated last April, has begun an information campaign to persuade voters to pass the next budget.
Woodbridge has 21 parks; the largest is the 179-acre Middlesex County-owned Merrill Park off the Middlesex-Essex Turnpike. It contains four tennis courts (two with lights), two basketball courts, three baseball diamonds, two softball diamonds, three gazebos, a soccer field, a football field, nine picnic groves, four playgrounds and a petting zoo.
The township has just completed the $16 million Woodbridge Community Center on Main Street. It contains meeting rooms, a full-sized hockey rink, a roller rink, a pool, a exercise room and a basketball court.

Some homeowners use them for basketball courts; others for driveways. They were poured as floors and foundations for some of the 110 buildings constructed in 1918 to serve as United States General Hospital No. 3, a military orthopedic hospital. The facility was built on 300 acres owned by Charles D. Freeman, a commodities trader. Mr. Freeman lent his estate to the Army after a discussion with another Colonia resident, Dr. Fred A. Albee, an orthopedic surgeon who had been asked to establish a hospital that would perform reconstructive surgery on wounded soldiers. The hospital received its first patient on July 5, 1918, and closed on Aug. 15, 1919. In its 13 months of existence, it treated about 6,000 wounded soldiers. The hospital was demolished in 1919, and the land was returned to Mr. Freeman. Map of New Jersey shows the location of Woodbridge.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester; 
The Pros and Cons of Owning a Piece of the Dock

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: CROTON-ON-HUDSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Harvey Shaplow, who lives in this Hudson riverfront village, learned this spring that some of the only dockominiums in the state were for sale at Half Moon Bay Marina next door to where he lives, he bought two of them. Mr. Shaplow, who is not planning to use them himself, said he bought them as "a good investment in tough economic times." 
 "Maybe I'm not going to make a million dollars," Mr. Shaplow said, "but with the way things are these days, I'm doing a lot better than if I put the same money in the stock market." A 35-foot-long dockominium -- the dock and the land under it -- at the Half Moon Bay Marina costs $32,500, and Mr. Shaplow has already found renters who will pay him $3,150 a season for each one. 
 Moreover, the value of his two-bedroom condominium on the waterfront here is enhanced by the availability of a dockominium so close by, realtors say. On the other hand, recent history has shown that in hard times investors may flee from the marina business. 
Half Moon Bay Marina began converting its 173 slips to dockominiums this spring after the offering plan was accepted by the state in March. Almost half of the slips have already been sold. Marissa Piesman, an assistant attorney general, said that dockominiums fell under the same legal category as condominiums. Condos, dockominiums, co-ops and homeowners' associations must be registered with the state attorney general's office in New York.
David Plotkin, who owns the Half Moon Bay Marina, paid $715,000 for the property -- which includes nine underwater acres and less than an acre of shoreline -- at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation auction in 1994. The property had been owned by James Harvey, the original developer of Half Moon Bay Condominiums next door. Mr. Harvey defaulted on his mortgages for the marina and the condos during the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, as did many real estate investors at that time.
The condo project, a separate business entity that has seen a number of development proposals in the last decade, is being completed by Spectrum Skanska of Valhalla as Discovery Cove at Half Moon Bay.
In the late 1990's, as the economy flourished again, the dockominium concept regained popularity, particularly in Florida, North Carolina and California. But in New York, the only other dockominium is the Anchorage Yacht Club in Babylon on Long Island. That one was formed in 1985, along with several others that subsequently failed, according to the attorney general's office.
Howard G. Sheldon, a financial specialist in Roanoke, Va., with First Union National Bank, which handles many mortgage applications for boat slips, predicted the dockominium concept would take off this time around -- "especially since we're only four or five years away from the baby boom retirement era."
"Boats are a great leisure time activity, people need places to keep them, and demand for slips is beginning to overtake supply," said Mr. Sheldon, who has received about 20 mortgage applications in the last six weeks from prospective dock owners at Half Moon Bay, many referred to First Union by the marina owners.
Another factor contributing to the growing popularity of dockominiums is the recent repeal of the federal tax on luxury boats, said Diane DeNardo, an owner of the Palmer Point Marina in Greenwich, Conn., which is the sales and service arm for River Club of Greenwich, a dockominium complex. "In the last two years, boats here started selling like crazy," Ms. DeNardo said. Palmer Point, which was started in the mid-1980's and struggled in its early years, has now sold all 110 of its dockominiums. 
"For a while, we couldn't give the slips away," Ms. DeNardo said. "Now we have waiting lists."
Dockominium buyers can apply for up to a 10-year mortgage -- with the same tax deductions that a conventional mortgage offers -- although interest rates of dockominium loans have been a bit higher lately than on first mortgages for houses, running about 7.9 percent in recent weeks, according to Mr. Sheldon of First Union. Many dockominium buyers like Mr. Shaplow, who own condos nearby, buy the boat slips to increase the value of their land-based property, he said.
BUT Mr. Shaplow, like several others interviewed, paid cash for his two dockominiums. 
And while some use them solely as an investment, others buy them instead of renting to make sure they have a place to keep their boat -- especially as waiting lists for rentals grow longer. Also, owning a dockominium allows a condo owner to sell both at the same time to a potential boat owner.
Like a landowners' condo group, a boat owners' dockominium association can be formed when 15 percent of the slips have been bought. Alan Rothschild, a White Plains lawyer who wrote the offering plan for Half Moon Bay Marina, said dockominium buyers owned the water space and the right to use a specific slip to dock a boat. The dock area, walkway and planks constitute the common area, much as the internal sidewalks, roadways and parking areas of a condo do.
"It's like buying a piece of the Hudson River and land under it, and the dock comes along with it," Mr. Plotkin said. He said monthly maintenance ran about $80 and covered insurance, electricity and maintenance, among other things. Each dockominium includes a hookup for electricity, water, telephone and cable television.
Dockominium owners, like condo owners, are responsible for taxes.
But why have dockominiums been popular elsewhere and so slow to catch on in New York? According to Ms. Piesman at the attorney general's office, few marina owners in the state also own the land under the water, and most have only an easement to the property. It is easier, she said, to become a co-op marina, with a corporation owning or leasing a strip of land, obtaining an easement for use of the water and selling shares to use the docks. Even so, there are only about a dozen of those registered in the state.
But even when they meet all the criteria to convert to dockominiums or a co-op, not all marina owners consider that a wise business decision.
Johanna Giacobbe, who owns the Imperial Yacht Club in New Rochelle, a family-run business with close to 100 slips, said: "We never wanted to convert because that would mean giving over control to someone else, to an association. For now, we're keeping things the way they are."
Also, in at least one state, the concept of private ownership of an area on a body of water is illegal. In Wisconsin, state judges halted a proposed dockominium complex on the basis that is would block public access to the water. The Public Trust Doctrine, a legal principle dating to the Roman Empire, guarantees the public access to the water, holding that air, sea and shore belong not to any one person but to the public at large. Waterfront owners have a right to use the shoreline and access the water, and to build docks and piers as long as the structures do not impede navigation of the river or lake.
MASSACHUSETTS outlawed the concept of dockominiums in 1990, but the state for now is allowing members-only marinas, where a boater pays a fixed amount to join a marina n return for a guaranteed spot to park his boat for 99 years. No ownership deeds are issued to members. Existing dockominiums have been grandfathered.
The future of the dockominium market in New York is difficult to predict, Ms. Piesman said. Clearly, the ability to create new dockominiums will be limited somewhat by the requirement that the land under the water be owned by the individual or company selling the boat slips, she said. "But anything can happen," she added. "Judging by other creative developments we've seen, real estate can sometimes enter the realm of the surreal."

FIRST stop: the Gap for a new pair of jeans. Then on to Claire's Accessories, for makeup and earrings, and possibly a spin through B. Dalton Bookseller to check out the latest fiction. But before leaving the mall, you might want to head downstairs to view the works of a local watercolorist, or take in the Holocaust remembrance exhibition at the Bergen Museum of Art and Science.
 After years of operating out of makeshift county office space and relying on other venues to display its works, the Bergen Museum will soon have a home to call its own -- in the lower level of the Bergen Mall. 
 Maybe this what is meant by mall culture.
The idea of housing a museum inside a mall seems like an obvious choice for Paramus. After all, the American Association of Museums says that elsewhere in the country, there are only two children's museums, two museum satellite branches and one science and art museum situated in malls.
"Paramus doesn't have a town center," said Dorothy Nicklus, first vice president of the Bergen Museum. "Even City Hall and the main post office are off Route 17. So, like in many places, the mall is the town center."
The president of the museum's board, Peter Knipe, who has been pursuing the mall space for the last two years, admits the choice may seem a bit unusual but thinks it is not much different from having a movie theater in a mall.
"Of course, the mall won't have the same economic advantage if we were a movie theater, but the museum will attract people that might not otherwise come to the mall," said Mr. Knipe, who expects to remain at the mall for at least three years. "They can come do some shopping, have dinner and visit the museum."
Not unlike the bones of the two mastodons that are part of its collection, the Bergen Museum has been struggling to piece itself back together since December 1998, when Bergen County reclaimed the 10,000-square-foot space on East Ridgewood Avenue here that it had been providing the museum rent-free for nearly 40 years.
Since then, the museum has been a nomad, presenting occasional shows in municipal buildings, theaters and schools and mounting limited exhibitions in its fifth-floor office space in another county building in Hackensack. With no heating or air-conditioning in the evenings or on weekends, Ms. Nicklus said, it was particularly frustrating trying to get the public to attend shows there, since "the building's doors would lock at 5 p.m., and we would have to use walky-talkies to let people up."
In March, the museum even lost this less-than-desirable space after its lease with the county expired. And while the board was given enough notice to properly pack up the works in Hackensack, the bulk of the museum's 500-piece collection, which was still being stored in Paramus, was crated up by county workers with little care, said Rena Burg, one board trustee.
"They came in with no warning in March and loaded them off to a county storage facility without any attention to the conservation of art," said Ms. Burg.
While the Bergen County freeholder chairman, Anthony Cassano, blamed a communication mix-up for the premature packing, he said that he was "not aware of any major problem."
The museum will have a better idea of the condition of its collection when it begins moving it to the 2,800-square-foot mall space on Sept. 1. Board members do not expect to be ready to open to the public until late October, but the museum will be host to its first annual music and arts festival outside the mall on the weekend of Sept. 14 and 15, to let people know it is back in business and, it is hoped, to begin establishing a regular source of funds.
As a "museum without walls," the Bergen Museum has not been able to qualify for state art financing. And in March did not include any money for it in the current budget. 
Ever the optimist, Mr. Knipe said he hoped that in its new home, the museum -- which is operated with the help of volunteers -- will be able to sustain itself through private resources rather than public funds. Currently the museum has about 600 members, which Mr. Knipe said he expected to triple or quadruple in the next year.
Among its priorities, the museum board is eager to bring home its two mastodon skeletons. Discovered in 1962 during the construction of Route 80, the Hackensack Mastodon is currently on loan to Museum Village in Monroe, N.Y., while the Dwarskill Mastodon, which was discovered in 1973, is on display at the State Museum in Trenton. Mr. Knipe is hoping to display one or both of the partial skeletons at the mall, but because of their size, this might require spilling over into some of the mall's common space.
One other piece of unsettled business is the renowned mural by the Polish artist Stefan Knapp, which belongs to the Bergen Museum and is undoubtedly its most valuable piece. Believed to be the largest enamel mural in the world, the 184-by-50-foot Abstract Impressionist painting graced the side of Alexander's on Route 4 from 1965 until 1998, when the department store was razed. Since then, the mural has been in storage in Carlstadt. And while Mr. Knipe has had conversations with various parties, so far he has no takers for the mural. Among those he approached was Ikea, which is now negotiating building on the space once occupied by Alexander's, although representatives of the home furnishings store were "not very interested," Mr. Knipe said.
"Because it's a very important asset, we couldn't just give the mural away, and Ikea didn't recognize the value of it," he said. For now, the Bergen County icon is being appraised. 
Mr. Knapp's works are on display throughout the world, from the Tate Gallery in London to the Vatican Museum in Rome to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But for anyone wishing to see the Bergen Museum's Knapp mural, they will have to settle for the picture on the museum's Web site, or the reproduction in a local Verizon yellow pages.

HEADLINE: THE ENVIRONMENT; 
Why Was the Spigot On in August?

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S on-again, off-again drought restrictions were on again last week with a statewide ban on all lawn watering and car washing, which left many people asking: Why was the ban lifted at all in a period that Bradley M. Campbell, the commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, said was shaping up as the driest in the state's history?
 "Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions," Mr. Campbell said last Wednesday when he announced the reimposition of the ban on lawn watering and car washing at home. Plants, shrubs and trees can be watered every other day. 
 The announcement gave a herky-jerky feel to the state's drought policies, which depend largely on the imprecise arts of weather forecasting and climatology. This year, rainfall levels declined drastically in the withering heat of July and August -- after the restrictions were eased following the relatively wet months of April, May and June. 
Yet another part of the drought policy is formed in response to the political and economic pressures faced by the region's elected officials.
In one way or another, all these factors have dogged the state throughout the year as Mr. Campbell has sought to come up with a balanced response to the vagaries of the rising tempers of spring and the rising temperatures of midsummer.
In 20-20 hindsight, it seems that all the indicators were there to dictate a clear, singular approach.
In March, Mr. Campbell, along with Governor McGreevey, declared a state drought emergency, noting that New Jerseyans were coming off the driest six-month period in the state's history since 1895.
But then in July, water consumption in the northeast part of the state increased a whopping 100 million gallons a day.
Faced with perilously low reservoir levels in the aftermath of a warm, dry winter -- a total ban was imposed on lawn watering in the northeast and a schedule was drawn up for the less arid central and coastal areas -- allowing households with odd-numbered addresses to water on odd-numbered dates and those with even-numbered addresses to water on even-numbered dates.
Restaurants were told not to provide patrons with water unless it was requested, and hot tubs and pools could only be topped off and not refilled. Car washing -- except for emergency vehicles -- was banned and only commercial car washes using recyclable water could operate.
Those who used more than 100,000 gallons of water a day -- like golf courses, nurseries, automobile plants and utilities -- had their allocations cut 50 percent. Then came an April, with average rainfall and a May and June with rainfall above average.
"There was a three-month period in which things were looking a lot better," said Jeffrey Tittel, executive director of the Sierra Club of New Jersey. "The grass was all green, the climatologists were saying summer would bring average rainfalls, and a lot of wishful thinking set in."
Keith Arnesen, a professor of meteorology at Rutgers University and the assistant state climatologist, said that long-range forecasting was "not very good."
"It is true that we had reached a period where rainfall had returned to normal, but weather doesn't have a memory which dictates that being normal for the last three months means that it will be normal rainfall for the next three," Mr. Arnesen said.
As it was, the three months of rain began just as Mr. Campbell started holding public hearings on what measures to take to ease the dropping water levels. At every stop, said Elaine Makatura, spokeswoman for the environmental agency, he faced angry representatives of the "green industry" -- landscapers, nursery operators and golf course operators -- who complained that their reduced allocations and threatened restrictions would present a financial hardship.
In June, the commissioner eased the restrictions, increasing the allotment of large water users to 80 percent from 50 percent, allowing weekend car washing and odd-even lawn watering statewide. Other restrictions -- like those on restaurants providing water, the filling of swimming pools and controls on other commercial water uses -- remained in place.
"It had everything to do with the fact that we had a period of above-average rainfall and a lot to do with the negative impact it was having on the nursery industry," Ms. Makatura insisted.
Throughout the drought emergency, the McGreevey Administration had shown an acute awareness of the connection between the drought and New Jersey's delicate economic state, said James Sinclair, an environmental expert with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. Early on, Mr. Sinclair said, the environmental agency asked businesses to develop plans for a reduction in water use, and with the latest restrictions asked them to provide an analysis of the economic effect of the rollback.
"The drought is probably not as serious a threat to our state economy as the drought in the 70's was when we were more dependent on manufacturing for jobs," said Mr. Sinclair. "But to Brad Campbell's credit, he has been talking about this and has promised that he would track rainfall carefully in setting restrictions."
But Mr. Tittel of the Sierra Club said that the decision in June to increase commercial allotments was a bad call, running counter to the long-term indications showing the state in a prolonged drought that had persisted from 1998 to 1999, abated in 2000 with Hurricane Floyd, but roared back in 2001.
Still, he said, the McGreevey administration had been faced with the delicate job of juggling the psychology of water restrictions and a sagging economy.
"The McGreevey people have been doing the best that they can given the circumstances, and they probably should have tightened up the restrictions earlier, but that is 20-20 hindsight," said Mr. Tittel. "They are on the other hand trying the longer-term solutions to our water problems such as curbing growth and development and linking up the state's water resources."
Mr. Arnesen, the assistant state climatologist, conceded that there was a risk of "whipsawing people" with the revisions, but added that not to respond to the changes in the weather would have paved the way for even more serious problems.
At the least, the ban on lawn watering can provide quick results. According to Mr. Tittel, a lawn sprinkler running for two hours spouts out more than two inches, or 2,000 gallons, of water -- a significant amount.
In Ridgewood, for instance, the town's water storage last week plunged to 40 percent of normal, prompting town officials to institute a local lawn-watering ban. In just four days of relatively lax enforcement, said Frank Moritz, the town's water director, the amount of water stored doubled to 80 percent. The town had planned to lift its local ban, but the announcement of the statewide restrictions dashed those plans.
But Mr. Arnesen said that rising reservoir levels and increased water storage did not solve the more serious and long-term problem of coping with the drought. He likened the state to a sponge that has been just sprinkled with water, noting that while softness on the surface represented the reservoirs, the core of the sponge representing the subterranean aquifer remained hard and dry.
"Still, I think in this day and time letting your lawn go brown is actually performing a community service," Mr. Tittel said.
He might get an argument from Dan Schapiro, a Ridgewood homeowner who has lavished attention on his lush, green 50-by-100-foot lawn over the last months.
"It's upsetting after putting in all of the work I did since April," said Mr. Schapiro, a textile company owner whose lawn will soon become an expanse of withered browner. "The only consolation, I guess, is that the lawn can come back green as ever next year."
For Terry Bannon, the general manager of the Rancocas Golf Club in Willingboro, the drought restrictions that cut his water allotment by half have already "changed the way we do business." Even with the increased allotment in June, the club still watered only the greens, tees and fairways, leaving the rough to go brown. But the diminished allotment, along with the heat and scant rainfall -- is beginning to stress even the areas that they are watering.
"In other years they have imposed restrictions, but no one did much enforcement," he said. "This time its different, and the state regulators are all over us." --------------------

Utilities Barred from Cutting Service
NEWARK, (AP) -- State regulators last week barred utilities from shutting off delinquent customers' power when temperatures of 95 degrees or higher are forecast within 24 hours.
The emergency measure, effective for the next 60 days, is intended to guard the health of frail, elderly and other residents vulnerable to extreme heat, by ensuring that they can run their fans or air-conditioners even when they cannot pay their bills.

Why New Yorkers Loved the Babe

 BODY:
YANKEES CENTURY: 100 Years Of New York Yankees Baseball
Text by Glenn Stout

Houghton Mifflin
($35, hardcover)
 New York City was precisely the right place for Ruth. The dual tragedies of the war and the recent plague of Spanish influenza, which killed half a million Americans, had left the nation saddened and pessimistic. But now society was on the rebound, the postwar economy was booming, lifestyles were changing, and Americans were ready to cut loose and have some fun. 
 New York City emerged in the 1920's as the nation's commercial and cultural center. And Ruth was New York incarnate -- uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable. He towered over baseball like the Manhattan skyline. Compared to Ruth, all else was in shadow.
His doughy face, dark, broad features, and massive torso drew fans toward him. The simple fact that he was neither English nor Irish made it easy for fans of other ethnicities to identify with him, and New York City, more than ever before, was still a city of immigrants, a place they had made their own. Manhattan was more than Fifth Avenue and Wall Street. The heart of the city was where the people lived, in dozens of ethnic enclaves such as Little Italy, Hell's Kitchen and Chinatown.
Ruth was one of them, a street urchin raised in a Baltimore orphanage. His behavioral incorrigibility somehow made him even more endearing, because Ruth, despite his many personal faults, was never cruel. There was no malice in his behavior, simply unchecked enthusiasms run amuck.

RESCUING THE WORLD: The Life and Times Of Leo Cherne
By Andrew F. Smith
State University of New York Press
($26.50, hardcover)
Cherne's first year at New York University was actually spent in an annex at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Building. He had no serious academic orientation, and he found the courses unstimulating with two exceptions. One was an English class, in which he was required to write a paper. At the time, Prohibition was still the law of the land, and Cherne noted that newspapers were filled with stories about deaths on the Bowery as a result of the illegal sale of "smoke," a mixture of wood alcohol and water, which had a smoky appearance. It sold for 15 cents a bottle -- sometimes just a dime. Every morning ambulances would arrive on the Bowery and cart away the bodies. Some victims needed medical treatment, but many died from alcohol poisoning. Cherne convinced Lillian Herlends, his English teacher, to give him credit to live for a month on the Bowery and write up the experience, provided that a newspaper agreed to publish his stories. The editors he approached at The Daily Mirror bought the idea.
Cherne lived on the Bowery disguised as a bum frequenting speakeasies. He reported daily the addresses of the places that sold smoke, which The Daily Mirror dutifully published. The police read the stories and raided the speakeasies identified in Cherne's articles. This had two results: the speakeasies threw comatose bodies into the alleys behind their establishments rather than out the front door, where they would have been visible; and every proprietor on the Bowery began looking for the informer. At first Cherne had been able to order smoke and spill it out without drinking it, but as things heated up, he had to drink what he ordered. He remained on the Bowery for 10 days, living in flophouses. One morning, he awoke to find himself piled with the others in the back of a speakeasy. He'd had enough. The Daily Mirror was happy with the results and his teacher gave him an A+.

MY LIFE IN THE NYPD: JIMMY THE WAGS
By James Wagner
With Patrick Picciarelli
Onyx
($5.99, paperback)
Ninth Precinct cops had a reputation for being wild men. More often than not, any high-crime command was a world unto itself. Rules generally didn't apply in precincts where walking to your radio car at the start of a tour could turn into a near-death experience. We made up our own rules as we went along.
Wild parties, drinking on duty, brutality, and a sloppy appearance were generally accepted in a ghetto command, as long as you got the job done. Parties were a safety valve to let off steam. Drinking on duty prepared us for the after-work parties. (Why waste valuable minutes getting a buzz on your own time?)
In the 70's it was commonplace -- indeed, accepted -- to slap around prisoners and other miscreants who gave us a hard time. The cops were greatly outnumbered, and if for one moment the street people thought you were soft, you'd pay the price with a garbage can thrown from a roof or a direct confrontation on the street. The tougher you were, the more respected you were in your sector. . . . 
Captain Baker was determined to change our image by implementing rules that would have met with resistance even from the Royal Guard at Windsor Castle.
"Men," he said at his first roll call, "from here on in every officer in this command will wear a hat when outside the radio car." I hadn't seen my hat in weeks. "Two, no smoking in uniform, no drinking in uniform, and above all, I want a greater amount of respect shown to the citizens of this command."
Citizens? I thought. I had recently locked up a 15-year-old kid for setting his parents on fire -- this shortly after someone tried to blow up my radio car with a homemade bomb. No, Captain Baker had to go, but first we had to find where he was most vulnerable.

FOR THE SINS OF MY FATHER: A Mafia Killer, His Son And the Legacy of a Mob Life
By Albert DeMeo
Broadway Books
($24.95, hardcover)
I already knew that there were two White Houses in America. One was the White House we talked about at school, where President Carter lived. Anybody could visit that place. The White House my father was taking me to was the place where Paul Castellano lived. Paul Castellano was ii capo di tutti cappi, the boss of bosses, godfather and chosen heir to Carlo Gambino. Big Paul was at least as powerful in the underworld as the president was in the world of international politics. The Castellano White House was a private place, and only the inner circle could go there. My father was now a part of that circle.

HEADLINE: COPING; 
Rooting for a Recession in the East Village

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS; E-mail: jacobsa@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"CRASH! Crash! Crash!"
 That's the chant my cash-poor friends and I have been secretly invoking, a cynical, self-serving prayer aimed at the Big Guy in the Sky who holds sway over the stock market. You see, after a decade of depressing excess, we were hoping that a dive-bombing Dow would quell the soaring rents and boutique-ization that has turned our beloved East Village into an alcohol-soaked playland for dot-com millionaires, carousing N.Y.U. students and those who love them. We had a dream that the recession would bring back the cheap pirogi joints, $600 studios and the charming anarchy of Avenue B. 
 Fat chance. 
Rents dipped briefly after Sept. 11 but, like the markets, they're on the rise again, with subway-car-size flats in my neglected tenement going for $2,000. The New Theater Building, a luxury condominium that mockingly shadows its low-rise neighbors, was sold out even before the frosted windows obscured its guarded lobby. St. Marks, that chaotic jumble of tattoo parlors, secondhand CD shops and panhandling skinheads, will never be the same once a developer finishes renovating the blue elephant that once housed Andy Warhol's Electric Circus. Every week, it seems, another cherished merchant is replaced by the likes of Alpha Fine Foods, a purveyor of British muesli ($5 a bag) and strawberry Italian balsamic vinegar ($9) across from Tompkins Square Park, that former crucible of social tumult. The rest of the Lower East Side, increasingly pocked with mojito lounges and 50's furniture stores, is not far behind.
"The yuppies have wiped out a wonderful culture of artists and those with a political consciousness," said John Penley, a battle-scarred photojournalist who has lived there for two decades. 
Not that the changes have been all bad. For one thing, the East Village is cleaner and less menacing than it was in the late 1970's and 1980's, when my generation discovered a neighborhood that had been left for dead, its streets awash with crack addicts and homeless people. I'll be the first to admit that I patronize some of the new bistros that dot Alphabet City, although I do so with the requisite liberal guilt. 
But I still seethe at the changes, and try to fathom why moneyed folk want to live in these grimy fluorescent-lighted walkups. "Why?" asked Gene Martinez, a broker at the Corcoran Group, which sells million-dollar homes on Avenue D. "Because it's cool. It's about living on the edge, being Bohemian, but with lots of money." 
Mr. Martinez's hypothesis was partly borne out the other day as I walked past the boarded-up remains of Charas/El Bohio, the iconic cultural center on East Ninth Street that housed artists and activists until Mayor Giuliani sold it to a developer. Across the street, resting on the loading deck of their U-Haul, two weary newcomers explained why they had given up comfortable lives in Madison, Wis., for a cramped $1,925-a-month apartment on a block once famous for heroin outlets. "It's sexy, the drinks are cheaper and it's safe," said Ali Tonn, 26, whose hair was dyed a dull orange. "Everywhere else in the city seemed so boring." 
Both Ms. Tonn and her friend have already found work at a nonprofit arts group. But to make the rent, they'll both need supplemental waitress jobs. They may not be fiery socialist squatters, but in some ways, they are not unlike the earlier youthful strivers who brought color and creative buzz to the neighborhood. 
Last week's news that the Bloomberg administration will sell 11 buildings to a group of homesteaders is further proof that all is not lost. And as long as New York's rent laws remain in place, thousands of other old-timers -- aging hippies, undiscovered artists and assorted outcasts -- will help keep some intensity in the East Village.
Then there are the weekly protests each Saturday night at Avenue A and East Seventh Street, where the police and protesters clashed more than a decade ago. Organized by a hardy band of antiestablishment agitators, the Speak Outs, who have been drawing scores of people who sing ditties like "Die, Yuppie Scum" and shout unkind words at the diners at Leshko's, a retro-chic restaurant that appropriated the name and space of a treasured Ukrainian coffee shop. 
Now in their fourth week, the protests began after recent incidents in the park, including a police crackdown on quality-of-life offenses and the arrival of a Haagen-Dazs "sculptural pavilion" that sold $3 scoops of ice cream. Mr. Penley, an organizer, said he had been heartened by the turnout, but acknowledged that no amount of angry foot-stomping can kill the gentrification beast. 
"I guess our only hope," he said, "is that the stock market tanks."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
When Times Are Hard, Household Names Shine

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
COMPANIES that make basic consumer products like lipstick, shampoo and razor blades have been proving their worth as bedrock investments.
 Carol Warner Wilke, household products and cosmetics analyst at Merrill Lynch, talked last week about the outlook for the dozen companies she follows. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. How vulnerable are the companies you follow to turns in the economy?

A. For the most part, the current slowdown has not really had an impact on them. When they are challenged, it is more a company-specific sort of story. During the current slowdown, for example, Estee Lauder has seen a significant impact in its department store sales.

Q. A couple of years ago, when the economy, technology and telecom were booming, these stocks were getting slammed. Why?

A. A couple of years ago, this group was having a really tough time. Part of the problem was technology, which was very popular. But most of the challenges they were dealing with were company-specific.
There were management shake-ups at companies like Procter & Gamble, Avon and Gillette. Some acquisitions didn't work out. And some challenging external conditions made the problems well up. 
But over the past 9 to 12 months there has been a significant improvement in execution. Procter & Gamble's new chief executive has spent the last two years revamping the company, and earnings growth has beaten expectations three out of the last four quarters. 
Avon is another example. Andrea Jung took over there in November of 1999 and since then has refocused on the direct-selling business. Avon has met or exceeded expectations for 10 straight quarters.

Q. What shape are these companies in?

A. I am positive on the group. Cash flow and earnings are strong. The quality of earnings is high, balance sheets have improved significantly, the currency situation on the whole is positive and they are well positioned to pick up growth outside the United States. To me, that is pretty appealing.

Q. Historically, what sort of growth rates have these companies achieved?

A. On average, earnings tend to grow about 10 percent a year. Revenues tend to grow about 4 percent. They are not superfast growers. That is not what you buy these companies for.
The market is not concerned about superfast growth. It has shown it is more concerned about a company setting a realistic goal and meeting it. The market rewards steady, consistent growth.

Q. Are the stocks trading at historically high price-to-earnings multiples?

A. Through last Tuesday, on average, the stock price of the group was up 7 percent so far this year, versus quite a big decline for the major market averages. Every company is outperforming every index.
Typically, these stocks have traded at a premium to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. But right now almost every name is trading at a discount to its 5-year and 10-year price-to-earnings ratio. That is a function of the market. I don't assume the stocks will get back to their all-time-high price-to- earnings ratios, but back to their average. 

Q. At the moment, which company has the best new-product pipeline?

A. Looking at the whole universe, the company that has the most momentum in terms of new products and initiatives is Avon.
Estee Lauder always has a host of new products. Colgate-Palmolive has some big new products coming in the fall. Procter & Gamble has been very focused on new products in their big brands, like their Crest business. And a year ago they launched a new line of diapers and training pants in Europe.

Q. Which companies are your favorites, and which are you cautious about?

A. I don't own any of these companies, but the two stocks I like the most are Avon and Procter & Gamble.
Avon's top-line growth is at least twice the group average, and earnings have been very consistent and consistently higher. 
Procter is very much back on track. Their earnings quality has improved significantly, they have streamlined manufacturing and are getting higher utilization rates out of their existing plants. Their goal is to focus on health care and beauty care, which are higher-margin and less capital-intensive businesses. 
Clorox is a company I am not positive on and have rated a hold. The stock is fairly fully valued. Its challenge is the business in which it participates: home cleaning. They have lower top-line growth than the others in the group. They have done a great job of improving their balance sheet and cash flow, but my concerns have to do with what their growth can be, given their business mix.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for DEBRA L. DUNN; 
Why It's Worth Taking the Heat

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
THROUGH much of this week and next, a large group of politicians, professors, environmentalists, economists and such, representing developed and developing countries, will converge on the Earth Summit sponsored by the United Nations in Johannesburg to discuss how to protect natural resources while expanding economies.
 Also participating will be executives from dozens of big corporations. They'll be there ostensibly to see how their companies can best help advance the worldwide push toward "sustainable development," a catchphrase for raising incomes and standards of living without depleting resources or sullying the environment. If the past is any indication, advocates of environmental and social welfare causes will protest the practices of these same companies. 
 So why do the companies attend, subjecting themselves to such public criticism? Don't they have their hands full buoying their stock prices, calming their shareholders, holding on to their customers and otherwise hanging on in this turbulent economy?
Debra L. Dunn, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the Hewlett-Packard Company and one of its delegates to the conference, tried to explain. She spoke in a telephone interview last Thursday. CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

Q. Wouldn't it be easier to just avoid this event?

A. Not if you take a long-term view of success. You can either hide from criticism or engage in dialogue that will move things forward. We can give specific examples of projects we've done in places like India and Senegal, in which we use communications technology to promote literacy and create jobs. And we can learn what other companies and governments have done. It makes no sense to keep relearning from scratch things that others learned before you.

Q. Do you think the much-publicized corporate scandals of this year will be a cloud over the American delegates' heads?

A. It will certainly come up, and I think it's important that we all address it. We can provide some reassurance to the world that we have internal mechanisms in place that will avoid the kind of alleged surprises that happened at Enron. After all, they have a real stake in this -- if your company is the source of jobs and taxes and it implodes, you're creating a huge economic issue.

Q. But aren't you afraid you will come across as the ugly Americans, shoving technology and methods at other cultures in the guise of charity, paying low wages, taking profits out and leaving a trail of pollution in your wake?

A. We've always been careful to enlist local governments and agencies and even companies as co-sponsors of any project we do. We never say, "This is our philanthropic solution." We say, "How can we use our talents and technology to jointly solve a problem?" For example, we recently provided Internet access to some remote villages in India that are two hours away from our nearest plant, but their local governments were eager participants in the project.
And while we certainly do not pay U.S. wage rates in developing countries, we do pay fair wages for those areas. There's an important line between exploiting and bringing in jobs and paying taxes. And we are all making progress on solving environmental problems.

Q. What emerging markets are particularly important to you right now?

A. India, China and Brazil are high on our list, both as places to make products and to sell them. They have lots of people, of course, and particularly in India and China, they have a real thirst for technology.

Q. Can the statements that often come out of a forum like this really do anything to benefit those countries or to help you build a business in them?

A. Stating goals and policies can be important in terms of setting targets to shoot at. And you make connections with people at forums like this, so that you can leverage everyone's expertise and really boost the impact that communications technology has on economic development.

 New York, D.C.?

Q. To show support for New York after Sept. 11, Congress is meeting here on Sept. 6 for the first time since 1790, but why did it leave New York in the first place?

A. When the first Congress met at Federal Hall in Lower Manhattan in August 1789, one of its first orders of business was to find a new location. Southern states did not like having their country's capital in what Thomas Jefferson, a Virginian, once called "a cloacina of all the depravities of human nature."
 As far as they were concerned, the city was too concerned with wealth, too immoral and too British. But New Yorkers liked having their city as the nation's capital and were in no rush to move it. One New Yorker, Alexander Hamilton, saw the schism as his opportunity.
Hamilton wanted the states' Revolutionary debts assumed by the almost-bankrupt Federal government, as a way to establish its credit. Northern states, heavily in debt, supported the idea, while the Southern states, whose debts were smaller, opposed it.
Jefferson and Hamilton made a deal: Jefferson would support the debt takeover and get Southern representatives to follow, if Hamilton agreed to move the capital south to some swampland being developed on the Potomac River, after a layover in Philadelphia while the city was being built.
On Aug. 12, 1790, Congress met in New York for the last time, and the move set the stage for something not seen in the European motherlands: a country with two capitals, one political and one cultural and economic.
Abigail Adams, wife of Vice President John Adams, might have seen this coming. When informed of the new location of the capital she noted, "When all is done it will not be Broadway."

Library Leos

Q. I know the lions outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue are named Patience and Fortitude, but how did they get those names?

A. Actually, the lions have no official names at all, but they have gone through a few nicknames since they first took up their perch when the main New York Public Library was opened in 1911. In the 1930's, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia christened the lions with their best-known nicknames, Patience and Fortitude. Those were the qualities, Mayor La Guardia believed, that would enable New Yorkers to survive the Great Depression.
The lions were sculptured by Edward Clark Potter and sit outside the library's main entrance, Patience on the south side and Fortitude to the north. When the library opened, the lions were called Leo Astor and Leo Lenox after two library founders, John Jacob Astor and James Lenox. Those names eventually became Lord Astor and Lady Lenox before La Guardia provided the nicknames that have lasted until this day.
So synonymous are the lions with the library that they their image is a registered trademark of the New York Public Library.

Life-Saving Initials

Q. I've seen sealed buildings in New York with "R.O." painted on them. What does this marking mean?

A. The letters stand for "roof open," according to a Fire Department spokesman, Capt. William VanWart, and they are there to let firefighters know if there are any holes in the building's roof that would allow smoke to escape. The letters usually accompany a painted box, which also tells firefighters the conditions of the floors in the buildings.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Cost-Cutting Can Start A Ruinous Circle

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
IN Alice in Wonderland fashion, we talk of expansion and ignore the contraction all around us. We convince ourselves that out of cost-cutting will come prosperity. But while cost-cutting can lift a single company or two, when practiced widely enough it can pull down an economy. And that is happening today.
 Few economists acknowledge this dynamic. Corporate cost-cutting and labor-saving layoffs appear in the forecasts as the golden road to greater productivity and rising profits. Never mind that we have just fired the workers and extinguished the salaries that would have been spent on the merchandise and services to fatten the profits. With sales revenue failing to rise, we cut costs more. The process feeds on itself -- until there are not enough workers and salaries left to generate sales and profits. 
 There is hyperbole in this description, but not much. As a nation, we are caught in the strangest and perhaps most perilous recovery since the Depression -- featuring a dynamic that William Dudley, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs, characterizes as "the corporate paradox of thrift."
"If everyone tries to cut costs and save more, no one saves more," he said. "If you and everyone else cut costs, costs do indeed go down, but revenue also goes down, so profits eventually go down, too. Collectively, we can't cut our way to prosperity."
Individual companies -- defending themselves, not the economy -- have good reason to throw themselves into this behavior. In one profit report after another this summer, the story has been the same: Sales revenue was flat or barely rose in the second quarter, but don't worry, profits were up. Cost-cutting and labor-saving efficiencies fattened the bottom line, and revenue will soon rise as lower costs allow us to cut prices and take sales away from competitors. 
That is fine, for a while, for the winning company. But consider what happens in an imaginary country where Burger King and McDonald's are the entire business sector and the total national output -- 100 hamburgers a day, evenly divided between the companies -- matches the demand from this nation's consumers. Demand and sales revenue, however, stay flat. So Burger King lays off two workers and uses the saved wages partly to fatten profits and partly to discount prices by just enough to take sales and revenue away from McDonald's. And McDonald's responds in kind. 
But soon, the four laid-off workers, with little income, buy fewer hamburgers, and the nation's total consumption drops to 95 hamburgers a day. That sets off another round of cost-cutting and price discounting, and our imaginary nation sinks gradually into stagnation or deep recession not unlike America in the 1930's. 
Why isn't that danger uppermost in everyone's mind? Why are forecasters like James Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, so optimistic? In a nutshell, they expect an infusion of demand from somewhere that will reverse the cost-cutting and persuade companies to expand investment, production and hiring. Their main hopes are more tax cuts, more growth in federal spending and more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They also count on people to finance consumption by continuing to extract equity from their homes, which are still rising in value.
Mainly, though, it is stimulus from Washington that for Mr. Glassman will save the day. "If Washington cannot get us moving toward full employment within a year," he said, "then there will be more federal stimulus. We have learned a lot since the Depression about how to fix the economy." 
BUT perhaps not enough. Perhaps we have become too accustomed to the other post-World War II recoveries, which were so different. There were no excesses to overcome from a stock market bubble and an insane rush by business to expand far beyond demand. Instead, when consumption rose, there was shortage and rising prices. To control inflation, the Fed pushed up interest rates. In response, consumption subsided, provoking a recession -- until rates came down and pent-up demand reasserted itself. Business stepped up investment to keep output abreast of demand, and recovery was on its way.
In the current cycle, however, consumption -- particularly for cars, housing and appliances -- never tapered off from very high levels during the nine-month recession that started in January of last year. It has still not tapered off, but it is not rising, either, and that is a problem. Recovery requires increased consumption and business investment to make the economy grow. The danger today is that demand will decline instead, and recession will return -- or there will be prolonged stagnation. Unfortunately, Mr. Dudley's "corporate paradox of thrift" is pushing hard in that direction.

HEADLINE: The F-Cars, From A to Z28 

BYLINE:  By NORMAN S. MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
 HERE are highlights in the development of General Motors' F-body pony cars:

APRIL 17, 1964 -- Lee A. Iacocca, general manager of the Ford Division, introduces a small sporty car built largely with parts from the Falcon compact. "Mustang fever" grips the nation as a new automotive category, dubbed the pony car, is born. More than 400,000 Mustangs are sold within 12 months.

SEPT. 26, 1966 -- Chevrolet's answer to the Mustang, the Camaro, is introduced with a base price of $2,466.

FEB. 23, 1967 -- The Firebird, developed under John Z. DeLorean, Pontiac's general manager, goes on sale.

1968 -- A Camaro driven by Mark Donohue wins the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am championship.

1969 -- Chevrolet builds a short run of Camaros with aluminum-block 427 engines, but the $4,160 ZL-1 option more than doubles the car's price. Only 69 are built.

1969 -- The Firebird Trans Am makes its debut. Figuring on a limited appeal, Pontiac agrees to pay the S.C.C.A. $5 a car for rights to the name, a decision that ends up costing millions of dollars.

FEBRUARY 1970 -- The second generation of the F-cars comes to market. A legend is born when the Camaro Z28 is fitted with the 360-horsepower LT-1 engine.

1972 -- A 117-day strike strands 1,100 partly assembled vehicles at a plant in Ohio. The cars are unable to meet bumper regulations that took effect during the shutdown, and all are scrapped.

1973 -- After much internal debate, an eye-catching graphic spreads its wings across the Trans Am's hood. It quickly becomes known as the Thunder Chicken.

1974 -- The Camaro Z28, emasculated by emissions controls, is dropped.

1977-83 -- Popular Burt Reynolds movies showcase the Firebird, including "Hooper" and the "Smokey and the Bandit" series. Sales soar with each sequel.

1977 -- The Camaro Z28 returns, albeit with a dishrag rating of 185 horsepower.

1978 -- T-tops -- roofs with removable glass panels -- endear the F-cars to the "Saturday Night Fever" set.

1979 -- Combined Camaro and Firebird sales set a record: 494,025.

1980 -- "Rockford Files" ends its six-year NBC run. James Garner played a private eye; a gold Firebird was his sidekick.

1982 -- The F-cars are redesigned, and reach a performance nadir. A four-cylinder engine is offered for the first time, with just 90 -- count 'em -- horsepower.

1985 -- A deal to supply cars for the International Race of Champions series results in the IROC-Z Camaro package.

1987 -- KITT, bionic Firebird of "Knight Rider," is parked after five years of flexing its Super Pursuit Mode and Passive Laser Restraint System on TV.

1993 -- Fourth-generation F-cars arrive. Production shifts to Ste. Therese, Quebec.

1996 -- Performance options raise power levels past the 300 mark (on the Camaro SS and Firebird WS6 Ram Air) for the first time since the early 1970's.

1998 -- The Corvette's all-aluminum LS-1 engine makes its debut in the F-cars.

AUG. 28, 2002 -- The last of the Camaros and Firebirds are to roll off the line as G.M. puts the cars "on hiatus." The 325-horsepower finale delivers the performance of the early days but with respectable fuel economy of up to 28 m.p.g.

HEADLINE: Children Of the Night; 
Snug in bed? No. Like New York's adults, its kids are often up and about in the wee hours.

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
THEY are a fixture of night in the city, just like the colored lights on the Empire State Building and the Mexicans who tend flowers at 24-hour delis. Young children, up late.
 The phenomenon is clear to anyone who visits the city's streets, subways, stores and fast-food restaurants after 10 p.m. Summer is prime time for the wee hours, and the city that never sleeps is filled with children who seem not to sleep enough. 
 Late August is also when school looms and, experts say, when parents most need to ease their children into earlier bedtimes. But schoolbooks were a distant thought at 1:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday in Times Square. 
On that night, seven cousins, 3 to 15, transformed the corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue into a playground as they laughed, shouted and swung from low-hanging scaffolding. Supervising the rowdily friendly bunch was their grandmother, Shirley Ann Quintero, and her husband, Jose Saavedra.
"When I was little, my dad used to bring me out to play the arcades in Times Square, so I decided to bring my kids out and do the same thing," said Ms. Quintero, who lives in the same building as her charges on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The special occasion justified the late hours, she said.
As the Quintero clan swung from the scaffolding, Ahmed Farraj, 10, and his family entered a nearby subway station. They had just been to see the movie "Signs" and were headed home to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Despite the late hour, Ahmed was not tired, he said.
"You know why?" he asked. "Because the lights, they're too shiny, and it looks like it is not even dark yet. It looks like it's the morning."
In Astoria, Queens, Yehia Ghazi, a gregarious Egyptian immigrant, also understands the powerful draw of the city's bright lights. "I love the night," he said. His children, Khalid, 7, and Khloud, 5, are also developing a taste for it. "They go to bed at 12:30 or 1" on school nights, he said. "If you wake up at 7:30, that's enough sleep." During the summer, he added, they are up even later.
There have been no studies of the sleep habits of the youngest New Yorkers. Impressions can be misleading, too, and not just because a late night may be a rarity rather than a routine. A child playing outside an apartment building late at night will be seen by hundreds; a suburban child logging onto the Internet from a bedroom is nearly invisible. Also, naturally, there are plenty of New York City homes where early bedtimes are alive and well.
Still, experts offer several reasons why early bedtimes for children may be scarcer in New York than elsewhere. 
For starters, city dwellers have always been night owls. "There's more competition for sleep" in urban areas, said Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Pediatric Sleep Disorders Clinic at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I. "It's much more of an artificial environment. There's stuff going on 24 hours a day. Stores are open, parents are working. There's just much less reliance on your natural circadian rhythms."
At most hours of the night, New Yorkers can buy books, rent videos, work out, eat Korean barbecue, even be arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court, which is open all night three nights a week.
For workers, too, New York is a sleepless town. "New York City has more 24-hour operations than your average city," said Dr. Jack Connolly, president of Shiftwork Consultants, a firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that advises around-the-clock businesses. 
Bodega and transit workers are obvious examples, but old-school manufacturers, like the Domino Sugar plant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, also tend to run all night. Even for lawyers, secretaries and others who work regular hours, ambitious New York is just not a 9 to 5 place.
"The economy doesn't close down at night," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "So what's happened is that many parents do not come home until late in the evening and that's when they spend time with their kids, doing chores, helping with homework or shopping."
These urban characteristics are accompanied by other, more general social pressures that can mean less sleep for children, from the trend to more homework to the multiplying number of computer games and television shows. Combined, these forces raise the specter that bedtimes for city children, already late, may grow later.

Busy Parents, Busy Children
Dr. Laura Popper, an associate professor at Mount Sinai Medical School and a pediatrician who primarily deals with upper-middle-class families in her private practice, often observes busy parents trying to carve out time to spend with equally busy children.
"If you're an investment banker and work incredibly long hours," she said, "something's going to have to give." Even for parents who achieve what experts advise -- giving elementary-school children regular bedtimes and 9 to 11 hours of sleep a night -- the task can be exhausting.
Liz Swig, who lives on the Upper East Side, feels lucky if she can get her sons, Simon, 11, and Oliver, 7, to bed at 10 and 9:30, respectively. They do not frequent the streets or play many video games; their lives are just busy. Between the two, there's tennis two days a week, soccer, art class and Hebrew school. Last year, Simon had up to an hour and a half of homework as a fifth grader at the Horace Mann School, in Riverdale in the Bronx. Oh, and there is the small matter of eating dinner.
"There's no time for them to try to just chill out," Ms. Swig said. "Conceptually, children need their sleep. But it's very hard to do it."
By the time Simon's daily whirlwind is done, it's almost 10, but Ms. Swig allows him to stay up a little longer.
"Don't you think he deserves downtime?" she asked. "Don't you think he deserves the equivalent of his glass of wine a day?"
Like the Swigs, many parents, especially in middle-class neighborhoods, list a litany of school and extracurricular activities. But even when they are done, bedtime is not necessarily quick in coming. "I see kids who really are burdened with hours and hours and hours of work," Dr. Popper said. "They really can't wind down from it, so they're awake." Experts say quiet time before bed is important for good rest.

The Night Shift
Daysi Melendez can understand these pressures. A Honduran immigrant raising three children on her own, Ms. Melendez works 4 to 10 p.m. three days a week in a Laundromat in Park Slope, Brooklyn. On her days off, she insists that the kids be in bed by 9. But when she works, it is not until 10:45 or so that she picks them up at the baby sitter's house in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where Ms. Melendez lives.
She says she knows this pattern is not good for the children, that they may not be able to concentrate in school. "The poor kids go to bed at midnight, by the time they take a bath and I change them," she said. "It's hard, but it's necessary. It's temporary, just for now." 
But there is nothing temporary about the work schedule of Mr. Ghazi. "All my life I work nights," he said, adding that he always will. When his family first joined him from Egypt in 2000, he drove a bakery truck on the 2-a.m.-to-noon shift. The only time he had for his family was at night before work, and the kids often stayed up until he left. He would teach them English words or tell them stories in Arabic.
Now Mr. Ghazi works in an East Village restaurant, Sahara East, from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. He sees his children when they come home from school and on Monday, his day off. But the family's late nights continue.
On a recent Monday evening, Mr. Ghazi and his wife, Amal Monsor, were in their small three-bedroom apartment on a quiet Astoria street. It was 11 p.m., and the two children were sitting on the couch, watching an Egyptian movie on satellite television. The living room was decorated with images of Ramses and Nefertiti, enlarged passages from the Koran and eight clocks. 
In the next hour and a half, Khalid played the video game "Fighting Force 2" on his Playstation, studied his Pokemon cards and tuned in stations on his Walkman. Khloud lay on her parents' bed, flipped through Dr. Seuss's "Foot Book" and played with stuffed animals, including a gorilla, a baby giraffe and an eyeless Kermit the Frog.
The children were energetic and adorable, but they began to falter by 12:30 a.m. Drifting toward the bedroom where they share a colorful bunk bed, they began looking through a collection of picture books.
At 12:50 a.m., back in the living room, Khloud announced she wanted to go to sleep, but with a catch. She wanted her older brother to come to bed too. Khalid was not tired, but Mr. Ghazi ordered him to go with Khloud wait until she fell asleep and then come back. Khloud collapsed on the lower bunk, face down. Khalid leaned against the yellow bunk ladder, reading "Huggly's Snow Day." The eyeless Kermit sat in the corner. About 1:15, after a brief return to the living room when his sister had dropped off, Khalid went to bed.
Such patterns are familiar to Dr. Owens. She has studied the sleep habits of lower-income children from the Providence area, and said her findings also apply to New York and other big cities with large immigrant populations.
"A large number of these kids have parents working two jobs or three jobs, and many working a night shift," Dr. Owens said. "There isn't anybody to supervise bedtime, and bedtime in the families isn't really a structured concept."
Such a pattern can be a problem. A recent study of 187 elementary-school children in two-parent homes by Dr. Jodi Mindell, associate director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, shows that children's sleep is affected in families in which at least one parent does not work a typical 9-to-5 day.

Summer in the City
On a recent hot evening in Washington Heights, kids swarmed outside, riding scooters, sitting on stoops, eating Chinese takeout and playing basketball.
The Heights is one of the city's most densely populated neighborhoods, so for every kid in the street after midnight there were probably many more tucked in bed. But the sheer number of kids outside in this area on a steamy night makes every corner look like a day care center. On some blocks, speakers blare merengue or bachata so loud from windows that it is hard to imagine anybody inside the building asleep.
You are never too young to join this party. About midnight on a recent Sunday, three strollers stood unoccupied at Audubon Avenue and 178th Street. They belonged to Shaunoly Perez, 2; Justin Minaya, 1; and Aliyah Beltre, 1. With encouragement from her mother, Valerie Malave, Aliyah wiggled her hips to a merengue song by Sergio Vargas. The children's parents and grandparents egged her on, and Aliyah smiled. 
Asked why Shaunoly was not in bed, her mother, Charo Perez, was defensive. "Today's the only day she's breaking night, so I can spend some time with my parents," she said, saying Shaunoly's usual bedtime is around 10.
This scene is at once strange and familiar to Jose Beltre, Aliyah's father. He grew up in Washington Heights and remembers wishing his parents would go upstairs so he could go to sleep. But since he moved, things are different. "I live in Florida and I don't see my neighbors," he said.
His wife, Ms. Malave, added, "There's not really that hanging out that you do here." 
A few blocks away, Henry Sanchez made the rounds on his scooter, despite the occasional admonition from his father, Luis, to stay nearby. Many members of the Sanchez family were gathered outside their Audubon Avenue building.
"Let's consider something," Mr. Sanchez said when asked about the street scene. "The heat. Not everyone has their little air-conditioner." 
Church is another reason for staying up late. In Washington Heights and other immigrant and minority neighborhoods, some children attend Pentecostal churches on weekday evenings. The Rev. Adalberto De Jesus of the Church of God, on Crotona Avenue near East Tremont Avenue in the East Tremont area of the Bronx, said that years ago he scaled back his Wednesday services to end no later than 9:45 p.m. He wanted the children, usually about a third of his 30 or 35 Wednesday worshipers, to return home.
But, he said, many other churches are not as conscientious. "I don't think they realize the full negative effect that is happening," he said. "On the other hand, if you're going to weigh the positive and the negative, there are more positives than negatives from the effect church has on children."
Staying up late in the summer is not a big problem, Dr. Mindell said, as long as the child does not have to wake up early for camp or day care and gets enough sleep over all.
But, she warned, children who make a quick switch as school starts will have troubles. "Parents need to realize that the transition cannot happen overnight from a summer sleep schedule to a school sleep schedule," she said. She compared it to jet lag after flying from California to New York.
"With some of these kids," she added, "it's more like they're on Hawaii time."

A Close-Out Chain Has Been Opening Eyes on Wall St.

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO 

 BODY:
IN another sign that Wall Street is worried about the economy, the nation's largest chain of close-out stores is one of the year's hottest stocks.
 Big Lots, based in Columbus, Ohio, has logged one of the best performance in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index so far in 2002, rising 64 percent, to close at $17.04 on Friday. By contrast, the index as a whole has fallen 18 percent. 
 So far, at least, the weak economy has been a boon for Big Lots, says James R. Norris, a portfolio manager at Cooke & Bieler, a mutual fund company in Oaks, Pa., that holds Big Lots shares in two funds. "They get better deals because manufacturers want to get rid of inventory," he said, and shoppers are likely to be seeking bargains. 
Since March, Mr. Norris has trimmed his Big Lots shares, although they still comprise 4.5 percent of CB Midcap Value, the mutual fund he manages.
If the economy weakens further, even discount chains may feel the pinch, some industry analysts say. "Even a downscale store like Big Lots will have a tougher time in a down economy," said Richard S. Lawson, a portfolio manager at the Weitz Funds, based in Omaha; it has been paring back its holdings of the stock recently, too.
Wall Street's enthusiasm for Big Lots has also been prompted by two years of revamping that is beginning to register at the checkout counter.
In July, Big Lots stores that had been open at least two years took in 16.9 percent more than they had in the period a year earlier. That compares with anemic sales growth of 0.8 percent in July 2001. Clerks in those stores rang up 10 percent more transactions this July than they had a year earlier. "Shoppers are returning to Big Lots's cleaner and better merchandised stores," said Brent R. Rystrom, a retail analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.
On Wednesday, Big Lots reported net income of $3.2 million for the second quarter on sales of $879.3 million, versus a loss of $10.7 million on sales of $748.4 million in the period last year. "Our results and those of the discount retailers suggest consumers are bargain-shopping during this time of economic uncertainty," said Michael J. Potter, the chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Potter joined the company two years ago, when it was floundering, several analysts said. His reorganization plan focused on revenue growth rather than on cost-cutting.
At the time, Big Lots operated stores of varying quality under the names Pic 'N' Save and Mac Frugal's Bargains Close-Outs, a holdover from acquisitions in the mid-1990's. Management sought to unify the brand by naming all stores Big Lots and by standardizing store layout, lighting and checkout systems.
The range of products sold by the stores -- from cookware to consumer electronics -- can be as broad as that of big, general-merchandise discount stores. Brand selection may be narrower, but prices cheaper. By contrast, "dollar stores" -- which go by names like Dollar Tree, Dollar General and 99 Cents Only -- sell a limited range of products like toothpaste and potato chips. Other close-out chains like Marshall's or T. J. Maxx specialize in apparel or household wares.
Big Lots has had mixed results expanding into niche close-out stores. It made a disastrous foray into toy stores with the purchase of K B Toys in 1996, analysts say. The company tried to sell close-out toys side by side with new products, but the strategy failed in a business as dependent on fads as toys, Mr. Norris said. Big Lots sold the K B Toys unit in late 2000 to Bain Capital.
Big Lots has opened more than 65 furniture stores, called Big Lots Furniture, though they still amount to a tiny proportion of the company's 1,357 stores in 45 states, according to John Rouleau, a retail analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Rouleau cautioned that the discount furniture business might also be challenging because a substantial amount of capital is tied up in inventory. 
Divining whether the turnaround of Big Lots has been priced into the stock yet depends on whom you ask. Most but not all of the old stores have been refurbished and renamed. "But there is a lag from when you make the changes in the store and when the customers reward you for that," Mr. Rouleau said.
Based on his estimates for improving sales and profits, he said the stock could reach $23 in the next 12 to 18 months. The greatest challenge will be improving profit margins, he said. In the mid-1990's, the company had 8 percent margins, fairly typical for retailers. The margin shrank to 5.7 percent in 2000, then plummeted to 2 percent in 2001. Management is projecting a 3.8 percent margin for 2002, and has set the goal of returning to 8 percent margins by 2005.
BUT there are skeptics. Karen Sack, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, points to the stock's huge run-up this year. "I think the turnaround success is already factored into the price," she said. She is not recommending the stock.
Some professionals who took a chance early on Big Lots have been cashing in their chips. In March, Weitz Funds owned 3.7 million shares of the company, making it one of the largest shareholders on record. Three months later, the firm owned slightly less than 400,000 shares through three mutual funds, Weitz Hickory, Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value.
Mr. Lawson, who manages the Hickory fund, said he thought Big Lots was worth more than the current price. "But it's not as attractive as it was at $8 or $9," he said.

Your Alma Mater Wants to Become Your Bank

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
JUST before Wendy Lambke bought her first house, in August 2001, she shopped around for homeowners' insurance. After comparing four or five rates, she ended up buying a policy offered through her alma mater, Iowa State University in Ames.
 "It turned out to be the cheapest insurance policy I could get," Ms. Lambke said of the $300 premium offered by the Liberty Mutual Group of Boston. So good a deal, in fact, that when it came time to renew her auto insurance, she switched to the plan offered to Iowa State alumni by Liberty Mutual. "I'm probably saving a few hundred dollars a year," she said, or about 20 percent, compared with other plans. 
 Ms. Lambke, 25, who graduated last spring and now works as a public relations coordinator in Des Moines, is one of thousands of people who have turned to their alma maters for a wide range of financial services -- from basic checking and savings accounts to mortgages and even health insurance. Alumni officers say the programs let them offer a service while also generating revenue. The programs are offered at schools of all sizes -- from small ones like St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wis., to big public universities including some in the University of California system. 
"Schools already have all of this data on their alumni" and can screen the lists for different offers, said Christopher Keenan, marketing director at the De Novo Corporation, a financial services consulting concern in Wilmington, Del. "Now they're taking that data and beginning to mimic other industries -- as much as you hate to call the schools industries."
Colleges, he noted, keep records of student loans, making it easier for them to offer loan consolidation programs. Many alumni groups also learn when former students marry, have children or accept new jobs; that information, too, can help in marketing specific products and services.
The idea of generating university revenue by pairing with financial services goes back to at least the early 1980's, when Georgetown University teamed up with the MBNA Corporation to offer a school-brand credit card. More than 1,000 colleges and universities now offer such affinity cards; MBNA, the largest provider, says three million alumni of 700 schools carry its cards.
Analysts say the card market is now saturated, so many schools are trying other programs. If designed correctly, college and company officials say, the arrangements can benefit everyone -- the alumni, the alumni associations and the companies.
BUT alumni should choose carefully. Ms. Lambke used to carry an Iowa State credit card offered by MBNA until she noticed that she could get a better rate elsewhere. "When the interest rate went up, I dropped it," she said, "even though it was a cool-looking card."
And the rush to sign up partners can backfire. In 1999, U.C.L.A. marketed a brokerage firm to its more than 300,000 alumni that promised discounted stock trades and online financial planning. The alumni association received an initial fee from the firm, University Alumni Funds of Chicago, but the firm went out of business soon after the program began, said Keith Brant, executive director of the alumni association. The founder of University Alumni Funds, Dan Frey, could not be reached for comment. 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., ran into problems last winter when Hartford Life Insurance canceled its coverage for about 200 alumni. The policies were canceled because Hartford, which took over the policies from Continental Assurance, said it was losing money on them. 
Mr. Brant at U.C.L.A. said the association also offers alumni programs for short-term medical insurance, term life insurance and eye care. Prices vary, depending on the type of coverage, but Mr. Brant said he tried to make sure that alumni get a price break. 
This fall, U.C.L.A. plans to roll out an auto insurance program with American Express Financial Services, which is just beginning to enter the college affinity market. Mr. Brant expects alumni to receive a 20 percent discount off typical premiums. For every former student who buys the insurance, the association receives a fee; Mr. Brant declined to disclose the amount. Eventually, he said, he expects auto insurance alone to generate well more than $100,000 annually for the association.
At many schools, the programs can contribute substantial revenue. At the University of New Hampshire in Durham, affinity programs account for up to half the alumni association's budget, said Ernie Gale, executive director of the group, which covers 102,000 alumni. The association offers auto and homeowners' insurance about 20 percent below market rates, Mr. Gale said, and has begun offering short-term medical insurance that is popular with recent graduates and alumni who are between jobs.
Several schools are moving into banking partnerships. Drexel University in Philadelphia set up the nation's first college-brand Internet bank, AJDrexel.com, two years ago, and has begun marketing it to its 60,000 alumni.
Constantine Papadakis, Drexel's president, said the bank had already attracted about 2,000 alumni by offering no-fee checking and 6 percent interest, more than twice the going rate, on 12-month certificates of deposit. The bank was started in partnership with TheBancorp.com, a Wilmington-based online bank in which Drexel has an ownership interest. The school receives a small fee for every account opened and for every transaction, Dr. Papadakis said.
He said he hoped that the bank would generate $500,000 in annual revenue within three years.
Jill Kelly, a senior vice president at TheBancorp.com, said the company planned to introduce such banks at several other schools in the next year. 
Other universities with banks include DePaul in Chicago, which has a partnership with the Sutton Bank in Attica, Ohio. J. Anthony Gorrell, Sutton's chief financial officer, said the bank planned to work with several new schools each year; it has already teamed up with Ashland University in Ohio and St. Norbert College.
Executives at several financial services companies said the partnerships give them ready access to a target market: educated people who, chances are, need these financial products anyway. 
Liberty Mutual, which has worked with more than 200 alumni groups, mainly in auto and homeowners' insurance, "gets a large base of potential customers in our target market," said Timothy M. Sweeney, senior vice president for sales and marketing. "As a group, their frequency of claims is lower," he said, "which means they're more profitable, and that's why we're able to offer them a discount."
This year, he said, the company plans to expand to up to 30 more schools. Discounts vary, but Mr. Sweeney said they average about 10 percent but can be up to 25 percent.
First USA, owned by Bank One, plans to expand from affinity credit cards to a comprehensive program for alumni, including C.D.'s and home equity loans. Joseph J. Purzycki, executive director for business development at First USA, said it would introduce the program at several large schools over the next 18 to 24 months.
First USA's main rival in college credit cards, MBNA, already offers banking products like C.D.'s and money market accounts to about one-third of the schools where it already offers credit cards. Alumni typically receive an additional tenth of a percent in interest on such accounts.
Analysts say that the programs will keep attracting alumni only if they are competitively priced.
Ryan Sawak, 23, received a political science degree from Drexel last year and is now a graduate student in international relations at Georgetown University in Washington. He said he kept his checking and savings accounts at AJDrexel.com because it offered better rates than other banks he found in Washington -- as well as a rebate on A.T.M. fees incurred at other banks. "I thought about opening a local account when I moved here," he said, "but this turned out to be a better deal."

1% Return? There's a Lesson in That

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SUMMER is nearly over, and many children are ending the season with money in their pockets, flush from the proceeds of summer jobs. Now, the question for them, and the responsibility for us, is what do they do with it?
 Go ahead. Tell them to put it into the stock market. 
 I faced this problem a year ago when my daughter, Marian, 15, finished her summer job with $600. I showed her how to open a savings account and told her that she could withdraw a bit but that most of the money should be saved for college. This was my weak attempt to give her a financial education.
When I soon noticed that her balance had shrunk to about $465 after several trips to the mall, I figured that my lesson hadn't taken hold. I told her to stop. "Save the rest," I said. "Now you can sit back and watch it grow."
Her balance is now $468.12. The lessons of savings and compound interest are understandably lost on her. She opens her bank statement, looks at the pennies she has earned in interest and then looks at me, as if to say: "Good move, Dad. Got any more advice?"
With the stock market so volatile and interest rates on savings accounts so puny, how do you invest the small amount of money that your child has earned? And how do you turn it into a lesson? If my financial adviser came back with a profit of $3.12, the lesson I would have learned was that I needed a new adviser.
Susan Bradley, founder of the Sudden Money Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., which conducts money camps for children, says that I and other parents need to relax about our children's finances. The lesson isn't so much about profit, she said, but about the pros and cons of investing.
"The losses that kids experience is really tuition into the school of life," she said. "The No. 1 mistake that parents make is that they try to protect their kids. They take on the responsibility of making sure things go well, instead of giving the child the responsibility."
Arlene Green, 41, and her husband, Michael, 50, of Stuart, Fla., have handed their daughter Devon, 11, a lot of responsibility. When she was 5, they helped her start a recycling business, collecting aluminum cans and other material from homes and businesses and delivering them to a recycling center. She's been at it ever since and now clears about $40 a week. She also has her own checking account, as well as money in several mutual funds. (Some funds, by the way, have low initial investment minimums. For example, the Investment Company of America fund requires just $250.) She has saved about $5,000 and raises money for charity.
"Balancing the checkbook has taught her responsibility and to understand the value of the dollar," Ms. Green said. "And she has great math skills."
Ms. Green, a business professor at a community college, tells the story of being in a clothing store during a 20-percent-off sale when Devon was younger and crawled under a rack of clothing and hid. A few minutes later a shopper walked up to the rack, looked at a price tag and, talking to herself, wondered what 20 percent off was.
"And from underneath the rack, Devon tells her what the number is," Ms. Green said. "She's amazing."
Sanford Coggins, 43, a financial adviser for Merrill Lynch in Newport Beach, Calif., has three children, ages 9, 12 and 15. They all have savings accounts funded by allowances. The 15-year-old, Bradleigh, who has a baby-sitting business, also has money in several mutual funds.
Mr. Coggins had her split the money among a growth-and-income fund, a large-cap growth fund and a sector fund, telling her to pick something that interested her. She chose entertainment and now follows the fortunes of companies like Disney and Viacom.
He said his children are not only learning the value of labor, but by saving money, they also see that it is possible to accumulate wealth over the long term. That, he said, helps curb impulse buying: "They see that it isn't important to get that mirror for their bicycle," Mr. Coggins said.
"Many parents don't know how to get their children to save," he added. "That's a real challenge. All they have to do is stay in the game and they will be millionaires by 50."
Ms. Bradley said another option is to have the children invest in themselves. If they're interested in computers, they can save to take a computer class. Or they can take a class that leads to a job -- a safety course to become a lifeguard, for example. She said children could also use their earnings to become entrepreneurs -- by buying a bike at a tag sale, for example, fixing it up and reselling it at a profit.
MS. BRADLEY says Marian can still make these choices.
"Your daughter has learned a lesson about interest rates," she said. "She realized with a low interest rate the money doesn't grow very much. At least she still has the money. If she had gone into a mutual fund, she would have been down 10 percent."
Better to be up 0.5 percent, I suppose. But Devon, for one, has learned not to worry about losses. Remember, she's just 11.
"I'm learning how the stock market works," she said. "It's a long-term investment, so I'm not worried. When it goes down, you can buy more with less money. When it goes up, your stock is worth more."
Now there's a financial adviser you can trust.

HEADLINE: Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
IT was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped through his files and found the number for the Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies.
 Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines, had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of $66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600 million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. 
 That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr. Siegel reached. 
In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days before US Airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago -- but after it had negotiated about $550 million in concessions with its unions -- Texas Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company, and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges from bankruptcy -- unless another investor surfaces with a better offer. 
"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were," said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in an interview after the bankruptcy filing. "There aren't many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry."
Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990's with investments in Continental and America West. The firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. 
Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions, most in unloved industries like semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month, it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank.
The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6 -- yes, just $6 -- in cash. It will also guarantee a $150 million bank loan.
In the last few years, most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts -- the use of junk bonds, bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -- have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze.
Texas Pacific is different. "This is a terrific environment for them," said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts.
Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: "Most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing. You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes."
LIKE most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant interviews and its Web site is perpetually under construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price, the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for this article.
Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and bright, patterned socks. "He likes argyle socks, and they tend to fall down around his ankles," said Henry Miller, an investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit.
. 
When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan. "Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller I.D., I know it's David calling," said one investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman.
Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman. Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan, which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass.
In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr. Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain & Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific.
The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues.
"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal maker," said Greg Brenneman, a former president of Continental. "Jim is very much a counterbalance to David. He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than David does."
By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a party. 
But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable.
Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during that stretch.
"They started to cash out early in the cycle," said Mario Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific investors.
The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas Pacific -- it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help.
But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a $280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than quadrupled. 
But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997, has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods.
Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker, both of which filed for bankruptcy.
Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through March 1997, should return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific investor. But its second fund -- $2.5 billion raised in 1997 -- could return less than half that, this investor estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank.
But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund, profits on these investments could rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, "their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won't return any capital" to investors.
BUT with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success, the investor said. "They should do exceptionally well," he said.
Texas Pacific has a distinct style -- if not formula. It relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it replaces managers.
Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy, for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court.
Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry.
"The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob Ferguson," said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982 Braniff bankruptcy. "He chose Bethune over his longtime friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a better job."
At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors.
W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr. Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr. Parker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhat kindred spirits."
The board replaced most senior managers at America West, except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped down last September. His restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in August 1994. 
Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes.
"These are not passive investors, nor am I," said Donald L. Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. "You're active. Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."
After overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. 
Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would "be as labor friendly as possible," Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed interest. 
Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the chain's franchisees -- even before the company, which had been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King franchisees.
"We liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy," Mr. Josephson said. Many other owners, he added, "are dismissive of labor."
At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines, who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest bought out their stake in Continental in 1998.
Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored with the technology industry, despite the failure of so many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed.
THE firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation, which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections, has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for bankruptcy last year.
Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6 billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last year. 
Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC, may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the payment to E.On, based in Dusseldorf, Germany, was actually more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal said. 
Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of which it swapped for more stock in the company.
"They did a good job of timing the acquisition," said Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000.
But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet, the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group.
Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75 million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive. Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale.
The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific remains committed to it. 
Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk, Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain, Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.

HEADLINE: The World: Over a Barrel; 
Oil Prices Won't Depend on Iraq, but on Its Neighbors

BYLINE:  By DANIEL YERGIN; Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is the author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power."

 BODY:
UNTIL the last two months, one of the United States' major sources of oil imports was Iraq, a country now often used in sentences with the word war. Oil prices last week reached $30 a barrel, partly because of fear of such hostilities and the rising crescendo of the national debate.
 But what would war with Iraq really mean for oil prices? There is worry that hostilities would send prices sky high, delivering a powerful new shock to already-troubled American and world economies. Yet, unless war and disruption spread to other Middle Eastern countries, the impact, in oil terms, could be more limited than many anticipate. 
 This may seem strange. After all, Iraq is a big player in world oil and could be even bigger. Yet, in the last few years, Iraq has so marginalized itself as an exporter that the world oil market has almost grown accustomed to its unreliability. This spring, Iraq unilaterally cut off exports for a month, trying to instigate a new oil embargo. The world hardly noticed. And other exporters were grateful for the chance to fill the gap, sell more oil and make extra money. 
Oil was a key consideration a decade ago when Iraq seized Kuwait and threatened the Saudi oil fields. But the focus even then was not so much on access to oil as on the ability of a Greater Iraq to transmutate oil into economic, political and military power -- especially weapons of mass destruction. 
Now the debate is focused on those weapons of mass destruction and the future orientation of a Middle East in turmoil.
Iraq's marginalization is self-imposed. Its output has sagged in response to under-investment, to isolation and to its own political decisions. 
At its peak in 1979, before it launched its disastrous invasion of Iran, Iraq was producing 3.5 million barrels a day. Its physical capacity to produce is now at something around 3 million barrels a day. Its actual output is a good deal lower, closer to 1.8 million barrels -- a fraction of Saudi Arabia's 8 million barrels a day. 
After accounting for domestic consumption and smuggled oil, Iraq's exports are about a million barrels a day. This drop in exports reflects a struggle between Iraq and the United Nations, which oversees Iraq's exports under the Oil for Food program, because of Iraq's imposition of an illegal export surcharge that goes directly to Saddam Hussein's coffers, bypassing the United Nations accounts.
Still, the prospect of a war in the Persian Gulf has been sufficient to alarm the market. Last week's prices of $28 to $30 a barrel include a "fear premium" of roughly $5 to $6 -- which translates into an added 10 to 15 cents a gallon at the pump for American drivers. What this means is that some of the price spike that people anticipate with hostilities is already in the marketplace. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that it is just anxiety that is pushing prices up. Right now, market fundamentals are also somewhat tight, and traders are nervously waiting to see if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raises its quota when it convenes in Osaka on Sept. 18.
The onset of hostilities would almost certainly mean a cut-off of Iraqi exports, which could mean prices surging toward $35 or even $40. This is not as high as some have predicted. Still, it is significantly higher than the $18 to $25 a barrel that many regard as "normal." Prices at $35 to $40 would mean an additional burden for ailing industries like airlines and for automakers, whose sales would be socked. More broadly, such prices would impose real damage across a world economy already lumbering under much strain.
Prices would only start coming down when buyers were persuaded that the global supply system was working -- that exports from other Persian Gulf countries were not disrupted, and that the rest of OPEC was making up Iraq's exports. During the gulf crisis in 1990-91, prices remained high for several months in anticipation of possible shortages once the fighting started. They plummeted the day the air war began, when it was clear that the Saudi oil fields were not vulnerable. 
During the gulf crisis, the other producers had to replace five million barrels a day -- the combined exports of Iraq and Kuwait that disappeared overnight from the world market. Now, that job would be far easier. Because of Iraq's self-marginalization, there are only about a million barrels of Iraqi exports to be replaced. 
Other OPEC producers have about six million barrels a day of unused production capacity that could be quickly called on to make up for the missing Iraqi barrels. Half is in Saudi Arabia, which has a policy of maintaining two to three million barrels a day of surplus capacity, with most of the rest in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have indicated they would use that extra capacity to make up any shortfall. 
There is a little extra supply capacity in Algeria, Libya and Nigeria. Venezuela and other Latin American countries are at capacity and have no extra barrels to contribute. In the next few months, Russia, which is on a strong growth track, might be able to add one to two hundred thousand barrels a day to the world market.
The real problem would be if other Persian Gulf suppliers were affected by the conflict. Then prices could climb far higher. From an oil point of view, that is the big risk. Eyes will be focused in particular on the security of production and export facilities in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The images of Kuwait's burning oil fields, ignited by Iraq at the end of the gulf war, are still vivid.
About seven million barrels -- equal to almost 10 percent of world consumption -- pass through Saudi export facilities every day. One could well imagine the market panic that attack or damage to those facilities could cause, perhaps sending prices to $50 or even $60 a barrel for a short time. But it's no secret these fields and facilities could be a target, and they are well defended by the Saudis. In addition, American military forces are close by. There's a great deal of duplication in the facilities, which provides a backup if any anything is hit, and damaged facilities could be repaired quickly. In addition, Saudi Arabia has backup export facilities across the country, and maintains its own oil inventories outside the country.
There is also that the critical second line of defense -- the 1.2 billion barrels of strategic crude oil reserves held or controlled by the Western governments. America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve alone holds almost 600 million barrels. This would be used quickly if a larger oil disruption threatened the world economy.
One way or the other, the knowledge that replacement oil is on its way would likely stem panic buying in its tracks and send prices down -- perhaps quickly. No refiner wants to run out of oil. But neither does any refiner want the losses that come from being stuck with oil bought at $35 to $40 a barrel when prices are dropping toward $20. The slide could be further greased by the weakening in the demand for oil that could result from the price spike itself.
If there is a war, what happens when it ends? Some people talk about a flood of Iraqi oil that would pour into the market and drive prices down to single digits. 
But a "new" Iraq is unlikely to do any flooding, even if it wanted to. The first task of a new regime would be to get production capacity, damaged by war and poor operating practices, back into gear. Fixing the immediate problems would take time and money. It would take even more time -- as well as a great deal of investment and lot of technology -- to get capacity back to where it was in 1979.
This would surely be accompanied by protracted negotiations between a new Iraqi government and the international companies -- among which Russian and French companies would be prominent, along with other European and American companies. 
A new government in Baghdad would be seeking technology and large-scale investment. It would, however, hardly be a pushover in dealing with these companies; rather, it would be seeking to assure its control over -- and maximum benefit from -- its No. 1 resource and money-earner. For their part, companies would be cautious about committing large amounts of investment dollars until confident of stability -- political and contractual.
At the same time, the companies would be interested in Iraq's potential, which has loomed large since the 1920's. Oil was discovered in Iraq in 1927, in the Kurdish region, at the site of what is thought to have been the "burning fiery furnace" of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar. This was a decade before the major oil discoveries in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In 1972, four years after Saddam Hussein's Ba'this regime came to power, Iraq threw out the international companies and nationalized its industry.
Today, Iraq's official oil reserves are 112 billion, the second largest in the world, a little bigger than Kuwait's, but only about 40 percent of Saudi Arabia's, which has the largest reserves. For years, however, there has been expectation that far more oil remains to be discovered in Iraq.
This process of reconstruction and negotiation -- just getting Iraq back to where it was at its previous high of 1979 -- could take three to five years. Thus, it might not be until 2006 or 2008 that Iraq would be able to launch itself on a true expansion phase of its capacity and test the premise as to how big a player it can be in the world of oil.

Riding the Light in Wyoming

BYLINE:  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
Sometimes I think the West is just a trick of the light. Especially in central Wyoming. Dawn breaks as if someone had flung open the barn doors, letting the sun out onto the prairie. After a run of bright colors, dusk lingers like a bruise. Everything is measured against the open range of the sky, and everything would be diminished by that scale if the level sun, at morning and evening, didn't have the trick of catching the world in its low beams. A herd of deer grazing by a head gate near sunset blends into the alfalfa behind it, until one doe peers over the embankment and her ears turn crimson with their own blood in the penetrating light. Sunrise picks out wires on a fence line that were once as tight as guitar strings but now run like tendrils from post to post. A derelict Econoline glistens in the tall grass, as venerable as a settler's buckboard. Wait long enough here, and the light will sooner or later give everything its due. It will make everything seem just right. 
 The other trick, of course, is real darkness. I don't mean the raven blackness of midwinter, but the darkness of a landscape almost empty of humans. I recently spent a night with friends deep in the sagebrush down a road that turns greasy with bentonite when the rains fall. We took a tour of the hay meadows just before dark, when the sage hens in the short grass look as prominent as turkeys. An antelope walked among them with something of the veld about him. By the time dinner was over, the last traces of twilight had faded. 
 I walked out to the road and looked from the cedar ridges in the west to the low buttes, cast in a mule deer's coloring, in the east. The only lights came from the ranch house behind me and the sky above. The horizon was flawless. Coyotes had already begun making their way closer and closer, worrying the ranch dogs, and coons were busy in the creek bottom. A partial moon blurred the night sky.
On a night like that, your mind can wander almost anywhere without interruption. It feels, in fact, as if you've stopped thinking, or as if your thoughts were out there padding along among the coyotes, moving quietly through the brightness of night, listening intently for prey. And when your thoughts do circle back home again, into yourself, it's almost as if you can hear them stepping up onto the porch of your consciousness, turning the knob on the door and making themselves at home. It feels like coming to, like an awakening. 
I suppose that's the thing I really mean when I talk about the trick of the Western light. The eye rides the light into the far distance and your thoughts ride along, whether the light comes from the morning or evening sun or from a hesitant moon. And still you've only begun to look. After all, you're stuck with Eastern eyes. A rancher will say, "See that fence line?" Somewhere in the distance, indiscernible, it climbs out of the alders, halfway to the horizon, and runs up a remote hillside nearly the color of the fence posts. So you nod and say, "Yes," because you know that if you lived long in this light, you'd be able to see that fence line, too. VERLYN KLINKENBORG

HEADLINE: The Nifty Fifty, Or Just the Lucky? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Did You Buy at the Peak? Hanging On May Still Pay" (Strategies, Aug. 18) notes that if a portfolio of large growth stocks, known as the Nifty Fifty, had been bought near the market top in 1972, it would have broken even by 1980, then performed very well over the next two decades. 
 A discussion paper by the Federal Reserve economists Shagihil Ahmed, Andrew Levin and Beth Anne Wilson suggested recently that good luck, more than monetary policy or business practices, was the main reason the business cycle was so tame from the mid-1980's to 2000. That would mean that the Nifty Fifty did well with a fortuitous economic background, and perhaps that this group's performance alone is not indicative of a more general trend for growth stocks.

Maybe It's the Economy

 BODY:
 Only about half of Americans say they are happy with their jobs, a Conference Board survey of 5,000 households indicates, down from 59 percent in 1995. 
The drop in satisfaction was found across all ages, incomes and regions, according to the survey, released on Wednesday. 
 Worker satisfaction with bonus plans, promotion policies, educational training programs and even fellow employees all fell since the survey was first conducted seven years ago. The one job aspect that most employees like a lot is the commute.

HEADLINE: Drowning Freedom In Oil 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
On a recent tour of India, I was visiting with an Indian Muslim community leader, Syed Shahabuddin, and the conversation drifted to the question of why the Muslim world seems so angry with the West. "Whenever I am in America," he said, "people ask me, 'Why do they hate us?' They don't hate you. If they hated you, would they send their kids to be educated by you? Would they look up to you as a model? They hate that you are monopolizing all the nonrenewable resources oil . And because you want to do that, you need to keep in power all your collaborators. As a consequence, you support feudal elements who are trying to stave off the march of democracy."
 The more I've traveled in the Muslim world since 9/11, the more it has struck me how true this statement is: Nothing has subverted Middle East democracy more than the Arab world's and Iran's dependence on oil, and nothing will restrict America's ability to tell the truth in the Middle East and promote democracy there more than our continued dependence on oil. 
 Yet, since Sept. 11, the Bush-Cheney team has not lifted a finger to make us, or the Arab-Islamic world, less dependent on oil. Too bad. Because politics in countries dependent on oil becomes totally focused on who controls the oil revenues -- rather than on how to improve the skills and education of both their men and women, how to build a rule of law and a legitimate state in which people feel some ownership, and how to build an honest economy that is open and attractive to investors.
In short, countries with oil can flourish under repression -- as long as they just drill a hole in the right place. Think of Saudi Arabia, Libya or Iraq. Countries without oil can flourish only if they drill their own people's minds and unlock their energies with the keys of freedom. Think of Japan, Taiwan or India.
Do you think the unpopular mullahs in Iran would be able to hold power today if they didn't have huge oil revenues to finance their merchant cronies and security services? Do you think Saudi Arabia would be able to keep most of its women unemployed and behind veils if it didn't have petrodollars to replace their energies? Do you think it is an accident that the most open and democratizing Arab countries -- Lebanon, Jordan, Bahrain, Morocco, Dubai and Qatar -- are those with either no oil or dwindling oil reserves? They've had to learn how to tap the talents of their people rather than their sand dunes.
The Pentagon is now debating whether Saudi Arabia is our enemy. Yes and no. There is a secularized, U.S.-educated, pro-American elite and middle class in Saudi Arabia, who are not America's enemies. They are good people, and you can't visit Saudi Arabia without meeting them. We should never forget that.
But the Saudi ruling family stays in power not by a democratic vote from these progressives. It stays in power through a bargain with the conservative Wahhabi Muslim religious establishment. The Wahhabi clerics bless the regime and give it legitimacy -- in the absence of any democratic elections. In return, the regime gives the Wahhabis oil money, which they use to propagate a puritanical version of Islam that is hostile to the West, to women, to modernity and to all non-Muslim faiths.
This bargain suits the Saudi rulers well. If they empowered the secularized, pro-American Saudis, it would not be long before they demanded things like transparency in budgeting, accountability and representation. The Wahhabi religious establishment, by contrast, doesn't care how corrupt the ruling family is in private -- as long it keeps paying off the clerics and gives them a free hand to impose Wahhabi dogma on Saudi society, media and education, and to export it abroad.
So while there are many moderate Saudis who do not threaten us, there is no moderate Saudi ruling bargain. The one that exists does threaten us by giving huge oil resources to the Wahhabi conservatives, which they use to build mosques and schools that preach against tolerance, pluralism and modernity across the Muslim world -- and in America. And it is our oil addiction that keeps us from ever confronting the Saudis on this. Addicts never tell the truth to their pushers.
Until we face up to that -- and curb our consumption and encourage alternative energies that will slowly bring the price of oil down and force these countries to open up and adapt to modernity -- we can invade Iraq once a week and it's not going to unleash democracy in the Arab world.

Tuition Bills Grow for Elite Educations

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
 Private schools can offer students a top-notch education, but they usually come with a hefty price tag. The average tuition for private day schools for ninth grade rose 31 percent, to $14,735, adjusted for inflation, between the 1991-92 school year to last year, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Boarding school tuition was up 29 percent, to $27,560, in the same period. (Schools surveyed do not include parochial schools.) 
 The share of students receiving financial aid is little changed in the past 10 years, hovering around 16 percent, but the dollar amounts have grown. For day schools surveyed, the average award was $7,980 last year, up 44 percent from 10 years ago, adjusted for inflation. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

A Five-Week Winning Streak for Stocks

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Despite a sell-off on Friday, General Motors, the Walt Disney Company, Citigroup and Microsoft all rose for the week and helped lead major stock indexes to their fifth consecutive positive week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.1 percent for the week, rising 94.90 points, to 8,872.96, The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 12.09 points, to 940.86, a gain of 1.3 percent. 
The Nasdaq composite index added 19.61 points, to 1,380.62, up 1.4 percent. 
 The approach of Labor Day and the lack of much significant economic news kept trading light. But that also means that the market could be vulnerable to some big swings in the days ahead.
Hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut faded after several Fed officials indicated that they believe that current short-term rates are low enough to provide enough stimulus to keep the recovery going. As a result, investors may again focus on prospects for corporate earnings in the second half of the year, which might not be positive for stocks.
 In the bond market, interest rates headed lower again. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was at 4.24 percent on Friday, down from 4.33 percent the previous week. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

Some Alternatives to Stalemate-or-Surrender

BYLINE:  By LEONARD KOPPETT; Leonard Koppett has been a baseball writer for 52 years. His revised 1991 book, "The Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball" (Sports Illustrated/Total Sports), has been published in paperback.

 BODY:
A pre-emptive strike by the major league baseball players, to forestall unilateral changes the clubs could make between seasons, has now been authorized to start on Friday while bargaining continues. Whatever the outcome, their basic positions seem as irreconcilable as they have been for 25 years. Each side regards the other's approach as unacceptable in some fundamental way. That leaves surrender or stalemate as the only options: one side or the other has to "win," whatever that takes.
 Sooner or later, however, more mutually satisfactory ideas must be explored. And such concepts have been around for 30 years, warmly endorsed by some of baseball's highest officials but never acted upon. 
 These include:
1. Agreeing on some specific percentage of gross baseball-related revenue to be earmarked for player compensation. (Football and basketball have had that for years.)
2. Reorganizing the player development system to make it dramatically less costly and more efficient.
These are feasible and have precedents in baseball and other sports.
As things stand, owners are focused entirely on some mechanism -- greater sharing of revenue, luxury tax, salary cap or whatever -- to check salary escalation by punishing the clubs that choose to pay the most. They say this is wrecking the industry's economy and killing "competitive balance."
The players see this as undermining the bargaining power they have gained in 25 years of partial free agency, not only for more money but also for some freedom of choice about where and for whom to play. If owners can't restrain themselves, why should players tie their own hands?
The economic problem is real. The gap between the most affluent and least affluent clubs has become too great, making operating expenses out of proportion to the franchise value of most teams.
But the "competitive balance" issue is merely a rationalization, used to buttress the salary-limitation argument. As history clearly shows, it has never existed in any major league sport, nor have sports ever needed it to prosper. In any case, the changes proposed by the clubs would not alter it but simply subsidize smaller-market finances.
Other options exist. Here are some concepts, all interrelated:
1. Guarantee a stipulated percentage of baseball's gross income to be set aside for player compensation. That would give the players their share of any future increase, and share whatever risk hard times might produce. It would give substance to the hitherto empty owner rhetoric that "players should recognize that we're partners."
2. Then almost all, instead of a few, players could be made free agents every year. The salary arbitration system, which ratchets up all salaries in step with free-agent maximums, would disappear. Since all of the players' share of the gross would have to be paid out, many more players would do better even if a few top stars got less. The present effect of limited free agency plus arbitration pulling up all other salaries would evaporate and would no longer be seen as needed by the players.
3. How to distribute player compensation could be negotiated with player input. A possible formula could be $80 million to the six first-place teams, $70 million to the second-place teams and $60 million to the remaining 18 teams. Of the many available formulas, whichever is finally adopted would leave the remaining portion of each team's budget unaffected by player payroll. It would have already put its share of its income into the player salary pool. In effect, each team's payroll would have been determined by the agreed-upon formula and would give teams an equal chance to sign any free agent according to its evaluation. Thus, a player's salary would be calculated in terms of the 100 percent of his club's salary pool rather than a set figure.
This would constitute a leaguewide salary cap, less objectionable than individual club caps in the absence of a shared gross. And if restrictions on free agents are needed, the limitation should be on how many one club can sign, not on any player's right to be one.
Under the present system, players are already classified according to statistics and experience for salary arbitration purposes. If a team could sign only two or three "premium" free agents, without restricting the rest, the guaranteed total player compensation would protect everyone. This really would improve competitive balance and benefit far more players than it hurt.
4. The entire minor league system could be redesigned, along lines outlined more than 30 years ago, to save at least half the $300 million now being spent on it. It would replace individual farm systems, which are expensive and redundant.
A player-development arm of the commissioner's office would conduct year-round, worldwide tryout camps, signing any applicant who qualifies to a generalized baseball contract, without any bonuses. It would operate all Rookie, Class A and Class AA teams, subsidized the way individual farm systems are now, out of a central fund, to which clubs would contribute less than the present cost of their own farm systems. It would set salary scales with appropriate promotion bonuses, hire scouts and instructors and assign players.
Each Major League club would support and control one Class AAA team, and 50 players, able to move them back and forth between them. Then it could acquire players only by drafting them from the unaffiliated lower minors.
This would do for baseball what the colleges do free for football and basketball. Then 30 competing organizations could scout actual performance sensibly, under uniform conditions, instead of trying to project (and commit millions to) the future of untried 18-year-olds.
Until they address such issues, the two sides are stuck with their choices of stalemate or surrender, in a self-made prison whose door is wide open for those willing to notice and step through it. It is not too soon to start thinking through such concepts.
Otherwise, the agonizing negotiations of 1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1990, 1994 and now will be repeated next time around, undermining further the public's attachment to the only product the industry has to sell: interest in its ball games, not its finances.
Organized Baseball was formed in 1903 when the 17-year-old National League made peace with the 2-year-old American League to stabilize the finances of both. Baseball's 100th birthday, next year, might be an appropriate time to start thinking seriously, from scratch, about its shape in the future.

College Football's Catch-22

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
BIG-TIME college football is the last frontier of colonial-style race relations, where African-American athletes supply the labor but rarely get control.
 This is not a new story; in fact, it's a dreadfully old and tired story. 
 In September 1970, the University of Southern California played the University of Alabama in Birmingham. The crux of the story surrounding the game is how Alabama's crushing defeat helped accelerate athletics integration in the South. Thirty-two seasons after that game, the S.E.C. is represented by a phenomenal black presence on the playing field. Yet no university in the conference has hired an African-American head football coach. 
The S.E.C. is a symbol for a nationwide travesty: African-Americans can block and tackle and run and jump across our screens every Saturday afternoon, but they cannot become head coaches and athletic directors.
This season, only 4 of the 117 Division I-A coaches are black while about half of their scholarship football players are black. The percentage of black players is remarkably higher when you look only at the starting offensive and defensive units.
The colleges that field these semipro teams should look at the lack of black head football coaches as an educational issue; the enterprise is a public symbol of a great failure. For the last 25 years, top universities have turned out thousands of African-American football players. Yet in that same 25 years barely a handful of them have managed to become head football coaches or athletic directors. Black athletes play and leave while many of their white teammates are put on the coaching and administration track. 
Mike Slive, who became the S.E.C. commissioner this summer, has made hiring African-American head football coaches one of the priorities of the conference. He has had his staff compile a data bank of African-American N.F.L. assistant coaches.
"There's a lot to do, and I just started this job," he said. "But you've got to start somewhere."
The long-languishing Black Coaches Association took a first step toward applying pressure on Friday when it met in Lincoln, Neb., to discuss hiring. The objective was to help aspiring African-American head coaches crack the code of big-time college football: to provide knowledge, accountability and political and economic strategies to bring about change.
Why is football such a bastion of resistance? Floyd Keith, the executive director of the B.C.A., has a theory. Football is the primary source of income for most athletic departments. Coaches are expected to generate interest and revenue through winning, through fund-raising, schmoozing with boosters and speaking at alumni functions. Fund-raising is the foundation of college football, and athletic directors want to have coaches whom boosters feel comfortable with, he said. 
Hiring blacks became good business in basketball after programs like Georgetown, Temple and U.S.C. became successful with black coaches. "This is a big business and the color that matters most is green," Keith said. "As of now, presidents have not seen that hiring black head football coaches is good business."
Notre Dame's hiring of Tyrone Willingham, even though he was the second choice, was seen as good business. Chris Leak, one of the nation's top recruits, will be making his first official visit to Notre Dame, precisely because Willingham is the coach.
What is more phenomenal than the persistence of the low number of African-American coaches is the mentality of parents and guardians who continue to send their children to these schools.
I like the Kellen Winslow model. Winslow, a tight end, played at the University of Missouri in the late 70's, then enjoyed a splendid professional career with the San Diego Chargers. Winslow was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995. When his son, Kellen Jr., also a tight end, became one of the nation's most highly recruited players in 2000, Winslow decided that he would treat Kellen Jr. the way recruiters treated him: as a valuable natural resource. Winslow set conditions for his son's recruitment -- he would not consider a college that did not have an African-American assistant coach, and would seriously look at colleges with black head coaches. Michigan State, whose head coach, Bobby Williams, is African-American, was in Winslow's top three. 
Winslow discouraged his son from selecting the University of Washington because he felt Rick Neuheisel and his staff attempted to go around the father during the recruiting process. Winslow, a college football analyst with Fox, canceled a visit that had been made without his knowledge or permission. Kellen Jr. ultimately chose the University of Miami and was on Miami's national championship team last season. The Hurricanes' defensive coordinator, Randy Shannon, is African-American.
The B.C.A.'s challenge will be to get an economically and politically diverse black community excited about the issue of controlling its most precious commodity: black muscle.
In the 1950's and 60's, economic boycotts of selected businesses broke down segregation in the South and forced businesses in the North to hire black workers. The campaign slogan was, "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work."
Beginning this recruiting season, the motto for high school football recruits and their parents should be: Don't play where you can't coach.

HEADLINE: Colombia Counters Rebels With Troops and Music 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: PATILLAL, Colombia, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
The music has returned to this picturesque town where the kidnapping and killing of a tireless promoter of the local folk music by rebels last September shocked the country.
 Patillal (pronounced pah-tee-YAL) and several other communities in this lawless region of northwest Colombia, sandwiched between two towering mountain ranges, are part of a government pilot program aimed at establishing order and rooting out leftist guerrillas. 
 Residents here have long been accustomed to kidnappings on the roads, to extortion demands on farm owners and rebel attacks against isolated police stations. 
Though common across the country, such violence is especially troubling here because major roads connecting the coast to Bogota, the capital, pass through this stark region. 
But just two weeks after Alvaro Uribe was inaugurated president, army patrols have returned and a police station is being planned to replace one destroyed by rebel guerrillas. A network of 1,100 civilian informants, who provide information on rebel movements to state security forces, has also been formed here in Cesar Province.
"The kidnapping rate by the guerrillas is very high, so the idea was to go into that zone before other zones," said Alfredo Rangel, a military expert in Bogota who is a consultant for the army. "It is an area crucial for the national economy."
Even before the kidnapping from a local road of Consuelo Araujo, a former culture minister and the promoter of the accordion-driven vallenato music, Colombia's decades-old civil conflict had driven out weekend homeowners and the folk musicians who made the region famous.
On a recent night, however, the musicians settled under a mango tree and played their ballads as if all were well here. Soon a crowd formed, clapping, singing along and drinking chirinchi, the local brew. 
It was the first time in months that musicians had spontaneously begun playing, though that had once been common in this town, known as the "cradle of the maestros." 
"For more than a year, we have not seen this in town," said one singer, Camal Mohales, 54, a lifelong resident of Patillal. "But now that the armed forces are back, we feel hopeful because the security has returned."
Mr. Uribe, who has strong American support for his aggressive effort to combat the rebels, has promised to replicate what is being done here nationwide. By decree, his government has already announced a new, one-time tax on assets worth at least $60,000 to collect $800 million to pay for training thousands of troops and police officers and to pay for the growing network of informers. The goal, in time, is to double the size of the security forces and to station police officers in 163 municipalities -- one of every seven in the country -- that have no police presence.
On Aug. 8, the day after Mr. Uribe was inaugurated in a ceremony marred by a rebel mortar attack in Bogota, the new president showed his resolve by visiting here to assess how plans were proceeding for the informants' network. 
The plan, which calls for civilians to be recruited and paid for offering information on the activities of armed groups, had begun taking shape in the weeks after Mr. Uribe won the election in May.
Earlier this week, he and other officials returned, and were informed by the army as well as local officials that road traffic had increased 43 percent in Cesar because of the informants and the increased security patrols.
Defense Minister Martha Lucia Ramirez, pleased with the report, said, "We are going to work so the public forces are present in all the national territory." 
It will not be easy. Analysts of Colombia's conflict, now in its 38th year, contend that Mr. Uribe lacks the resources or the manpower to bring about substantive changes to a country where wide swaths of territory are under the influence of leftist rebels or the right-wing paramilitary groups that have formed to fight them in some areas.
Some critics also believe that Mr. Uribe's plans -- among them a new proposal to recruit up to an additional 20,000 young peasants to create a military presence in their hometowns -- could lead to abuses or put people in harm's way.
Analysts also say that re-establishing a police presence in regions under rebel influence could take years and, even then, could fail because of the overwhelming strength of the guerrillas in some regions. Even here, where the news has been good, the roads remain dangerous, as evidenced by today's rebel kidnapping of a farmer.
"Even if you reopen the police stations, keeping them open is quite another challenge," said Adam Isacson, who analyzes Colombia's military for the Center for International Policy, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
But here, where people had been so tired of violence and lawlessness for so long, any action by the government is warmly welcomed.
"Uribe's plans have had excellent results," said Elias Ochoa, mayor of Valledupar, the provincial capital.
Indeed, in addition to the increased traffic, there have been other tangible results, local military officials said. On Tuesday, an anonymous caller reported some suspicious men lingering near a bridge. The army arrived, found four rebels placing dynamite under the structure and began firing. One rebel was killed, and the others fled.
"It all began with a call from someone who saw something suspicious," said Lt. Col. Hernan Mejia, commander of the local battalion.
One local informer, a man in his 30's code-named K-003, said he had decided to take part in Mr. Uribe's force because he was tired of the rebel presence in his hometown. 
The man, a farm worker, oversees a group of five other informers, and regularly reports rebel activities to his employer, who then contacts the army. Since he is considered a "control agent," overseeing others, he will in time be paid about $75 a week for his work, with more coming for useful information.
"It is dangerous, but I feel confident," the man said. "It is not the same fright I used to feel before, though. I feel like we are all collaborating." 
Local people who are closely following Mr. Uribe's proposals are perhaps most interested in seeing a positive outcome here in Patillal, a town that is symbolic because of its music and traditions.
Some of the greatest vallenato composers, household names like Rafael Escalona and Freddy Molina, were born here. Valledupar's middle classes had, before the conflict spiraled out of control, built weekend homes here.
"This is the place that has made the province important," said the local prefect, Elvis Diaz, 32. "Now, the town is quite happy. People have stood up to say, 'Let us take back the town.' It is like going back 20 years, when things were peaceful."

HEADLINE: To Be Hamlet (but Still Keep the Day Job) 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
For years, Tim Martin, an executive at an antique-silver shop on East 57th Street, has dreamed about playing Hamlet. The desire came from a long run of theatergoing.
 Many of the plays were Off Off Broadway, many of them by Shakespeare, and he and his friend Dave Eisenbach would repeatedly leave a theater and agree that they could have done it better. Mr. Martin hoped to play Hamlet by the time he was 30, and it looks as if he will be only two years late. 
 Beginning Sept. 4, for five performances, he will star as Hamlet in a theater not far from Broadway. 
How did he do it? 
First, to cast the play, he placed an ad in Back Stage -- offering actors "possible pay." To his astonishment, more than 300 people replied, and he interviewed 160, many of them with acting credits and with far more experience than the man playing Hamlet. An octogenarian former baseball player auditioned for the role of Claudius and, without encouragement from Hamlet, a potential Ophelia stripped to her underwear before speaking her lines.
From the applicants, Mr. Martin gathered and rehearsed a cast of eager players, almost all professional actors with day jobs like office receptionist or waiter. Gertrude works at J. P. Morgan. The Player King is a computer consultant; the Gravedigger is a tailor; and Polonius is a professor of Shakespeare.
The response caused Mr. Martin to reflect: "You sit on the subway, and so many people look drab on a winter's day. They're going to their jobs, but for all you know, at night they're in a play or they're dancers. Everybody talks about how people in New York are obsessed with money and glory, and here's a massive group of people who answer an ad."
Mr. Martin is the producer and the show's sole backer -- for $7,500: an amount, he suggested, that he might have spent on a long summer vacation. He is also co-director with Mr. Eisenbach, who is playing Horatio. Another friend, Teige Carroll, is playing the Ghost.
From the beginning, he and Mr. Eisenbach hoped that the production might rise to the level of "pretty good," but they knew that "awful" was always a prospect. Even as rehearsals proceeded, Mr. Martin would make only one claim. Thinking of himself, at 6-foot-3, and his 6-foot-8-inch Ghost, among others, he said, "I've probably got the tallest cast ever assembled for a 'Hamlet.' "
Less than two weeks from his debut, Mr. Martin is of two minds. "It's fabulous," he said. "I hope people will come and get some pleasure out of it." Then he added, "In your imagination, you can do it much better than you can with your actual body."
Mr. Martin has not acted since college, but finally, prodded by Mr. Eisenbach, who is a Ph.D. candidate in American history at Columbia, he decided to go ahead with the project. He rented the Producers' Club II, an Off Off Broadway theater on Ninth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets, and drafted a budget. The initial outlay of $6,000 turned out to be less than what was needed.
The next step was casting. The ad in Back Stage read: "THM Productions will hold auditions for 'Hamlet' . . . Bring pix & resume, and prepare a speech and a Shakespeare sonnet, with a maximum length of five minutes. Callbacks will be next week. N.B.: Hamlet, the Ghost and Horatio are precast. Possible pay."
At first, he said, he thought they might have a complete "Hamlet" cast, but he soon became more practical. With some actors playing more than one role, the number needed shrinks to 14, so excluding those places reserved for Hamlet, Horatio and the Ghost, 11 actors were chosen.
He has taken as a role model Kenneth Branagh, an actor he greatly admires. In the early 1990's, Mr. Martin lined up at 4 a.m. to buy tickets to see him play Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and thinks it was the finest Hamlet he has seen. (Of course, before Mr. Branagh did "Hamlet," he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and at 23 played Henry V.) 
On the positive side, Mr. Martin has never worried about learning his lines. "I always had a good memory, particularly for words," he said. "But I can't remember things that happen. That's a problem that many of my ex-girlfriends pointed out: 'You can remember all of "Hamlet," but you can't remember when we went to Italy for two weeks.' "
In June, he held auditions followed by callbacks, welcoming actors to his Gramercy Park apartment. One evening before the actors arrived, the floor of his living room was covered with head shots (with credits on the backs), as he and Mr. Eisenbach tried to decide which applicants to choose. First to read was an actor whom they had liked in an Off Off Broadway production of "Measure for Measure." On the basis of his reading, he might have had the role of Claudius, but later called to say he had accepted a different offer.
Next an actor came in to read for Polonius. "How do you want me to do it?" he asked, and added, "Do you want me to age?" After delivering a speech, he suggested, "I can do it differently." He seemed as amenable as Dustin Hoffman playing an unemployed actor auditioning in "Tootsie" ("I can be taller. I can be shorter. I can be different.") Polonius was followed by a breathless Ophelia and a Gertrude who seemed better suited to "Funny Girl." None of the three were offered parts.
Ophelia was one of the most difficult roles to cast. About 80 actresses auditioned, including one who besieged Mr. Martin with late-night calls and at her audition stripped to her underwear and did a monologue from "The Misanthrope." Frances Chewning, the actress who got the part, is the opposite. Mr. Martin said, "She is amazingly delicate, tall and thin with incredibly translucent skin, sort of like a Memling painting."
Several actors are members of Actors' Equity, some studied theater in graduate school and many have already done Shakespeare. Mr. Martin, a Columbia graduate and a student of Shakespeare, works for his stepfather, Eric Shrubsole, at S. J. Shrubsole, a leading silver dealer. His father, Dwight Martin, was an editor and writer at Newsweek.
Mr. Martin made it clear to the actors that he could pay only carfare. Because this is an Equity showcase production, tickets are held to $15. In a 99-seat house there can be no profit, but he said he might pass the hat and split the take among the actors. 
While meeting his actors, Mr. Martin faced his first crisis. He lost his Claudius. The problem began with the pronunciation of a line, "Colleagued with this dream of his advantage." Mr. Martin said the word should be pronounced in three syllables -- col-LEAGUE-ed, -- but the actor insisted that the accent was on the first of two syllables (COL-leagued). For proof, Mr. Martin deferred to various editions of the play and recordings of "Hamlet," one with John Gielgud. The actor acceded to the direction, but the next day called to say he was quitting to do "Jekyll and Hyde" in Rhode Island.
After Mr. Martin took out another ad in Back Stage, 15 prospective Claudiuses showed up, including an elderly man who said he had once played baseball for the New York Giants. He did Hamlet's soliloquy "O! What a rogue and peasant slave am I," and was, Mr. Martin said, "Absolutely fabulous." Boldly, the actor asked, "Do you think I'm going to get the part?" Mr. Martin replied that the audition was good, but that "you may be a little old." 
"How old do you think I am?" came the reply. "You must be 70, and Gertrude is pretty young." The actor said, proudly, "I'm 83," flexing his muscle to demonstrate his fitness. A younger actor was hired, and he read that crucial line correctly.
From the beginning, Mr. Martin made it clear that he planned a bare-bones production with minimal scenery, and with costumes suggested by the actors. The focus would be on the text. As host in his apartment, he made dinner, or rather, "slapped together whatever was in the fridge." Actors often discreetly announced, "I ate before I came here."
Rehearsals began this month in a Lower East Side studio, cheek by jowl with productions in the New York Fringe Festival. On a recent evening, the actors prepared to go through Act III. Everyone was ready. But where was the Player King? Hamlet got on his cellphone and learned that he was tied up with an emergency at Goldman Sachs. Another actor filled in.
A room in the castle. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Then, Enter Hamlet with "To be, or not to be." Mr. Martin knew his lines but seemed to rush them. Soon he turned to Ophelia and said, "Get thee to a nunnery!" Then came the Dumb Show. The actor playing the Player Queen adjusted his long black wig, but the hair kept falling in his eyes.
Scene IV. The Queen's Closet. Gertrude forgot a line. The Ghost, sitting at a table waiting his turn, prompted her. On cue, Hamlet stabbed Polonius. The scene ended, with all lines accounted for. Mr. Eisenbach gave notes to the actors, beginning with Polonius, who took exception to the direction. The others were more receptive. Hamlet, in proper fashion, was highly self-critical. The conversation became a colloquy, with everyone participating. Then, it was back to the boards as rehearsals, and the learning process, continued.
Although Mr. Martin has the look of a leading man and has a clear, cultivated voice, he has no illusions -- well, maybe a few -- about being discovered and becoming an actor. He is not about to leave his day job. 
Before he started "Hamlet," Mr. Martin raised the question, "Am I being presumptuous?" The answer: Well, you're not doing "King Lear" -- yet. But if "Hamlet" works, he already has his eyes on "Julius Caesar" next summer. He wants to play Cassius, a second step for this lean and hungry Hamlet.

HEADLINE: In Race to Tap the Euphrates, The Upper Hand Is Upstream 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TELL AL-SAMEN, Syria 

 BODY:
The Euphrates River is close by, but the water does not reach Abdelrazak al-Aween. Here at the heart of the fertile crescent, he stares at dry fields.
 The Syrian government has promised water for Mr. Aween's tiny village. But upstream, in Turkey, and downstream, in Iraq, similar promises are being made. They add up to more water than the Euphrates holds. 
 So instead of irrigating his cotton and sugar beets, Mr. Aween must siphon drinking and washing water from a ditch 40 minutes away by tractor ride. Just across the border, meanwhile, Ahmet Demir, a Turkish farmer, stands ankle deep in mud, his crops soaking up all the water they need. 
It was here in ancient Mesopotamia, thousands of years ago, that the last all-out war over water was fought, between rival city-states in what is now southern Iraq. Now, across a widening swath of the world, more and more people are vying for less and less water, in conflicts more rancorous by the day.
From the searing plains of Mesopotamia to the steadily expanding deserts of northern China to the cotton fields of northwest Texas, the struggle for water is igniting social, economic and political tensions. 
The World Bank has said dwindling water supplies will be a major factor inhibiting economic growth, a subject being discussed at a weeklong international conference in South Africa starting Monday about balancing use of the world's resources against its economic needs.
Global warming, some experts suspect, may be adding to the strain. Droughts may be extended in already dry regions, including parts of the United States, even as wetter areas tend toward calamitous downpours and floods like those ravaging Europe and Asia this summer. In general, the world's climate may be more prone to extremes, with too much water in some areas and far too little in others.
Both the United Nations and the National Intelligence Council, an advisory group to the Central Intelligence Agency, have warned that the competition for water is likely to worsen. "As countries press against the limits of available water between now and 2015, the possibility of conflict will increase," the National Intelligence Council warned in a report last year.
By 2015, according to estimates from the United Nations and the United States government, at least 40 percent of the world's population, or about three billion people, will live in countries where it is difficult or impossible to get enough water to satisfy basic needs.
"The signs of unsustainability are widespread and spreading," said Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project in Amherst, Mass. "If we're to have any hope of satisfying the food and water needs of the world's people in the years ahead, we will need a fundamental shift in how we use and manage water." 
An inescapable fact about the world's water supply is that it is finite. Less than 1 percent of it is fresh water that can be used for drinking or agriculture, and demand for that water is rising. 
Over the last 70 years, the world's population has tripled while water demand has increased sixfold, causing increasing strain especially in heavily populated areas where water is distant, is being depleted or is simply too polluted to use. 
Already, a little more than half of the world's available fresh water is being used each year, according to one rough but generally accepted estimate. That fraction could climb to 74 percent by 2025 based on population growth alone, and would hit 90 percent if people everywhere used as much water as the average American, one of the world's most gluttonous water consumers.
Water tables are falling on every continent, and experts warn that the situation is expected to worsen significantly in years to come. On top of the shortages that already exist, the outlook adds to the tensions and uncertainty for countries that share water sources, like Turkey and Syria, where Mr. Aween is among those still waiting and hoping for the Euphrates to be brought to his door.

A Few Miles' Difference
The stories of Mr. Aween and Mr. Demir illustrate how the growing fight for water can make or ruin lives.
Until last year, Mr. Demir, 42, a father of nine in Turkey, was living an itinerant life as a smuggler and a migrant laborer. But on a recent scorching afternoon, he stood sunburned and content, his striped pants rolled above his knees, bare feet squishing in Euphrates mud.
"It seems like we have all the water we need," Mr. Demir said, leaning on his shovel and running a hand through his close-cropped hair. What has changed in this swath of southern Turkey is the arrival of irrigation. It is part of one of the world's largest water projects, an audacious $30 billion plan by Turkey's government to spread the Euphrates' gifts across a vast and impoverished region of the country. 
By now, Mr. Aween, the Syrian, might have been celebrating, too. Under Syria's irrigation plan, ambitious in its own right, water from the Euphrates should have reached Mr. Aween's door, less than 50 miles from Mr. Demir's.
But strong doubts are emerging about whether the vast scope of Turkey's project will leave enough water for its neighbors downstream -- so much so that Syria appears to have put the brakes on its development plan.
"We're still waiting," Mr. Aween, 40, said on behalf of his 2 wives, 3 children, and 17 brothers and sisters, who all live in a hamlet that bears the family name. He wore a loose, Arab-style outer garment and cheap plastic sandals as he hitched a rusty tanker trailer to a sputtering tractor, his water bearers. "But the water hasn't come."
The trouble over the Euphrates can be expressed in a simple, untenable equation. 
As best as anyone can determine, the river, in an average year, holds 35 billion cubic meters of water. But the separate plans drawn up by Turkey, Syria and Iraq for building dams and irrigating fields would, taken together, consume nearly half again more water than the river holds.
Each country has acknowledged the impossibility of marrying their schemes. But none has shown any willingness to scale back. Trying to accommodate fast-growing populations and to head off a migration to the cities, each country is still clinging to its irrigation dreams.
On both sides of the Turkish-Syrian border, snapshots of those dreams still unfold on summer dawns, in fields that used to be good for little but grazing, but where new irrigation canals are now delivering Euphrates water in regular supply. 
Thirsty crops like cotton and sugar beets have begun to thrive. Farm incomes have tripled. Young women who turn out in sparkling dresses tend prized plants with special care, shepherding the water down each muddy row. Young boys cavort in irrigation ditches that provide relief from the intense midday heat.
Now that there is water, Mr. Demir said, it would not be such a bad thing if his four sons, ranging in age from 4 months to 22 years, decided to stay and work the land -- something he could not have imagined only a year ago when farming was far harder. 
But in a world in which so much depends on having water, he bristled at the idea of sharing it. "If I used any less, the others would use more," he said. "I use what I need, and as for the rest, it's their business."
That kind of thinking has not helped Mr. Aween's village, not far from Tell al-Samen, where the absence of water is almost equally on display. With his family, Mr. Aween raises scraggly goats and grows whatever barley and wheat he can coax from dry, unirrigated land. It is a far cry, he said, from the lush green crops he would grow with irrigation -- the difference between sustenance and comfort.
Syria and Turkey have been at odds since the late 1980's, when Turkey decided to proceed with its development project without consulting its neighbors.
To Turkey, the plan was an essential step in the country's development, a means of transforming an area that is home to six million people, including many restive Kurds, into a zone of greater economic and political stability. But to Syria, which depends on the Euphrates for half its fresh water, it continues to be seen as a major threat. Iraq, the far downstream neighbor, has been mostly a bystander because of its international isolation. 
The basic disputes between Turkey and Syria -- over water rights and allocations -- would be familiar to any landowner who has struggled over competing claims to a stream or a well. But the fact that the parties are nations, with large armies at their disposal and large populations at stake, has added to the weight of the clash.
Less powerful militarily than Turkey, Syria resorted through much of the 1990's to indirect pressure, by giving support to the terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan, the No. 1 enemy of the Turkish government. In response, Turkish officials sometimes went so far as to warn that the flow of the Euphrates into Syria could be cut.
Such talk has cooled in the last three years since the arrest of Mr. Ocalan. But the potential for trouble lingers. 
Over the last year, as Turkey has completed many dams and has begun to extend its irrigation, the flow of Euphrates water into Syria has grown consistently smaller. The flow has fallen below levels allowed under Turkey's only existing commitment to Syria, an interim 1987 agreement intended for the period of dam construction.
Turkey has blamed drought and the overuse of the new, cheap water by farmers for the shortfall. The government says much of that can be reversed. But Turkish officials have also said they no longer see the 1987 deal as binding. The trend has raised deep concerns in Syria, which is already facing water shortages in Damascus, the capital.
Both countries say they are ready to strike a deal, but cannot imagine scaling back their development plans. "For half of Syria, the Euphrates is life," said Abdel Aziz al-Masri, a top official at Syria's Ministry of Irrigation.
Mumtaz Turfan, the director of Turkey's department of hydraulic works, echoed the sentiment. "Without our dams, life in Turkey would be impossible," he said.

Rising Tension, Dwindling Water
It has been a decade since Syria, Turkey and Iraq sat down to formal negotiations, and their positions remain as starkly opposed now as they were then.
Syria and Iraq want the water to be divided roughly in thirds. Turkey, on the other hand, claims more than half for itself. It says any sharing must take into account Turkey's status as the source of most Euphrates water and the home to a population that is half again as big as Iraq's and Syria's put together.
"I am sure that if we forget about borders, we can solve the problem," Mr. Turfan said. Over the last 30 years, he has presided over the construction of 700 dams in Turkey, and a map that stretches across his wall details plans for 500 more.
"I am providing water for 22 million people who take drinking water from our dams, and for 35 percent of our agriculture," he said. It would be a mistake, he suggested, for Turkey to accept less than the lion's share of the Euphrates. "Without irrigation, we can't do anything," he said. "We can't give it up and destroy our people."
Around the world, the question of water ownership has never seemed so divisive.
Despite efforts by the United Nations and others, the world has yet to come up with an accepted formula on how shared waters should be divided. That situation applies to nearly 300 rivers, including the Nile, the Danube, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, all subject to major disputes.
In 1997, a United Nations convention declared that international waterways should be divided reasonably and equitably, without causing unnecessary harm. But Turkey, along with China and Burundi, refused to sign the agreement, a sign of reluctance on the part of major upstream countries to cede their dominant positions.
Beyond current water shortages, one reason for the tension is a lack of optimism that pressures on the world's water supply might be eased.
Of course, some new technologies, including advanced irrigation techniques, innovative desalination methods and bold water-moving schemes, offer some hope.
But experts say the task of making fresh water available where there is none -- from seawater, from icebergs or by moving surface water long distances -- remains too costly to be widely adopted. Most easily accessible fresh water sources have already been tapped.
To those who would bend nature, there are many cautionary tales, including the Soviet-orchestrated drying up of the Aral Sea, an environmental catastrophe. Even for its project on the Euphrates, Turkey could not win World Bank support because of the plan's significant costs, including the submerging of an important archaeological site.
But sometimes, as in Turkey's case, the thirst for water is greater than any such opposition. Along the Euphrates, Turkey is paying its own way, despite the financial hardship and despite the uncertainty over how its plans will affect others.
In the dry heat of a Mesopotamian summer, how that tenacity is regarded depends on which way the water is flowing. 
In an office in Al Raqqa, a Syrian city on the banks of the Euphrates, Iliaz Dakal, a consultant to Syria's land development agency, was studying a map of his own. It depicted, in vivid green, the land that Syria is already irrigating along the river. Much more land, though, like the fields that are home to Mr. Aween, was crosshatched to show uncertainty -- its water and its fate now perhaps in Turkey's hands.
"For now, thank God, we have enough to grow the wheat we need," Mr. Dakal said. "But what about the future?"
Mr. Demir, in his muddy Turkish field, had an answer, saying he had come to see water as a byproduct of power.
"If Turkey is stronger," he said, "then I get to keep my water."

HEADLINE: Facing Death, Founder Fights for Labor Party's Life 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Tony Mazzocchi, the driving force behind the nation's fledgling Labor Party, shocked thousands of the party's members when he recently wrote to them, "I am both afflicted with an incurable disease and blessed with an incurable optimism."
 Mr. Mazzocchi, 76, has pancreatic cancer, and although his doctors give him only a few weeks or maybe a few months to live, he continues to battle relentlessly in pursuit of his dream -- building a Labor Party that will someday move to center stage in American politics. 
 Gaunt from losing 25 pounds this year, he seems especially rueful that his health is failing at what he sees as an opportune time to reassert workers' interests and to hack away at corporate power. "For the first time in 20 years, corporate America is losing legitimacy," he wrote last month to party members, pointing to the Enron and WorldCom debacles. "It is cracking under the weight of its own greed. No longer can it play the goose that lays the golden eggs." 
The Labor Party has three main issues: single-payer national health insurance, as in Canada; free tuition for all college and graduate students at public colleges and universities; and labor law changes to make it easier for workers to join unions without employer intimidation. Mr. Mazzocchi complained that it was extremely difficult to unionize workers because trying to do so caused many employers to threaten to close their plants or move overseas.
Many political analysts say the Labor Party's program is unrealistic, exemplifying the sort of big-government approach that even Democrats long ago disowned. The party's proposals, they say, might be embraced in Europe, with its social democratic traditions, but are not likely to get far in the United States, with its emphasis on shrinking government and cutting spending.
The Labor Party has even come under heavy fire from some labor leaders, who say it is undermining the Democratic Party, which they see as the best vehicle to help workers. Conservatives denounce the Labor Party as a crude advocate of class warfare and soaking the rich.
But Mr. Mazzocchi (pronounced muh-ZOCK-key) insists that the party's wish list is not pie in the sky. He says one of the party's mottoes could be "Steal Our Program." 
"We're concentrating on issues that resonate," he said. "Right now the cost of tuition is so prohibitive, even at many state universities, that it's hurting many working-class students. Tuition for all these folks is $23 billion. That's nothing."
Although he dropped out of school in ninth grade, Mr. Mazzocchi is a seminal thinker and strategist for what remains of the American left. He spends his days, often in pain, at his modest town house here, where the second floor has been turned into a Labor Party office. 
Several unusual accomplishments have helped build his reputation. In 1954, as president of a union local at a Helena Rubenstein cosmetics factory on Long Island, he was one of the first labor leaders to win dental benefits. From the 1950's through the 1970's, he did more than any other union leader to forge ties with environmentalists and scientists while working on such issues as fighting nuclear testing and identifying toxic chemicals that endangered factory workers and residents nearby. 
In 1970, as legislative director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, he played a crucial role in securing passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is often called the most important pro-worker legislation of the last 50 years. 
"What's incredible," Mr. Mazzocchi said, "was the guy who was president then was Richard Nixon, which shows that when you build a big movement from down below, regardless of who's in the White House, you can bring about change."
In 1974, Mr. Mazzocchi was the union's main adviser to Karen Silkwood, an atomic plant worker from Oklahoma, before she died in a mysterious car accident while driving to meet a journalist to publicize safety problems at her plant.
When he speaks, Mr. Mazzocchi often uses the us-against-them, class-tinged speech of the 1930's. In his view, the main issues facing workers have changed little since then: they keep getting squeezed while corporations grow more powerful, and the gap between the rich and everybody else keeps growing. 
"Workers are worried today," he said. "They see decent-paying jobs fleeing overseas. They see that they will get the raw end of the stick whenever it comes to corporate restructuring. They understand instinctively and more than ever before that when the economy goes downhill, corporations don't care about their well-being."
Mr. Mazzocchi's childhood in Brooklyn shaped his politics. His father, a unionized worker at a suit factory, lost the family's home because of steep medical bills for his wife, who died of cancer when Mr. Mazzocchi was 6.
Mr. Mazzocchi founded the Labor Party in 1996 at a convention in Cleveland because he was convinced that corporate interests and wealthy donors dominated the Democratic and Republican parties. 
He does not see the party, at least now, electing candidates to office. Rather, he said, its focus should be pushing worker-friendly issues into the nation's discourse.
Asserting that Mr. Mazzocchi and his party have an obsolete leftist vision, many critics say it is not surprising that the party has grown slowly and gained little traction.
Mr. Mazzocchi acknowledges that the party has grown more slowly than he had hoped and has tailed off some from the 14,000 members it had four years ago. One reason, he said, is that his illness has sidelined him -- the party's main spokesman and booster. He has concentrated lately on signing up union locals rather than individual members, and has helped persuade 350 union locals to pay affiliation fees to show their support. If the party had more money, he said, it could easily double or triple the number of unions.
"When I get into a union hall and I'm able to talk to the members, our message resonates," he said. "American workers aren't going to sit still if things continue to come apart. If you look at the history of American workers, you'd think they're in a sleepy lagoon, and then all of a sudden there is an explosion."

HEADLINE: A Group That Makes Networking Its Business 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Not long ago, Louise Wise Services, the big foster care agency, leased space at 55 West 125th Street (now better known as Bill Clinton's building). The agency chose Lara Hullinghorst, an information technology expert, to oversee the high-tech aspects of the move. Ms. Hullinghorst, in turn, helped Martin Cohen land the contract for office supplies and recommended Barry Winter to handle the physical relocation.
 Mr. Winter, meanwhile, suggested to a company whose lease was running out that it ask Daniel S. Chillemi, a commercial real estate broker, to help them find bigger quarters. Mr. Chillemi is showing the company space around the city. Once it settles, he will tell Mr. Winter, who will probably handle the move. Both men will probably steer business to Ms. Hullinghorst or to Mr. Cohen. 
 Indeed, Mr. Chillemi is already mentally making connections. "They'll need an architect and an engineer, and of course a telephone person," he said.
What is the link between people in such disparate fields? They belong to an organized group of 40 or so people in complementary but noncompeting businesses that have turned networking into a fine science.
David Glickman, the network's sole electrical engineer, recommends Ms. Hullinghorst, who works for Business Technology Partners, to people looking for a technology engineer, and she sends potential clients to him. If Mr. Chillemi's clients at CB Richard Ellis need an architect, he gives Jeffrey Kleinberg of MKDA first crack at the job. They may move to Lower Manhattan? That calls for Salim Ismail, whose specialty is helping companies get incentives the city is offering to draw business back downtown. What if the client wants to publicize the move? Time to call in Bambe Levine, a public relations specialist who is one of the group's newest members.
"It's a snowballing concept that really works," Mr. Chillemi said.
It does so despite having no dues, no formal charter, not even a name. Members tend to refer to it as "our group" or "our network," and Mr. Cohen, who owns Leonard Martin Office Products and is the group's founder, sees no need to change that. "Why do we need a name, so people can sue us?" he asked.
The name is probably the only thing about the group that is unscripted. Every other Thursday at 8 a.m., its members file into a board room in the Chrysler Building, which they borrow from the law firm Parker Chapin, whose partners sometimes attend. Over coffee and bagels, they sit down and start the routine.
Members and guests -- there are always a couple wanting to join -- introduce themselves, and give thumbnail sketches of what they do. Then, two members, different ones each time, give talks about their businesses. People then thank those who gave them recent referrals. The group takes a few minutes to tie up loose ends and to discuss new business, and it's out the door.
"That agenda is geared toward just one thing, expanding everyone's revenue stream," said Gail Z. Koch, a new member who owns the executive recruiting firm Comsearch.
A lot more people are clamoring to join, Mr. Cohen said, and almost no one misses meetings these days. Besides business leads, there is a bit of group therapy involved. "The worse the economy gets, the more people want to huddle," Mr. Cohen said. The meetings themselves remain inexorably tuned to drumming up business instead of to commiseration and handing out succor. It is Mr. Cohen's way of differentiating his group from all the other networking groups he has joined over the years. "I got to a lot of nice parties," he said, "but I didn't get much business."
The problem, he came to think, was the way the groups were structured. Because they charged dues, they needed more members. As a result, they would accept direct competitors and novices. Their events were attended by so many people that it took a maximum amount of chatter to generate a minimum number of business leads. The people who ran the groups rarely cared much if members showed up, or generated leads, as long as their dues were paid.
Expenses in Mr. Cohen's group are minimal because each meeting's speakers pay for the refreshments and members get their companies or clients to donate meeting space; for now, it's Parker Chapin.
Any member who misses six meetings in a year without a reasonable excuse is booted out. So are members who do not generate business. And the rules are enforced. The group has ousted nearly 20 people in its five years of existence. It recently kicked out an accountant who ran a 50-member firm yet provided no leads. It rejected an architect whose area of expertise bumped up against that of another architect in the group. ("Everyone liked her," Mr. Glickman said. "It was a shame.")
Rules can be bent, though. Several members have withheld recommendations from members who seemed wrong for a particular job. "I won't jeopardize a relationship with a client just to make a referral," Ms. Hullinghorst said. And, while the group is ostensibly for small-business owners, it accepted Moshe Jacobs, a fund-raiser for the Jerusalem College of Technology and a self-described master networker. "I introduce people almost intuitively," he said.
Mr. Cohen reckons that he has gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars in referral business from the group, and figures that he has given out more than $1 million. Mr. Glickman, who joined less than three years ago, says the network has led him to $100,000 to $200,000 in business.
"A new client called me last week, and said he'd gotten my name from three people," Mr. Glickman said. "Two of them were in this group."

HEADLINE: Mt. Sinai on a Path Away From the Past 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT with MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
It is hardly a secret that this has been a tumultuous year for Mount Sinai, the megaplex medical center on the cusp of East Harlem and the Upper East Side, long a source of everything from high-tech medicine to physician education to subsidized care for the poor. 
 But the replacement of the hospital's president last week was the clearest signal yet of the board's desire for a new direction. 
 In his many years at Mount Sinai, the former president, Barry R. Freedman, played a central role in the medical center's precipitously shifting fortunes, from ambitious building programs to the troubled merger with the New York University Medical Center. Now, struggling with an operating-budget deficit of more than $100 million for the hospital and the medical school combined, Mount Sinai is in the midst of a series of changes that its leaders say are intended to break with the recent past. 
In replacing Mr. Freedman with Dr. Larry Hollier, a senior vice president and chief of surgery, Mount Sinai's trustees said they were seeking to remake the hospital as more of a "physician-led institution." The details of the medical center's new direction will not be made public until next month, officials say. 
Still, that process has been gathering force -- although painfully and haltingly -- since the hiring of outside consultants and the arrival in April of a new chief executive for Mount Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Kenneth I. Berns. 
There have been a number of shifts in the leadership of the trustees and administration, including the appointment of a new chief financial officer. At the same time, armed with the consultants' 7,000-page report, Mount Sinai has begun to impose a new fiscal austerity -- closing outpatient clinics, laying off hundreds of workers, and adopting a tighter-fisted approach to physician and faculty pay. 
All of this comes amid a state investigation stemming from the worst blow to Mount Sinai's image in years: the death in January of a liver donor left, after major surgery, in the care of what the state Health Department said was an overworked, undersupervised and relatively inexperienced staff.
Administrators attribute the center's fiscal problems largely to changes in health care financing and reimbursement. Even so, some of them acknowledge that the fiscal crisis is at least partly of Mount Sinai's own making. The new economics have squeezed all of the nation's teaching hospitals, and especially those in New York. But the roughly $700 million in bonds that Mount Sinai Hospital and three of the N.Y.U. hospitals raised jointly are now considered of the lowest investment grade by two of three rating agencies. 
Some officials say that Mr. Freedman and other executives were slow to respond to early signs of trouble several years ago. At the time, they say, the leadership was distracted by the merger with N.Y.U., which many officials say has failed to produce the gains that had been expected and which would have come undone if not for the bonds held jointly by the two institutions. Then, these officials say, the departure of Mount Sinai's chief executive, Dr. John Rowe, followed by a lengthy interregnum, made it far harder to take decisive action to control growing losses. 
One indication of the trustees' concern comes from its decision to hire the outside consultants, the Hunter Group, known for coming in "when a management is in trouble with the board and the board is looking around for help," according to Gary I. Filerman, a professor of health care management at Georgetown University. 
Mr. Freedman had been associated with Mount Sinai for 25 years, many of them in top leadership positions. During his tenure, the hospital began an ambitious building program, increased patient admissions and, for a time, cut the average length of their stays, increasing revenues. Mr. Freedman was also one of the hospital executives who devised the merger with N.Y.U.
He did not have a lot of visibility, but within the health care economy, he was powerful. Since 1996, he has served on the board of Premier Inc., a privately held company that helps a quarter of the nation's hospitals -- including Mount Sinai -- buy billions of dollars' worth of hospital supplies each year. In 2000, Mr. Freedman became Premier's lead director, its second most powerful governing official after the chairman. 
In recent months, several federal agencies have begun examining, among other things, whether Premier and similar buying groups have effectively colluded with large medical-supply companies to eliminate competition in the hospital-supply market. In response to pressure from a Senate subcommittee, Premier recently promised to change the ways it does business.

Austerity vs. Executive Pay
 At Mount Sinai, the current climate of austerity casts an uncomfortable light on the medical center's executive compensation, especially given its nonprofit status. The salaries of its top executives, said Mr. Filerman of Georgetown, are considered among the highest in the nation's hospital industry. Also, Internal Revenue Service records show that most of the top tier of executives received substantial pay increases in 1999, as Mount Sinai was promising the public that the merger with N.Y.U. would improve its fiscal condition. 
For example, the former chief executive, Dr. Rowe, received $1.4 million in 1998, the year the merger was consummated. The next year, his last full year at Mount Sinai, he was paid $1.9 million. The federal records also show that he had an interest-free housing loan of $2.25 million. 
Mr. Freedman was paid $1.1 million in 1998, $1.3 million in 1999 and slightly less the next year, the most recent for which records were available. 
A Mount Sinai spokeswoman, Lucia Lee, said that while she could not provide specific numbers, "we're not the highest, as far as our salary goes" among medical centers in the New York area. Of the loan to Dr. Rowe, she said many medical schools offered them, to attract top talent. It has been paid back in full, she added. 
Mr. Freedman would not discuss his departure or his compensation.
The ascent of Dr. Hollier, who was already on the payroll, is likely to be a cost saving in itself. But more significantly, as with the hiring of the Hunter Group, the appointment of a physician is also intended to have political and symbolic value. 
An executive vice president of the medical center, Dr. Gary Rosenberg, said the importance of a physician-run structure "has to do with the nature of how one makes change with physicians." He suggested that it would be easier to convince reluctant physicians of the need for change if physicians were in charge. 
The current situation has only heightened the inherent tensions between Mount Sinai's fiscal imperatives and its diverse agenda of teaching, research and service. 
"Obviously, if you go broke, you can't fulfill any of those missions," Dr. Berns said in an interview early this summer. But behaving more like a business presents its own problems. "The challenge then becomes how you remember that you're supposed to be an academic institution," he said.

Consultant's findings
 As it seeks to balance those interests, Mount Sinai is being guided by recommendations of the Hunter Group, which called for changes in everything from how supplies are purchased to how doctors are paid. Officials declined to make the report public. But conversations with several people who have seen it make clear that more than a few things operated at less than optimum efficiency. For example, Mount Sinai had been losing $10 million a year in uncollected revenue because of inadequate billing, Dr. Rosenberg said. The hospital, he said, is changing that.
The hospital is also trying to rein in the cost, which it pays, of patients kept in the hospital longer than insurers allow. Its average length of stay is longer than most hospitals' -- partly because its patients tend to be sicker, but also because of inefficiencies that are common, some say inherent, in teaching hospitals. Administrators say they have made progress but want to cut the average by 10 percent more. 
At the same time, the emergency room, primary-care physician to many of the poor, is severely overtaxed. Built to handle 35,000 visits a year, it now receives twice that number, and the resulting congestion can mean unnecessarily long waits. 
Amid all the talk of cutbacks and efficiency, administrators say they are also trying to create new sources of revenue. Most notably, they recently spent what Dr. Berns described succinctly as "a bundle" to recruit a high-profile team of four heart surgeons from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and build them new operating rooms. 
Still, economy is generally the order of the day. About 700 positions in the hospital and 150 in the medical school have been eliminated, Dr. Rosenberg said. (Because some were unfilled, he said, the actual drop in employees is less.) He said the positions were mostly in management and building service, along with a handful of nursing positions in ambulatory care. At least immediately after the layoffs, medical center administrators said that parts of the hospital -- although not patient rooms -- had become noticeably dirtier. Offices were being cleaned less often, and faculty members and executives were told to put their trash outside their offices for pickup.

Restructuring at Clinics
 Perhaps the most visible cuts and restructuring have involved a central element of Mount Sinai's community-service mission: the 165 outpatient clinics run by Mount Sinai faculty and staffed by doctors in training. Mostly based at the hospital, the clinics receive nearly 400,000 visits a year, largely from patients on Medicaid or with little or no insurance to cover the cost. The clinics have been hemorrhaging money. 
To begin cutting those losses, Mount Sinai shut down its Communication Disorders Center, which for nearly three decades had treated children and some adults with speech and language disorders. 
To try to reduce the costs of outpatient pediatric services, Mount Sinai is shifting as many as 5,000 low-income patients to community clinics in Harlem and the Bronx staffed by Mount Sinai doctors but run by the Children's Aid Society.
And the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, with 100,000 visits a year and a staff of more than 100, was informed that the medical center could no longer cover its $5 million annual deficit. Dr. Angela Diaz, the center's director, has cut staff, increased doctors' caseloads, organized fund-raisers and lobbied legislators. She said the center was "pretty much breaking even."
While those programs serve mostly low-income patients, Mount Sinai also recently shut its Women's Health Program, a comprehensive health program that in many ways resembled a private group practice. Opened in 1994, it was targeted at the more lucrative middle- and upper-middle-class market. Yet it was never profitable. The hospital also recently closed its diabetes clinic.
Virtually all teaching hospitals are subject to a host of economic constraints -- increasingly tight limits on Medicare spending, the policies of managed care companies, labor shortages and rising pharmaceutical and malpractice insurance costs. 
But Mount Sinai administrators often point out that they face special burdens. Largely because of geography, a high percentage of its patients are underinsured or uninsured: 25 percent to 30 percent of all inpatients and, administrators say, virtually all who use its outpatient clinics. 
Furthermore, they say, the hospital is reimbursed for its Medicaid outpatient visits at a rate lower than that of some comparable hospitals and even some community clinics. A spokesman for the state Health Department said Mount Sinai's outpatient Medicaid reimbursement rate, like those of other hospitals, is based on a formula plus an estimate of current capital costs.

Death After Transplant
 Adding to the medical center's woes is the case of Mike Hurewitz, the 57-year-old man who died three days after donating part of his liver to his brother. The state Health Department imposed the maximum fine, $48,000, and banned the hospital from doing live-donor liver transplants for six months. 
Though Mount Sinai administrators and physicians say it remains unclear exactly how Mr. Hurewitz developed the infection that apparently led to his death, and though they say they do not believe the hospital could have prevented his death, they have increased the number of nurses on the transplant unit and changed their procedures on orders from the Health Department. 
The continuing state investigation has since expanded to 125 cases or confidential complaints made in the wake of Mr. Hurewitz's death. Most involve the liver transplant unit, though some involve other services. 
Asked about the case's impact on the hospital, Dr. Berns said recently, "I think it brought home the realization that a lot more attention had to be paid to patient care here."

HEADLINE: Judge Changes Mind On Murder Case Costs 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: McARTHUR, Ohio, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
A judge is allowing prosecutors to seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a college student, reversing his earlier judgment that it would be too expensive.
 The judge, Jeffrey L. Simmons of the Court of Common Pleas in Vinton County, ruled this month that financial considerations could compromise the due-process rights of the defendant, Gregory McKnight. 
But in a one-page ruling on Friday, Judge Simmons dismissed those concerns. 
 The judge ruled minutes after an appeals court dismissed the prosecutor's appeal of the decision. The prosecutor, Timothy Gleeson, had also asked Judge Simmons to reconsider.
Mr. Gleeson, referring to small counties, said he hoped "the legislature will find a solution to allow counties to prosecute such cases." 
Vinton, in southern Ohio, is the state's most sparsely populated county, with about 12,800 people. Its unemployment rate is usually double the state average.
Judge Simmons said in his earlier ruling that paying for Mr. McKnight's defense against the death penalty would deplete the county's $2.7 million general fund budget. A county commissioner, Michael Bledsoe, said the county would find the money.

HEADLINE: Must Speed Process Of Meeting Energy Needs 

 BODY:
 Despite the economic downturn, New York will still require more than 7,000 megawatts of additional power by 2005. To avert the threat of blackouts, we need to take decisive action now. 
The state needs to ensure we have a reliable electricity system by facilitating the development of sufficient power supply. The state is currently reviewing permits for many power projects throughout the New York. However, many of these projects are at risk of not being approved and constructed. This risk is a result of the state's cumbersome permitting process and of the growing challenges of the softer economy and the corresponding increased difficulty in financing such facilities. 
 At least one power generation facility on Long Island is successfully making its way through the state permitting process and has just received a recommendation from hearing officers presiding over the case. American National Power's proposed Brookhaven Energy Project, a 500-megawatt, natural gas-fired, combined cycle facility, would use state of the art technology and equipment, making it one of the most efficient and environmentally sound projects in New York.
The development of this and other highly efficient generation facilities will also lead to increased competition for electricity, driving down prices in a region with some of the highest electrical rates in the country.
In addition, electrical generators like the Brookhaven Energy project contribute significant local benefits, including local taxes and employment. The Brookhaven project alone is estimated to create 700 construction jobs during times of peak construction and about 25 full-time employees to run it.
I call on state officials to facilitate the development and construction of the Brookhaven Energy facility and other similar power generators.

For Job Seekers, an Edge (a Sharp One)

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
It is soooo tempting to make fun of Career Gear, at least at first. How else to respond to a charity with a new program to help the jobless by giving them (drumroll. ..) free haircuts.
 But the story behind the barbershop Bargain is actually rather poignant - and it offers some insights into the changing challenges fo assisting unemployed New Yorkers in the current economy. 
 More than three years ago, when Gary Field founded Career Gear in Manhattan, New York City's economy was booming. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that if you were breathing and could speak English, you could find work. 
 So perhaps it made sense that both the city goverment and nonprofit agencies concentrated their efforts on a small but important group of the unemployed: those on welfare or those with serious problems that made finding a job especially hard.
 This troubled group, of the male variety, makes up Mr. Field's clientele. Men who just got out of prison, men struggling with drugs or alcohol, men with various kinds of disabilities. Back then, jobs were out there for them; the tough part was getting them ready to do the work.
 One of the problems these men have is coming up with appropriate clothes to wear to an interview. "Some of them haven't worn a suit since they were five," Mr. Field said.
 He knows the problem, because he had to buy a used suit and a preworn pair of shoes when he started looking for a job more than a decade ago. He was 32, on public assistance and, he said, "my life was a mess." After waiting tables and working as a receptionist, he helped come up with a plan to help other men in the same straits.
 Social service agencies refer unemployed men who have been through job training and have an employment interview scheduled to Career Gear. The agency fits them with an appropriate ensemble, whether it is a suit from Brooks Brothers ( a big benefactor) or a more casual work outfit. Along the way, it als provides advice and counseling.
 "In the scheme of things, a haircut sounds kind of ridiculous," Mr. Field said. But it is just the newest part of a packcage to, as Oprah might say, boost self-esteem.
 These days, however, the unemployed need far more than just self-esteem. New York City has lost almost 84,000 jobs in the last 12 months, a fewer people have jobs now than they did at this time in 1999, Career Gear's first summer of operation.
 The unemployment rate shot up to 8 percent in May and June, from a low of 5.3 percent in March 2001, according to the New York State Department of Labor. And while the rate edged down a bit in July 2002, to 7.7 percent, economists say that is probably because some job seekers were so discouraged by bad economic news that they stopped looking for work, and so were no longer officially counted as unemployed.
 But there are still a lot of people - almost 300,000 - looking for work in New York City now, according to government estimates, maybe tens of thousands more than last year.
 What this means for Mr. Field's clients is that they have to compete for jobs with people who have college degrees and good work records, he said, adding. "The folks with less education, less of a chance, have even less of a chance now."
 In a tough economy, helping such people has become more of a challenge - but so has helping all unemployed New Yorkers, said Neil Scott Kleiman, director of the Center for an Urban Future, a research group, and an expert on the city's efforts to assist the unemployed.
 Furthermore, workforce development - making sure there are enough skilled workers to attract employers - has become crucial to the city as it struggles to keep businesses from leaving in the wake of Sept. 11. The Bloomberg administration is clearly rethinking the "get 'em off welfare" focus its predecessor, Mr. Kleiman said, but figuring out what to do will not be easy, in part because so many traditional job-training programs have not helped people find work.
 But if one thing stands out, Mr. Kleiman said, it is that education pays off. "It is impossible to get a well-paying job in New York without an associate's degree," he said.
 Education worked for Mr. Field, who now has a master's degree in social work. He was already in his 30's when he began attending the Borough of Manhattan Community College "with a million 18-year-olds," he said. "It was very humbling. But that is where I needed to start."

An L. L. Bean Life Style on a Wal-Mart Paycheck

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
WHEN your property taxes finally hit the five digits, as mine did recently, you know you have entered a whole new ballgame.
 A ballgame, perhaps, in which the other team has Derek Jeter and Jason Giambi and your infield just came by bus from Lodi. 
 New Jersey Policy Perspectives, a research organization, came out with a report this summer called Fiscal Stress, which basically concluded that the entire state will end up like Camden if it doesn't fix a tax structure that allows so many different town and county governments to replicate services, and that relies so heavily on local property taxes.
When I talked to Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspectives, he was hardly reassuring. 
Take my minuscule town of Glen Ridge, which to Mr. Shure's way of thinking is a classic example of a town that doesn't have a right to exist at all.
"You might have a house you like in a neighborhood you like," he said, "but your town's got fiscal stress and you've got fiscal stress trying to live there."
Tell me about it. And from what I can tell, I'm not alone but right in the middle of the once-comfortable middle class and being squeezed like the third person in the middle of a New Jersey Transit train seat.
Maybe life is expensive because you can't live an L. L. Bean life style on a Wal-Mart paycheck. In case you haven't noticed, New Jersey -- where people used to skulk off to if they couldn't afford Connecticut or Westchester or even parts of Long island -- isn't cheap anymore. The days of $7.50 Springsteen tickets are over. Heck, even Asbury Park isn't cheap; I just heard about someone who bought a loft there for $400,000, though I can't vouch for her mental state.
I mean, if you can't stand the price of sushi, maybe it's time to get back in the kitchen.
So while I wait for enlightened political leadership, I thought I'd follow the example of Charles B. Darrow, who invented Monopoly during the Depression while he was unemployed. My game is called Suburbopoly, New Jersey Edition.
OBJECT: Live in a leafy neighborhood with good schools and go on vacation at least two weeks a year.
EQUIPMENT: A board, dice, tokens, 32 houses and 2 bed-and-breakfasts. There are Chance and Community Chest cards and all the currency is credit-card-style plastic.
PROPERTY: The board starts with condominiums, works up through split levels, Colonials, Tudors, Victorians and McMansions and culminates in actual mansions in Rumson. Players who lose their property are forced to move in with their parents in Boca Raton. Game over.
PROPERTY TAXES: Start at $6,500 and go up by a couple thousand dollars every time you you pass Go.
UTILITIES: In addition to water (which you are not allowed to use) and electricity (which may not always be there at the flip of a switch), there is E-ZPass, Poland Spring, Gym Membership, High-Speed Internet Access, Cellphone, Landscape Service, Weekly Maid, Cable TV, HBO, Karate Lessons, Orthodontia and Car Insurance.
Every time you land on one of these utilities, except Car Insurance, you pay 10 times the amount of dice rolled. If you land on Car Insurance, you pay 20 times the amount rolled. Two speeding tickets and you are out of the game.
RAILROADS: There are only two railroads, Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. If you land on New Jersey Transit, you pay $6 for a ride from Metro Park to New York City. If you land on Amtrak, you pay $28 and everyone else is assessed $100.
SO SUE ME: There is no jail in Suburbopoly, only court. If you draw a So Sue Me card, you pay thousands of dollars in legal fees for the rest of the game.
CHANCE and COMMUNITY CHEST: These represent the little vagaries of life that make suburban living so much fun. For example, you are invited to an out-of-town wedding; pay $1,000. Swimming pool filter breaks; pay $1,000. Oil change and a few other things the dealer says need to be done to keep your warranty in effect; pay $400. Restoration Hardware catalog comes; pay $600. Your daughter marries: pay $30,000. Homestead Tax Rebate, collect $67.
FREE LUNCH: There is no free lunch, only cheese samples at Whole Foods.
THE PLAY: Players who refinance their mortgages, avoid speeding tickets, send their children to college and marry them off are eligible to sell their property. The first player to sell the house and move out of New Jersey wins.

Slimmer, Costlier, Artsier: The Bloomberg Green Book

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Mayor Bloomberg has put his stamp on the Tweed Courthouse, smokers' wallets and recycling bins. Now he has left his mark on another New York favorite.
 On Aug. 6, the first Green Book of the Bloomberg administration arrived, committing to print the names, job titles and telephone numbers of everyone under his watch. The tradition dates to 1918, but the new edition is also notable for what it might say about Mr. Bloomberg's style. 
 This year's cover, a playful illustration of the Statue of Liberty, was drawn by the artist and AIDS activist Keith Haring. The previous mayor was given to baseball tableaus and picking fights with artists and AIDS activists. 
"He's made it a point to bring art into the administration," said Megan Sheekey, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg. "Haring is an extremely New York artist."
At 658 pages, the new Green Book is a hair slimmer than last year's edition, a nod perhaps to the mayor's prescribed staff cuts. The price has gone up, too. It costs $19.95, $4 more than it had the last six years. Inflation and rising printing costs contribute, but as any budget watcher knows, City Hall is pressed for cash these days. 
"It's still a bargain," said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
Putting out the book this year was further complicated by the mayoral change and the shuffling of phone numbers and offices after Sept. 11. That might explain some curious omissions. 
"I'm not in there," said Steward Desmond, the deputy advocate for communications for Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, who has been sparring with Mr. Bloomberg about mayoral succession. "I don't think it's aimed at the public advocate's office. Perhaps I'm not important enough."
The paperback volume, known officially as the 2002-2003 Green Book: Official Directory of the City of New York, is a must-have for civil servants, advocates and many businesses. For newspaper reporters, it receives as much abuse as the backspace key.
"We require all our students to have it," said Samuel G. Freedman, the interim associate dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism. "Mine is filled with scribbles, updated numbers and Post-It notes."
The book is sold at the two City Stores, at 1 Center Street and the Times Square Visitors Center, as well as online and via telephone. More than 9,000 copies had been sold as of last week.
"It's the most popular book in New York City right now." said a clerk at the downtown City Store. DENNY LEE

GRAPHIC: Photo: The latest Green Book features a cover drawing by Keith Haring. Chart: "JUST THE FACTS -- Green Revolution"The first Green Book was published in 1918 under Mayor John F. Hylan. The directory was always referred to as the Green Book because of the covers color, but the name didn't become official until 1984. The 1957 Green Book featured the traditional green color, but with a velvet cover. The fiscal crisis of the 1970's prohibited annual production of the directory for a number of years. The first fax numbers were included in the 1989-1990 edition, while Internet addresses were first included in the 1996-1997 edition. Starting with the 1994-1995 edition, the Green Book increased in size by 20% to make it easier to read.

The Fringe Is Full of Ideas

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
MANY ideas and products that were once considered deviant, at least to some eyes, are now solidly in the mainstream -- professional wrestling, snowboarding, jazz, Victoria's Secret lingerie and Viagra, to cite just a few. And many entrepreneurs who were considered a bit odd at first went on to create large, successful companies -- including Richard Branson of the Virgin Group, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Ray Kroc of McDonald's and Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores.
 How business ideas move from the edge to the mainstream and how companies can profit from the process are the subjects of an intriguing new book, "The Deviant's Advantage: How Fringe Ideas Create Mass Markets," by Ryan Mathews and Watts Wacker (Crown Business, $25.95). 
 The authors, childhood friends who grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, are futurists at First Matter, a trend-watching firm based in Westport, Conn. They have been profiled in Fast Company and Wired, among others, but haven't exactly been household-name consultants. Their past client list, however, is impressive -- British Airways, General Motors, Hallmark Cards, I.B.M., Marriott International, Procter & Gamble, Sara Lee, Sony and even the United States Navy. 
Mr. Mathews and Mr. Wacker say they recognize that not all deviance is good. "Of course, there is positive and negative deviance -- the former a force for transformation, the latter a source of unspeakable evil," they write. They focus on the positive kind, which they say offers "an inexhaustible font of new ideas, products, and services and, in the end, is the source of all innovation, new-market creation and, for business, ultimately represents the basis of all incremental profit."
Their term for the voice of positive deviance is the "devox." In their lexicon, the devox helps ideas move along a progression: from the Fringe to the Edge, then to the Realm of the Cool, then to the Next Big Thing and finally to Social Convention. Ideas are sanitized as they move toward the center and the mass market. Consider how clothing and shoe styles from economically depressed inner cities are translated into what affluent suburban children wear. Ultimately, ideas that go from the fringe to the mainstream may be displaced if they've become too establishment.
The challenge for business, then, is how to manage the fringe -- how to recognize positive deviant ideas and move them toward the market. Language is hugely important in these processes because it often defines what is acceptable to a society. The language can change or even eliminate the obstacles that made a product's acceptability difficult. The authors call that the "abolition of context."
Who would have thought, for example, that Pfizer could take a problem known as "erectile dysfunction" and turn it into an openly discussed syndrome? Language and context were crucial to the company's ability to create a hit with Viagra. "Previous generations accepted a loss of sexual interest or performance as a normal consequence of aging," Mr. Mathews and Mr. Wacker write. "However, the significant extension of the average life span and the abolition of context of the traditional view of aging have sexualized old age." 
At one time, it would also have been inconceivable that a national politician, Bob Dole, would appear on television to promote such a product. There again, the social and attitudinal context has changed. In his most recent commercials for Viagra, Mr. Dole even jokes about the pill as his "little blue friend."
Smart companies realize that language is power. McDonald's owns the intellectual property of 131 words and phrases like Big Mac and Happy Meal, as well as to lesser-known terms like McSwing, an ice cream desert sold at McDonald's in Argentina, and McBaby, a lifelike computerized mannequin that recreates chewing and swallowing functions and was donated by the company last year to the Consumer Product Safety Commission for product testing.
Intel was able to use a simple phrase, "Intel Inside," to build brand awareness, the authors say, "in the minds of people who really didn't understand or fully appreciate the difference between a microchip and a potato chip." Slightly more seriously, they argue: "In a world where the lines separating phrase making and market making are so fragile as to be barely perceptible, business has a unique opportunity to manipulate the abolition of linguistic context to its own commercial advantage."
Over all, the authors take an anthropological approach to corporate innovation that is refreshing. "All business problems are really culture problems, in more than one sense of the word," the authors write. "In one American company after another, corporate culture acts as an organizational prophylactic, protecting business-as-usual businesses from being infected by new opportunities." They add that corporate culture "hates the devox and works tirelessly to eliminate deviant employees."
CORPORATIONS, they write, have "antibodies" that resist hiring people who are too deviant or drive them out if they persist in thinking that is considered odd. One example is how Xerox ignored great ideas, like one for the computer mouse, that came out of the company's own Palo Alto Research Center in California. Instead of embracing the new, Xerox let Microsoft and Apple Computer take the ideas and make billions of dollars off of them.
When a company works correctly, the authors say, it attracts some deviants and gives them a cause to embrace. Sometimes, as with the original Ben & Jerry's, Tom's of Maine, Planned Parenthood and other groups, "dedication to a cause translates directly into dedication to an organization," Mr. Mathews and Mr. Wacker contend. "So rather than worrying about how deviant employees love, find out what they love and embrace it," the writers add. "Celebrate deviance."
This is mostly fresh thinking, but the book suffers when the authors wander into a pretentious history of science and art, all aimed at showing how the devox shaped everyone from Socrates to Newton. They're prone to use irritatingly constructed words like "cyptomysticism" and "autocatalytic." They also are less than convincing when they veer into sweeping discussions of politics and the news media.
Moreover, the serious business reader will come away a bit hungry for more detailed prescriptions about how an established company can "dance with the devox." How does a company create a process in which the best ideas from outside are funneled through research into manufacturing and then to marketing and sales? How do you compensate the deviants? How do you arrange the interactions of Ph.D. deviants and a sales force that is focused on profit? All these are problems for even the most innovative American companies.
The book also doesn't offer many tips about how companies can resist negative deviance, a la Enron. 
But the reader should be inclined to forgive these transgressions. Over all, the book is written in an engaging and often humorous way with a minimum of consultant-speak. One specific management technique recommended by the authors is an "opposites analysis," in effect an exercise in which corporate leaders must contemplate what they have never contemplated before (a joint venture with a bitter rival, for example). The heart of their consulting style is to expose corporate insiders to outside thinkers who challenge the company's internal orthodoxy by asking questions of Zen-like simplicity.
All this is aimed at helping top management break out of isolation. "Most of us learned to manage from the center, bringing everything into a stable environment where it can be standardized and processed," the authors write. "The real trick is to manage the Edge, not the center. The 'real deal' is out there somewhere, raw, messy and untamed." To capture it, they write, "requires a constant exposure to ideas and people that are foreign and uncomfortable and, sometimes, downright hostile and threatening." And they aren't referring to investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
During a time of corporate scandals, "Deviant's Advantage" may help jolt some executives back on the path toward positive deviance.

HEADLINE: The World; 
A New Villain in Free Trade: The Farmer on the Dole

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN diplomats, world leaders and economists meet in Johannesburg this week to figure out how to help struggling countries, they will be slinging darts at a brand new villain: the big American grain farmer.
 Deserved or not, this year the big American farmers were transformed seemingly overnight from benevolent producers of the world's greatest bounty to unfair competition -- greedy welfare kings undermining poor farmers in Africa, Latin America and Asia. 
 The criticism has nothing to do with famine relief, but with American farmers selling their subsidized grain below cost to the rising middle class overseas, much like countries that the United States accuses of dumping their underpriced steel here.
"It's fairly straightforward," said Pranab Bardhan, professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley. "The subsidies encourage overproduction, which depresses prices and leads to a kind of dumping of low-priced grain on the world market. The only people who will be hurt from these subsidies, who will really go hungry, are the poorest people in the developing countries." 
In May, President Bush signed the $190 billion 10-year farm bill that will continue to give the nation's biggest farmers $19 billion in subsidies, perpetuating a Depression-era program of direct financial aid to encourage production of grain and cotton. Some critics call that a welfare system, and some of the most important developing nations with big agricultural exports -- Brazil, Thailand and South Africa -- spoke up loudly, charging the Bush administration with hypocrisy.
They complained that one minute the United States says it wants developing countries to rely on free trade rather than handouts, the next it enacts a law, which they say is the biggest impediment in the free trade of food, the one commodity all these countries produce.
These countries had hoped that Mr. Bush, an avowed free-trader, would reduce the American farm subsidies and shame the European nations to follow his lead and reduce theirs as well. The European Union gives its farmers $60 billion in annual subsidies, which cause similar problems for developing countries. Japan subsidizes its rice growers, too, but with fewer repercussions on the world market.
Thailand, which exports $40 billion of fruits, vegetables, fish, rice and other food, sent a delegation of farmers and parliamentarians to Washington in June to protest the new farm subsidies. 
"This is the way of rich countries," said Prakarn Virakul, the agricultural attache of the Thai Embassy in Washington, who accompanied the farmers on their visit. "They tell us to open our markets; we do but they don't stop giving their farmers subsidies. Now American farmers will be given money to grow cheap rice and push down the world price for the next six years. That pushes our poorest farmers out of business."
When he speaks of American farmers, however, he does not mean the farmers who grow the food Americans eat -- farmers of fruits and vegetables as well as ranchers. They do not receive a penny of federal subsidies.
"There is now a complete disconnect between farm policy and what people actually eat," said Timothy E. Josling, a Stanford professor who specializes in agriculture and trade. "The subsidies support what was historically the most important part of American agriculture but not what people spend their food dollar on today."
With the federal budget tumbling into deficits, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and one of the few farmers in Congress, sided with the little farmers and denounced the subsidies. "These subsidies are destroying small family farmers, not helping them," he said, adding, "We've got food coming out of our ears."
At the end of the debate, Mr. Lugar and his allies were easily defeated.
The reason is politics. In this election year, Senate Democrats and House Republicans marshaled votes for the bill, hoping to appeal to the farm bloc and hang on to the majorities in their respective chambers.
In hindsight, this argument was merely a rehearsal for the current global debate.
In Congress proponents of the farm law argued that without subsidies indebted family farmers would be run off their homesteads.
Twenty or 30 years ago, farm policy actually had something to do with feeding the country. It was designed to ensure food security by continuing the Depression-era program to pay big grain farmers to grow food. But today there is no need to ensure food security. The United States has been self-sufficient in food for decades. 
Early in the farm bill debate, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman raised questions about fairness. There are more than two million grain and cotton farmers who receive free government subsidies, but only 10 percent of them get 69 percent of the $19 billion every year.
According to Agriculture Department statistics, these big farmers used their government checks to expand their acreage, buying small neighboring farms, and increased their production, which pushes down the world market price. They are still profitable, because government subsidies make up the difference. But the grain farmer in Asia, Africa or South America without subsidies has no defense against world grain markets, which are at historic lows.
For its part, the Bush administration is trying to find a compromise. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, proposed breaking the deadlock between farmers in rich countries and those from developing nations by first eliminating export tariffs on agricultural goods and putting a tighter cap on subsidies rich countries pay their farmers. "This is a reform long demanded by developing countries, which rightly resent having to compete not only with internal agriculture supports but also with the lavish subsidies some developed countries used to pay others to buy their food," Mr. Zoellick said.
IN poorer countries where two-thirds of the people still live on farms, America's grain subsidies are seen as the equivalent of a declaration of war. 
In the past several years, these developing countries have dropped barriers and opened their markets in the belief that free trade, not reliance on handouts, is the best way to climb out of poverty. This June, the administration promised aid at a conference in Mexico to countries that followed the free trade route.
The new farm law is seen as a betrayal of those promises and of these developing countries' attempts to beef up their own agriculture and feed their people. The United States, Europe and Japan spend $1 billion a day to support their farmers or about six times the aid payments they send to the developing world, which is desperate for help to build up its agriculture.
Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said at the World Summit on Hunger this summer: "You put yourself in the shoes of a small developing country which cannot export its agriculture products because of restrictions and tariffs, a small developing country that cannot compete on the world market even if it could export, because the richer farmers in the richer countries are heavily subsidized.
"There is no point in giving with one hand and taking it with the other."

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Change a Regime 

BYLINE:  By James A. Baker III; James A. Baker III was secretary of state from 1989 to 1992.

DATELINE: PINEDALE, Wyo. 

 BODY:
While there may be little evidence that Iraq has ties to Al Qaeda or to the attacks of Sept. 11, there is no question that its present government, under Saddam Hussein, is an outlaw regime, is in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, is embarked upon a program of developing weapons of mass destruction and is a threat to peace and stability, both in the Middle East and, because of the risk of proliferation of these weapons, in other parts of the globe. Peace-loving nations have a moral responsibility to fight against the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by rogues like Saddam Hussein. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to do so, and leading that fight is, and must continue to be, an important foreign policy priority for America.
 And thus regime change in Iraq is the policy of the current administration, just as it was the policy of its predecessor. That being the case, the issue for policymakers to resolve is not whether to use military force to achieve this, but how to go about it. 
 Covert action has been tried before and failed every time. Iraqi opposition groups are not strong enough to get the job done. It will not happen through internal revolt, either of the army or the civilian population. We would have to be extremely lucky to take out the top leadership through insertion into Iraq of a small rapid-strike force. And this last approach carries significant political risks for the administration, as President Jimmy Carter found out in April 1980.
The only realistic way to effect regime change in Iraq is through the application of military force, including sufficient ground troops to occupy the country (including Baghdad), depose the current leadership and install a successor government. Anyone who thinks we can effect regime change in Iraq with anything less than this is simply not realistic. It cannot be done on the cheap. It will require substantial forces and substantial time to put those forces in place to move. We had over 500,000 Americans, and more soldiers from our many allies, for the Persian Gulf war. There will be casualties, probably quite a few more than in that war, since the Iraqis will be fighting to defend their homeland. Sadly, there also will be civilian deaths. We will face the problem of how long to occupy and administer a big, fractious country and what type of government or administration should follow. Finding Saddam Hussein and his top associates will be difficult. It took us two weeks to locate Manuel Noriega in Panama, a small country where we had military bases.
Unless we do it in the right way, there will be costs to other American foreign policy interests, including our relationships with practically all other Arab countries (and even many of our customary allies in Europe and elsewhere) and perhaps even to our top foreign policy priority, the war on terrorism.
Finally, there will be the cost to the American taxpayer of a military undertaking of this magnitude. The Persian Gulf war cost somewhere in the range of $60 billion, but we were able to convince our many allies in that effort to bear the brunt of the costs.
So how should we proceed to effect regime change in Iraq?
Although the United States could certainly succeed, we should try our best not to have to go it alone, and the president should reject the advice of those who counsel doing so. The costs in all areas will be much greater, as will the political risks, both domestic and international, if we end up going it alone or with only one or two other countries.
The president should do his best to stop his advisers and their surrogates from playing out their differences publicly and try to get everybody on the same page.
The United States should advocate the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of a simple and straightforward resolution requiring that Iraq submit to intrusive inspections anytime, anywhere, with no exceptions, and authorizing all necessary means to enforce it. Although it is technically true that the United Nations already has sufficient legal authority to deal with Iraq, the failure to act when Saddam Hussein ejected the inspectors has weakened that authority. Seeking new authorization now is necessary, politically and practically, and will help build international support.
Some will argue, as was done in 1990, that going for United Nations authority and not getting it will weaken our case. I disagree. By proposing to proceed in such a way, we will be doing the right thing, both politically and substantively. We will occupy the moral high ground and put the burden of supporting an outlaw regime and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on any countries that vote no. History will be an unkind judge for those who prefer to do business rather than to do the right thing. And even if the administration fails in the Security Council, it is still free -- citing Iraq's flouting of the international community's resolutions and perhaps Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which guarantees a nation's right to self-defense -- to weigh the costs versus the benefit of going forward alone.
Others will argue that this approach would give Saddam Hussein a way out because he might agree and then begin the "cheat-and-retreat" tactics he used during the first inspection regime. And so we must not be deterred. The first time he resorts to these tactics, we should apply whatever means are necessary to change the regime. And the international community must know during the Security Council debate that this will be our policy.
We should frankly recognize that our problem in accomplishing regime change in Iraq is made more difficult by the way our policy on the Arab-Israeli dispute is perceived around the world. Sadly, in international politics, as in domestic politics, perception is sometimes more important than reality. We cannot allow our policy toward Iraq to be linked to the Arab-Israeli dispute, as Saddam Hussein will cynically demand, just as he did in 1990 and 1991. But to avoid that, we need to move affirmatively, aggressively, and in a fair and balanced way to implement the president's vision for a settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute, as laid out in his June speech. That means, of course, reform by Palestinians and an end to terror tactics. But it also means withdrawal by Israeli forces to positions occupied before September 2000 and an immediate end to settlement activity.
If we are to change the regime in Iraq, we will have to occupy the country militarily. The costs of doing so, politically, economically and in terms of casualties, could be great. They will be lessened if the president brings together an international coalition behind the effort. Doing so would also help in achieving the continuing support of the American people, a necessary prerequisite for any successful foreign policy.

More Thana Sumner Romance, But Not a 50-50 Marriage

BYLINE:  By Geraldine Fabrikant (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE) 

 BODY:
Sumner M. Redstone, the feisty 79-year-old chief executive of Viacom, well known to investors for his infatuation with his company and its stock price, has found another object of affection. 
 He has just become engaged to Paula Fortunato, 41, a New York City schoolteacher whom he has been seeing for the last year and a half. 
"She is lovely," he said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he has just bought a $14 million home from Sylvester Stallone. "She is lovable. She is well educated. She has kids from her classes that would write her and would say they didn't want to go to the next grade because they didn't want to lose her." She has been teaching third grade at Public School 158 on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
 Mr. Redstone has given Ms. Fortunato a diamond engagement ring. "It is a nice-size ring," he said, though he declined to say how large. 
Enamored as he may be, the marriage "does not affect anything on my economic life, and Paula has made it clear she wants nothing from me," he said. Mr. Redstone, Viacom's controlling shareholder, has arranged his financial affairs so that after his death his stake in Viacom goes to the children of his first marriage, which recently ended in divorce.
He said that the wedding, to take place in about six months, would probably be small, and that Ms. Fortunato was taking a year off afterward. Mr. Redstone added that a number of people, including Sherry Lansing, the chairwoman of Paramount Pictures, and Alan C. Greenberg, the retired chairman of Bear Stearns, had offered to give parties for the couple. Geraldine Fabrikant

HEADLINE: Ready to Rebuild, Afghans Await Promised Aid 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: MALIK KHIL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A dozen families have reclaimed their place in this village, a rough spot plowed under by two wars, off a road haunted by rusted Soviet tanks and an old mountain dog with his ears cut off. They came back from exile abroad with promises from the rest of the world that Afghanistan, finally, would be rebuilt. 
 Now the issue is how long they can stay. "Definitely, we are upset," said Akmal Khan, 35, who returned three months ago after 20 years in Pakistan. "We have land but no water. We have no place to live. Winter is coming. How will we stay if we have nothing to eat or no fuel for a fire?" 
 His question cut to the heart of a growing sense of disappointment in Afghanistan: that the outside world has yet to deliver fully on the promises made after the collapse of the Taliban. The issues are many and complicated, but the fledgling government here estimates that only one-third of the $1.8 billion pledged this year has reached Afghanistan. 
That means United Nations agencies that provide food and shelter are cutting services at a time when nearly double the expected number of Afghan refugees are returning home. 
What is more, most of the $560 million spent so far has gone for emergency aid, not for the kind of long-term help that would generate jobs and enable people like Mr. Khan to stay in their ruined villages. 
Aid groups and Afghan officials also point out that after Sept. 11, President Bush and other Western leaders argued that rebuilding a stable Afghanistan was the only way to prevent it from again becoming a breeding ground for terrorists.
"Afghanistan was to have been a very special case, but it's not treated as such," the foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah, said in an interview. "The international community has spent billions of dollars on fighting terrorism, but the real work of creating stability has not begun." 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld echoed that concern recently when he said money pledged to Afghanistan "has not been coming in as fast as it needs to come in." 
But his comments reflected another reality of reconstruction here: that it has become a battlefield. The Afghans blame donor countries. Donor countries grumble that Afghans' expectations are too high and that they understate how much has been provided. The Afghan government, which depends on foreign aid for 80 percent of its budget, is squabbling internally for control of the money. 
Mr. Rumsfeld was apparently taking aim at European donors. The United States says it has delivered roughly $300 million in nonmilitary aid, slightly above what it pledged earlier this year. Many Europeans are in turn urging President Bush to provide more security, to make it easier to deliver aid. 
Mr. Rumsfeld's statement came on a day when Mr. Bush, engaged in a broader budget battle with Congress, held up a bill that included an additional $174 million for reconstruction and refugees.
Despite the delays, no one is calling the mission here a failure. Commitments from nations and from financial institutions like the World Bank run deep, with more money and enthusiasm than in other places, like Africa, with similar needs.
But there is a growing concern here about the effort's slow pace and a lack of commitment to long-term projects. Almost everyone now acknowledges that there is a less hopeful mood than at the conference in Tokyo last January when the world promised $4.5 billion to Afghanistan over the next five years. 
"A sense of depression starts to come in," said Paul Barker, country director in Afghanistan for CARE, one of the largest private aid groups. "I insist on being cautiously optimistic. But sometimes it gets harder." 
The recovery program was ambitious -- and that, aid officials and diplomats say, is one reason for the disappointment. Pledges for assistance typically outstrip what is delivered, aid officials note. 
The effort is aimed at three basic goals, each a major undertaking: providing emergency relief to millions of people; reconstructing the nation's devastated infrastructure; and building up the fragile central government. 
Aid officials, diplomats and government officials acknowledge that only the emergency programs have borne results visible to the Afghan people, and even these programs are beginning to feel the pinch. At least two main United Nations agencies, those that resettle refugees and feed the hungry, have had to scale back because of tens of millions of dollars in unmet pledges. Danger has also curtailed emergency aid programs, with banditry and simmering feuds between armed groups. 
The Afghan government has expressed appreciation for the emergency aid, but it has been arguing with increasing force that more needs to be done quickly, especially in development projects and financial support for the government. 
In a recent report to donor countries, Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank official, suggested that Afghans needed to see more immediate benefits to maintain their support for the campaign against terrorism. "There is a growing perception that reconstruction has not started, while the military campaign is ongoing," he wrote. 
Aid officials and diplomats say that money for the government and long-term projects like roads and electrification is coming in more slowly than they would like. Some contend that donor nations have been holding back because they fear a return to chaos. 
Others say that the immediate priority is to feed and shelter people. "It's not much use having roads if everybody is dead who is going to use them," one Western diplomat said. 
Still others say that long-term projects, by definition, take more time. Julian Wilson, head of operations for the European Commission in Afghanistan, said it had rebuilt or financed 468 schools, 203 clinics and 3 hospitals -- part of the $140 million in projects already in place. An additional $120 million, he said, is in the works, most of it for improving rural infrastructure and building roads. 
"You can see these projects on the ground, but don't expect you will have a major road to Torkham tomorrow," Mr. Wilson said, referring to a city on the border with Pakistan.
Last month, negotiations broke down over a $150 million project to rebuild the vital 300-mile roadway between Kabul, the capital, and Kandahar, the largest city in the south. 
President Hamid Karzai balked at accepting loans as part of the package, a standard arrangement between poor countries and their benefactors. Diplomats say he argued that he could not ask a bankrupt country to accept loans when the outside world had promised so much in outright grants. 
Here in Malik Khil, where the chill of winter has crept into the evening air, many of the successes and failures of aid in Afghanistan are on full display. Most of the village's 100 or so houses were first damaged during the Soviet invasion in the 1980's, then suffered even more when it became a front line between Taliban soldiers and the government in the 1990's. 
Mr. Khan and his family traveled from Pakistan on a United Nations truck. They have been fed with United Nations food, and they earned additional food trading their labor fixing holes in the road. The United Nations donated beams that Mr. Khan is using to rebuild his house. 
But he and his family are not sure what to do next. There is no major construction project to employ them and not enough irrigation canals to water their crops. The worry, aid officials say, is that thousands of refugees who have returned home will now flood into the big cities -- or even back to Pakistan or Iran -- during the winter because they have no way to support themselves. 
"We need work -- in a factory, building roads," said Shamali Khan, 50, who opened a little market in the village after his own return. "Something to help us get along."

HEADLINE: The Environmentalists Are Wrong 

BYLINE:  By Bjorn Lomborg; Bjorn Lomborg is director of the Environmental Assessment Institute in Denmark and author of "The Skeptical Environmentalist."

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
With the opening today of the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, we will be hearing a great deal about both concepts: sustainability and development. Traditionally, the developed nations of the West have shown greater concern for environmental sustainability, while third world countries have a stronger desire for economic development. At big environmental gatherings, it is usually the priorities of the first world that carry the day.
 The challenge in Johannesburg will be whether we can put development ahead of sustainability. If the United States leads the way, the world may finally find the courage to do so. 
 Why does the developed world worry so much about sustainability? Because we constantly hear a litany of how the environment is in poor shape. Natural resources are running out. The population is growing, leaving less and less to eat. Species are becoming extinct in vast numbers. Forests are disappearing. The planet's air and water are getting ever more polluted. Human activity is, in short, defiling the earth -- and as it does so, humanity may end up killing itself.
There is, however, one problem: this litany is not supported by the evidence. Energy and other natural resources have become more abundant, not less so. More food is now produced per capita than at any time in the world's history. Fewer people are starving. Species are, it is true, becoming extinct. But only about 0.7 percent of them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not the 20 percent to 50 percent that some have predicted. Most forms of environmental pollution look as though they have either been exaggerated or are transient -- associated with the early phases of industrialization. They are best cured not by restricting economic growth but by accelerating it.
That we in the West are so willing to believe the litany despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary results in an excessive focus on sustainability. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the discussion on global warming.
There is no doubt that pumping out carbon dioxide from fossil fuels has increased the global temperature. Yet too much of the debate is fixated on reducing emissions without regard to cost. With its agreement to the 1997 Kyoto climate treaty, Europe has set itself the goal of cutting its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2012.
Even with renewable sources of energy taking over, the United Nations Climate Panel still estimates a temperature increase of four degrees to five degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. Such a rise is projected to have less impact in industrialized nations than in developing countries, which tend to be in warmer regions and have infrastructures less able to withstand the inevitable problems.
Despite our intuition that we need to do something drastic about global warming, economic analyses show that it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions radically than to pay the costs of adapting to the increased temperatures. Moreover, all current models show that the Kyoto Protocol will have surprisingly little impact on the climate: temperature levels projected for 2100 will be postponed for all of six years.
Yet the cost of meeting the Kyoto Protocol will be $150 billion to $350 billion annually (compared to $50 billion in global annual development aid). With global warming disproportionately affecting third world countries, we have to ask if Kyoto is the best way to help them. The answer is no. For the cost of Kyoto for just one year we could solve the world's biggest problem: we could provide every person in the world with clean water. This alone would save two million lives each year and prevent 500 million people from contracting severe disease. In fact, for the same amount Kyoto would have cost just the United States every year, the United Nations estimates that we could provide every person in the world with access to basic health, education, family planning and water and sanitation services. Isn't this a better way of serving the world?
The focus should be on development, not sustainability. Development is not simply valuable in itself, but in the long run it will lead the third world to become more concerned about the environment. Only when people are rich enough to feed themselves do they begin to think about the effect of their actions on the world around them and on future generations. With its focus on sustainability, the developed world ends up prioritizing the future at the expense of the present. In contrast, a focus on development helps people today while creating the foundation for an even better tomorrow.
The United States has a unique opportunity in Johannesburg to call attention to development. Many Europeans chastised the the Bush administration for not caring enough about sustainability, especially in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. They are probably correct that the American decision was made on the basis of economic self-interest rather than out of some principled belief in world development. But in Johannesburg the administration can recast its decision as an attempt to focus on the most important and fundamental issues on the global agenda: clean drinking water, better sanitation and health care and the fight against poverty.
Such a move would regain for the United States the moral high ground. When the United States rejected the Kyoto treaty last year, Europeans talked endlessly about how it was left to them to "save the world." But if the United States is willing to commit the resources to ensure development, it could emerge as the savior.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
The Poor Who Work, Yet Live With Desperation

BYLINE:  By RON WERTHEIMER 

 BODY:
Tonight's "Investigative Reports" on A&E offers some snippets of information about the plight of the working poor, but not enough to justify the program's two-hour length. In the slow, deliberate manner of an industrial training film, "Wage Slaves: Not Getting By in America" lays out its statistics, its experts and its sampling of struggling workers, then keeps repeating itself until even the most sympathetic viewer will be tempted to reach for the remote.
 The vitally serious point here is that the nation's lowest-paid workers -- store clerks, burger flippers, maids, receptionists -- earn barely enough to live on. This was the point of Barbara Ehrenreich's well-received 2001 book, "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America," in which she described her own dismal experiences in three bottom-rung jobs. Ms. Ehrenreich is on hand tonight to summarize her conclusion that the people who do this minimum-wage work are stuck in "a lifestyle of chronic desperation." 
 Such sympathy is echoed by two former Clinton administration officials, Peter Edelman and Robert B. Reich. Mr. Reich, the former labor secretary, says with obvious sadness, "We are drifting apart into very separate worlds where the poor don't see much of the rich, and the rich really don't see much of the poor."
But the program's heart seems to lie with two of its other talking heads, a pair of conservative economists from George Mason University. Donald Boudreaux argues that the minimum wage itself should be abolished, leaving the law of supply and demand to set all salaries. His colleague Walter Williams notes sunnily that these workers can't have it so bad if they own luxuries like televisions, telephones and microwaves. "Our poor are the most well-off poor in the entire world," he says.
The five working stiffs, all parents, chosen to represent their stratum do seem pretty happy in their sketchy portraits. A 27-year-old single mother of two in Alabama who earns a total of $7,000 a year from two jobs admits, "I'm broke." But is she poor? No, she says, "I think poor is a state of mind."
A 52-year-old man in Los Angeles who survived years of drug abuse followed by prison now works seven days a week for $6.75 an hour as a home health aide to support his wife and children. "It's not too low for me if I'm earning money and it's legal," he says.
These and the other cheerful strugglers keep coming back as the program progresses, saying nearly the same things. The producers obviously expect viewers to drop in and out, because the workers are all reintroduced, as if you've never met them before, with information you've already heard.
As other economic factlets are tossed casually into the mix, you look again and again at scenes of low-wage jobs, particularly pictures of the same hands preparing the same tacos and cheeseburgers. Despite its important subject, this report is no more than fast food for thought. You want fries with that?

HEADLINE: 2002 U.S. OPEN PREVIEW; 
The Decline of Doubles

BYLINE:  By LIZ ROBBINS 

 BODY:
The names no longer trill off the tongue like McEnroe-Fleming, Navratilova-Shriver or the Woodies once did. 
 Now there are Knowles and Nestor, Woodbridge-Bjorkman, the Bryan Brothers, and Raymond and Stubbs. When the Williams sisters are on the same side of the net, it gives fans a rare two-for-one deal. 
 But otherwise, the discipline of doubles -- especially in the men's game -- seems to be shrinking into the alley. As insiders debate the future of tennis, doubles seems caught flat-footed between players' disinterest and financial reality. 
While players admit doubles strategy and net play are good for their singles games, they are often reluctant to add more time and taxation to their schedules and bodies. 
The men's ATP Tour, beset by unstable economics and cognizant of the doubles' drain on purses, is discussing reducing the doubles draws -- perhaps from 32 to 16 -- as well as the prize money pool. The Tour is trying to entice top singles players -- and sell tickets -- by enabling them to use their ranking to get into the doubles draws next year.
At the United States Open this year, there is a subtle confirmation that doubles is sagging; the doubles prize money for the winners has not increased from the previous year, staying at $350,000, while the singles winners' prize money has jumped $50,000 to $900,000.
"With the increased competition and the demands to play more singles, something's going to give," said Pam Shriver, whose doubles success (106 titles, along with 21 singles titles) gave her a boost into the Tennis Hall of Fame this summer. 
Doubles, these days, takes the fall.
"As the rankings and prize money got so prominent, less and less emphasis has been put on doubles," Shriver said. "The question now is, 'How do you save doubles? How do you keep it on the radar screen?' "
She suggested experimenting with having a combined ranking system for singles and doubles, which would award the top all-around player.
Luke Jensen, who gave doubles a burst of popularity in the mid-90's as part of the wacky and charismatic team with his brother Murphy, does not think players would agree to such a combined ranking system. 
Singles is just too prestigious, he said. As for allowing singles players to use their ranking to play doubles, while some players will be squeezed out, Jensen thinks the move will perhaps be better for the game of doubles. "The day of the doubles specialist is gone," Luke Jensen, 34, said. "You have to streamline, you have to get rid of people who do not sell tickets. The Woodies were rare, and so are the Jensen brothers."
When the Australian Mark Woodforde retired after the 2000 season, he and his partner, Todd Woodbridge, had won a record 61 doubles tournaments. Woodbridge chose Jonas Bjorkman for his next partner, and the two have since won eight tournaments. They defeated the top-ranked team of Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada to win Wimbledon.
Knowles and Nestor have reached 10 finals this season, including all three majors, and have won five tournaments. And yet, Bjorkman said: "When Todd and I are playing our best, I would say that no one can beat us." 
Bjorkman is ranked No. 48 in the world in singles, and was once as high as No. 4, in 1997. Growing up in Sweden playing soccer and hockey, he explained, he loves the team concept and wants the younger players to play both singles and doubles simultaneously. The rewards in that, however, are questionable.
Mike and Bob Bryan, identical twins from Los Angeles, cite the logistical problems of playing both. If they go deep into a doubles tournament, they say they cannot arrive early at the next tournament to qualify for the singles draw.
The Bryans decided as youngsters they would aim for the No. 1 ranking in doubles. As 23-year-olds, such dedication has become their commercial duty: all of their sponsorships revolve around their partnership.
"We think we can make doubles pretty big because of the twin angle, and if we win a Grand Slam we can popularize doubles," Mike Bryan said last week.
Together, they have won four tournaments, the third-most on tour this season. As singles players they are ranked above 200.
"It was bigger back in the day just because Mac and all the great singles players played doubles," Bryan said, referring to John McEnroe. "It's becoming sort of a specialized art, now that singles players don't want to play because it takes too much out of your body. Guys aren't serving and volleying as much in singles. That's why they're not doing as well in doubles -- it's on the backburner.
"In the end," Mike Bryan added, "it kind of comes down to making the most money."
The ATP Tour experimented in 23 tournaments this year with a new tie-breaker format to decide the third set, hoping to shorten doubles matches. The W.T.A. Tour, which also has proposals to use singles rankings to enter doubles draws, is watching what changes the men will adopt. 
Ennui is not as much an issue in women's doubles since big names occasionally play. This year Anna Kournikova collected her second Australian Open doubles title with Martina Hingis in January, and Monica Seles has played one doubles tournament, as have Venus and Serena Williams, who won Wimbledon.
Lisa Raymond, the No. 1-ranked doubles player with Rennae Stubbs, thinks classic doubles play is a lost art because of the pre-eminence of singles and the disappearance of the serve-and-volley game. 
"Now it's like you see four singles players out there on the court," she said. But at the same time, Raymond seemed defensive about being tagged a doubles specialist.
Raymond echoed the prevailing viewpoint: "I play singles because I play singles -- it is my top priority."

HEADLINE: Want to See First-Run Indie Films? Join the Club 

BYLINE:  By BETH PINSKER 

 BODY:
Larry Meistrich, the founder of the Shooting Gallery production company, helped turn New York's chaotic independent film scene into a viable industry with movies like "Sling Blade" and "You Can Count on Me." Now, a year after the Shooting Gallery overextended itself out of business, Mr. Meistrich is trying to change the independent film world again, this time with a mail-order business championing the overlooked and the unreleased.
 His new venture, Film Movement, resembles a book-of-the-month club, except that beginning in December subscribers will receive a DVD of a first-run independent film chosen by Mr. Meistrich and other experts. Mr. Meistrich said the service, which will cost $189 for the year ($19.95 if paid monthly) or $30 for a single selection, would do away with the main problem keeping many specialty films from getting distribution: the lack of marketing budgets to compete with Hollywood blockbusters. 
 "I took a year off and looked at what is wrong with independent film," Mr. Meistrich, 35, said in an interview. "Smaller releasing companies can't afford to get people to go to the movie theaters. The economics of a platform release just don't work. It's an exercise in futility." 
Film Movement, which Mr. Meistrich said was being privately financed, is modeled on the successful film series the Shooting Gallery started in 1999. The series took previously unreleased films on nationwide tours and spawned hits like "Croupier" and "Judy Berlin." 
There is still no shortage of unreleased films to pick from, Mr. Meistrich said. The Sundance festival receives thousands of submissions for 100 or so spots. Few of the documentaries ever get to theaters. And not even all of the 16 films in Sundance's prestigious dramatic competition get distributed. "Memento," for instance, could not find a buyer and was basically self-released.
Film Movement's first film will be "El Bola," from the director Achero Manas, which was part of the New Directors/New Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in April. Future picks will be a mix of foreign and domestic features, as well as documentaries, said Curtis Hougland, a college friend of Mr. Meistrich's from Johns Hopkins University who serves as president of Film Movement. The films will be selected with the help of a board that includes Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, and Richard Raddon, director of the Los Angeles Film Festival. 
"We're positioning it as a brand, and putting our reputation on the table to tell you that we're picking for you," Mr. Meistrich said. He added that his background provided the credibility the project needs. 
Along with Ted Hope and James Schamus of Good Machine, and Christine Vachon of Killer Films, Mr. Meistrich helped spark the New York independent film boom of the last decade. At the Shooting Gallery, which he founded in 1991, he produced 30 films, including Nick Gomez's "Laws of Gravity." But the company's overexpansion, particularly into costly Internet ventures, saddled it with operating losses in the millions, and it went out of business last summer. 
Eammon Bowles, the executive responsible for selecting the Shooting Gallery's film series and then co-founder and president of the distribution company Magnolia Pictures, said he did not think Film Movement's success would be about track record. "It's going to rise or fall on the quality of films themselves and the audience satisfaction they deliver," he said.
And that will depend on what filmmakers Film Movement can sign. David Maquiling, whose "Too Much Sleep" was part of the Shooting Gallery's 2001 slate, said it might be a hard sell for anyone with a shot at a traditional release in theaters, usually a requirement to receive a review in major newspapers and a necessity to be considered for an Academy Award nomination. "But if I were in place like I was with 'Too Much Sleep,' where we didn't get distribution, I would be thrilled for Film Movement to release it," he said. 
Mr. Meistrich said Film Movement would be staging limited theatrical runs in big cities for the films. 
Film Movement's profit-sharing plan might be able to sway some filmmakers. The company is offering them a 10 percent cut of all gross profits, with an up-front payment based on the number of subscribers at the time. That means that if there are 20,000 yearly subscribers, the filmmaker gets at least $30,000.
The Shooting Gallery series paid about the same amount for films, and the usual straight-to-video or straight-to-cable release pays less. And those 20,000 people would probably be a bigger audience than that filmmaker could ever realistically get in theaters.
"As a filmmaker, it really gets you out there in a lot more significant way," Mr. Meistrich said. (Internet downloads and pay-per-view offerings are also planned, but not until the technology improves and the films can be carried by cable systems.)
There are, however, some small distributors who disagree with the contention that there are still a lot of worthy undiscovered films out there, or that the ones that are distributed are not reaching wide audiences. In the last year several new distributors have emerged, like Magnolia and ThinkFilm, or re-emerged, like United Artists. 
"There was a gap for a few months where there were films that weren't being distributed and not enough outlets, but that was quickly made up for by other companies." said Bob Berney, who just took over the revamped Newmarket, which released "Memento."
Mr. Berney said he was intrigued, however, by the notion of putting out the films on DVD. Nobody has tried exactly this before, but there have been some similar enterprises. Short Cinema Journal and Broadcast DVD tried to sell subscriptions for DVD series of shorts, but both are now out of business.
Scott Epstein, who was marketing director of Short Cinema Journal and then a founder of Broadcast DVD, was skeptical of Film Movement's chances. "It's compelling, but at that price they'll be lucky to get 1,000 subscribers," he said.
Film Movement is aiming higher. "I'd be disappointed if we didn't get 100,000," Mr. Meistrich said.

A New Model For AOL May Influence Cable's Future

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
The top executives at AOL Time Warner and Comcast probably did not feel like heavyweight boxers as they hammered out last week's deal for the looming AT&T Comcast cable television giant to distribute the America Online Internet service. And yet, the agreement may represent a technological transition point in the cable TV business as important as the "Thrilla' in Manila" heavyweight title fight in the Philippines 27 years ago.
 Internet technology could now create the same kind of era-defining shift in cable television that satellites did back then. And for the media industry, the big question is which sorts of companies can benefit most from this transition -- the companies that operate the cable systems, or the ones that provide the "content." 
 When Muhammad Ali defeated Joe Frazier on Sept. 30, 1975, in Manila, the fledgling Home Box Office network beamed the fight to cable television operators in the United States. It was the first time a cable network used satellite technology to distribute live programming to affiliates around the nation. Viewers, who up to that point had considered cable mainly a means to better reception of local broadcast stations, soon realized that cable operators could provide original programming available nowhere else. 
Just as important, cable operators soon realized that their success hinged on their relationship with the providers of that programming. As networks like HBO, ESPN and CNN blossomed in the late 1970's and early 80's, they attracted millions of households to cable for the first time. 
The top executives at AOL Time Warner -- which owns HBO, among other cable channels -- now hope that its America Online unit can fit into a similar mold. After years of insisting that America Online had to "own" its customers and trying unsuccessfully to persuade cable operators to lease the use of their lines as "dumb pipe" for high-speed Internet access, AOL Time Warner's executives came to a realization this summer: The only way to persuade AT&T and Comcast to distribute the cyberspace service over their cable lines was to package America Online as if it were a premium movie channel. 
It is a wholesale shift in America Online's business model and presumably for its future prospects. The new approach means that viewers who use the America Online service over the cable lines of the combined AT&T Comcast will be billed by AT&T Comcast -- not by America Online -- the way the price of HBO is included in a customer's cable bill, rather than the customer receiving a separate invoice from HBO.
In other words, the high-speed AOL customer will be as much the cable company's customer as they are America Online's. Customers who sign up for the America Online service will have their cable modem installed by AT&T Comcast. Customers who have a technical problem with the service will first call AT&T Comcast, just as consumers who have a problem with HBO call their cable or satellite provider.
And when a customer buys something on America Online -- online transactions are expected to play a big role in AOL's future -- AT&T Comcast will receive a cut of that revenue. This arrangement is comparable to the way cable operators now generally receive two minutes of advertising time for their own use for every hour of a cable network's programming they carry.
What all this means is that, a few years out, the question of whether last week's deal was a good one for AOL Time Warner will probably depend on whether the America Online unit can create the Internet equivalent of must-have offerings like "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City."
Last week, AT&T Comcast, which is to receive about $38 a month from America Online for every high-speed AOL customer served by its cable lines, seemed to have gotten the better part of the deal. And over the next year or so, other cable operators may very well follow the lead of AT&T and Comcast and strike similar arrangements with America Online. 
If other cable companies follow suit, though, the risk facing the entire cable industry over the next decade will be whether America Online succeeds with its new strategy. The cable operators could find themselves in a long-term position of weakness just as they have found themselves at the mercy of programming conglomerates like Viacom (with CBS and MTV), the Walt Disney Company (with ABC and ESPN) and yes, AOL Time Warner, with a stable that still includes HBO and CNN.
"For a long time, we kept asking cable operators to let us import our traditional business model into the broadband arena," said Lisa Hook, who oversees America Online's high-speed, or broadband, business for AOL Time Warner. "We kept saying, 'Sell us wholesale access to your network and we will have the direct relationship with the customer,' " Ms. Hook recalled in an interview last week. "It became clear that that was really unknown in the cable industry, and we've realized that moving more toward an HBO model for carriage makes a lot of sense."
Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast, who will run the combined AT&T Comcast if Comcast, as expected, completes its acquisition of AT&T's cable unit later this year, also uses the HBO analogy. "We're approaching this relationship with AOL like a premium movie channel," he said. "The HBO model lit a fire under cable, and it really took off. Likewise, I think the model we've worked out with AOL can really light a fire for cable modem service. Just as we have more than one movie service, like HBO and Showtime, we will have more than one Internet provider, and we will help each other become more successful."
AT&T Comcast and whatever other cable operators America Online strikes deals with will probably continue to deliver a "house brand" of cable modem service. Moreover, that house brand will almost always be less expensive than America Online cable modem service. Therefore, America Online will probably have to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming years to develop the Internet equivalent of ESPN's "SportsCenter" or MTV's "TRL" -- material that is available nowhere else. 
The payoff for America Online could be spectacular. Consider that the lament of cable system operators like Mr. Roberts these days is that programmers largely have them over a barrel. A cable system that did not include ESPN, MTV and CNN would have trouble retaining a lot of its customers. That is why ESPN can increase its fees by 10 percent to 20 percent annually and cable operators will still pay it. (Cable operators now pay ESPN close to $2 a month for each subscriber.)
In addition, the power of "must have" networks like ESPN allows programmers to force cable operators to carry additional channels. Walt Disney, which owns ESPN, is able, in essence, to say to cable operators: "You know you need ESPN, but if you want ESPN you also have to carry ESPN2, ESPN Classic and ESPN News. Take it or leave it."
The cable operators have little choice but to take it. And that is the leverage that America Online hopes to exert in a decade. 
Speaking on condition of anonymity, people close to AT&T and Comcast said last week they did not think that America Online could develop sufficient original, proprietary "must have" services to gain that sort of leverage. They say the Internet itself, available to all comers, will be the primary reason why people sign up for cyberspace service -- whether America Online's or the house brand. 
Of course, America Online is counting on just the opposite. Stay tuned. Or logged on.

HEADLINE: 2002 U.S. OPEN PREVIEW; 
Men's Game Is in Need of a Boost

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
If the top-ranked men on the ATP Tour were stuck together in the Ikea-furnished Real World of MTV. . . .
 Lleyton Hewitt would be the hothead the others whisper about offstage but never confront; Marat Safin would be the swinging ladies' man; Tommy Haas would be the quiet guy on the phone with his girlfriend; Yevgeny Kafelnikov would be bitter just because; and Tim Henman would be the square-as-a-Chiclet rich kid desperate to be liked. 
 It is the kind of toxic household made for ratings, if not for one role left unfulfilled: the American star. For the past two years, the aging Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi have been nudged out of the ATP's marketing promos, while the young guys in the backward caps and brooding stares have been pushed to the public like an assembly-line boy band.
If skin and sneers work for the women, why not the men? So far, the American public hasn't bought it. European players and Tour officials call it jingoism -- why is every gauge of success made in the U.S.A.? -- but there is concern over the plunging interest for the financially shaky men's Tour in the world's most lucrative market. 
In just five years, the United States television ratings for women's tennis have passed -- and in some cases, doubled -- the numbers for the men. Market experts and tennis officials say the women have what the men need: hot rivalries, family dysfunction, sex appeal and American dominance.
"It has translated into better endorsements, stronger ratings and more attendance for women's tennis," said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports and Celebrities, a firm that matches athletes with companies seeking endorsers. "The men have been going the other direction." 
The entertainment opportunists running the United States Open have capitalized on the trend. In two weeks, for the second consecutive year, the women's final will be broadcast in prime time. The men will remain as extras on the set.
They have yet to prove marquee worthy this season, creating no buzz on the dial during the first three majors. From the Australian Open final between Safin and Thomas Johansson to the French Open title fought for by two Spaniards to the Wimbledon championship won by Hewitt over a little-known Argentine, the United States television audience has mostly turned off men's tennis.
One observer after another has declared the men's game as flavorless as gum after a daylong chew. "I like to watch the women," Venus Williams said. "For me, it's entertaining, to be honest."
Roughing up the understaffed P.R. department, John McEnroe called the inability to hype the men as "one of the ATP's shortcomings." And Murphy Jensen, the audacious doubles star, had a more blunt view of men's tennis. "In this country, it's dead," he said. "Players don't do enough to sell their sport."
The No. 1 pitchman should be Hewitt. A talented but irascible Australian, Hewitt has blamed ATP officials for allowing the women to creep ahead on the pop charts, but Hewitt has often refused to promote the Tour. Tour officials view him as difficult and high-maintenance, and have been exasperated by his attitude.
"The X factor is charisma," Bob Williams said. "You have to captivate consumers and fans and be exciting enough for the public to pay attention on a 24-hour basis. Lleyton Hewitt doesn't fit that bill. He's a terrific player, but he's not a very charismatic individual."
Hope is in the form of Andy Roddick. The burden on the 19-year-old born in Nebraska is enormous. While Sampras came along with Agassi, Michael Chang and Jim Courier as company, Roddick is the sole young American in the top 20, currently ranked No. 11. Unfair or not, he is all but being asked to save the Tour.
"It's true that in men's tennis today, though we've got great players and great champions, we don't have, at the moment, the kind of extraordinary personalities that, say, a McEnroe or Connors represented," said Mark Miles, the chief executive of the ATP Tour. "That's something that just happens and will happen. Roddick has that potential. If he develops and gets on camera more often, he'll be a superstar."
So far, the embraceable American with the Abercrombie & Fitch appeal has done everything asked of him to promote the sport. Roddick does the photo-ops, autograph sessions and P.R. spots without complaint.
But in the win-or-bust mentality of America, charm and a top-10 ranking aren't enough. To many, Roddick won't arrive until he wins a major, a pressure that has weighed on him. "I was trying to force it a little earlier in the year, trying to do and be all things, but now I'm just trying to do what I can do and have fun doing it," he said. "I can't worry about what's going on outside the court."
Around tennis, international players don't begrudge Roddick's place as the Tour's prized possession, but there has been resentment on the part of athletes who are treated like rock stars everywhere except Main Street, U.S.A.
"There could be only one American in the No. 1 spot and the next one could be at 100, and Americans would say tennis was all right," Xavier Malisse of Belgium said. "Americans have had many champions, but now it's a time when it's somebody else. I wouldn't say that because an American is not on top that tennis is dead. Look around the world. I think it's doing well."
Two months ago, Albert Costa of Spain could barely part the crowd that greeted him at the airport terminal in Barcelona after he won the French Open. It was the moment of his life, with or without the American stamp of approval.
"Remember, it is a world game," Costa said. "I think the U.S.A., right now, is no longer the best country in tennis. Maybe soon or in the next 10 years, it'll be again that all the best come from the U.S.A., but not right now."
Tour officials point to overseas television ratings and healthy attendance figures to underscore the global success of tennis. Around the world, Safin is bathed in screams from girls as he walks down the street. He has loved the attention. After he won the 2000 United States Open, he hinted that the pursuit of women was more exciting than the chase for tennis trophies.
"You cannot compare pleasure with the business, my friend," Safin said. "It's two different things. So you have to dedicate yourself to the business or to the pleasure. Sometimes you have to choose between business and pleasure; you choose business. This is my case."
The business side of tennis goes beyond the Tour's need for a universal star. With last year's collapse of I.S.L. -- the Swiss company that signed a 10-year, $1.2 billion deal in 1999 to market the ATP -- the cash-strapped Tour could use an American renaissance to attract hard-to-find corporate dollars. Only five of the nine Tennis Masters Series have replenished their sponsorship deals since the I.S.L. debacle.
"There is an ongoing discussion which should be completed at the U.S. Open about any changes in prize money for next year," Miles said.
The four majors operate in their own economies. The man who wins the United States Open will take home $900,000, same as the women's champion. Right now, the two tours are not equal. For the last couple of years, the women have been carrying the ratings and providing more value for the dollar. 
Most often, a ticket purchased for the second week of a women's major comes with a nearly 100 percent guarantee that the fans will see marquee players face off in singles.
None of the top five men have advanced beyond the Round of 16 in all of the first three majors of the year. On the women's side, a second-week showdown starring Venus and Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati and Monica Seles is a given. The return of Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis from injury only adds to the intrigue.
"At a men's event, you may see Pete Sampras, or any name player, play once, and he might lose," said Luke Jensen, Murphy's brother and doubles teammate. "The top women, most of them, are going to get through to the next round. That's great for the promoter, great for the game, great for TV."
The men could create a TV drama, if they could only find an American star to grab the leading role.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
From Unseemly to Lowbrow,the Web's Real Money Is in the Gutter

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Life is good at the bottom of the cyberspace pit. When the Arizona attorney general's office recently shut down a Scottsdale company, CP Direct, it offered a glimpse into the spoils of the Internet's dark side. The company sold pills via the Web that promised to increase penis length, bust size and body height.
 Enough people had spent $60 an order -- mostly for the "Longitude" treatments, with ingredients that included pumpkin seed, sarsaparilla and "oyster meat" -- that the state was able to seize more than $30 million in luxury real estate and a herd of Mercedes-Benzes, Rolls Royces and a Lamborghini. 
 The dot-com bust has left the economy littered with the husks of companies that said they would transform the way that people work, live and play. But aside from such notably profitable Internet winners as eBay and edging-into-profitability giants like Amazon, it is not easy to find many pure Internet companies that make healthy profits without appealing to baser interests or using questionable business practices. Even huge companies like AOL Time Warner appear to be struggling to figure out -- still -- how to come up with online content and services that mainstream consumers will be willing to pay for. 
Those who provide some of the sites that many people object to say they have nothing to hide. "Obviously, there's a want for this stuff, because there's billions of dollars spent on it every year," said David Marchlak, who has brought the world sites like Voyeur Dorm, a Web precursor to the "Big Brother" television show that watches a Florida house shared by a cast of young women. "We're not forcing it on anybody."
Yet these days, Internet users complain of a proliferation of Web sites that offer a peek up Anna Kournikova's skirt or that hawk pills to increase the size of their sex organs. The Internet was supposed to make people's brains bigger.
People now talk about wasting too much of their time sifting through e-mail invitations to view photographs of nymphets or unspeakable acts with farm animals, as well as requests to send money to people who say they are relatives of Jonas Savimbi of Angola or Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire so they can release their stolen African millions.
Cyberspace is "debasing itself in front of our eyes," said Bruce Sterling, a science fiction author. Mr. Sterling, who sees the Internet becoming a pit of spam and swindles, pornography, corporate advertising and government surveillance, warns, "We will lose the Internet if we don't save it."
Why is so much high technology so lowbrow, with abominably written prose, horrific images like the beheading of the journalist Daniel Pearl and the sweaty sensibility of a tromp through the febrile fantasies of adolescent boys and middle-aged men?
One answer is that the Internet businesses that thrive most readily are the kinds that do well in every medium -- including those selling titillation and cheating their customers.
"Every industry has its charlatans, and e-commerce is getting its share," said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "I don't see evidence that it is more than you would expect, especially in a new industry."
Not everyone who hangs out a shingle in the grimy quarters of the online world becomes rich. Maria, a woman who runs adult Web sites and a telephone sex service, said that dreams of quick riches are quickly dashed, especially for those entrepreneurs who spend thousands of dollars for pornography-site-in-a-box kits that are sold online, which often include stockpiles of images that are already in wide circulation.
"I don't see people getting rich," said Maria, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used. "I see people getting burned" by their own inexperience and crushed by so-called chargebacks -- cancellations of credit card charges by consumers.
Louis Bajjali, who runs a number of pornography sites, said that those who succeed share some characteristics with their counterparts in mainstream business: They are on the scene early to establish brand recognition, work hard and stick with what they know.
"We're businessmen," he said. "It's actually a simple and clean job."
At least the online pornography purveyors deliver what they promise, however unseemly. CP Direct, the penis-pill merchants, sold snake oil to consumers by the thousands, the Arizona attorney general, Jeanne Napolitano, said in her announcement of the civil forfeiture action.
"The product was purchased by CP Direct for $2.45 a bottle, and sold for $59.95 -- that's a nice markup, isn't it?" said Lawrence J. Warfield, a certified public accountant who was appointed by the state to administer the sale of assets and distribution of money to victims of the swindle.
John Hannah, a lawyer for Michael Consoli, one of the principal figures in the CP Direct case, noted that the state seizure was not a final disposition of the case. "I have every reason to believe that Mr. Consoli will deny that he did anything wrong and will ask for his property back," he said.
CP Direct is one of many companies that -- at least, until law enforcement showed up -- proved that the wages of sin can, in fact, be bountiful. Last November, the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general settled charges against a New York company, the Crescent Publishing Group, after proving that Crescent and 64 affiliated companies billed thousands of consumers as much as $90 a month for access to pornography sites that gave the appearance of being free. In a settlement with the company, the government got $30 million for consumer refunds.
Pyramid schemes, too, flourish online: In August 2001, the Federal Trade Commission fined the creators of BigSmart.com $5 million in a settlement over the business practices of its online shopping mall. BigSmart's customers paid $110 for a home page with links to other merchants, and the only way to make money was to recruit newcomers to the scheme, the commission found.
The reasons that people engage in such activity are simple enough, said Eric Wagner, a lawyer in the division of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission. "Fraud is profitable," he said. "If it wasn't profitable, people wouldn't be doing it."
The relatively low cost of using the Internet for marketing makes it every bit as attractive to swindlers as it is to legitimate businesses.
The commission has declared war on spam and fraud, and has trained people from 1,700 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to detect and prosecute online fraud. The F.T.C. has collected 13 million spam messages in its efforts to study the problem, and has initiated dozens of "Netforce" sweeps to drive spammers out of business.
To be sure, the better neighborhoods of the Net -- where one can find learned discussion of Kierkegaard or analysis of Gram Parsons's influence on rock music -- are flourishing. But critics like Mr. Sterling argue that those leafy digital neighborhoods are increasingly surrounded by wildly expanding zones of slums, bad taste and risk.
He thinks "civil society" has broken down online, and that "it's not just a digital problem, it's the digital reflection of a global problem." 
Criticism of the Internet has its antecedents in the fears of every new technology that has come along, said Paul Saffo, an analyst at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. Some of the earliest printing presses were put to use publishing pulp and trash, and even early printed playing cards had salacious images. "A collective appetite for sleaze," he said, "seems to be a real constant."
Despite that, or perhaps because of it, reports of the death spiral for the online medium are premature, said Gary Chapman, director of the 21st Century Project, a nonprofit research and education program on science and technology policy at the University of Texas.
"I am astonished practically every day by something new on the Internet," he said. The medium has grown so extensively that "at this point, it's almost impossible to characterize what the Internet is like."
Spam, for example, "is an annoyance and something that is a regrettable display of the human tendency to go for the lowest common denominator," he said. "But it can't possibly be viewed as representative of the entire Internet."
Brewster Kahle, who has created a large Internet archive he calls the Wayback Machine, which contains several times the amount of information in the Library of Congress, said that the number of questionable sites is beside the point so long as search engines do their job.
"We don't worry about how many pages that I don't care about are in the Internet archive," he said. "What you do care about is, 'Does it have the pages that I want?' "
He acknowledged, however, that "we haven't done a very good job of putting the good stuff up there" on the Internet to dilute the bad, and that as a result today's leaders "are shortchanging the next generation."
Other initiatives to dilute the bad by raising the concentration of the good have also begun. Project Gutenberg, an arduous effort conducted largely by volunteers, has put more than 400 books online. The Million Books Project at Carnegie Mellon University is trying to create an online home in every field for major works that are no longer protected by copyright. 
And the Digital Promise Project, begun by a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, Newton N. Minow (who famously called 1961-era television a "vast wasteland") and Lawrence Grossman, the former chairman of NBC and PBS, aims to improve education and the Internet by earmarking some $18 billion raised in federal auctions of rights to use portions of the broadcast spectrum.
"There's so much good stuff that is trapped in libraries that should be digitized and made available," Mr. Minow said. "It's just yearning to get free."
To Mr. Kahle, the Internet's diversity, good and bad, means that people will find the information they want, as narrowly and as deeply as they care to explore it. While he, too, would like some method to control the spam that flows into his e-mailbox, he said he preferred a complex ecosystem to a monoculture as bland and regular as a suburban lawn.
"I grew up where almost everybody could sing all three verses of the 'Gilligan's Island' theme song," he said. "I don't want my children to grow up like that."

HEADLINE: Now Steve Is Running to Revive Forbes 

BYLINE:  BY DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Steve Forbes has a really good job. As president and editor in chief of Forbes, he writes a column, appears on television and meets with world business leaders. The lobby he enters is encrusted with treasured family objects and his office is up a set of marble stairs. But no one plays "Hail to the Chief" when he enters the room.
 After running for the Republican presidential nomination, showing up every day at a family-owned media company might seem like a bit of a comedown. 
 "It's easy," he said, offering the frozen smile that was a fixture during his two campaigns for the presidency. "It would be one thing if I'd been in the White House, but I wasn't. Running something you spent your whole life building is exciting." 
While pushing a flat tax to an apathetic electorate is no day at the beach, Mr. Forbes now confronts the biggest challenge to the family business since the Depression. Forbes, which became one of the richest magazines in America by serving as a totem for conspicuous wealth, is a little short these days. It has fallen to third in ad pages in its category, after leading Fortune and Business Week for most of the 1990's, according to the Publisher's Information Bureau. It has lost almost half its advertising pages the last two years, and newsstand sales, a measure of current consumer interest, were down almost 14 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year.
The Forbes dynasty, composed of four sons and a daughter of Malcolm S. Forbes, is hardly bereft, but there are significant signs of stress. The company's generous 401k plan, which had provided a 2-for-1 match for employees, was discontinued earlier this year, and some of the family's lavish collections -- including Lincoln's final address as president -- have been auctioned in the last year, raising $30 million. Senior management has taken a significant pay cut, and the company has engaged in modest layoffs, a rare event at Forbes.
As a private company, Forbes Inc. does not disclose profits and losses. But Steve Forbes said that the company's prudence should not be mistaken for panic.
"Everything that we have been doing in the last year is in response to an environment, a falloff that hasn't been seen since the 30's," Mr. Forbes said. "No one is immune. We write about that all the time."
He points out that ads for July were up 20 percent over the previous year and maintains that the auctions at Christie's were part of an orderly disposal of his father's collections and have nothing to do with a need for cash.
During his runs for the Republican nomination, Mr. Forbes had relinquished control of the company to his brother, Timothy C. Forbes, and the return of Steve Forbes has led to some confusion around the company. Even William Baldwin, who became editor in 1999 after replacing the venerable James Michael, who had been in the post 37 years, said that he was not sure which brother has ultimate authority.
"I couldn't tell you which one runs the company," he said.
It had been reported that Steve Forbes, who was bequeathed a majority of the voting and capital stock by his father, had relinquished control by selling shares to his family to finance his campaign. But in an interview, Steve Forbes said that he remained in control of the majority of the voting stock in spite of spending almost $70 million on his two campaigns. (A company official confirmed that Steve Forbes had raised money through sales of nonvoting stock.) Timothy Forbes has returned to his role as chief operating officer and controls much of the day-to-day operations of the company. Robert L. Forbes is vice president of Forbes and president of Forbes Global and Forbes FYI. And Christopher Forbes, known as Kip, is a vice chairman and is responsible for the advertising and promotion departments of Forbes. Their sister, Moira Mumma, has no operational role in the company.
Timothy Forbes, whose affability and erudition make him a popular figure at Forbes, said that the magazine has endured endless cycles throughout its history and has prospered through all of them.
"There is a tyranny to the present, and the value of history is that you are able to get some perspective," he said. "We will ultimately thrive."
During its heyday, the magazine was closely identified with Malcolm Forbes, who cut a swath through button-down business culture by making profligacy seem like a virtue. Before his death in 1990, his gold-plated gallivanting on motorcycles, hot air balloons and the Capitalist Tool -- the lavish corporate jet -- came to embody the Forbes brand, an unapologetic ode to the good life and the political and economic system that produced it.
After his death, his four sons oversaw a decade of growth, but the magazine's status as an independent family-owned property in an age of publishing behemoths and an increasingly competitive environment in business journalism has wiped out profits, which approached $25 million to $30 million a year in the late 1990's, according to executives with knowledge of the current financial situation.
Monie Begley Feurey, a Forbes spokesman, said: "Whoever said that could have no clue one way or the other because it is a private company."
Forbes is hardly alone in scrambling to come to grips with a downturn. Some of the new generation of business magazines that cropped up during the technology boom are gone, and both Business Week and Fortune, its two main competitors, have suffered as well. But Forbes, which had always eschewed trends in its coverage, stumbled more deeply, possibly because the magazine gave particularly lavish -- and some say slavish attention -- to the technology, energy and telecommunications companies of the moment.
"Forbes was early on this story and is more investment-oriented than the other two business magazines," said George Gilder, editor of The Gilder Technology Report and co-sponsor of a conference with Forbes. "Since above all, the tech story was an investment story, they got hit harder than the others."
Dynegy, among others, was still getting generally positive treatment in Forbes after it became clear it had problems. Mr. Baldwin said the magazine did many tough stories on stock market irrationality in 2000.
"On some stories, we weren't skeptical enough. On others, we were probably too skeptical," Mr. Baldwin said. "In general, I don't think that we were acting out of character."
Forbes's own investment in the Web never yielded a public offering and has been a significant drain on profits. In spite of its staff of over 75 and a commitment to breaking news, Forbes.com has almost exactly the same number of unique visitors a month -- two million in July, according to Media Metrix -- than the much less expensive Fortune site generates. Forbes is about to sign a deal with Fortune's parent company, AOL Time Warner, to be carried on AOL, according to an executive at AOL, in order to bolster traffic.
Brand extensions like Forbes FYI, a lavish lifestyle magazine, and Forbes ASAP, a technology magazine, have failed to produce any significant profits, according to Forbes executives. The magazine continues to expand globally, with local language editions in Japan and Brazil, and James S. Berrien, president of the Forbes Magazine Group, said that the company will have a total of six local language editions in next 12 months. But the profits, and the fortunes of the family, clearly depend on the biweekly business magazine, which has a rate base -- the number of readers promised to advertisers -- of 900,000.
The expansion has taken place at a company that is selling much fewer ads and is doing so at deeply discounted rates, according to two salespeople at the magazine. With declining margins and lower gross revenues, what had been a dynamo throwing off tons of cash has slowed to a crawl.
Mr. Berrien said the magazine's lead in readership among chief executives has helped produce a summer of much improved ad sales. He added that the magazine's television show, "Forbes on Fox," has been a hit and helped the company sell large ad deals.
The company is not down to its last nickel. A few months ago, it took advertisers and reporters out for a cruise on the Highlander, the company's luxurious yacht. In between helicopter rides, which landed on the boat to take guests for an aerial tour of Manhattan, Steve and Timothy Forbes chatted with guests, reminding them that the magazine was all business before business was cool.
Although the sons have little of the father's flamboyance, they seem to share his vision of a country, and a magazine, that will prosper over the long haul.
"My father grew up in the Great Depression and he was instrumental in putting the magazine into the big leagues," Timothy Forbes said. "He was an essential optimist and that was born of the experience of what he was able to accomplish. I think right now, he'd say, 'Don't let the present overwhelm your sense of the possibilities of the future.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues Warning to Europeans in Dispute Over New Court 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has warned European nations that the American role in NATO will change if the European Union refuses the United States' request for agreements to keep Americans out of the reach of the new International Criminal Court.
 The foreign ministers of the European Union are scheduled to meet at the end of the week in Copenhagen, where they will begin deliberations on whether to grant the United States such an exemption. 
 The European nations are strong supporters of the court, which opened last month in The Hague and is the first permanent forum for trying people charged with genocide and other crimes against humanity.
The Bush administration is strongly opposed to the court, citing concerns that Americans would be unfairly singled out for politically motivated prosecutions abroad. 
The debate complicates the administration's search for support among its closest allies for possible action against Iraq.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell wrote letters to individual European governments dated Aug. 16, asking them to ignore the European Union's request to wait and make a united stand on the issue. He urged them instead to sign separate agreements with the United States "as soon as possible" under Article 98 of the treaty that created the court, which the United States says allows nations to negotiate for immunity for their forces on a bilateral basis.
"Unfortunately, some voices in the E.U. in recent weeks have suggested that E.U. governments should avoid making Article 98 bilateral arrangements with the United States, pending further consultations toward a common E.U. position," Secretary Powell wrote in the letter.
In a confidential document written by the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, the commission's initial legal assessment is against the United States' request, according to European diplomats who have read the document.
The conclusion states that "the bilateral agreements proposed by the U.S. are not covered by Article 98. A contracting party to the Statute concluding such an agreement with the U.S. acts against the object and purpose of the Statute."
A spokesman for the European Commission refused to comment, saying it is European Union policy to neither confirm nor deny the contents of confidential documents.
"This is too delicate a matter," said a European Union spokesman in Washington. "We should wait in about a week when the ministers have discussed the issues and come to a decision."
Pierre-Richard Prosper, the American ambassador for war crimes issues, said in an interview with the Danish news media last week that if the answer is no, the status quo between the United States and NATO "will obviously not exist, and we will have to see how we can work through this."
He also said that if countries that are candidates to become members of NATO did not sign such an agreement, "it will be an issue that we will have to discuss in the NATO context," according to a State Department transcript of the interview.
While several European nations viewed these remarks as a veiled threat, Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said "there is no connection" between a decision by the United States in favor of a country's membership in NATO and the country's decision on granting an exemption. He said Mr. Prosper's remarks about NATO reflected the administration's deep concerns about the court.
"The Europeans know our concerns about peacekeeping and NATO," Mr. Reeker said. "We are not prepared to speculate on what alternative strategies we might pursue if our current policy falls short of our goal."
Last month, after debate over protection for American peacekeepers from the court's jurisdiction, the United Nations Security Council agreed to exempt United Nations peacekeepers from prosecution for a year. 
The Bush administration then started a campaign to persuade most countries to sign agreements not to extradite Americans for trial before the court. It warned foreign diplomats that under a new American law, their nations could lose American military assistance if they became members of the court without pledging to protect Americans serving in their countries from its reach.
Romania and Israel have signed such agreements. Switzerland has said it will refuse to do so.
Human rights groups here worry that the administration's position will eventually undermine the court.
"The level of threats has increased dramatically," said Richard Dicker, director of the international justice program for Human Rights Watch in New York. "And threat inflation is a sign of a policy gone amok."

HEADLINE: Linking Poverty Aid to the Environment 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
The smoke settles over the rickety shacks and shabby houses as soon as this city wakes. Thousands of poor people without electricity burn scraps of wood in rusty tin cans to keep warm. Others burn coal in old stoves that belch soot and fumes into the cold morning air.
 Poverty in crowded cities like this one and in sleepy villages as well is threatening the air, the waters and the forests of the developing world. On Monday, the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development will open here to try to focus the world's attention on the environment in these poor countries. 
 The 10-day meeting is expected to attract more than 100 presidents and prime ministers from Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America, who will devise a plan to protect the globe's atmosphere, lakes, forests and wildlife and focus on the link between poverty and environmental degradation. Officials hope to build on the ambitious, but poorly executed, agenda set at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 10 years ago. 
Leaders from the United States, Europe and developing nations have already agreed that reducing poverty must be a central element of the plan. But the question of how to do that and to ensure the survival of the globe's natural resources has left rich and poor nations bitterly divided. The dispute is likely to dominate the political negotiations here. In this continent of immense natural beauty and desperate poverty, the debate could hardly be more relevant. 
In the 1990's, Africa had the world's highest rate of deforestation as poor people cleared trees for farmland and firewood. Acute respiratory infections, which often afflict families that rely on coal or firewood, kill or disable about 30 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's children each year, the United Nations says. Meanwhile, pollution is worsening as millions of Africans abandon rural villages for urban shantytowns.
Poor countries say they cannot safeguard their natural resources unless they can strengthen their economies. They want wealthy nations to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national product to aid developing countries; to reduce or eliminate tariffs on agricultural goods from poor countries and to halve the number of people without access to sanitation by 2015. 
Some wealthy nations, including the United States and some members of the European Union, are resisting. American officials say they have already agreed to increase foreign aid to the poor, and developing nations should eliminate corruption and strengthen democratic institutions before more aid is committed.
The United States, the world's biggest polluter, has also refused to commit to time frames for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or for converting to renewable energy sources, despite pressure from the developing world and the European Union.
The European Union has agreed to discuss targets for increasing foreign assistance, but opposes time frames for eliminating agricultural subsidies, which protect their farmers from foreign competition.
Environmentalists and advocates for the poor, who have poured into this city by the thousands, have already been holding marches to keep the link between poverty and environmental decay high on the agenda.
Much of their anger is directed at President Bush, who will not attend.
"The north/south dispute over money and trade is an old one, but it's particularly acute at the moment," Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said in a telephone interview from New York. "There's distrust on both sides." 
Meeting organizers say they believe that the differences will be resolved. They note that the nations have already agreed on nearly 80 percent of the summit's action plan. 
They have already agreed to offer incentives for investment in cleaner forms of production, to provide additional resources to keep deserts from spreading and to try to reduce by half the number of people living on less than $1 a day by 2015. But none of these commitments are groundbreaking; the commitment on poverty, for instance, was adopted two years ago at the Millennium Summit at the United Nations.
Officials assembled here agree that developing countries must focus on good governance and democracy, and curb pollution within their own borders. But the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, who has led Africa's push for more foreign aid, has said leaders should also take a stand for the environment by committing to alleviating poverty.
"You can't expect the developing countries to address the environment in the absence of economic growth and development," said Crispian Olver, director general of South Africa's department of environmental affairs. 
The meeting in Johannesburg will be the third international effort in 30 years to find a way to promote human development without damaging the environment. But countries have been slow to act. 
After the first meeting, in Stockholm in 1972, wealthy nations began cleaning air and water, but continued to ravage forests and other resources elsewhere to maintain growth. 
In Rio, at the second meeting, leaders signed an ambitious agenda to protect the environment while strengthening the economies of poor countries. But there were few binding obligations.
Since then, the world's population has continued to surge, poverty has deepened in Africa, forests have retreated, fish stocks have decreased and concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. 
Last year, President Bush angered many leaders when he rejected a treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, which set targets for reducing emissions. Mr. Bush said such accords should bind developing nations, especially China and India, that are also major emitters of greenhouse gases. 
Developing nations have refused, saying wealthy countries are among the largest polluters and should clean up first. So far, the world's environmental meetings have produced more political declarations than real action. 
This time many nations are calling for concrete commitments -- particularly for foreign aid and trade -- while the United States insists they are unnecessary. 
American officials note that the Bush administration has agreed to double foreign aid to the poor and that it supports the United Nations' Millennium Declaration, which aims to reduce poverty, illiteracy and child mortality by 2015.
"We embrace the United Nations Millennium Declaration goals, which do specifically refer to targets," Paula J. Dobriansky, the State Department's under secretary for global affairs, said by telephone from Washington.
She said that rejecting targets and time frames should not suggest that the government cares little about poverty or the environment, and that the American delegation, led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, is eager to address those issues.
European Union officials say commitments are needed to reduce poverty and protect the environment. 
The European officials have agreed to commit 0.39 percent of their gross national income to foreign aid by 2006. They say nations should reverse the loss of natural resources by 2015 and increase the share of renewable energy sources to at least 15 percent of the primary energy supply by 2010. Making such commitments, they say, might help build solidarity among nations.
"We see the mistrust and the disbelief in many developing countries," Margot Wallstrom, the European Union's commissioner for the environment, said in an interview. "Targets and timetables are the only way to regain some credibility, to move from words to deeds."
Just how much needs to be done is painfully clear in the impoverished community of Soweto, a 40-minute drive from here. 
During these winter months, when poor people burn coal and firewood to cook and keep warm, the level of pollutants in the air rises to two to three times the health standard. Even in neighborhoods where families have electricity, the poor rely on coal to keep electric bills low.
Monde Bendile, 45, knows that prolonged exposure to fumes and soot pollutes the air and sometimes causes respiratory illnesses. But she cannot afford to heat her home with electricity.
"The smoke, it's dangerous," said Ms. Bendile as she watched a salesman unloading coal from his horse-drawn cart. "But there's nothing we can do. We have no choice."

HEADLINE: 22-Year Incumbent Faces Fight After an Unknown Wins a Ballot Spot 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Sitting in a coffee shop in the Bronx on a recent morning, Eric Stevenson spoke with no shortage of bitterness about the challenge of getting on the ballot in his neophyte run for elective office.
 Mr. Stevenson, a candidate for an Assembly seat in the Bronx, said that the borough's Democratic organization first challenged the number of valid signatures on his petitions. And when the city's Board of Elections determined that he had indeed exceeded the 500 signatures required, the organization took him to court, saying that his petitions lacked some details on their cover sheets, like the name of the Democratic Party. 
 "They tried everything they could," Mr. Stevenson said, just a few days after a State Supreme Court judge restored his name to the ballot in the Sept. 10 Democratic primary. "But we got over two hurdles. And, now the court has made it possible for me to run for office. It should never be this difficult."
That court action has also created a competitive race for Assemblywoman Gloria Davis, a 22-year incumbent who has not had a serious primary opponent since 1986. Ms. Davis, 64, is a longtime ally of the Bronx Democratic organization and is well known to her constituents in the 79th Assembly District, which includes Morrisania and Claremont Village. 
Her race is complicated by a number of factors. For one thing, she had expected Mr. Stevenson to remain off the ballot and, by her own admission, has spent little time planning for a primary challenge. Secondly, she has been the subject of a bribery inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney's office.
Although he is a novice candidate, Mr. Stevenson, 35, who works as a coordinator of community services in the office of the Bronx borough president, is from a well-known Bronx political family. His grandfather was Edward A. Stevenson, the assemblyman from the Bronx, and his father was Edward A. Stevenson Jr., the Democratic district leader who was also a commissioner on the Board of Elections.
While Mr. Stevenson devotes a great deal of his campaign presentations to his family's political history, he contends that he offers a fresher perspective on solving problems than Ms. Davis. The district is plagued by high unemployment and, he said, Ms. Davis, has done little in the way of economic development.
"After 22 years, it's time for a change," Mr. Stevenson said. "And if you haven't seen any advancement in your community, why wait in order to make that change take place."
The 79th Assembly District lies in the southwestern portion of the Bronx, split by the Cross Bronx Expressway. It includes the large apartment buildings of working-class residents along Third Avenue as well as several large public housing complexes, including the huge Claremont Village Houses. The district's population is 54 percent Hispanic and 42 percent black, although black voters make up a majority of the electorate.
Ms. Davis said she was not worried by Mr. Stevenson's challenge, dismissing him as a newcomer to the district whose family history is largely irrelevant today.
"Well, if it's time for new blood, it should at least be someone who has paid some dues," Ms. Davis said. "Just because you have moved into this area a year ago or so, it doesn't mean that you are new blood that's qualified to do the job." 
Of the Stevenson political history, Ms. Davis said, "his grandfather has been dead for 30 years or so. The people in this district don't know Mr. Stevenson. But they know me and know what I have done for this community." 
Ms. Davis, who has done considerable advocacy on behalf of charter-school reform and programs to prevent teenage pregnancy, said she did not need to delve into specifics in her campaign platform. 
Indeed, Ms. Davis is relying largely on her reputation in her campaign. She said she had raised little money because she did not expect a competitor in the primary (her most recent filings indicate that she has raised $14,000 and has about $12,000 left). She has the support of several major labor groups in addition to the backing of the Bronx party organization.
In contrast, Mr. Stevenson said that, although he filed papers a month ago indicating he had raised about $2,000, he has collected nearly $30,000 in contributions since then.
What neither candidate discusses is Ms. Davis's legal woes. She said it was a topic that never came up with voters. "Only the press brings it up," she said. Mr. Stevenson said: "The issue is out there, people know about it. I only say that people should ask her about it. I don't want to initiate any mudslinging. I'm just glad I'm on the ballot and can run."

HEADLINE: Poverty in a Land of Plenty: Can Hartford Ever Recover? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
On the eastern edge of town, looming over the broad brown waters of the Connecticut River, the old Colt firearms factory is losing its fight with history.
 Under its spangled blue onion dome, the 19th-century armory where Samuel Colt's inventions helped spawn the Industrial Revolution -- and where his company made the guns that helped the United States conquer the West and win two world wars -- now stands hollow, disintegrating into crumbling bricks and broken glass. 
 City Hall has all but forgotten it; the state is planning to build around it. Without government incentives, private developers will not touch it. The abandoned landmark -- which Connecticut's Congressional delegation now wants to become a national park -- is perhaps an apt metaphor for Hartford itself, the most destitute 17 square miles in the nation's wealthiest state and a city where 30 percent of its residents live in poverty. Only Brownsville, Tex., has a higher figure. 
Hartford's descent reflects the central conundrum of Connecticut, which has the nation's highest per capita income but also has a split-level economy of affluent suburbs and almost universally floundering cities. And its story sums up the question central to all of America's troubled cities: What role, if any, should their wealthy suburbs and state governments play in their recovery?
The newest building in Hartford's undistinguished, underpopulated downtown went up 13 years ago, said Bill Farley, president of the Connecticut regional office of CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate brokerage company.
"There's just been no need, no demand or no stomach to build a new building," he said. "It's almost unbelievable."
Now, for the first time in decades, there is hope of a renaissance in the form of an enormous downtown development called Adriaen's Landing. But no one, including Gov. John G. Rowland, the project's greatest champion, believes that it alone can make Hartford work again.
Many East Coast cities -- Newark, Providence and Baltimore among them -- have fallen on hard times. But those cities have all taken strides toward recovering. Hartford, which after the Civil War was the richest city in America, and remains associated more with insurance industry jobs than urban despair, still awaits its comeback.

Accountability
Mayors Powerless To Run City
Interviews with dozens of historians, economists and government officials suggest three main reasons why Hartford fell so far.
First, "Lousy leadership at City Hall," as Mr. Rowland put it recently (though an aide later said the governor was not referring to the current mayor or his predecessor). Experts say regressive tax policies, grand but ill-conceived downtown revitalization projects and a racially antagonistic relationship with its white suburbs has damaged Hartford to an extent rarely seen in major American cities.
Hartford, a city with a Buck-Stops-Nowhere reputation, replaced its "strong mayor" form of government in 1946 with one that split accountability between a professional city manager and an elected City Council. The mayor was reduced to a figurehead.
The system has worked well in other cities, notably Dallas and San Antonio, where well-connected, charismatic and ambitious mayors have worked successfully with business leaders, said Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. But in Hartford, experts said, it has been a well-documented failure.
Absent a strong political leader, in the past two decades Hartford has had eight city managers with questionable skills.
In the 1980's and 1990's, for instance, they negotiated some of the most unfavorable union contracts in the city's history, including a 25-percent raise over three years for firefighters. They also approved rules that allowed executive employees, including the city manager, to collect full pensions after only 15 years of service, terms that experts said would bankrupt any private enterprise. 
At one bizarre point in 1992, the City Council hired a $118,000-a-year manager from Illinois, who lived in Chicago and commuted to Hartford a few days a week.
In 1989, Hartford's City Council latched onto a property-tax policy that has done more to destroy Hartford's business appeal than any other single act, economists said.
In 1988, the state General Assembly passed a law allowing cities to cap residential property taxes at 1.5 percent of market value, and to make up the difference by adding a surcharge on business property of up to 15 percent. Seeing a way to keep more homeowners from leaving, Hartford was the only one of Connecticut's 169 cities and towns to implement the legislation.
"No one was stupid enough to take them up on it except Hartford," said Stan McMillan, manager of the University of Connecticut's Center for Economic Analysis. "Big businesses, who can afford to pay, begrudgingly pay it," he said. "Smaller firms move out of the city."
Hartford's schools have also been mismanaged into dysfunction. In 1994, the city hired a private company, Education Alternatives Inc., to improve its 32-school system, 95-percent black and Hispanic, and among the worst-performing in the nation. But by 1996, the City Council had fired the company, declared the schools "incapable of self-correction" and urged the mayor to declare a state of emergency.
The state has run Hartford's schools for the past five years.
Private-sector leadership failed the city as well, urban experts say. Other cities, Atlanta and Dallas among them, prospered under business leadership. Hartford's business leadership came from a closely knit group called the Bishops, the heads of the insurance companies that for decades dominated the local economy. But at a key juncture in the city's history, the Bishops also played a role in dividing the city against itself.
In the wake of Hartford's race riots of the late 1960's, they developed a secret plan to improve Hartford, called Greater Hartford Process, that envisioned moving Hartford's blacks and Puerto Ricans out to newly purchased tracts in the rural suburbs.
"The idea was to get the poor people out of the city and develop it into this island for the white power structure," recalled the Rev. Michael Galasso, a priest at St. Peter's Church on South Main Street.
Once leaked, the plan outraged neighborhood groups, engendering decades of racial and ethnic distrust.

Racial Divisions
With White Flight, Isolated Minorities
That debacle helped cement Hartford's second failing -- its inability to build any constructive interracial alliances within its own borders. In a state that is 86 percent white, Hartford became an island of poor minorities, with blacks clinging to power they seized in the voting drives of the late 1960's, Hispanics largely disenfranchised and whites warily looking on from the wealthy suburbs.
The results have been disastrous.
Hartford's homeownership rate -- 24.5 percent -- is the second lowest in the nation, half a percentage point higher than Newark's. The 80 percent chance that a baby born here will have a single mother puts Hartford in a dismal class by itself.
The city has lost 45 percent of its property-tax base since 1990 and almost 40 percent of its population since 1950.
"What we've done in Connecticut is segregate Hartford so dramatically by class and race that it's no longer a viable economic unit," said Jefferson Davis, a Democratic state representative who is co-chairman of the legislature's joint Planning and Development Committee. "It can't compete."
The racial Balkanization, which began with the white flight of the 1950's, left blacks in political control and concentrated on the north side of town and Hispanics relatively powerless until recent years and concentrated in the south. 
Interstate highways carved up neighborhoods, and Hartford's downtown became an experiment in urban renewal that knocked down some of its most distinguished old buildings. In their place came, in 1962, Constitution Plaza, which is walled off from the rest of downtown, and the Civic Center, in 1975, now little more than a modest mall with many vacant storefronts.
In the 1980's, Hartford's historically inexhaustible commodity, work, also began to vanish. Between 1980 and 1990, the city lost more than a quarter of its factory jobs. In the 1990's, Hartford's bedrock asset, its insurance industry, was decimated when 25,000 well-paid, high-skill jobs were cut, consolidated or conveyed out of town. Insurance remains central to the local economy. After a modest upswing in jobs during the boom years of the late 1990's, the city had 32,590 insurance jobs in 2001. 
For decades, the Bishops played golf, sat on one another's charity boards and served as the city's financial and political patrons. As control of many of the companies moved elsewhere, the influence of the Bishops in Hartford diminished.
Now, the residential exodus continues, with middle-class blacks moving to north suburban Windsor and Bloomfield and second-generation Puerto Ricans, Peruvians and Colombians expanding into Wethersfield and other towns south of Hartford.

Home Rule
Suburbs Are Free To Ignore the City
But historians and urban planners say the problems go beyond bad decisions to the third and perhaps most acute cause of its plunge -- systemic problems that have hampered all of Connecticut's big cities.
If urban distress amid suburban affluence is a national pattern, the pattern in Connecticut is magnified by the deeply held allegiance to "home rule," each town's authority to zone, tax and enforce its policies without regional oversight. Connecticut and Rhode Island are the only two states in the country that do not have any form of county government, a policy that has kept wealthier towns insulated from failing cities, said Myron Orfield, a Minnesota state senator and author of "American Metropolitics" (Brookings Institution, 2002), a study of how regional government has worked elsewhere.
In Connecticut, regional councils of governments meet regularly, but they are weak and voluntary, mostly concerned with regional transportation problems. Without a broad mandate from the state, Mr. Orfield said, they often end up deferring to the needs of affluent suburbs, not to Hartford.
In other states, he said, like Minnesota, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin and California, regional tax and spending plans have stabilized struggling cities in the same way, he said, that revenue sharing in the National Football League allows teams in small markets to offer salaries equal to teams in major markets.
"There are hundreds and hundreds of jurisdictions competing against each other," he said of Connecticut's 169 cities and towns. "The Avons and Farmingtons are getting much wealthier," he said, referring to two of Hartford's upscale suburbs, "and every year the cities have more poverty and less resources. It builds on itself."
In 1994, the Greater Hartford Regional Chamber of Commerce came up with recommendations to initiate regional tax sharing and other measures to help Hartford. The idea went nowhere, said Joseph O. Ierna, the chamber's former senior vice president.
"The usual comment you got was, 'It's not time,' " he said.
Home rule has also spawned a geographic claustrophobia. With just 17 square miles, half of it covered by untaxable park, church and state property, Hartford is a fraction of the size of Jacksonville, Fla., Indianapolis and Nashville, cities that have annexed their entire counties in recent years to attract the corporate campuses, retail warehouses and strip malls that drive the new economy.
"If you threw in the half-dozen closest neighboring suburbs and said, 'This is Hartford,' I don't know that you would think it was a problem city," said Peter L. Halvorson, director of the Urban Studies program at the University of Connecticut.

Revitalization 'War'
A Wealthy Past, A Possible Future
Driving past the rows of abandoned buildings on South Main Street, just blocks from the gilded state Capitol, it is hard to remember that this city was once the envy of bankers, builders, artists and thinkers and the place of many universal firsts.
Three years after they founded the city in 1636, Hartford's Puritans, led by the Rev. Thomas Hooker, wrote the Fundamental Orders, considered the first written declaration that government authority lies "firstly, in the free consent of the people," and an inspiration for the United States Constitution.
A century later, Hartford businessmen made insurance a New World industry, to reduce the risks of their far-flung maritime forays. By the end of the Civil War, Aetna and the companies now known as the Travelers Property Casualty Corporation, the Phoenix and the Hartford had helped make Hartford an economic power.
Hartford residents went on to invent the revolver, the pay telephone, the gas-pump counter, gold fillings, air-cooled airplane engines and the first American dictionary. 
The few old-timers who still live here remember a bustling city of white-collar insurance jobs and foundries and factories making bicycles, bolts, typewriters and telephone wires. Hartford even had a small but vibrant Chinatown.
"At Christmas, they used to be like ants, people crawling all over the place, like Fifth Avenue," said Juan Roman, 73, a former Hartford police detective who moved here 50 years ago. "Everyone was happy."
Now, in a city where only 12.4 percent of the population has a bachelor's degree, and only 61 percent of adults 25 or older have a high school diploma, it is no wonder that Hartford's new mayor, Eddie A. Perez, in a speech last March to the Metro Hartford Regional Economic Alliance, called Hartford's revitalization "a war."
Still, for all its misery, Hartford remains a city with a serious arts community that includes a ballet, a symphony and a world-class art museum. It is the capital of a wealthy state and the hub of a prosperous metropolitan area. It still has a solid base of insurance jobs. And, there are signs that some of the more difficult battles are winnable.
Mr. Perez, a Democrat and the city's first Puerto Rican mayor, enjoys enthusiastic support among Hartford's Hispanic and black leaders, regional business executives and powerful Republicans, including Governor Rowland.
On Election Day, if voters approve a charter revision, Mr. Perez will become Hartford's first strong mayor in 56 years. It would be a small but crucial change that would once again concentrate accountability in one person. But on the scale of grand plans to turn Hartford around, nothing compares to Governor Rowland's $770 million construction project that he says will turn this into a trendy cafe-and-steakhouse city by 2005.
The project, to be built with public and private money including $529 million in state funding, is called Adriaen's Landing, after the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, the first European to sail up the Connecticut River. It calls for a hotel, a 145,000-square-foot convention center and a $100 million science center near the city's riverfront. It also incorporates street-level shops and apartments downtown, and a nearly completed restoration of a historic downtown building that will house a community college.
It is all meant to turn downtown Hartford into a new home for suburban empty-nesters and a weekend destination for families across southern New England, project supervisors said. "We're developing a critical mass that will create the momentum," said Brendan M. Fox Jr., executive director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority. "There's no doubt in my mind."
Most local and state officials say Adriaen's Landing will infuse Hartford with energy and an infectious buzz. But the project's greatest critics, including cultural historians and urban planners, also say that a city as troubled as Hartford cannot heal itself though an enormous public works project designed to attract outsiders.
Mr. Rowland, who has said his legacy will be Connecticut's urban revitalization, said his critics were missing the point. "I'm not trying to artificially create something," he said. "I'm trying to create the right environment so that good things can happen from that."
But in a city where even second-tier problems are huge -- Hartford's airport, 15 miles away, for example, is the only one its size in the nation that functions without any state subsidy or public transportation -- all roads to recovery go through the wealthier suburbs, experts said. 
"By focusing on city-only policies, we're missing the boat," said Mr. Katz, the urban planner at the Brookings Institution. "If that's all you do, you end up with a Potemkin village that people can come in and visit on the weekends, but that's it."

HEADLINE: $500 Million Left in 9/11 Aid, But Small Businesses Don't Ask 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
David Mirzayev, whose hair salon on Madison Street in Lower Manhattan was closed for two weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center, said "nothing happened" after he applied to a disaster aid program in April, discouraging him from seeking other programs.
 Down the block, Peter Migliorini, whose small grocery is doing 40 percent less business than before the attack, said he had not been aware of government programs offering thousands of dollars in grants for which he could apply. 
 On Nassau Street, two blocks from the trade center site, Shamil Mavruk said that the picture-framing and African and African-American art shop he managed was doing only half its pre-Sept. 11 business, but that he had not applied for government aid because it seemed like "a lot of headache" for too little money.
Despite a recent drive to publicize the two major programs of government grants for small Lower Manhattan businesses struggling to recover -- and often to survive -- in the attack's wake, two-thirds of the two programs' total pot of $772 million is still waiting to be awarded. 
Critics of the programs, who include many of the area's small-business operators and their advocates, say the amount of money not given out shows that the programs are too restrictive to provide adequate help to all the businesses needing it. Officials of the state and city agencies administering the programs say that the money still awaiting takers shows that many potential applicants are still unaware of the programs or do not know to qualify, and that the publicity effort was started to overcome this.
One program is intended to compensate small shops and office-based businesses in Lower Manhattan for revenue losses from the attack. The other is intended to encourage them to stay in the area and to encourage others to move there.
A recent change in the second program that widened eligibility seems to have fostered an intended increase in applications. The publicity campaign, which began July 2, may also have contributed to the increase: it involves newspaper and radio ads as well as city and state workers' visiting Lower Manhattan merchants to spread the word.
But in the program providing revenue-loss compensation, the rate of applications remains below what it was in the month before the publicity effort began.
One small-business advocate, Kevin Curnin, said early last week that the agencies running the two federally financed programs "are still sitting" on a total of more than $500 million in both programs "that could be helping small businesses while they are still here." Mr. Curnin is a lawyer for From the Ground Up, a group of nearly 300 small businesses in Lower Manhattan.
Officials of the agencies have expressed confidence that all the money will be distributed. They have said the restrictions are needed so that enough money will be available for all who ultimately apply and are deemed eligible.
"We want to get this money out," Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the state's Empire State Development Corporation, which is running the programs with the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in a recent interview. 
On Thursday, another government official familiar with the agencies' latest actions said that in an important change, they planned to increase compensation for losses suffered by the small businesses nearest the trade center site, which have generally been hardest hit. 
The official said that the amount of the increases had not been determined. The program now reimburses businesses with up to 500 workers for up to 10 days' worth of losses, up to a $300,000 maximum, in the area from 14th Street to the Battery. The increase is planned only in the area bounded by Chambers and Rector Streets, Broadway and the Hudson River.
The government official said he thought that no changes were planned in the program to encourage businesses to remain in Lower Manhattan or move there.
Mr. Mavruk, the manager of the H & M Art Gallery on Nassau Street, said that this program was of no help to his shop. The program, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant Program, provides up to $5,000 per employee to businesses with up to 200 workers that sign new or renewal leases of at least five years, in the area south of Canal Street. The lease must be signed no later than Dec. 31, 2004.
"We have eight years left on our 10-year lease," Mr. Mavruk said, noting that that makes the program irrelevant to his store. Program officials say a 2004 deadline was set to encourage businesses to stay in or move to the area in the relative short term, when steps to foster a revival are vital.
And with only two employees -- two were laid off as patronage plunged after Sept. 11 -- the $5,000 per worker maximum meant the program would provide "nothing" to the business even if it were eligible, Mr. Mavruk said. 
He cited expenses that include $6,000 a month in rent -- to go back up to its normal $8,500 next year -- and income averaging $10,000 a month, compared with income running $20,000 to $25,000 before Sept. 11.
By Aug. 16, the latest date for which figures were available, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant Program had authorized a possible $22 million in grants to 229 of the 352 businesses that had applied for them, out of a total of $291 million available. 
The precise commitment cannot be determined because payments are generally made in two installments, first when the grant is approved and then 18 months later, with each grant based on the number of employees when it is made. The approvals since applications were first accepted in March total $11.1 million for first installments.
Some critics say the amount committed so far shows that the restrictions are too tight. State and city officials say it is too early to conclude this because businesses will be applying over the next two and a half years. They also say that the application increase since eligibility for the program was widened in late June is also encouraging. From March, when the program began, until June 30, applications averaged 10 a week; since July 1 they have averaged nearly 30 a week.
Eligibility was widened by opening the program to businesses with fewer than 10 employees; earlier it had aided companies with 10 to 200 workers. Half the higher number of applications since July 1 have been from the small businesses.
In the program of compensation for revenue losses, called the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, 9,308 applications were received by Aug. 16. The 8,536 approved involve $238 million in grants out of the $481 million fund. Distributing the remaining $243 million involves "reaching out to the stragglers," those still unaware of the programs, and thus the publicity effort, said Mr. Gargano, the state development chief.
(People interested in the programs may call a city business aid line at (866) 227-0458 or a state line at (800) 456-8369.)
When workers in the publicity campaign visited an area near the Brooklyn Bridge recently, the need for the campaign was clear.
In his Downtown Hair Studio on Madison Street, Mr. Mirzayev, who had been closed for two weeks after Sept. 11, could not recall the program he applied to in April. He said he had been unsuccessful, and had then given up, adding that he was unaware of several publicly and privately financed programs that he was told he could now try.
In Peter's Grocery nearby, Mr. Migliorini, explaining his lack of knowledge of the current programs, said, "Like a lot of the people here, I'm busy working seven days a week."

HEADLINE: In Revolt in the Den, DVD Has the VCR Headed to the Attic 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
Digital videodiscs and their players, which five years ago were not much more than the toys of gadget-lust sufferers, have now taken full wing as a true pop-culture phenomenon.
 According to industry projections, Americans will spend nearly $3 billion more on DVD's this year than they did last, an increase of 50 percent. 
 Some recent hit films, like "The Fast and the Furious" and "Training Day," have earned more money from their DVD releases than from their first-run theater engagements. And for the first time, DVD sales have surpassed those of videocassettes, even though DVD players are in only about a third of American households, compared with a saturation of more than 90 percent for videocassette players.
In the face of this, American retailers have shown the first major signs of making a permanent shift to DVD's from videocassettes, much as they did to CD's from vinyl albums a decade ago. 
"It is the most successful home entertainment device in history," said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video. "In five years, it has gone from zero to 30 million households, and a quarter of those have more than one DVD player. Nothing else has come close to doing that in such a short time, not CD's, not VCR's, not personal computers, not even television itself."
Early estimates in 1997 and 1998, the first years that DVD's were on the market, were that it would take substantially longer for the new format to assert itself. But no one foresaw how quickly Hollywood studios would move to put their recent releases and extensive libraries onto the shiny new discs. By decade's end, all of them had.
And few predicted how quickly the price of DVD players would drop. They typically cost between $600 and $700 in 1997 and now go for $150 to $160, with some retailers last Christmas offering players for as low as $79.
Tom Adams, president of Adams Media Research, a leading monitor of the entertainment industry, said that "the main, wild variable" that caused the explosive growth was the entry of Chinese manufacturers into the DVD player market in the last two years. "That forced the Japanese to slash their prices," he said. "So we have seen both an unprecedented rate of price decrease on the hardware front and an unprecedented rate of software support in the form of movie titles being released."
Adding to the popularity of DVD's is that many computers and gaming systems can now play them. Among other things, that means viewers are no longer chained to their television sets; they can watch DVD's in the car, on the train, even at work.
Bolstering sales further is that, unlike videocassettes, which ruled home entertainment for a generation, DVD's are much more likely to be bought than rented -- sometimes purchased more than once as upgraded or expanded versions of films are released with new bells and whistles.
A case in point is the sequential release on DVD and VHS cassette of three versions of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." A release earlier this month will be followed in November by an expanded version, with 30 minutes of extra scenes woven in and interviews with the filmmakers, and then by a deluxe four-disc set with more features. New Line Cinema, which released film, is counting on some DVD aficionados to buy two and perhaps all three versions, leaving it to future scholars to ponder which is the definitive version of the movie.
The movie's sales pattern in its first days on store shelves shows how rapidly the digital format is supplanting old-fangled videocassettes, particularly for blockbuster films that appeal to a young male audience. While New Line estimates a sales breakdown of 65 percent DVD to 35 percent VHS -- representing no small surge on the DVD front -- Video Business magazine, citing sources from among the studio's unnamed competitors, estimates an even greater disparity. It projects that the film sold 5.2 million to 6.5 million copies in its first week (beginning Aug. 6), of which only a million to 1.5 million copies were VHS.
Making this shift even more lucrative for the studios is the cost of manufacturing DVD's, which at slightly more than a dollar per disc is less than half that for a cassette.
A movie's initial theatrical release, particularly its opening weekend, is still the event that drives the film's performance over all. A box-office hit is more likely to become a pay-television hit and a video store hit. But in terms of actual dollars flowing into studio coffers, home entertainment is king.
Typically, a film's initial release accounts for only one-fifth of what it will eventually bring in, while home entertainment has been more than double that in recent years. And since the advent of DVD, the home entertainment portion has crept up to account for more than half of a movie's ultimate revenue.
In 2001, $10.3 billion was spent in the United States to buy copies of films for home use, of which $5.4 billion, or 52 percent, went for DVD's. Adams Media Research estimates that in 2002, $12.4 billion will be spent, with $8.1 billion, or 65 percent, going for DVD's.
"The initial release of the motion picture in movie theaters is becoming, to a large extent, little more than a preview trailer for the subsequent purchase of the DVD," said Martin W. Greenwald, president of Image Entertainment, which produces dozens of pop-music and DVD titles for the retail market.
"Training Day," the police thriller that won Denzel Washington an Oscar, made $76.3 million in its initial theatrical release but by the end of June had earned $86.1 million on sales and rentals of its DVD, according to the latest figures available.
"The Fast and the Furious" made $144 million at the North American box office, but it had earned the same amount on DVD sales and rentals by the end of June and has continued to be a top seller and rental item since.
The sudden dominance of DVD is transforming the rental market as well as sales: DVD rentals in the first half of 2002 were up 116 percent from the first half of 2001, while video rentals (though still a larger proportion of the rental market) declined 22 percent. Although some in the industry cling to the notion that videocassettes will persevere, most believe they will gradually, or perhaps not so gradually, go the way of the vinyl disc and the dodo bird.
"My guess is that within 24 months it will become very difficult to find any titles in video, other than family films," said Benjamin S. Feingold, president of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group.
Family films are an important part of the home video industry because children, much more than adults, are eager to watch the same movies over and over, making buying them much more economical than renting.
DVD's, which are a vast improvement in quality over cassettes and have many more features -- director commentary, for instance, or alternating endings -- are also changing the way that millions of Americans actually watch movies at home. The enhanced video and audio qualities are nudging more people toward elaborate home-theater systems. The digital nature of DVD allows viewers to pop in a disc and watch only one or two favorite moments instead of a whole film, much like a favorite track on a CD, changing movie watching from a linear experience to a more interactive one.
How these changes will affect the way the movies are made is still largely a subject of conjecture in Hollywood. But everyone agrees there will be inevitable impacts.
Racy or explosive scenes that may not make a PG cut for movie theaters can still be shot in hopes of placing them on DVD versions. And seldom before have filmmakers allowed such early access to behind-the-scenes documentarians, creating a vast new pool of information about how movies are made that, many hope, will have a positive effect on dwindling film literacy.
"Directors have embraced the format so enthusiastically, much more than they ever did with VHS," Mr. Feingold said. "As a result, they're getting involved right from the beginning in the making of the extra DVD material and taking a much more hands-on approach to the DVD release. It can't help but have an impact."
Warner Brothers, the leading studio in terms of DVD sales and rentals, estimates that the number of players in American homes increased 53 percent from mid-2001 to mid-2002. Most experts estimate that, by year's end, about 40 percent of American households will have them.
Add to that personal computers with DVD drives and sophisticated game systems that can play DVD's, and more than half of American households will have the ability to watch DVD's, Adams Media Research predicts.
"One profound impact that DVD is having is that it's re-energized people's buying behavior," said Bob Chapek, present of Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Disney's video and DVD division. "Even in the heyday of VHS, the average household bought about five videocassettes a year. Now, consumers are buying 15 DVD's per year."
Earlier this summer, the Circuit City electronics chain announced that it intended to stop selling videotapes altogether to devote its shelf space to DVD's, and many experts predict that giant retailers like Wal-Mart may soon follow suit. 
"I think we are looking at somewhere this side of five years away when videotapes will disappear from stores altogether," Mr. Lieberfarb said.

HEADLINE: A Huge, Boat-Hurdling Carp Is No Mississippi Fish Story 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: VICKSBURG, Miss., Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Five miles west of downtown Tunica, over the grassy levee that keeps the floods out of town, the fishermen who had gathered by the banks of the Mississippi were telling tales of crazed fish as big as hound dogs that leap out of the water and hit boaters on the head.
 "This year there's a gang of them coming into the boats," said John Robertson, who helps out at a bait shop at Charlie's Landing, a fishing camp. "If you're down there fishing, they'll jump over in the boat to you. I had one guy, it hit him and busted his mouth." 
 In the next fishing camp over, Jack Bryan, who had joined some friends for breakfast beers at Big Roy's, a tavern, said: "It started about two, three years ago. What I was told was, some of these fish ponds got flooded, and they spread all over." Two weeks ago, he said, a flying 48-pounder split a buddy's lip. 
The men were sober. The tales were true. The fish were carp.
Grass carp, bighead carp and the neurotic silver carp -- giant, prolific species all originally imported by catfish farmers in Mississippi and Arkansas two decades ago to control detritus and unwanted plant and animal life in their manmade ponds -- have escaped in floods into the Mississippi, and have begun showing up as far north as Iowa and Illinois.
"They are thick as fleas in Mississippi tributaries," said Bill Reeves, chief of fisheries for the State of Tennessee. 
These carp lack any touches of style, like a swordfish's elegant fins or a sturgeon's scoopy nose. The grass carp "is like an aquatic cow," said Jack Killgore, a fisheries biologist at the Army Corps of Engineers' Waterways Experiment Station, a research center in Vicksburg. "It just grazes." 
Now a more recent arrival, the black carp, is stirring alarm from New Orleans to Ontario. Also known as the snail carp and the Chinese roach, the black carp is a bottom-sucking ogre that can grow five feet long and up to 150 pounds. It gorges on mollusks -- including parasite-infested ram's horn snails, which can populate ponds and infect the catfish with wormy yellow grubs. Teeth in the back of its throat grind up its prey like garbage disposals.
The various carp species, imported from China, Russia and Vietnam, are banned from fish farms in several states. They are edible but largely uneaten here, except by some Asian immigrants for whom they are a dietary staple. 
Most farms get along without them, said Hugh Warren, executive director of the Catfish Farmers of America, a trade association in Indianola, Miss., but a sizable minority believe they must have them. Several farmers in Arkansas breed small numbers of sterile black carp for sale to catfish farms in Arkansas and Mississippi.
As yet, none is known to have escaped a pond for the wild, but after two years of pressure from many states' conservation and natural resource agencies, the Fish and Wildlife Service on July 30 proposed adopting a rule designating the black carp an injurious species. On Aug. 3 it issued a similar ruling for the northern snakehead, a predatory Asian fish that has been found in Maryland, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
"The probability is high" that the rule will be approved for the black carp after a 60-day comment period, said Ken Burton, a spokesman for the service. Opponents, he said, "would have to present very convincing arguments, because all the evidence goes the other way."
The rule would ban the importing and interstate shipping of the carp, although states that now allow them, like Mississippi and Arkansas, could continue to do so. The agency cited other ways to control snails on catfish farms, using chemicals and less invasive snail-eating fish. But some farmers say nothing works like black carp, and they intend to fight the ruling.
In the political storm that is brewing, the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association, made up of natural resource agencies from 28 states and four federal agencies, favors such regulations. State and federal agriculture departments tend to oppose them. 
"I've talked to both of our senators personally," said Mike Freeze, a black carp and bass farmer in Arkansas. "I know both are opposed." The industry has formed a formidable lobby.
The earlier invasion of Asian carp into American waterways, before injurious-species regulations had been written and long after a ban would have any effect, presents a major conflict. It not only sets commercial interests against conservationists and ecologists, but also pits the interests of one business, catfish farming, against the interests of another, the sale of mussel shells to Japan to make cultured pearls.
In Mississippi, catfish have become the state's fourth-biggest crop. Like the casinos that have opened along the Mississippi River, catfish farms have helped sustain a region of the country, the Mississippi Delta, that ranks with Appalachia and Indian reservations in unemployment, poverty and disease. Workers who have lost jobs on mechanized cotton plantations find jobs at catfish processing plants.
Mr. Warren of the Catfish Farmers of America said 395 Mississippi farms raise catfish in 111,500 acres of water. They represent more than half the nation's cultivated production of catfish. Some farmers also raise a hybrid striped bass for restaurants. "And there are people that grow catfish that also grow carp," Mr. Warren said.
But as the grass, silver and bighead carp already in the river grow and proliferate, conservation agencies are finding them no easier to control than alewives, round gobies, the zebra mussels that have stacked themselves along the Mississippi and across the Great Lakes, and the sea lampreys that latch onto fish and suck the life out of them. Carp hug the bottom of the muddy Mississippi, and nobody knows how many there are.
Day by day, fishermen have lately been reporting sightings of the once-infrequently seen silver carp springing like torpedoes from rivers in the Mississippi basin when outboard motor boats pass. "It's common behavior to jump when frightened," Dr. Killgore of the Army Corps of Engineers said. "One clipped my ear."
For a couple of years, bighead carp have been piling into the nets that Bill Lancaster of Sunflower, Miss., sets out for native catfish and buffalo fish. "They've gotten more and more and bigger and bigger," Mr. Lancaster said. "I caught some bigheads last year that weighed over 70 pounds. They tear enormous holes in your nets."
As they head north, John Chick, director of the Illinois Natural History Survey's Great River field station near Alton, Ill., said, "Individuals have been seen up around Iowa and Wisconsin." Their next stop could be the Great Lakes.
Marc Gaden, spokesman for the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission in Ann Arbor, Mich., an organization of the governments of the United States and Canada that seeks to prevent pollution and ecological damage to the Great Lakes, said the fish were "scratching at our door."
"They're very large, they're voracious eaters, and they're very well suited to the climate of the Great Lakes," Mr. Gaden said. 
Jerry Rasmussen, coordinator of large river activities for the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association, which petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service for the ban against black carp, said, "Two bigheads in the 50-pound range have been found in Lake Erie." Mr. Rasmussen said Asian immigrants might have put them there.
To thwart escapees from the Mississippi, and any other fish heading from there to the lakes along the Chicago Sanitary Canal, the Corps of Engineers has installed an electric barrier in the canal that induces them to turn back. "The barrier was turned on in April," Mr. Gaden said. Asian carp have yet to test it, he said, but so far it seems to be working on gobies. 
With relatively few established in the rivers, it is hard to tell which of the carp, if any, will become bearable nuisances, or whether any will become something much worse, like the zebra mussel. As big, gluttonous vacuum cleaners, carp compete with native fish for food and spawning ground. "At some point, we're going to run into a major crisis," said Ronald Benjamin, a fisheries biologist in the LaCrosse office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
Richard Wehnes, fisheries unit chief at the Missouri Department of Conservation, said, "The silver carp has taken off exponentially." Because they compete with largemouth bass, bluegills, redears and crappies for plankton -- single-cell plant and animal life -- Mr. Wehnes said, "Our concern is, what are they pushing out?" 
Although it is too late to stop the other Asian carp, Mr. Wehnes said his office had ordered producers to destroy their black carp. To help them adjust to other means of snail control, he said, the department is providing sterile black carp to use in their ponds temporarily.
Mike Freeze, who raises hybrid striped bass for restaurants, also produces the sterile black carp, which he sells to Mississippi farmers. That business would stop under the Fish and Wildlife Service's rule, and Mr. Freeze is a leader of the lobby against it.
"There has not been a single black carp that escaped into the wild," he said. "It's a legitimate concern." With screens on the drains of the ponds and high leveelike walls around them, he said, "We're extremely careful, and we're being punished for that."

HEADLINE: As Multinationals Run the Taps, Anger Rises Over Water for Profit 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: SAN ISIDRO DE LULES, Argentina 

 BODY:
When Jorge Abdala's water bill jumped to 59 pesos a month from 24 a few years ago, he went looking for someone to blame. He soon found his villain: a French multinational company at the forefront of a global effort to privatize government-run water systems.
 Mr. Abdala, a soft-spoken 54-year-old, scarcely seems the revolutionary. Scrambling for a living like most of his neighbors in this sprawling town tucked up under the Andes, he runs a meager catering business out of his kitchen. 
 But the protests Mr. Abdala organized here forced the company, now known as Vivendi Environnement, to abandon its long-term contract to overhaul and manage the waterworks of the Tucuman Province, where Mr. Abdala and roughly one million other Argentines live. 
"Our main demand was, simply, 'Go home!' " he said, shifting to the edge of his seat in the living room of his simple one-story home. "We kept presenting facts showing that they were not making any investments, just raising the price of water. And any investments they made were with government money."
Vast numbers of people have also demonstrated in Bolivia, in Ecuador, in Panama, in South Africa and elsewhere in a vivid illustration of how highly charged the economics of water have become. At issue is this question: should water, a substance close to life itself, be a profit-making business?
The backlash in Tucuman continues today as the province struggles to find a new company to operate its aging water system. The reaction is still being felt by the big European concerns that dominate the world water business and the Western aid institutions that support privatization.
Already, corporations own or operate water systems across the globe that bring in about $200 billion a year. Yet they serve only about 7 percent of the world's population, leaving a potentially vast market untapped. Protesters are determined to limit that market. 
The protests have heartened the companies' critics, mainly environmentalists who oppose globalization, but also consumer groups and labor unions. They all object to private enterprise making a profit on water.
"Water is a resource essential to life," said Hannah Griffiths, of Friends of the Earth, an environmentalist group based in Britain. "Decisions about allocation and distribution should be democratic and based on everyone's fundamental right to a clean, healthy supply."
Not all agree. Some argue that unless water is treated as an increasingly precious commodity and priced to reflect its value -- particularly for heavy users like farmers and factories -- much of it will be wasted.
It also often takes more money than some governments are willing or able to spend to improve the systems that deliver fresh water to cities and towns around the world, especially to the poor.
But will allowing private enterprise to manage or own many of the world's water systems help overcome those problems? And will it expose the poor to impossibly high water bills?
The widespread inability of public utilities in the developing world to provide clean water is one of the strongest arguments in favor of privatization.
"As a general rule, they're heavily overstaffed, provide poor quality, are unwilling or unable to invest, with not enough money to serve everybody," said John Briscoe, senior water adviser at the World Bank in Washington, referring to public utilities.
But private enterprise appears to be no panacea. Here in Tucuman, Vivendi's critics say that the company recklessly pursued the contract in order to break into the market and that most of the problems it encountered were of its own making.
To Gilda Pedinoce de Valls, a former state's attorney in Tucuman, Vivendi failed to recognize how strongly people feel about tampering with the substance essential to sustaining what has long been a dusty region noted for its citrus fruit crop.
Water, she said, "is a gift from God."
Olivier Barbaroux, the president of Vivendi's water business, agreed -- but only up to a point.
"Yes," Mr. Barbaroux said, "but he forgot to lay the pipes."

More Water, but No Sewers
When water filled the cellar under Basilio Sajnik's pizzeria in downtown Lomas de Zamora, a sprawling suburb of Buenos Aires, he, too, looked for a culprit.
Like Mr. Abdala, he found a leading French multinational. That company, Suez, along with Vivendi has led the push to privatize water management.
In 1992, Suez signed a 30-year contract to manage the water around Buenos Aires. Lomas, a sprawling low-slung city of 600,000 on the capital's southern edge, is home to many of the 2 million people that Suez provided with water for the first time.
But the company was slower to install sewers. Now the cellar under the three-family building that houses Mr. Sajnik's pizzeria is permanently flooded. A pump runs seven days a week.
"It's the third pump I've purchased, yet nobody pays me for the electricity" Mr. Sajnik, 58, said recently as he waded in dirty water almost to the top of his knee-high boots.
The water Suez brought to the neighborhood produced so much runoff that the water table rose, causing streams of sewage to trickle along curbs and flood cellars, even in the driest of seasons. In summer, the stench is overwhelming. So far there have been no outbreaks of sickness, but the threat to public health is constant.
"I could go to court, but it is too slow, and the powerful always win," Mr. Sajnik said. "They say it's nature, and what can you do about nature?"
Suez executives blame Argentina's financial crisis instead of nature. Jacques Petry, chief executive of Ondeo, the water division of Suez, explained in Paris that Suez's original investment plan foresaw the installation of sewers. But the collapse of the Argentine peso has frozen the work. Suez, he said, supports a program to provide 1,500 pumps to the area.
For the time being, said Jean Bernard Lemire, the new chief executive of Suez's Argentine affiliate, spending has been reduced to the essentials: paying wages, buying chemicals and energy, and basic maintenance.
He acknowledges that renegotiating the original contract, which has already been modified dozens of times, mocks the original agreement.
"Of course, our competitors can say, 'Under those conditions, we could have won the contracts, too,"' he said. But he added, "We cannot forecast on a 30-year basis; we have to be flexible."
Overall, Suez says it is proud of its accomplishments in Buenos Aires. It modernized treatment plants that were once on the verge of collapse, and efficiently runs a fleet of more than 1,000 repair trucks. Billings are now computerized. And except for the first eight months, when Suez lost $23 million, it has been highly profitable.
Daniel Azpiazu, director of research at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Buenos Aires, accuses Argentina's political leadership of cynically permitting the public utilities to deteriorate so that voters would embrace privatization.
In a 1992 survey, he said, 82 percent of Argentines questioned had favored privatization. In the haste to privatize, however, regulatory bodies and oversight authorities were rarely installed.
"In the early phase, a regulatory agency was not in place," said Abel Fatala, the engineer in charge of public services in the municipal government of Buenos Aires. "When it did start up, it was made in the image of the water company. The concrete result was that there was no control at all."

A Vast Market Gap to Fill
By 2025, as the world's population grows to eight billion, the United Nations expects the number of people suffering from an inadequate supply of clean water to grow to five billion from the current two billion.
The vast potential to make money by filling that gap has prompted several large multinationals like Vivendi and Suez to target what they see as a lucrative market for the future.
The case for privatization germinated decades ago after the World Bank unsuccessfully tried to fix the public water supply system in Manila. Despite five repair attempts over the years, water loss was as high as 64 percent.
"Fundamentally we realized that without a change in incentives -- some very logical, sensible things -- this was not working," said Mr. Briscoe, of the World Bank said.
Critics still say it is unrealistic to expect private companies, whose main responsibility is to their shareholders, to assume the financial risk of supplying water to portions of the world's population that may not be able to afford it in the first place.
But investors are betting that the business of water will boom in coming decades. "This is a $200 billion market, growing at a 6 percent rate annually, in terms of population," said Hans Peter Portner, a fund manager at Banque Pictet in Geneva who handles the bank's Global Water Fund. He predicts that privatized water systems will expand to serve about 17 percent of the world's population by 2015, up from 7 percent now.
Compared with the Europeans, the American company with the biggest international business in the field, Bechtel, whose directors include former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, is a novice. Another American company, Azurix, a unit of Enron, collapsed before its parent did.
That leaves the field mostly to the French giants, Vivendi Environnement and Suez. Last year, almost half of Vivendi Environnement's $26 billion of revenue came from water; roughly one quarter of Suez's $38 billion in revenue was generated by the water division, Ondeo.
French dominance is now challenged by a third global player, Thames Water P.L.C. of Britain. Thames rose, after Margaret Thatcher privatized water services in Britain in 1989, by swallowing up smaller British competitors. In 1999, it agreed to a $9.8 billion takeover bid from the big German utility RWE A.G.
All three European companies have spent lavishly expanding in the United States. This year, Thames acquired American Water Works, the American market leader, for $7.6 billion. It was playing catch-up to Suez, which spent $6 billion in 1999 to buy United Water Resources and Nalco, a maker of chemicals for water treatment. Earlier that year, Vivendi acquired the U.S. Filter Corporation for almost $8 billion.
Contracts are pouring in. This year, both Suez and Vivendi signed long-term deals, some for up to 50 years, to manage municipal water systems in China, which faces huge water shortages. In Central Europe, cities like Warsaw and Budapest are struggling to upgrade their water systems to meet the standards of the European Union, which Poland and Hungary are expected to join within the next few years.
Industry executives recognize the need for oversight. "It's always a difficult decision to ask a private water company to manage such an essential service," said Gerard Mestrallet, the chief executive of Suez, in his Paris office. "It is your duty to demonstrate that the arrival of the private sector brings something concrete."
But in their hurry, the companies often underbid to get a foot in the door, with prices that fail to take account of the full cost of upgrading old and inefficient water systems. Contracts are therefore regularly renegotiated.
Renegotiation often means that parts of the contract, like obligations to provide sewers to go with water distribution, are cut or scaled back, sometimes causing environmental difficulties. The situation in Lomas de Zamora is a pungent illustration of the point.
Critics charge that it is all part of corporate strategy. If the project doesn't make money, the critics say, the companies cry for renegotiation, threatening to leave otherwise.
Moreover, there is an inherent contradiction in many of the efforts to privatize water systems, particularly those in developing countries.
Municipalities award those contracts in part to shift the investment risk to the private sector. Often, however, the private contractors commit little of their own capital, relying instead on the municipalities themselves, private lenders like banks, and international development organizations like the World Bank or regional development banks.
In South Africa, for example, 80 percent of the money for a recent water development project came from the Development Bank of South Africa. In Peru, 100 percent of the money for a similar project originated at the Interamerican Development Bank.
Given those flaws, opponents, many representing nongovernmental organizations that have becoming increasingly involved in development issues, contend that the role of private companies in delivering water supplies should be sharply limited, confined to simply building things like treatment plants for public entities.
"Water has to be a public good," said Mr. Azpiazu, of the School of Social Sciences. "It cannot be a predator business, in which you stay for a few years, make your money and leave."
In North America, most water remains publicly managed. Yet many municipal systems are old and inefficient, and competition to take them over is intense. Indianapolis, Atlanta and Milwaukee are among the city water services licensed for management and operation to the European giants. In March, Suez landed a 10 year, $4 billion contract to mange the water system of Puerto Rico.
Company executives muse about the billions of dollars modernization of the old and dilapidated water works of great metropolises like New York might one day bring.

Uniting Against Vivendi
After Suez landed its lucrative 30-year contract to manage the water system in Buenos Aires, Vivendi decided to jump in. It bid aggressively for the similar contract in Tucuman Province, even after four other bidders dropped out.
After rates continued to rise, Mr. Abdala joined other consumer leaders from all over the province in calling for a payment strike. Vivendi's collection rate in Tucuman, which rose to 70 percent after it reorganized bill collecting, plummeted to 10 percent.
When Vivendi employees sought to shut off a nonpaying customer's water, Mr. Abdala and other protest organizers sent demonstrators who stood on manhole covers and blocked access to the water mains.
"We lived in a permanent state of mobilization," Mr. Abdala recalled.
In early 1996, after manganese deposits, always present in the local water, became so great that tap water ran the color of cola, popular anger translated into large-scale demonstrations against Vivendi. Local officials blamed the ineptitude of Vivendi's French engineers; Vivendi suspected sabotage.
By the summer of 1998, Vivendi was losing almost $3 million a month in the province, and it unilaterally canceled the contract. One month later, Tucuman Province pulled out of the deal as well. Vivendi then sued Tucuman before a World Bank tribunal, but lost.
Now the province is starting from scratch. Water engineers sent from a neighboring province to run the system have cut jobs at the water utility, to 500 from 850. A regulatory agency is being established to prepare for a new contract later this year.
"We don't know what company will invest here," said Jose Cuneo Verges, a former government official who is working on the project. "Yet we want to show that Tucuman is ready."
That is why Mr. Abdala is still on the case.
"Whoever takes it over must have good ties to us," he said. "We want the participation of consumers."

HEADLINE: In Chelsea, a Growing Demand for Electricity but a Distaste for Substations 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The parking lot on the Avenue of the Americas in Chelsea seemed to Consolidated Edison to be the perfect spot for an electrical substation. After all, the company owned the land, and the site was in the heart of a place that desperately needed more electricity because in the last decade it had been flooded with apartment buildings and art galleries.
 So, Con Edison executives said they expected little opposition to their plan for a nine-story substation, at a price of $70 million, at the corner of the Avenue of the Americas and 24th Street. The local community board even supported it as long as Con Ed met certain conditions. 
 But it turned out not to be that easy. The plan for the substation faced every kind of opposition from residents imaginable, from "not in my backyard" objections to complaints based on assumed health risks, safety concerns and the impact on property values. Ultimately, the city agency that regulates land use rejected the plan. 
"It has left us really concerned about power," said Ed Kirkland, a long-time resident who lives a few blocks from the proposed site and is chairman of the Community Board 4 committee that reviewed the plan. 
Officials from Con Ed and from the New York Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid, say they believe that at least three large plants and nearly half a dozen substations will have to be built in New York City in the next few years to keep pace with demand. 
Yet energy and land use experts say it is becoming harder to find places to put power stations. And with a hot summer as a reminder of just how close trouble could be, these power officials say that their inability to build could mean more difficulties down the road. 
"It was a huge blow to the reliability of the network," said John H. Banks, Con Ed's vice president for government affairs and its chief lobbyist. "Chelsea is going to have a real problem."
Across the city, almost a dozen plans exist for power plants or substations, which are used to convert electricity to voltages low enough to be transmitted to homes and businesses. 
In Chelsea, the need for a new substation is particularly acute. Since the city decided to rezone the neighborhood for residential, retail and office space in 1996, demand for electricity has grown 8 percent each year, compared with about 2 percent for the rest of the city. Con Ed officials say that it is the fastest growing neighborhood when it comes to power use, and the most vulnerable to power failures. 
So two years ago, Con Ed proposed building a new substation on the Chelsea lot, which it had purchased three decades earlier for that purpose. Officials at the utility said the substation could be running by 2004 on the site, which is now home to the Chelsea Flea Market on weekends.
But almost immediately, local residents -- many lured into the neighborhood during the rezoning -- formed a group, the Chelsea Alliance, to oppose the project. By the beginning of 2001, they had some powerful allies, including Councilwoman Christine Quinn, State Senator Thomas K. Duane, Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried and the Gay Men's Health Crisis, which has a clinic for AIDS and HIV patients on West 24th Street.
The coalition opposed the project for a variety of reasons: neighborhood aesthetics, the impact on apartment values, and traffic and security concerns. The group also raised questions about environmental safety and the loss of the flea market.
Sylvia Lachter, the president of the alliance, said it would create a "dead block" where the city had encouraged residents to move when the neighborhood was depressed. The surrounding blocks are now filled with coffee shops, galleries and health food stores, and a hotel sits across the avenue.
Con Ed officials told residents that the substation would be safe, and went to community meetings with architectural drawings showing how the substation would mimic the facades of nearby buildings. 
The alliance proposed instead that the substation be built at a site Con Ed owns at 28th Street at the West Side Highway. But Con Ed said that from an engineering perspective, that site was too far from the center of the neighborhood -- making it harder to get power to customers reliably, and that it was already being used as a maintenance yard.
But before Community Board 4 made its recommendation, politicians rejected such arguments.
Ms. Quinn said her opposition was based on the fact that "you had one side of the government rezoning this area and telling people to come live here, buy expensive co-ops and make this a residential neighborhood," she said. "Then, you have Con Ed going to another piece of the government and saying this neighborhood has grown, so let's put in something antiresidential."
Con Ed officials say that the Giuliani administration supported the plan, but that a few weeks after Michael R. Bloomberg took office as mayor, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, Amanda Burden, told them the 24th Street substation was a nonstarter. In June, the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, which regulates land use, rejected the plan by a vote of 4 to 0.
In an interview, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said that the Bloomberg administration, which had helped Con Ed in its efforts to quickly build a new substation to serve parts of Lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center attack, did not take a position on the 24th Street plan.
But Mr. Doctoroff did say that given the potential for a power crisis within the next five years, officials had to come up with ways to build power stations in rapidly growing areas, and he predicted that local residents would not always be happy with the outcome.
"We certainly have a preference for siting these projects in communities that want them or do not object to them," Mr. Doctoroff said. "But at the end of the day, we have an obligation to make sure the city has the energy that it needs."
Con Edison is now negotiating with several building owners on 30th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue, to purchase land for a substation to serve Chelsea. Con Ed has not said what its plans are for the 24th Street site. 
Mr. Banks, the Con Ed vice president, estimates that such a land acquisition would add $30 million to its cost, adding that "these types of political considerations" are "ultimately why Con Ed has some of the highest rates in the country."
"You can see how hard it is going to be to build several 1,000-megawatt power plants in the city when we can't even get this, just a substation," he added.
In the meantime, Con Ed has placed -- and will continue to add more until at least 2005 -- several gas-fired mini-generators in Chelsea. But the generators have also angered neighborhood residents, who say they spout black smoke and are too loud. 
"We would kill them if the lights went out, so I can't begrudge them the generators," said Mr. Kirkland, of Community Board 4. 
He said that in the long term, Con Ed, power generators and neighborhoods need to learn how to work better together. "If we are going to have electrical power, this stuff has to go somewhere, " he said. 
But such cooperation does not appear to be materializing. The Midtown Civic Association has already decided to oppose construction of a substation on 30th Street.

Ford Appeals Crash Award, Raising Questions of Jury
In the appeal of a case where it was ordered to pay $290 million in damages, Ford has raised questions about the jury's deliberations. The jury in California, after deliberating for five days, had ordered Ford to pay millions to the family of three killed in the rollover of a Bronco. According to Ford and the judge, the deliberations were anything but thoughtful and conscientious.
 The questions raised by Ford are part of a larger debate about whether jurors, lacking in technical and economic training, should be entrusted with the task of punishing corporate wrongdoing. Section A.

HEADLINE: German Candidates Unscathed After First TV Debate 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 25 

 BODY:
The two main candidates to lead Germany squabbled politely tonight in the country's first American-style television debate, displaying their dislike for each other in repeated clashes but landing few solid blows.
 Nor did either man make an egregious error, or add very much to his known positions on the central issues of the economy, immigration, taxes and foreign policy. 
 The debate, with another scheduled for Sept. 8, is unlikely to play a decisive role in the outcome of the Sept. 22 election, since Germans traditionally cast their votes more for parties and their programs than for individual leaders.
But as an experiment in "presidential" politics in a parliamentary system, the 75-minute debate -- advertised as "The Duel" -- was considered a success, with more than eight million Germans watching. 
The incumbent chancellor, Gerhard Schroder of the Social Democrats, overcame a nervous start to display his traditional self-confidence and ease in front of the cameras, and quick opinion polls conducted during and just after the debate indicated that most viewers thought that he had prevailed.
His main rival, the conservative Edmund Stoiber, 60, was less strident than usual in front of the cameras. He scored points against Mr. Schroder's record on unemployment and economic growth, and Mr. Stoiber is considered likely to retain a lead for now.
"Mr. Chancellor, you made a disastrous mistake in your tax reform that is now having dramatic effects," Mr. Stoiber said. "People today are worse off than they were when you took office four years ago."
Then, acknowledging his reputation as a stern, number-loving bureaucrat, he said, "You accuse me of reading too many files, but you should read them more -- then you wouldn't make mistakes."
Mr. Stoiber attacked Mr. Schroder for mishandling "the national disaster that is unemployment," and he reminded everyone of the chancellor's statement that he should not be re-elected unless the number of unemployed, now above 4 million, had fallen to 3.5 million.
Mr. Schroder said unemployment was caused by "international factors, as every reasonable economist knows." 
"You're promising everything to everyone," he said. "Your plans will cost the state 70 billion euros -- it's unrealistic."
Mr. Schroder said his government coalition with the Greens had not been perfect, but he promised "a good combination of economic and environmental sense" to see Germany through to better times.
His calm management of Germany's recent flooding crisis has helped swing more voters toward him, and he worked hard tonight to present himself as unflappable, reasoned and slightly disdainful of Mr. Stoiber, who gave in to his tendency to lecture and wag his finger.
But both men talked more to the two interviewers than to each other, and there was no live audience to play to.
"This wasn't much of an entertainment," said Nils Diederich, a political scientist at the Free University in Berlin. "This was a double interview, not a discussion." He said it was unlikely to do much to sway the large group of undecided voters.
"This was not the bad performance by Stoiber that many people had anticipated," said Reinhard Schlinkert, director of the Dimap polling agency. "Over all it was very disciplined, a very German way of discussing things. It's the standard of discussion in a country where you stop at 3 a.m. at a traffic light, even when no one is coming."
In Dimap's preliminary polls about the debate, about 55 percent said Mr. Schroder did better than Mr. Stoiber. But among men, the margin was only five percentage points, which is within the margin of error, Mr. Schlinkert said.
The Forsa agency also did a poll of more than 2,200 Germans, which found Mr. Schroder's performance more likable, 57 percent to 35 percent. But only a quarter of those polled said "the duel" would have an influence on the election.
"Don't overestimate the importance of the duel," cautioned Uwe Andersen, a political scientist at Ruhr University in Bochum. "The chancellor is not elected directly, and 70 percent of Germans vote for a party, not a candidate."
Still, he said, viewers watched this first debate with eagerness and great expectations. "I thought both candidates were almost even in their performance," he said, "which was a bit of surprise for me."
Even Mr. Stoiber complimented Mr. Schroder on his handling of the flood crisis. But he disagreed with Mr. Schroder's plan to raise taxes for a year and to postpone a tax cut to pay for the damage.
On Iraq, Mr. Schroeder repeated that he would not allow German soldiers to fight in a war to depose Saddam Hussein. Germany "will come to the aid of allies when attacked," as the United States was on Sept. 11, he said. But the debate in America now is about overthrowing Mr. Hussein, while the United Nations aims to send in arms inspectors. "It can't be the aim of the United Nations to replace Saddam Hussein," he said.
Mr. Stoiber said Mr. Schroder was undermining the allied unity needed to pressure Mr. Hussein to admit arms inspectors, but hastened to say that "no German chancellor ever would join a military adventure."
Mr. Stoiber seemed most awkward when he tried to remind Mr. Schroder that "you once said, 'Edmund Stoiber, he keeps his word.' "
Mr. Schroder laughed and said, "That was a long, long time ago."
The only surprising question was about the role of the candidates' wives. Mr. Schroder's fourth wife is a former political journalist for the tabloid Bild who has accused the paper of attacking him. Mr. Stoiber's wife has stayed in the background.
Mr. Schroder said, "I sometimes ask myself what kind of view do we have of women if they are reduced to a role where women should not comment on political issues."
Mr. Stoiber, at his starchiest, said: "I don't want to pass judgment on that. My wife doesn't comment on current events. She supports me."

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH/J. Allan Hobson; 
A Rebel Psychiatrist Calls Out to His Profession

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
When Dr. J. Allan Hobson, 69, a Harvard psychiatrist and dream researcher, arrived for an interview, he had a notebook filled with his writings, photographs of his extended family and renderings of his summer house in Italy.
"This will help introduce me," Dr. Hobson said.
 "I believe you need to get to know about me quickly," he added, demonstrating an easy informality and perhaps belying the stereotypes about uptight psychiatrists. 
 But then, Dr. Hobson, director of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, is known as a convention-defying psychiatry rebel. 
His books include "The Dreaming Brain," "The Dreaming Drugstore" and "Dreaming as Delirium." His latest work, "Out of Its Mind: Psychiatry in Crisis: A Call for Reform," written with Jonathan A. Leonard, (Perseus, $17) and just published in paperback, is an exhortation to reorganize the profession he has practiced more than 40 years.

Q. In a nutshell, why has psychiatry gone "out of its mind"?

A. Because it's lost its way. In 1960, when I first went into it, the specialty felt very coherent. But psychiatry, at the time, was being held together by psychoanalysis.
Over the years, psychoanalysis became "the god that failed." At the same time that many psychiatrists became disillusioned with psychoanalysis, they failed to pick up on its humanistic implications, the idea that people, on a one-to-one basis, could help each other. Finally, there's been the unwitting success of medication, which enabled psychiatrists to empty the mental hospitals without really caring for patients.

Q. Has psychiatry "lost its way" partly because of the economics of mental health financing?

A. Oh, absolutely. The states no longer take responsibility for the mentally ill. There's a constant call for privatizing the care of these people, which is impossible. No one will ever be able to make any money off of this kind of business. It's silly. These people have severe handicaps. Even if they're walking around the streets on Thorazine or whatever, they're still very impaired people.
When I began my training, I couldn't have anticipated the emptying of the mental hospitals and seeing people on the streets. But these are the most disenfranchised of the disenfranchised, and almost no one speaks up for their interests. My own institution, Massachusetts Mental Health Center, which is located on a very prime piece of medical real estate, is constantly threatened with closure.

Q. Why did psychoanalysis become "the god that failed"?

A. I think people became disillusioned with psychoanalysis, because it was, ultimately, a strange way of caring for people. There was this tendency in the psychoanalytic world to imply that everything was psychodynamic.
In my own training, I saw things that seemed cruel and that I believe, partly, led to the downfall of psychoanalysis. Very strange, for instance, was this business of distancing oneself from patients in order to obtain what was thought of as a crucial objectivity. Even stranger was the idea of blaming mothers for what happened to their kids. Or worse, blaming the patients themselves. 
This notion that everything was psychodynamic, I think, led to poor patient care. During my years of training, I was told, for instance, to control psychosis with psychoanalysis, which couldn't work.
I was told that I shouldn't give anyone medication, because it would muck up transference. I mean, I was dealing with catatonic schizophrenia people who were really, really crazy.
Then came the revolution of psychopharmacology, and suddenly the pendulum swung the other way. Psychotherapy was down the drain, including the more useful parts, like humanistic psychology and an understanding of the unconscious.
At the same time the field was declining, there have been tremendous breakthroughs in the brain sciences. I want to say to medical educators, "We've finally got what Freud always wanted, the chance to make a psychology based on brain science."

Q. How would you reorganize medical training so that you'd attract better and more students to your speciality?

A. I'd tell them that they have a chance to work on one of the last great medical frontiers, which psychiatry could be. This is a field where they'll have license to talk about psychology and physiology and philosophy, all together. Where else can you do that?
I'd make the courses exciting. There was a professor named Fred Barnes at Brown University who's always said it is astonishing the way psychiatrists had managed to mess up the field and make it unexciting. In his psychiatry courses, he had actors come in and act out these little dramas for medical students. The students got hooked, emotionally, by what they saw. The rest was easy.

Q. Let's return to the clinical part of your work. Considering the state of mental health care, if you were an ordinary citizen with run-of-the-mill health insurance and a teenager showing schizophrenic symptoms, where would you go for help?

A. I would be at a loss. It's devastating. The families watch their kids founder because, in most cases, there's no place for them to go.
I've got a brain-damaged son. He's 40 now, and we've managed well. Part of the reason is that we found good outside help. Ian lives in a group home. He supports himself completely. And he's a happy man. He comes to see my younger children, 6-year-old twins, and he's very involved with them.
Of course, I would have liked a different scenario for Ian, but I feel ennobled by this boy. Every time I see him, I feel better. And this is a feeling that I believe should be engendered in psychiatrists as they care for their patients.
I still have patients that I saw in the beginning of my career. With the seriously ill patients, on the whole, they don't stop being mentally ill, but they can do well. They can do better because a doctor cares for them. And you can be clever with the medications, restrained about their use. Probably the most important thing you can do is to give them a sense of human place with you.

Q. The recent film "A Beautiful Mind" has brought issues of mental illness into the public consciousness. As a therapist, have you found it a useful tool?

A. I suspect a lot of people have taken to this movie because it appears in some ways to simplify, even romanticize, mental illness. I know, for instance, someone whose own personal history is very troubled. She's just rhapsodic about it. She thinks of herself as miraculously cured, and she's not.
Most people don't like the reality of mental illness. You can't just say, as some do, that being straightforward with patients will get them well. They don't get well easily, and sometimes they don't at all. What psychiatrists and the patients' families need to do is be straightforward, not abandon the person, not get impatient, not feel like we're a failure if we don't cure them. We're dealing with chronic long-term disability, and nobody likes it. You don't want to have it. And you don't want a family member to have it. But it happens.

HEADLINE: A DOCTOR'S JOURNEY; 
Ancient Ways, Harsh Terrain and Many Bugs

BYLINE:  By BEN DAITZ 

 BODY:
Roosters are on my mind. After all, Hilly Kaplan and I have been up all night talking with "El Gallo," -- the Rooster, if you will -- certainly one of the most fascinating men I've ever met, and not just because of the Cuban rum we have been nipping on till four in the morning.
 El Gallo is a Bolivian hydraulic engineer, and Hilly and I have been sitting for five hours on the porch of his mother's small hotel in San Borja, Bolivia, a frontier town of 12,000 people in the Bolivian Amazon. We have been talking Bolivian and world politics, rural development, anthropology and health care. El Gallo is well versed in almost all those topics, quietly charismatic in multiple languages, but best of all, he is a great storyteller. 
 He describes himself as a former Marxist guerrilla who trained as an engineer in Moscow in the 70's and remained in the former Soviet Union through the 80's. Now he is an entrepreneur with a mission: the empowerment of his people, the mestizos and Indians of El Oriente, the northeastern Bolivian jungle. 
Most recently, he engineered a potable water system for a small town seven hours by bus from here. The project was completed over three months ago, but he still has not been paid. El Gallo is no longer a Marxist, but he shrugs and says the Bolivian system is so corrupt that not even capitalism works.
My friend Hillard Kaplan and I are members of a medical-anthropological team, and we have come here to live and work with the Chimane Indians, who live in isolated villages up and down the Rio Monique, a distant tributary of the Amazon. San Borja will be the last town we will see for a while, before we head upriver to Chimane communities that have rarely, if ever, received any medical attention.
Hilly, a professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico, has spent years studying hunter-gatherer people in South America and Africa, trying to answer questions like: Why do children remain dependent for so long compared with other primates and mammals? Why do women stop reproducing in their early 40's, when they are still healthy? Why do people live so long in simple economies and very tough environments?
I am a physician on the faculty of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, and I am here to help with the medical aspects of these and other questions. Hilly and I met at the university in 1987, when he invited me to go with him on an expedition to the Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon, one of the few places left in the world where people still avoid contact. 
I spent four months with Hilly, treating the Machiguenga and Piro Indians. The problems were immense: TB; leishmaniasis, a tropical disease that causes progressive ulcers of the skin and mucous membranes; malaria; chronic diarrhea in infants and adults; and an average of six species of intestinal parasites per person.
So I already have a pretty good idea about what I will see among the Chimane of the Rio Monique, but this time Hilly and I will have more help. We have already enlisted the support of the Bolivian Ministry of Health, and although short of money, supplies and personnel, the agency went out of its way to make our trip easier.
Health care for the Chimane (pronounced chee-MAH-neh) is largely nonexistent. There have been some immunization campaigns, but the health ministry has no real data on the percentage of people vaccinated or on the incidence of chronic disease. The small country hospital in San Borja is equipped to do simple surgery, but little outreach effort, if any, is offered to surrounding jungle communities.
We are a team of 10, arriving today from La Paz, after a bus trip down the eastern slope of the Andes on a narrow, road that averages two deaths a month. This year the average will be higher. In June, a bus went over the edge; 45 people were killed.
Hilly's former Ph.D. student, Michael Gurven, is here, now an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California at Santa Barbara and a co-investigator on this binational project financed by the National Science Foundation. Mike spent three months here last year, securing permission for our trip, scouting villages and learning some Chimane.
In addition, we have brought Stacey Rucas, Jeff Winking and Jose Carlos Cavalcanti, students in U.N.M.'s human evolutionary ecology program, and Robin Mamani, an anthropology graduate student from Bolivia, who has worked with the Chimane and speaks the language. Reuben Cuba, Monica Calisaya, and Edhitt Cortez are young Bolivian physicians with the project.
The Chimane are living as our ancient forebears did, without market economies, health care or schools, and what we hope to learn from them is what happened to humans at the end of the Pleistocene -- about 12,000 years ago, when they stopped living in small hunting bands and began living in villages and growing their own food. This was a big change in human demography, a major transition in human health.
The anthropologists among us will be investigating what makes a good hunter or fisherman or farmer or weaver. How do people spend their days? What is the social structure of the community? What, and how much do they eat? The physicians will be taking their histories, listening to their hearts and lungs, probing for their livers and spleens -- and all of us, living together with these people, will be learning how their health and their life course interact.
El Gallo already has a pretty good idea about what is happening with the Chimane. Our conversation finally breaks up at 4:30 a.m. and he embraces us, and says in advance, "Thank you for helping my people."
As I lie in bed in the Hotel Avenida just before dawn, I hear a single rooster crow. The signal call of this gallo is followed by a cacophony, the likes of which I have never before experienced. I listen to whole fiddle sections of roosters answering one another in layered choruses from all quarters -- rooster surround-sound that continues for at least two more hours, until the sun breaks and the first motor scooters blast by on the only paved road in San Borja. 

A Plague of Mosquitoes
As the parrot flies, it is only about 60 miles to Cuvirene, but it takes us more than six hours in a vintage Ford truck, our team and all our equipment piled in back. Along the way, we pick up Chimane trudging along the road to distant settlements. Whole families climb on board; a hunter with bow and arrows, and a small javelina, a wild pig, slung over his shoulders; a number of women, old beyond their teenage years, with babies at the breast; in total, about 30 people crammed into our truck.
The red clay jungle road into the rain forest may as well have been paved with mahogany. Stands have been stripped clean by loggers who pay the Chimane a concession for the rights to the wood, then pay an individual Chimane about $5 for finding a tree. Now, Chimane have to walk four to five days through the jungle to find one. Then, the loggers bulldoze a trail and drag it out.
Cuvirene is a thatched hut settlement of about 80 people, actually more a grouping of extended family compounds, separated from one another by quarter- or half-mile jungle trails. We arrive to a spectacular jungle sunset with piled thunderheads suffused with orange light.
We are quickly suffused with mosquitoes. We unload our gear, swatting our faces, cursing. There is no escape. Those of us who have experienced mosquitoes in the jungle have been preparing the uninitiated with our personal worst attack stories for days. My own recollection was of trying to examine a Machiguenga Indian who probably had active TB and was coughing in my face as I was sneaking breaths to the side and sucking mosquitoes in with each gulp. That experience was a 10; this, about a 9 on my scale. The plague is so intense, we plunge into hastily erected tents and mosquito nets at 7:30, forgoing dinner.
In the morning, we are attacked anew, and the experience is made worse by having to scrounge the surrounding jungle for dry firewood to boil drinking water we have hauled from the muddy Cuvirene.
We forgot the baking powder and the spatula. Half our cooking pots have not made it from La Paz. The pancakes flopped. Battery acid has leaked over a third of our gear. It is 96 degrees with 87 percent humidity. We all stink. No one has diarrhea -- yet. 
When we finally venture out to meet the people of Cuvirene, there are only women and children around. All the men, the women say shyly, have gone hunting.
We understand this because Alfredo Zelada is with us. Alfredo is a Chimane who speaks excellent Spanish, and we have brought him from San Borja. Alfredo is a handsome man, his face the color of the mahogany that is no longer here. Alfredo is a promotor de salud, a community health worker trained, he tells us proudly, with other Spanish-speaking Chimane in a one-month course.
The problem is, there is no money to hire them. This is Alfredo's first gig.
It turns out he is a genius. First, he smoothed our way with a group of very frightened women and children who probably had never seen a group as white or gear-laden as ourselves.
This afternoon, after the hunters return with about 175 pounds of mixed jungle grill, Alfredo gently explains that we have not come, as rumor had it, to boil their women and children for their oil.
Alfredo gives a little talk to the assembled community of perhaps 50 people. His body language is eloquent, and by public health standards, his presentation is extraordinary, resulting over the next week in our being able to do health histories and physical exams on 160 people, practically the entire populations of Cuvirene and the neighboring village of Aperecito. 
Alfredo is wise and skilled, but I will never forget his question to us, riding in the back of the truck to Cuvirene. Mike was plotting settlements we passed on a Global Positioning System device to make an accurate map of Chimane country, and we tried our best to explain satellite technology to Alfredo. It was then that Alfredo asked if it was true that men had been on the moon.

Cause of Death: Witchcraft
"Chimane is the toughest language I've come across," Hilly says. Hilly is a quick study, and languages are a forte, but Chimane seems to start somewhere on the back palate and then come whining out the nose, with a little reverse spin.
Learning Chimane is a must, however, and the team jumps right in, asking questions, and using complementary body language the members never knew they had. The anthropologists begin a community census: How many children? Who's related to whom? Alfredo shuttles back and forth, translating for the anthropologists in the morning, and for the four doctors taking complex histories in the afternoon.
We hold our clinics in Martin's house. "Martin, "El Corregidor" (The Mayor), is printed in yellow on the back rail of his chair, and his is the only chair in town. He sits in it now, in the middle of the mud floor of his house, watching us work, scratching mosquito bites on feet so well-developed, that they function better than the best cross-country trainers. 
I ask Alfredo to ask my patient, Ignacio, how old he is. Ignacio has no idea. My best guess is 50. Ignacio tells Alfredo that his three brothers all died from witchcraft.
Ignacio has the biggest inguinal hernia I have ever seen. His scrotum extends halfway to his knees, filled with loops of herniated bowel that I hear gurgling with my stethoscope. Ignacio was one of the best hunters in Cuvirene but now he can no longer bring back meat for his family of five. I ask Ignacio whether he would consider going to San Borja for an operation. He says yes, but Alfredo and I wonder if he knows what we are talking about.
Casimiro, Martin's son, is about 14. When Casimiro taps me on the shoulder and shows me his arm, I am pretty sure I am seeing our first case of leishmaniasis, the parasitic disease spread by the bite of the sandfly. There are two weeping ulcers on Casimiro's lower arm, each about one and a half inches in diameter. They are angry infected sores that have been growing for at least six months. I examine Casimiro and find enlarged tender lymph nodes near his elbow and in his armpit, at least presumptive evidence that the parasitic infection may have already spread.
A recent paper in The New England Journal of Medicine described a new, less toxic treatment for the disease, and I have brought a supply of it with me, thinking that we may be able to use oral tablets instead of the long series of intramuscular injections that await Casimiro. But after consulting the Bolivian Health Ministry, we decide to wait until there are confirming studies. 

Powerful Jungle Brew
We spend our days in Cuvirene and Aperecito, examining patients, making new friends, and sharing bowls of chicha, the sour, fermented, jungle beer made from manioc. Manioc, or yucca, is the staple carbohydrate in Amazonia and Africa. It is a tuberous root, the source of tapioca, but it bears little resemblance to the pudding. Manioc is traditionally dug, and then masticated -- chewed in giant chews by the women of the village. Their saliva starts the fermentation process, and after they spit the chew into a large bowl, it takes two or three days to make a fairly powerful brew. 
Then it's party time.
Traditionally, everyone, including children, is offered a drink. Both in Peru and Bolivia, I have watched enough chicha being consumed to think it is a significant medical problem. No commercially made alcohol is evident here, but there are people with obvious drinking problems.
Chicha also seems to ruin teeth. Very few women over 25 or 30 have any teeth left, and with no teeth, it is hard to be well nourished. We are also hearing reports of multiple intestinal parasites and seeing clinical signs of anemia. Initial tests show very little body fat. (The Cuvirene dog pack are the skinniest I have ever seen, ribs protruding like washboards, and I somehow think there is a corollary message here.)
Very few children or adults have been immunized. There are chronic cases of dermatitis from infected insect bites, and eye and ear infections in kids and adults. In the village of Aperecito, we find many cases of pneumonia, and one man with symptoms suggestive of TB. We also suspect there are a fair number of women with sexually transmitted disease. The gossip is the mahogany loggers are to blame, but pelvic exams will have to wait for more time, and trust.

A Shakedown Trip
We leave Cuvirene, having accomplished more than we expected. We view this first excursion as a shakedown trip, a chance for the team members to get to know one another, to work out kinks. After we get back to San Borja, we will split into three groups, with anthropologists and doctors assigned to each. Then, the teams will spend the next year living and working in about 12 different Chimane communities.
Hilly and I plan to return to the jungle over the course of the project -- that is, if we ever leave. It has rained all day, and our truck, which has come to take us back to San Borja, is stuck an hour and a half away. We trudge through ankle-deep jungle mud to dig it out of a ditch, and then stop to push it 10 more times on the way back to San Borja. We have brought Casimiro, Ignacio and their families with us, and we finally reach San Borja at 3 a.m., 10 hours after we started.
The next day, after we buy the antibiotics, anesthetic agents, sutures and IV bags at a local pharmacy (the hospital has few supplies in stock), Ignacio's hernia is successfully repaired. The surgeon tells me Ignacio's hernia is also the biggest he has seen.
I bring Casimiro to the hospital that afternoon. I think he is scared to death, but he is very brave and I tell him so. He smiles. The sores are so characteristic of leishmaniasis, that he has started on treatment with a series of injections of antimony, the heavy metal, standard treatment for this disease. We should know in a month if he is better. 
"Que aprendiste?" El Gallo" asks me later. "What did you learn?"
I tell him that over the next year we will learn much more, but my overall impression is that the Chimane are really living in two worlds. In the old world, hunter-gatherers were once on the top rung of the social ladder. But the Chimane, and many other people, are late coming into the new world. They have lost, or are losing their territory and their resources. They are exposed to new diseases and complex social systems, and now they are an underclass, on the bottom rung. I tell him the questions I have been thinking about are all "what next" questions, and he nods and I know he understands, completely.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Early Declines Create Bargains, and Shares Rally Late

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors looking for a reason to buy stock found one late yesterday, as an early decline made prices too attractive to pass up. The resulting rally sent stocks moderately higher for the day. 
 The advance, which came on extremely light volume, followed a wave of profit taking that began on Friday. Investors were buying cautiously, but that was not surprising given the size of the market's recent advance and analysts' doubts about the durability of the gains. 
 "Investors are a little hesitant to commit more capital until September passes," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Financial Services in Philadelphia. "We probably aren't going to see a rush of buyers in the next few weeks." 
The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 116 points at midday, closed up 46.05 points, or 0.5 percent, at 8,919.01. The Dow dropped 180 points on Friday as investors collected profits from five consecutive weekly gains. 
Broader market gauges were also higher yesterday after shaking off early profit taking. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.09 points, or nearly 0.8 percent, to 947.95, having had five consecutive weekly advances. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq index advanced 11.12 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,391.74, after rising three consecutive weeks. 
The market's turnaround, which solidified late in the session, indicated how much sentiment has shifted toward buying rather than selling. Still, analysts said, investors are cautious and want to remain safe ahead of the Labor Day weekend. 
Analysts expect investors to continue to be wary in the weeks ahead. 
Whether the market's recent gains are a short-term blip in the bear market or the start of a longer-term, lasting advance remains to be seen. For answers, investors next month will look to see how the market handles the latest round of economic data and the third-quarter profit forecasts. 
Among yesterday's gainers, Hershey Foods rose $1.77, to $76.80, on a report that the Swiss food conglomerate Nestle was offering $11.5 billion for the company. 
Clear Channel Communications, the leading owner of radio stations in the country, rose $1.48, to $34.65, after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the company.
Hewlett-Packard advanced 15 cents, to $14.85, ahead of its fiscal third-quarter earnings, which will be released today. 
But United Parcel Service fell 57 cents, to $64.71, on a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. 
Fairchild Semiconductor dropped $1.20, to $13.45, after Bear, Stearns downgraded it, citing its price cuts. 
A pair of reports showing an increase in sales of both new and existing homes in July had little effect on stocks. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News) -- The prices of Treasury securities gained yesterday on expectations that a consumer confidence report today will indicate that the economic recovery is slowing.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.22 percent from 4.24 percent on Friday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 5/32, to 10 18/32. 
The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.01 percent from 5.02 percent. Its price rose 6/32, to 105 15/32.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Suggests Rates Won't Be Cut 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said today that the economic recovery was set to keep rolling, most likely without requiring further cuts in interest rates. 
 In comments that echoed other Fed officials' apparent reluctance to cut rates again, the Fed official, William Poole, said that if economic growth in coming months was weaker than forecast, interest rates would stay low for longer as well. 
Mr. Poole, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy committee this year, stressed the long-term health of the economy, including low inflation and rising productivity.
He cited economists' consensus forecasts of 2.5 percent growth over the second half of the year, but outlined possible alternative outlooks of stronger and weaker growth.
His comments resembled those of several Fed officials last week suggesting that policy makers had no immediate inclination to cut rates.

HEADLINE: ON THE GROUND: Newark; 
A Gateway to New York Is Enjoying a Renaissance

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN 

 BODY:
Newark -- a 15-minute train ride from Manhattan -- is a leading gateway to New York. But this third-oldest major American city has been enjoying a renaissance, and there are several reasons to stay in town. Newark is aggressively fighting to eradicate its reputation for crime; in fact, crime has decreased more than 50 percent in the last six years. 
 In recent years there has also been an influx of businesses, including the IDT Corporation, MBNA and the SBLI USA Mutual Life Insurance Company, which join stalwarts like Verizon, PSE&G, Merrill Lynch and Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The city has begun an effort to revitalize its waterfront, with the Faneuil Hall area of Boston and South Street Seaport in Manhattan as models. The F.B.I. will become the first organization to establish a presence there when construction is completed on its new office building. 
 Just west of the business district is the University Heights Science Park, a collaborative program for economic and community development that offers technology businesses modern office space, research facilities and assistance. The International Center for Public Health, a research center, relocated to Newark from Brooklyn this year.
Surrounding highways are undergoing major improvements, and transportation connections are some of the best in the region. New Jersey Transit (800-626-7433) provides a shuttle bus to points of interest around town, including to and from evening performances at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. You can also take the train directly to Newark International Airport.
Gateway Center, the largest office complex, is connected by an elevated bridge to Penn Station, where you can catch a train to New York or an Amtrak train to more far-flung destinations.

HOTELS
The NEWARK AIRPORT MARRIOTT (973-623-0006, $170 to $200), the only hotel on the airport grounds, is convenient for holding interviews or conducting meetings. Besides a 24-hour health club, there's a new cigar bar and patio, a telescope to track air traffic and an airline monitor in the lobby to check flight schedules.
If you like new, the WYNDHAM NEWARK AIRPORT (908-436-4600, $129 to $238), one of the many chain hotels near the airport, is less than a year old. 
In town, the HILTON NEWARK GATEWAY (973-622-5000, $229) is in the heart of the business district and is directly connected to Penn Station and the Gateway Center. Amenities for the business traveler include a business-services center and executive lounge.
In the arts district, the ROBERT TREAT HOTEL (973-622-1000, $125 to $142) has been a landmark since 1916. Combining old-world charm with modern conference facilities, it is a favorite of the celebrities, like Harry Connick Jr., who appear at the arts center.

DINING OUT
In the arts district, ARTHUR'S DOWNTOWN (973-286-1700) is popular with the locals for business lunches. Its banquettes and Art Deco styling give it a club atmosphere, and the bar is a pleasant place to dine alone. Lunch for two, including tip but not wine, runs about $25.
The upscale MAIZE restaurant (973-639-1200, $70 for lunch for two with tip and wine) in the Robert Treat Hotel offers lunch at no charge if you're not out in an hour.
Consider yourself lucky if the company you are meeting with has a corporate membership at the NEWARK CLUB (973-242-0658). Gabriella Morris, president of the Prudential Foundation, likes to bring out-of-town guests here for lunch. "Not only is the food wonderful," she said, but the views of Manhattan and the Passaic River "satisfy your visual appetite as well."
The THEATER SQUARE GRILL (973-297-5872) in the arts center has a $45 prix fixe dinner (wine is extra).
Ethnic restaurants abound in Newark. For lunch, Ms. Morris recommends JE'S (973-623-8848; $40 for two, including wine and tip, for either lunch or dinner) for soul food. 
In the Ironbound District, so named because it is surrounded by railroad tracks and bordered by highways, FORNO'S OF SPAIN (973-589-4767, $75 for dinner for two with wine and tip) is a good bet. The Ironbound is known for its large Portuguese community, its many Portuguese restaurants and its flourishing Portuguese night life.

ENTERTAINMENT
The NEW JERSEY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER (888-466-5722) is one of the best-known arts centers in the area. Although the free outdoor summer music series is over, regular events include jazz, classical music, pop stars, dance and theater.
At the Maize restaurant, the eclectic lounge is like a comfortable living room. Entertainment is provided Wednesday through Saturday nights in the fall.
PRONTO CENA RISTORANTE (973-824-8999) in the Legal Center across from Gateway Center, has a river view and jazz on Thursday nights.

ON YOUR OWN
If you have a couple of hours to spare, you might like to stroll through the NEWARK MUSEUM (973-596-6550). If you have children in tow, try the child-friendly interactive exhibit about the New Jersey Turnpike at the NEW JERSEY HISTORICAL SOCIETY (973-596-8500). After its move some time this fall, the ALJIRA, A CENTER FOR CONTEMPORARY ART (973-643-6877) will have its contemporary art exhibits on display again.

LOCAL LORE
Newark has a long history as a baseball town. Professional baseball dates back to 1902 with the formation of the Newark Indians, who later became the Newark Bears. Newark was also home to the Newark Eagles of the National Negro League.
Rick Cerone, former New York Yankee All-Star catcher and Newark native, helped to revitalize the Newark Bears franchise. The team plays at the three-year-old Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium.

 BODY:
Losing Billions And Charging Less
The airlines continue to lose billions, and air travel continues to get cheaper. 
 Average domestic air fares declined 9.1 percent and average international air fares were down 1.3 percent in July, compared with the month a year earlier, according to the Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade group. 
 "In order to stimulate demand, airlines have reduced prices to levels not seen since 1988," said David A. Swierenga, the chief economist at the trade group.

Travel Demand Perks Up a Bit
Overall travel demand appears to be picking up at the end of the summer, according to a new survey done by Orbitz, the online booking site, for the Travel Business Roundtable, a travel industry group. 
Nearly 90 percent of Americans are now traveling at least at the same level as they were a year ago, according to the survey, whose conclusions were extrapolated from interviews with 700 Americans who have taken at least one airline trip of spent one night in a hotel in the last six months. 
Leisure travelers have led the way. Frequent business travelers are among the most reluctant to resume former robust travel patterns. 
"There is a clear lag in the resumption of business travel patterns," said Jeff Katz, the president and chief executive of Orbitz. "Among frequent business travelers, 17 percent say that they are traveling less now -- 5 percent more than the population at large," he said. 
Jonathan Tisch, the chairman of the Travel Business Roundtable and chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels, said that besides economic constraints, the "hassle factor" associated with airport security was one reason for the lag. 
Among those surveyed, 79 percent of frequent business travelers reported being subjected to heightened security treatment, like pat-downs and orders to remove shoes. 
In addition, the survey found, more than one in 10 travelers said they had canceled flights or were flying less because of the "hassles" of airport security.
Among female business travelers who have reduced their level of flying because of security checkpoint experiences, 31 percent have done so because of what they described as a personal "intrusion from security." Of male business travelers who have reduced their travel, only 4 percent cited such intrusion as the reason.

Giving the Boot To Substandard Hotels
Hotel chain executives have a phrase to describe what happens to franchise holders drummed out of the chain. "Taking the flag down," they call it. 
Usually, it's a quiet process. Last week, however, the Cendant Corporation surprised the industry when it announced Project Restore, which it described as a campaign to "purge its systems of substandard quality hotels" and of franchise holders who do not pay their bills on time.
Hotels with a total of about 40,000 rooms -- about 7 percent of the company's capacity in about 6,600 properties -- may get the boot. Already, 300 hotels have received notice, the company said. 
Cendant's brands include Days Inn, Ramada, Super 8 Motel, Howard Johnson, Wingate Inn, Knights Inn, Travelodge, Villager Group and AmeriHost Inn. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Set a Record Pace Last Month 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes surged in July to the highest monthly level on record, and sales of previously owned homes also increased, two reports released today said.
 Sales of new homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.02 million in July, a record monthly pace and a 6.7 percent increase from June, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Sales of existing homes rebounded in July, rising 4.5 percent from June, to a rate of 5.33 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
Home sales have been a bright spot of the economy, mostly because of low mortgage rates, which remain below levels of a year ago. Another factor motivating buyers, economists said, is the appreciation in housing values. 
In July, those factors offset negative ones, including eroding consumer confidence and a stagnant job market.
In June, sales of new homes fell 2.6 percent and existing-home sales dropped 11.1 percent as worries about jobs, the stock market and the economy seemed to weigh on prospective buyers. Even with the declines, sales remained healthy.
Both new-home and existing-home sales are expected to set records this year. David Seiders, economist at the National Association of Home Builders, predicted that new-home sales would reach 936,000. David Lereah, economist for the National Association of Realtors, is projecting existing-home sales to reach 5.44 million.
By region, new-home sales in July increased 16 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 203,000, the highest level since December 1993. In the South, sales jumped 10.1 percent, to a rate of 470,000, the highest level since November.
In the Northeast, sales fell 9.1 percent, to a rate of 60,000, and in the West, they dipped 0.4 percent, to a rate of 284,000.
For existing homes, sales in July jumped 10.2 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 1.19 million. 
In the South, sales rose 6.4 percent, to a pace of 2.17 million, and in the Northeast, they went up 4.9 percent, to a rate of 640,000.
But in the West, sales slipped 2.9 percent, to a rate of 1.33 million.

HEADLINE: More Get 9/11 Aid, but Distrust of U.S. Effort Lingers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Since overhauling its programs in late June to assist New Yorkers devastated by the Sept. 11 attack, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted more money to nearly as many people needing help with their mortgage or rent as it did in the previous nine months.
 The agency has eased its eligibility criteria to include more New Yorkers, not just residents of Lower Manhattan. It has produced brochures in several languages, not just English. It has hired caseworkers who are from New York, not just far-flung states. 
 But for all the changes, FEMA is still plagued by many problems that community groups, Congressional leaders and residents worry may ultimately leave thousands of needy New Yorkers in the lurch. 
The critics say that the rules are still too arbitrary. That they focus too much on people who were previously rejected under much stricter criteria. That they are unfair to people outside Manhattan. And that they are onerous on low-income workers, who have trouble securing documents from landlords and employers.
But more than anything, there are concerns that thousands of people, already scarred by their dealings with FEMA, may not have the stomach to try again.
"Thousands of people have lost trust in the agency because of the prior rejections and false promises the first time around," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of Manhattan. "It's going to take more effort and stronger outreach from FEMA to convince those who are now so frustrated with the process that they haven't even considered applying for assistance under the new guidelines."
Helga Wong is leery of applying again. The first time around, it took Ms. Wong, who is the owner of Technorama, a technology company in TriBeCa, five or six weeks to send a complete fax to FEMA because the agency kept losing pages. When she didn't even get a response, she simply gave up in March and borrowed thousands of dollars from her brother.
Now, she is thinking of holding off on her mortgage payments so that she can receive formal notices from her bank to give FEMA incontrovertible proof of her hardship. But it is a big risk, she acknowledges.
"When you're emotionally battered," said Ms. Wong, "and you go to the people who are supposed to help you, and you get more emotionally battered by them, you have to say to yourself, 'Is this worth my sanity?' "
For their part, FEMA officials say that their programs are fairer, better and more inclusive than before. But they also acknowledge that the criticism has been humbling. "I wouldn't say that sometimes it's not painful, because all of us are in the business of helping people," said Brad Gair, FEMA's federal recovery officer in New York. "But whether it's demonstrations or letters from members of Congress or media reports, it makes all our programs better."
In the months after Sept. 11, people were particularly incensed about the agency's handling of one little-used program, the Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program, which covers up to 18 months of mortgage or rent payments for anyone who lost income "as a result" of a disaster. Until June, the application forms were printed only in English.
In theory, the program meshed well with the circumstances, since much of the damage to New York was economic, with 75,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in income lost. But for the Sept. 11 disaster, the agency, apparently fearing being overwhelmed by applications, changed its usual phrase "as a result" to "as a direct result," thereby raising the burden of proof.
The real result was a 70 percent rejection rate for applicants, which far outstripped the rate in other major relief efforts.
It did not help that FEMA evaluators -- two-thirds of whom were temporary workers -- were located in Texas, Virginia and elsewhere and sometimes misunderstood New York's geography and culture. One agency evaluator did not know that 1 Liberty Plaza was in Lower Manhattan, let alone adjacent to the World Trade Center. Another insisted that garment workers had been laid off because they were seasonal employees. Indeed, some New Yorkers have described the evaluators as condescending, rude and ill informed.
"If I heard someone from Texas, I would just keep dialing until I got the Virginia people," Ms. Wong said. "At least they said, 'Hi, can I help you?' "
After months of withering criticism, FEMA revamped the mortgage and rent program in June. Out went the question of what constituted "as a direct result"; in came a slew of guidelines driven largely by geography and income. The application deadline was extended, too, from September to January 2003.
Under the new guidelines, anyone who lives or works in Manhattan and suffered financially because of the attack may be eligible for assistance. Others in surrounding boroughs who worked for businesses that were economically reliant on Lower Manhattan may also be eligible. Prospective applicants can call the agency's special line, (800) 462-9029.
Some New Yorkers, previously rejected by FEMA, are now contacting groups like the New York Taxi Workers Alliance and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. So every day, Chaumtoli Huq, staff lawyer for the taxi group, opens her offices to a steady stream of taxi drivers grateful for another chance.
FEMA has tried to reach more immigrants through brochures in six languages and an advertising campaign in the ethnic press. It has worked more closely with community groups. It has formed a 15-member task force here, composed mostly of local caseworkers, to handle the toughest claims.
It has even arranged what Mr. Gair said was a "foreign exchange" between FEMA employees in Texas and New York to visit one another.
All told, 3,053 households have received $25.3 million since late June, compared with 3,585 households receiving $20.6 million from September to June. So far, the average monthly payment has been $1,140, and many of FEMA's toughest critics say that there has been a bureaucratic about-face.
"Before the changes, their attitude was more along the lines of, 'This is how we've done it before, and we're not going to change it,' " said Robert J. Hurst, chief executive of the 9/11 United Services Group, a nonprofit consortium of 13 charities. "Now, it feels like there's a much more flexible, much more thoughtful approach."
John Tolve, the principal of ResourceReservoir.com, a database development company, has his own tale of two FEMA's. At first, he was forced out of his apartment near Wall Street. He exhausted his credit line and was constantly late with his rent. And, to no one's surprise, rejected by FEMA.
But shortly after he called Assemblyman Sheldon Silver and a downtown business group, From the Ground Up, he got results. In fact, he discovered a few thousand dollars directly deposited to his bank account even before he received an approval letter.
"FEMA bailed me out because of my rent, and I'm going to be O.K. for the next couple months," Mr. Tolve said. "I really have to thank Shelly Silver for that."
And yet, therein lies part of the problem. Mr. Tolve and other residents felt so stymied that they needed to contact elected officials like Mr. Silver, Ms. Maloney and Representative Jerrold L. Nadler. That is not how the program was supposed to work. (Even some residents in the Washington area, frustrated that FEMA has distributed only $38,000 in mortgage and rental assistance, have contacted New York officials, too.)
So, two weeks ago, eight members of the New York Congressional delegation wrote to FEMA's director, Joseph M. Allbaugh, demanding that the agency loosen its financial requirements and reach out to more potential applicants. And on July 31, hundreds of New Yorkers and community groups marched on Washington to demand better treatment for low-income workers.
Of the 79,000 people in New York who contacted FEMA for help before the rule changes, 33,000 were deemed potentially eligible for the mortgage and rental assistance program under the old criteria. But of that group, only 11,000 finished their applications.
Of course, some people have managed to rebound economically. But a recent study by the 9/11 United Services Group found that more than 45,000 workers in Lower Manhattan continued to suffer an income loss of 25 percent or more, including 28,000 who were still unemployed. And those figures do not include the other boroughs or the suburbs.
As the rules are currently configured, someone who lives in Harlem and lost a job at La Guardia would qualify, but someone who lives in Astoria and lost the same job would not. Moreover, people who had to move out of their apartments -- perhaps because they were rejected by FEMA, perhaps because they were worried about the air quality in Lower Manhattan -- are now being told that they may not qualify, said Benjamin Ross, disaster relief coordinator of the New York Immigration Coalition.
"They've put me in a pickle," said Ariel Goodman, a business owner who relocated to Midtown after being forced out of her apartment in Battery Park City. "I think they're penny-wise and pound-foolish."
In response, Mr. Gair said that FEMA was trying to help as many people as possible, and that each case would be evaluated on its merits. "We're trying to be as creative as possible," he said. "We want to make sure no one prejudges their eligibility based on something they heard or read."
Many community groups also say that FEMA's lost-income threshold of 25 percent is too high, particularly for low-income workers. It is often difficult for low-income workers to provide supporting documents, especially when their employers and landlords deal only in cash and may be unwilling to furnish any official papers, said Wing Lam, executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers Association.
As such, FEMA's reputation is so besmirched in many parts of New York that even when someone receives help, few people believe it.
When Mohammed M. Quadery, a taxi driver from Queens, received a brown envelope from FEMA last month, he assumed that it was a brochure, maybe an advertisement. It was a check for $1,662.82, two months' rent.
Bewildered, he called the New York Taxi Workers Alliance.
"I was wondering, 'Is this real? Is this a check I can cash?' " said Mr. Quadery, who lost up to 75 percent of his business after Sept. 11 and borrowed thousands of dollars from relatives to avoid eviction. "I didn't think that FEMA sent out checks. I thought they only sent rejection letters."

HEADLINE: To Rebuild Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A country that has suffered as long and as cruelly as Afghanistan needs sustained international help to restore the rudiments of normal life. Two decades of economic and political breakdown helped make Afghanistan an outlaw base for global terrorism. Unless the promises of long-term reconstruction assistance that followed last year's military defeat of the Taliban are kept, anarchy could return. 
 Last January donor nations promised $4.5 billion in economic aid over the next five years. Most of what has been delivered so far, however, has gone to immediate humanitarian needs. Far too little has yet been committed to reconstruction projects that will revive the war-shattered economy and allow hundreds of thousands of returning refugees to become self-sufficient. 
 Unlike many European countries, America has fully delivered the aid it promised. Washington should begin shifting its assistance from emergency relief to reconstruction. Regrettably, more than $150 million in badly needed funds for Afghanistan is now being delayed as part of the $5.1 billion spending package President Bush is holding up in his budget tussle with Congress.
In the first few months after the ouster of the Taliban, emergency aid saved many lives. Sixteen million of Afghanistan's 27 million people have benefited from some kind of international help since last October, mostly in the form of food shipments or money for refugee care and resettlement. In addition hundreds of schools, hospitals and clinics have been rebuilt and more than three million children have been returned to school. The shaky central government led by President Hamid Karzai would be weaker still without the foreign aid that provides 80 percent of its budget and pays civil servants' salaries.
What is needed now is aid directed at reviving agriculture and trade. Before the Soviet invasion in 1979, Afghanistan had a functioning economy. The war destroyed many of the irrigation canals that made agriculture possible in the parched countryside and forced farmers off their land and into refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. Reclaiming that abandoned agricultural land would make Afghanistan less dependent on food relief shipments and would allow hundreds of thousands of returning refugees to resettle in the rural areas they left. Without such reclamation, many will drift back to cities where no work awaits them, while others will hire themselves out to warlords, a traditional outlet for young unemployed Afghan men. 
War also tore up the roads farmers need to transport goods to urban areas. With its road system rebuilt, Afghanistan could again reap commercial benefits from its location astride the crossroads of Central Asia. More money also needs to be channeled directly to the Kabul-based central government so that it can extend its authority throughout the country and control local warlords. 
With the security situation still fragile in much of rural Afghanistan, foreign donors have hesitated to involve themselves in road-building and land reclamation projects. But rebuilding roads and providing rural jobs will go far toward making the countryside more secure. 
Foreign donors were far too quick to abandon Afghanistan after Soviet troops left the country in 1989. This time they need to stay engaged until governmental authority is fully re-established and the economy begins to function again.

HEADLINE: Chinese Will Move Waters To Quench Thirst of Cities 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: DANJIANGKOU, China 

 BODY:
The booming cities of northern China are parched and constrained by a growing shortage of water. Yet in China's rainy south, the mighty Yangtze River pours vast volumes, unused, into the sea.
 So why not, Chinese leaders have long asked, cross the country with new canals, bringing that "wasted" water to where it is vitally needed for the country's progress? 
 In a world short of fresh water, one of the gravest challenges facing governments is that needs and supplies are often far apart. Now China, with water scarcity reaching the critical stage in sprawling showcase cities like Beijing and Tianjin, has embarked on one of history's great water-moving projects. 
At huge cost and great risk to the environment, the government plans to rechannel vast rivers of water from the Yangtze basin to the thirsty north, over three pathways of nearly 1,000 miles each. The official price tag of $58 billion, nearly half to be spent in the next eight years, is more than twice that of the Three Gorges Dam, China's most recent mega-project now nearing completion. 
Some officials speak of delivering new waters to a "green Beijing" in time for the 2008 Olympics, an indication of the political overtones of the project as well as the crash timetable. 
"We have to sacrifice so that people in Beijing can drink water," said Zhang Jize, a 32-year-old farmer and father of two daughters who is among 370,000 people the plan will uproot.
Such immense, centrally planned projects have been tried before, notably in Central Asia, where a Soviet-era plan has steadily drained the Aral Sea, turning what was one of the world's largest inland bodies of water into a salty desert and providing a vivid illustration of the dangers of bending nature to economic needs. 
But China, convinced of its future as a great power, believes the project is essential. Some have drawn parallels to the great water works of the United States, like the the Tennessee Valley Authority that spurred rural development beginning in the 1930's or, more appropriately, the canals that took northern waters to fuel fantastic growth in arid Southern California. But the Chinese project is on an even grander scale. 
Like China's construction of the Three Gorges Dam, which set off global debate, this latest venture raises a host of tough questions, including how to deliver clean water across one of the world's most polluted landscapes. 
Perhaps toughest of all, in a country where no good patch of land lies idle, is how to provide for those like Mr. Zhang and his family who will be moved.
For Mr. Zhang and many others who live around the Danjiangkou Reservoir -- a linchpin of the new project -- it is not the first time they are being displaced, and their travails parallel China's expanding ambition to meet its water needs. 
Some 30 years back, when Mr. Zhang was a toddler and the dam was first completed, he and his parents were sent from their fertile valley plot to a remote spot on the banks of the new lake, receiving little compensation for their troubles. 
"Life is too hard here," he recently told a visitor, gathering with his family in their house with walls of wood and packed earth, covered with old calendars and newspapers. 
As the government makes its plans for a new mass move, bitterness survives from those earlier rounds of resettlements. Party leaders know that the issue could be explosive if not handled with more care than during past projects, including the Three Gorges Dam project, which will eventually displace more than a million people.
Chinese officials have often glossed over the challenges in public, and most planning has taken place entirely behind closed doors. But they and their scientists are working feverishly on a host of issues as construction of two routes is expected to begin in the coming year. 
Northern cities have begun to raise water prices for consumers and reduce waste, vital steps if the project is to provide lasting solutions. Provinces, meanwhile, are already fighting over how the water will be shared, because some of the delivered waters will require expensive cleansing.
"If we're given smelly water and Beijing receives all the clean water, it will be bad for our image and our living standards," said a city engineer in Tianjin, a teeming city of 10 million that desperately needs new water but fears the expense.
The demand has become urgent throughout the densely populated north-central plains, home to metropolises like Tianjin and Beijing, with a population of 13 million, as well as dozens of smaller cities that are bursting with people and construction. 
Over-pumping of groundwater in the region has forced people to probe deeper for wells every year, and in some areas has caused disastrous sinking of land. Urban consumers take scarce water from farmers, while planners warn of smothering new restrictions on industry. 
Much of China's arid northwest, at the same time, is turning into a dust bowl, its land destroyed by drought and overuse and its residents caught in desperate poverty.

3 Routes and Numerous Detours
Each of the three routes envisioned to bring water to these thirsty areas has its own challenges. 
Of these, the western route is most tentative, with construction scheduled to start in 2010. It would channel water from upper tributaries of the Yangtze to China's arid, needy northwest. But as it takes water from Tibetan regions it may stir political controversy, and it poses severe engineering challenges and awesome costs. The current estimates are $36 billion for this spur alone. 
The eastern, coastal route is technically simple, though it will require 13 pumping stations, which will consume large amounts of electricity to lift water from near the mouth of the Yangtze to the higher north. It will save costs by following much of the same path as the ancient Grand Canal -- second only to the Great Wall as a wonder of Imperial China -- that once moved silk and rice from the south to Beijing. 
The main challenge is pollution. The route cuts across many of the world's most soiled river basins. Along the hundreds of miles of the canal that is still in use, it bustles with barges carrying sand, coal and other goods. Its shores are lined with primitive houseboats, home to hundreds of thousands of people who rely on the canal for work and waste disposal as well as living space. The waterway also receives untreated sewage from hundreds of nearby towns and villages and the effluence of thousands of factories.
"If you drink the water you get rashes and diarrhea," said Cui Xiao, 38, who had docked his sand barge at Pizhou, within sight of the waste of a chemical fertilizer factory that gushed into the stream. "You can't even use the canal water for washing."
Some scientists are quietly asking how the coastal route can ever affordably deliver water that will be safe enough even for industry, let alone drinking. 
The cleanup plans, to the extent they have been disclosed, stretch credibility. They include the forced closure of thousands of dirty factories that line the canal's route, many of which are owned by local governments that have evaded controls in the past. 
The government is also mobilizing to build sewage treatment plants in each of 119 counties along the canal, a leading water expert said, itself a mammoth undertaking in the hurried time frame. 
The people who live on the canal all expressed hope that the water project would give them an economic lift. But the government has not said what is to become of this decrepit flotilla and the multitudes who live on or near the canal.
Along the final, central route, officials say that pollution will not be a problem. But there are other challenges.
This plan calls for diverting water north from the Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze, by constructing a new canal. But to do so the Danjiangkou dam and reservoir will have to be raised, displacing about 300,000 villagers in Hubei and Henan Provinces, like Mr. Zhang, the farmer.
Even then, many engineers say, the reservoir will not hold enough water both to feed the north and to meet regional needs. Its waters will have to be replenished by a new feeder canal, built across mountains at enormous expense, to bring water from the new Three Gorges Dam -- in turn reducing its electrical capacity by 6 percent or more.

Waiting for Another Moving Day
Earlier this year, sign painters traveled along the banks of the Danjiangkou Reservoir and splashed a new slogan in big blue characters on village walls urging people to support "the project," alongside the usual appeals to limit births, trust in the Communist Party and pay taxes. 
Long aware of the water-transfer plans, hundreds of thousands of people near the reservoir have waited a decade or more in limbo, putting off home repairs or construction and sometimes postponing marriages. 
Now, with that day apparently approaching, many are fearful. 
Local television has carried announcements that people should prepare for orders to vacate homes, and county officials have taken a census of households and assessed property. But villagers still have heard nothing about the terms of the relocation.
There are not many options. The hilly region around the lake is badly overcrowded, and entire families live off less than an acre each. The new moves may cause destruction of forests and grasslands and will require costly efforts to bring safe drinking water, electricity and roads to those moved. 
In the 1970's, 270,000 people in rich valley lands had to make way for the reservoir as it was filled. Their compensation was paltry, if they received any at all. 
Many are still fuming. Rao Fumin, a 58-year-old man whose family was moved first in 1958 and then three more times, can hardly contain his fury. "We were moved around like prisoners," he said. 
His legs now crippled by arthritis, Mr. Rao lives with his sister near the foot of the Danjiangkou Dam itself, subsisting on a monthly $12 welfare payment. 
"We never see a cent of the resettlement money," he said. "All these city, county, town and village officials stuff the money into their own pockets." 
If he doesn't get more aid this year, he said, "I'll hang myself at the gateway of the Danjiangkou City Party Committee." 
The comments suggest the potential for fresh anger facing a government that in any case sees little choice but to push ahead with the plan. Even many of those who will be most affected, like Mr. Zhang, are resigned. 
"We don't know when or where we'll move, but we just hope we get some decent farmland," Mr. Zhang said, exchanging a nervous glance with his wife. "We're all just waiting to hear what will happen to us.
"This is central government policy," he added stoically, "so it must be a good thing for the country."

HEADLINE: Jackson Hole Outgrows Its Tiny, Busy Airport 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
In the alpine splendor of the Teton range, where crickets flitter across the trails and fish splash around the Snake River, another, less natural, sound is never far away -- the mechanical buzz of airplanes ferrying people in and out of this enclave for the rich and famous.
 The Jackson Hole Airport is the only airport in the country entirely within a national park. It is high season here now, and that means that aircraft, from private seven-seaters to commercial 757's, are touching down at a regular clip. 
 Perhaps more than is the case in most cities, in Jackson, the airport is central to economic vitality. The town's spurt in growth parallels the introduction of jet service here in the early 1980's. Yet the airport, a low-slung affair with peaked roof lines evoking the jagged-edge mountains that stagger up behind it, remains one of the nation's tiniest. Experts say the runway, at 6,305 feet, is among the shortest in use at commercial airports. 
But because it is located within the Grand Teton National Park, the National Park Service has restricted the runway's extension. So while Jackson Hole, the valley that includes Jackson and covers much of the county, is growing and developing largely because of its airport, the airport cannot grow along with it.
That has caused tensions between the many residents whose livelihoods depend on tourists -- including some business owners who would welcome expansion -- and those who worry that the rapid growth could ruin the very appeal that draws people here in the first place. Already, the surge in affluence that the airport has made possible dramatizes the rift between the growing rich, many of whom own second homes here, and the local work force, who cannot afford to live here.
All this has not stopped the traffic. Private planes swarm the tarmac in a constant procession. Because Vice President Dick Cheney is vacationing at his home here for the month of August, Air Force Two is frequently in and out, backing up planes because the airspace must be secured.
Even more activity is promised by mid-December, as local businesses here start to subsidize several major airlines to the tune of $1.3 million to guarantee nonstop service from some of the country's biggest airports, including those that serve New York, Chicago and Atlanta. There is only limited nonstop service now. 
After hearing a presentation from George Larson, Jackson's airport manager, about new security measures that will require passengers to arrive two hours before their flights, Jerry DeFrance, president of the board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce, was not terribly upset.
"Our problems are born of success, and those are a lot better than problems born of failure," he said. "A lot of communities would like to have our problems."
But there is rising concern here that unless these problems are managed, that success could turn sour.
"It raises questions when the community is pitching in $1.3 million to bring more people," said Carl Schneebech, a specialist in public land for the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance. "At some point, are we killing the goose that is laying the golden egg?"
The boom here began in the mid-1980's, when jet service began. Since then, the population has doubled, to 18,000 in 2000, up from 9,000 in 1980.
The Chamber of Commerce has even produced a graph that shows a happy correlation between the per capita income of residents and the level of jet service. Per capita income was relatively steady in Jackson Hole until 1984. As more planes began arriving, it soared, from less than $20,000 in 1984 to more than $67,000 today -- more than triple the national average. Now, Teton County, which includes Jackson Hole, is the nation's richest, ahead of even Fairfield County, Conn., at $50,000.
Yet Jackson Hole's airfield, which began as an unpaved strip in 1930, remains modest. When Congress designated the surrounding Grand Tetons a national park in 1950, constraints were placed on the airfield, which was not paved until 1959. Pilots periodically overshoot the runway, as one did a few years ago in the middle of the night in a plane flying the actress Sandra Bullock.
While there has been talk over the years of extending the runway, a 50-year agreement struck in 1983 between the airport and the park restricts such expansions. In addition, many residents object to a longer runway, saying it would invite bigger jets, which would create more noise.
Could the airport move out of the park, to where its runway could be longer? That is not likely. Land values here are exorbitant. A full 97 percent of the land is in government hands, and the remaining 3 percent is tightly held.
To move the airport but keep it in Teton County would mean moving it farther south, away from the national park, but the valley becomes narrower and more populated, making air traffic more dangerous. This has led some to suggest moving it over the mountains to Idaho, but Jackson Hole is not about to let that happen. 
The real problem, to many here, is the abundance of private air service. Because of poor air service in the past, even the less-than-rich buy into time-shares on private jets. As recently as 1999, about 5,250 private planes landed here per year. By 2001, that number had climbed to 13,100.
Town leaders, unhappy about the noise, are irked at the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to regulate the private planes. There are no curfews on them, as there are on commercial jets, and no limit on their number or flight paths. 
The federal agency maintains that banning private aircraft would be discriminatory. 
Tony Jewett, director of the Northern Rockies regional office of the National Parks and Conservation Association, said owners of private airplanes represented a powerful lobby.
"The fact that Jackson is in this explosive growth stage and a huge number of people moving to Jackson are people of means and have fairly snapshot lifestyles where they have to get in and out of places quickly," Mr. Jewett said, "means there is a lot of economic pressure to accommodate them." 
He added, "But this means that anyone visiting the park has constant visual intrusions, with flight patterns right across the park, and noise intrusions, which interrupt one of the great park values, which is the natural sound-scape."
But even park officials recognize the value of the airport to the local economy as well as the necessity for safety. As a result, they have not objected to night lights and a small tower, which controls air traffic. 
Jonathan Schechter, executive director of the Charture Institute, which studies issues of growth and change in places of ecological significance, said there was no direct cause and effect between airplane business and income even though he created the graph comparing the two. But he said that better air service not only brought in more tourists but, combined with Wyoming's lack of an income tax, made Jackson Hole more attractive to people with the means to live anywhere.
Mr. Schechter said that their wealth has in turn made Jackson Hole less reliant on tourism. Over the last 10 years, white-collar jobs -- in finance, real estate, medicine and law -- have generated more income here than tourism. Financial services and investments account for more of residents' income than tourism and white-collar jobs combined.
But Bill Collins, director of planning and development for Teton County, said that two-thirds of the labor force made less than $30,000 a year, and most of these workers could not afford to live here. The median price of a single-family home is $560,000, twice the national average. "An economic polarization is occurring here," Mr. Collins said.
Still, many businesses here are built on tourism, and business owners say it is essential to attract more tourists, particularly as the ski industry consolidates and shrinks.
Jerry Blann, president of the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, has been one of the main business organizers of the new contracts with the airlines, an arrangement found in other wealthy resorts, like Aspen and Vail. He is putting up $200,000 of the total $1.3 million to guarantee cash to Delta, United, Northwest and Continental to fly here nonstop. American is also servicing Jackson Hole but is doing so without a contract.
Mike Gierau, owner of Jedediah's restaurant, is putting up $1,800.
"There are 35 Realtors within a fork's throw of where we are now," Mr. Gierau said enthusiastically. "They're selling property to people who are buying plane tickets. And one reasons it's easier for them to sell property is because people can come here, especially if you have service from places like New York. Second-home-owners are going ga-ga over this."
Still, he has to compete for their business with his fellow restaurateurs. Because of that, he said, he is still hedging his bets.
"I give the pilots free breakfast," he said, laughing. "And many a time I've flown in and on final approach they'll say, 'Boy, if you get a chance, eat at Jedediah's. It's an awful nice place.' "

HEADLINE: 16 Banks Pledge Continued Commitment to Brazil 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Brazil's top economic officials persuaded 16 international banks yesterday to maintain their lending at current levels, a move that relieved some but hardly all the anxiety in that country's financial markets.
 The banks, including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase of the United States as well as Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander Central Hispano of Europe, pledged to keep up their lending after meeting in Manhattan with Brazil's finance minister and the president of the Brazil's central bank. 
 What the banks left unsaid is that most had already cut back sharply on their lending as Brazil began edging closer to a financial meltdown. 
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund negotiated a $30 billion bailout with the Brazilian government. But that package is aimed only at avoiding a default by the government, and it did not solve the credit problems of Brazilian manufacturers and exporters.
Brazilian companies have $8 billion to $10 billion in debt coming due by the end of the year, and analysts estimate that only about 40 percent of the medium- and long-term loans have been rolled over or refinanced in recent months.
The situation affecting exporters, who play a pivotal role in shoring up Brazil's financial position, may be even tighter. Alexandre Schwartsman, an economist at BBA, a Brazilian bank in Sao Paulo, said anecdotal evidence suggested that only 30 percent of Brazilian export credits were being renewed earlier this summer.
In a statement after yesterday's meeting, the banks stressed their "continued support" for Brazil and vowed to "sustain their general level of business.
"The tone of the meeting was very positive," said William Rhodes, senior vice chairman of Citigroup, in an interview.
Amilio Fraga, president of Brazil's central bank, said the meeting was "better than we had expected."
Investors appeared encouraged, but not jubilant. Brazil's beleaguered currency, the real, climbed slightly when the news first came out but ended the day almost unchanged. The value of Brazilian bonds climbed slightly.
Mr. Schwartsman of BBA said the banks' cautious support might have been the most that was realistic to expect.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS; 
New York Waits For Decision By the U.S.O.C.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
New York City's expensive campaign to become the host city for the 2012 Summer Olympics could advance today, or end quickly, when a United States Olympic Committee panel in Chicago chooses two finalists from a field of four to be the country's candidate.
 The process will conclude Nov. 3, and the International Olympic Committee will select the host city in 2005. 
 For New York, which has budgeted the most of any city, $13 million, to earn the U.S.O.C.'s favor, the desire to play host to the Olympics has taken on the force of official government policy: Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, founded NYC2012 in 1995 and is still its principal booster.
Jay Kriegel, the executive director of NYC2012, said little time was being spent worrying about losing to Houston, San Francisco or Washington, the other cities being considered in the United States. 
"We're very focused," he said. "We're doing what we can -- planning, talking to our team. We're taking nothing for granted.
"We feel terrific about our bid."
The plan features the use of athletic facilities that could be reached by ferries or by the railroad.
Dan Knise, the president of Washington DC 2012, said: "I think everybody's a little nervous. It's a big decision for our city and our region."
The four cities have submitted elaborate plans and have been visited twice by members of the U.S.O.C. task force. They then submitted revised plans or addenda. Washington and San Francisco each scaled back the geographic scope of their bids.
The 13 members of the task force have scored the cities on 14 criteria -- from the financial plans to transportation to arenas and the Olympic village -- but until today at 8 a.m. Central time, the group has never compared one city with the other. Only 10 members will vote. 
"We've done detailed numerical scores on each city, but right now, everyone is at par," Charles H. Moore, the chairman of the task force, said. He will lead the group through an analysis of the cities' scores, the cities' strengths and weaknesses and their international appeals.
"I spent time talking to the United States delegates to the I.O.C., and asked them what would you look for in a city, what would influence your vote?" Moore said.
Ultimately, Moore said, the U.S.O.C.'s choice will come down to which city is the most likely to win against foreign competitors, which include Moscow, Paris, Toronto, Rio de Janeiro, London, Milan and Tel Aviv. "The most important thing is the international appeal and strategy," Moore said.
Moore insisted that the task force could not make its decision until its scheduled seven-hour meeting today, and that any reports that it had already picked the two finalists were premature. 
Last week, the U.S.O.C. debunked a Washington Post report that claimed Washington and San Francisco were chosen.
New York, Washington and San Francisco are considered world cities with myriad tourist attractions and grand stories to tell. (Whether the terror attacks of Sept. 11 will create sympathy for New York and Washington is uncertain.) Despite Houston's size, it is viewed by Olympic observers as having a less compelling tale.
"The people deciding where to take the Olympics is the I.O.C., not the general public," said George DeMontrond III, the chairman of Houston 2012. "They're looking at what's best for the Olympic movement, like having a budget that would be profitable and having the most venues built."
Moore said: "If any member of the task force spoke out of turn, it's only one person's opinion and it wouldn't be the end of the world." But he added that it would not be definitive.
In their bids, the cities compete over financial surpluses and the housing and athletic facilities they would leave behind to the public. Or they boast of riverfront Olympic villages (like New York's, in Queens, opposite the United Nations) or those that need not be built, like the dormitories Washington DC 2012 would use at the University of Maryland. And of new stadiums, like Reliant Stadium and Minute Maid Field in Houston.
Houston's bid contemplates a $90 million overhaul of the Astrodome into an Olympic track and field stadium "that would be a one-of-a-kind facility that can be used to compete in all types of weather," DeMontrond said. 
For detractors who view Houston as another version of hot, humid Atlanta, which was the host to the 1996 Summer Games, he vowed that air conditioning would be plentiful.
"And our weather this summer has been no worse than New York's," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Price Tag and Local Politics Damp Interest in Hershey

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Paging Willie Wonka. Interest in the auction for Hershey Foods may be waning.
 Some potential suitors for Hershey, which put itself up for sale last month despite a storm of protest from local officials and employees, appear to be balking at the company's high asking price and the controversy surrounding the auction. 
 Cadbury Schweppes has already told Hershey that it will probably not submit an offer, according to executives close to the discussions. Nestle and Kraft Foods, the two most interested remaining bidders, are wavering about whether they can afford to meet Hershey's asking price -- more than $11 billion -- without significantly diluting their earnings, the executives said. 
Some board members of the trust that controls Hershey are reconsidering the auction, too. Without a lucrative sale price, some board members have begun privately discussing possibly ending the auction and buying back stock instead. Indeed, according to one board member, the political controversy could offer an excuse for the trust to halt the auction without having to acknowledge publicly that it could not draw the asking price. 
Besides opposition from officials and employees, Hershey's sale is also being complicated by a rival auction that has not yet begun.
Pfizer plans to put its Adams confectionary unit, which makes Trident, Dentyne, Certs and Halls, up for sale this fall, hoping to receive bids from many of the potential buyers of Hershey.
Adams could bring $4 billion or more, so some suitors are considering whether to bid for Hershey now or wait to try to buy Adams. "We only have so much gun power," said an executive close to one company contemplating the options. "We've got to decide which is the right shot."
Pfizer had hoped to begin its auction this summer but decided to wait until after Hershey completed its sale. Indeed, Pfizer's Adams unit briefly considered bidding for pieces of Hershey but decided the price was too high and that such a deal would complicate selling itself later, executives close to Pfizer said.
Analysts said Cadbury might be holding back on a bid for Hershey so it could pursue Adams.
Meanwhile, Nestle and Kraft Foods, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, continue to negotiate with Hershey, according to the executives, though both have lowered their valuations after reviewing Hershey's books in the last several weeks.
Executives close to Nestle and Kraft said the economics of a deal for Hershey worked only if it was valued at $10 billion or less. USA Today reported yesterday that Nestle had made an $11.5 billion offer for Hershey, but a spokesman for Nestle called the report a "market fantasy." Shares of Hershey surged $1.77 on the report, to $76.80.
To be sure, the potential suitors for Hershey and Adams may just be posturing, hoping to reach a deal with a lower price. But one member of Hershey's controlling trust recently questioned whether a sale would happen at all.
"The board is not committed to sell," William H. Alexander, a board member, wrote in a letter to a friend that became public last week. "It is only one of several options being explored," he wrote, adding, "Once and for all we are going to find out if anyone exists who will pay a sufficient premium to justify a sale."
In the letter, Mr. Alexander said, "My best guess is that the supposed premium for control will be offset by discounts for the Kit Kat license and the social constraints." Under the licensing agreement that Hershey has with Nestle to sell its Kit Kat and Rolo brands in North America, those rights could revert to Nestle even if Hershey is sold to another company, cutting into Hershey's asking price.
The social constraints mentioned by Mr. Alexander refer to the political jockeying in Hershey, Pa., to prevent a deal. On Friday, Mike Fisher, the Republican attorney general now running for governor, filed a motion in Dauphin County with the Orphans' Court, which has jurisdiction over the state's charitable trusts, to issue a temporary restraining order to block the sale of Hershey.
"We think it's time the court put a halt to this sale," Mr. Fisher said in a written statement. "We are concerned about the speed in which the Hershey Trust seems to be moving forward with their plans."
Lawyers for the trust responded in court yesterday, questioning the attorney general's jurisdiction in the matter. While acknowledging that the state has jurisdiction over charitable trusts, the lawyers contend that it has much more limited oversight of Hershey Foods, which is incorporated in Delaware.
The lawyers said a temporary injunction against a sale could cause "gross and severe harm and injury" to the auction process, leading to a drop in the company's share price and harm to the trust's beneficiary, the Milton Hershey School.
The judge in the case scheduled arguments for Sept. 3 on Mr. Fisher's motion.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg News Apologizes To Top Singapore Officials 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
As an entrepreneur-turned-politician, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has taken pains to avoid being accused of conflicts of interest in the way he runs New York City. Now, the company that made him a billionaire is in trouble for accusing this city-state's politicians of conflicts of interest in the way they run business.
 Over the weekend, the news and financial information company Bloomberg L.P. issued a public apology and agreed to pay damages and legal costs to three top Singapore leaders for publishing what it admitted were defamatory statements about the appointment of the daughter-in-law of the former prime minister as head of a powerful government investment arm, Temasek Holdings. The offending remarks appeared in a column Bloomberg published earlier this month on its subscription-based information service and on its Web site. The column, by Patrick Smith, was about the role of Singapore's government in the country's biggest companies. 
 In Singapore, which adheres to the British common-law interpretation of libel in which a defendant journalist or publication has the burden of proving the truth of what has been reported, ruling politicians here have never been shy about suing for libel. But the latest case comes at an awkward time. Faced with declining competitiveness as a manufacturing center compared with countries like China, Singapore is trying to overturn its reputation as an intolerant, state-run economy where most fresh ideas come from the top.
Instead, Singapore aspires to become a center for innovation, arts and the media -- but not, apparently, if it comes at the expense of its reputation for clean government. "They're still thin-skinned on this," said David L. Cohen, director of macroeconomic analysis at Standard & Poor's MMS International.
Set up in the mid-1970's to manage the government's corporate investments, Temasek (pronounce teh-MAH-sek) wields enormous influence in Singapore's economy. The companies in its stable represent at least one-fifth of Singapore's market capitalization and it has controlling stakes in Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecommunications.
In May, Temasek announced that a board member, Ho Ching, would become its executive director. Ms. Ho is married to Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, son of the founding prime minister and now senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew. In its apology, Bloomberg said its article had implied that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had put the Lee family's interests above the country's in allowing Ms. Ho's appointment, and that her husband and father-in-law were guilty of nepotism. Lawyers for the three men accused Bloomberg and Mr. Smith of acting maliciously. The article has been removed from Bloomberg's Web site and subscription service. A complete copy could not be obtained.
"We admit and acknowledge that these allegations are false and completely without foundation," Bloomberg wrote in its apology to Mr. Goh and the two Lees, which was issued on the company's subscription service and its Web site. Bloomberg acknowledged that the article, as written, could be understood to mean that Ms. Ho's appointment was made "not on merit, but in order to indulge the interests of the Lee family, or for some other corrupt motive."
The company has until Wednesday to propose a settlement acceptable to the three men or risk having the case brought before a Singapore court.
Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg in New York, would not comment on the company's decision to publish the apology or agree to a settlement. She said Mayor Bloomberg would not be personally involved in coming up with a settlement figure. The mayor stepped down last year from his management role. With his own finances still under examination by New York's Conflicts of Interest Board, Mr. Bloomberg has recused his company from tax breaks intended to keep corporations from leaving Manhattan in the wake of Sept. 11. 
The editor of Bloomberg's news service, Matthew Winkler, is scheduled to visit Singapore Tuesday as part of a trip around Asia. Bloomberg has more than 30 journalists stationed in Singapore, where it has had an office since 1990.
Ms. Ho's appointment is controversial in Singapore, but not necessarily because of her relatives. When she was appointed, officials said her family connections played no part. An electrical engineer with a master's degree from Stanford University, Ms. Ho worked her way up through the ranks of Singapore's state-owned military conglomerate and was a board member there for 10 years before joining Temasek.
Instead, executives, economists and fund managers have expressed concern about Ms. Ho's announced intention to exert a greater role in Temasek's companies. While Ms. Ho has stressed the need to extract greater shareholder value, many executives had hoped Temasek would slowly withdraw, eventually privatizing its stakes.
Singapore's boardrooms, meanwhile, are full of former government figures, some of them relatives or associates of the Lee family. The government is seeking highly educated professionals from abroad. In the meantime, officials explain, Singapore's population of four million people leaves it with a limited pool of talent from which to draw.

HEADLINE: At the U.S. Open, a Mayoral Return 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Nixon went to China. Gorbachev visited the Statue of Liberty. And last night, Bloomberg took in a little tennis at the United States Open.
 The idea that a mayor would attend a major international sports event in his own backyard would not normally qualify as big news, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's trip to the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, reflected a policy change of sorts: his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, refused to attend the tournaments for eight years. 
 "It is my pleasure to welcome everyone to New York City, home of the highest attended annual sporting event: the U.S. Open," Mayor Bloomberg said at the opening ceremony. "This is always a terrific time in New York City, with the last grand slam of the tennis season kicking off right here in Flushing, Queens."
The Open, in fact, has been something of a political football, or tennis ball, around City Hall for nearly a decade. It all began when former Mayor David N. Dinkins, concerned about the threat of businesses and institutions leaving New York City, negotiated a deal to build a new stadium for the Open.
Many city officials and fiscal experts found that the tennis stadium agreement, which was financed without city money, was better for the city than the stadium deals it struck in the past with the Yankees and the Mets. Mr. Giuliani objected strenuously to one clause in the contract, though -- the provision holding the city liable for fines if airplanes should fly over the tennis center during matches and distract the players.
The city has never had to pay any such fines, but Mr. Giuliani, who was always more a Yankees fan than a tennis fan and was never a big fan of Mr. Dinkins, said the city should not be held liable and warned that the deal placed unnecessary demands on the already crowded airspace around the city's airports. So he stayed away.
Then Mr. Bloomberg succeeded Mr. Giuliani this year and found that the ball was in his court. Mr. Bloomberg appeared on Mr. Dinkins's radio show in March and proclaimed the tennis complex in Queens "the only good athletic sports stadium deal, not just in New York, but in the country," and declared that he would attend the Open if asked. 
Mr. Dinkins, an avid tennis fan, said yesterday that he was delighted by the change in mayoral tennis policy. "I'm ecstatic," he said.
The new mayor's sports allegiances are not exactly clear. 
He likes to play golf, and he even took part in a charity tournament the day the city missed its first budget deadline this June. From time to time he watches one of his daughters in an equestrian competition. During the election he survived a whispering campaign that he might be -- gasp -- a Red Sox fan, and now that the city is wooing the 2012 Olympics, he has become an avid sports booster, even donning a skin-tight yellow zip-up biker shirt to kick off a bike race in Lower Manhattan earlier this month. 
"He may not be a big tennis fan," Mr. Dinkins said of Mr. Bloomberg, "but he certainly knows the economic impact of the U.S. Open."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A subheading yesterday about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's attendance at the United States Open tennis tournament misidentified the Queens neighborhood where it is being held. The stadium is in Flushing Meadows, not Forest Hills.

HEADLINE: World Development Forum Begins With a Rebuke 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of officials, environmentalists and advocates for the poor converged on this old mining city today to devise an ambitious blueprint to promote development while protecting natural resources. 
 Participants from all over the world flocked to the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development in flowing African robes, Indian saris and pinstriped suits. They celebrated the spirit of global solidarity and vowed to hammer out a plan to protect rain forests, to clean polluted air and to help millions of people escape from poverty. 
 More than 100 presidents and prime ministers, including most European leaders, will attend this summit meeting to show their commitment to their new pledges. But many here are expressing doubts about the developed nations' sincerity and are especially critical of the fact that President Bush, the leader of the world's biggest economy and its largest polluter, has decided not to attend. 
American officials here today said they were committed to the meeting's agenda and would soon announce investments of more than $970 million in projects to provide access clean water to Africa and other developing nations. They said they want to focus on offering concrete support for specific projects instead of getting mired in debates about the targets and time frames for foreign aid that the developing nations are seeking.
But as participants gathered in the gleaming convention center here, nearly everyone was haunted by the failures of the past.
Ten years ago, the world's leaders left the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro with an ambitious agenda that is mostly remembered by the participants here as a string of broken promises and squandered opportunities. In his opening speech today, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa said pointedly that the world had stood by and allowed environmental degradation and deepening poverty to threaten the future of the Earth.
Mr. Mbeki said leaders had failed to muster the political will to reduce poverty and to protect natural resources despite the promises made in Rio de Janeiro. He urged officials to develop a plan during this 10-day meeting to rescue a world increasingly characterized by dying lakes, retreating forests, global warming and desperately poor people.
"Poverty, underdevelopment, inequality within and among countries, together with the worsening global ecological crisis, sum up the dark shadow under which most of the world lives," Mr. Mbeki said in his speech. "It is no secret that the global community has, as yet, not demonstrated the will to implement the decisions it has freely adopted." 
"We need to take stock of the inertia of the past decade and agree on very clear and practical measures that will help us to deal decisively with all the challenges that we face," he added. "This is the central task of this summit."
The officials here applauded his words. But as the day wore on and negotiators huddled in the ballrooms, it was clear that coming up with a strong plan would be very difficult.
No new treaties will be signed here. Instead, negotiators are focusing on the link between poverty and environmental degradation and on how to spur growth in poor countries while protecting the environment. 
But there are deep disagreements between rich and poor nations about how to achieve those goals.
Poor countries say they need to improve their economies before they will be in a position to protect their natural resources. They want wealthy nations to provide aid to developing countries equal to 0.7 percent of the wealthy nations' gross national products. They also want the wealthy nations to reduce or eliminate tariffs on agricultural goods from poor countries and, by 2015, to reduce by half the number of people who lack access to sanitation. 
Officials from the United States and the European Union have refused to make commitments for time frames to eliminate agricultural subsidies, which protect their farmers from foreign competition. "We do not see Johannesburg as a place to have these negotiations," said Catherine Day of the European Union at a news conference today.
The European Union is willing to discuss setting targets for increasing foreign assistance to the poor and for converting to renewable energy sources, but the United States opposes such measures.
"I think goals are important, but they're only lofty rhetoric without the commitment of resources," said John F. Turner, the assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. 
"The opportunity here is for partners to start committing resources in these critical areas to reduce poverty and ensure a more sustainable future," Mr. Turner said. "That's what we ought to be focused on." 
But officials from developing nations said the wealthy countries were being inflexible. "What's in there for us?" asked one official, who supports specific targets for foreign aid. "We're not advancing at all." 
Nearly 25 percent of the summit meeting's action plan remained contested today. As diplomats scrambled for consensus, some officials warned that the meeting might produce little more than reaffirmations of old promises. 
Environmentalists and advocates for the poor are already vowing to march through the streets by the thousands on Saturday to ensure that the link between poverty and environmental decay remains high on the agenda. Much of their anger is directed at President Bush.
Last year, President Bush upset many leaders when he rejected a treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, which set targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Marcel Furtado, a Brazilian representative of the advocacy group Greenpeace, said both developing and developed countries were to blame for the failure of pledges made in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
Mr. Furtado said many delegates had learned from the failures of the past. He said they resented the United States and the European Union, to some extent, for blocking efforts to infuse this meeting's action plan with new and concrete commitments. "We have a job to do, which is to deliver change," he said. "It looks like the real issues are not making it into the document."
Klaus Toepfer, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, urged negotiators to strive for consensus, no matter how difficult the negotiations become. No one, he said, can afford to give up. 
"The eyes of the world are upon us here waiting for signs that we are able to bridge our differences," he said. "The time has come to translate our political commitment into action."

Cheney Says Nuclear Peril Justifies Attack on Iraq
Vice President Dick Cheney presented the administration's most forceful and comprehensive rationale for attacking Iraq, warning that Saddam Hussein would "fairly soon" have nuclear weapons. Administration officials said Mr. Cheney's views mirrored those of President Bush, and were part of an ongoing campaign to persuade the allies, Congress and the American public about the administration's plans for what it calls regime change in Iraq. The officials said Mr. Bush is expected to discuss Iraq in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 12. A1

The Defense Department is notifying more than 14,000 reservists that they may be required to extend their duty, a move seen as a contingency for possible action against Iraq. A8

Giant Water Project in China
China, with water scarcity reaching the critical stage in sprawling showcase cities like Beijing and Tianjin, has embarked on one of history's great water-moving projects. At huge cost -- $58 billion -- the government plans to rechannel water from the Yangtze basin to the thirsty north, over three pathways of nearly 1,000 miles each. A1

Forum Opens in Johannesburg
Thousand of people flocked to the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg to devise an ambitious blueprint to promote development while protecting natural resources. But doubts remain about the sincerity of the more than 100 world leaders who will attend, particularly because President Bush, the leader of the world's biggest economy and its largest polluter, will not attend. A7

Push to Secede in Patagonia
There is an increasingly restive movement to detach the southernmost region of South America, rich in oil and minerals, from the economic disaster that is the rest of Argentina. A1

U.S. Appeals Court Rules Secret Hearings Are Illegal
The federal appeals court in Cincinnati declared that the Bush administration acted illegally in holding hundreds of deportation hearings in secret based only on the government's assertion that the people involved may have links to terrorism. The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is the first major appellate ruling on the government's legal tactics in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. A1

New Tools in Anthrax Inquiry
The F.B.I. will re-enter a quarantined tabloid newspaper office in Boca Raton, Fla., where last year's anthrax attacks were first discovered, using fresh techniques to search for new clues. The anthrax is thought to have entered the building in a letter, but the letter was never found. A13

Blood Test for Weapons Expert
An offer by Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, a biological weapons expert, to provide a blood sample to the F.B.I. could bear strongly on his guilt or innocence in the anthrax attacks last year, but any results would probably not be conclusive. A13

DNA Proof Frees Detroit Man
A Detroit man who confessed to the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in 1984 was freed after DNA evidence proved he did not commit the crime. Mr. Loyd, who served more than 17 years in prison, is the 110th person to be exonerated because of DNA evidence. A10

Singer Inches Closer to Space
The singer Lance Bass of the group 'N Sync began a week of training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in a bid to become the first entertainer in space. He joined four astronauts -- three Russians and a Belgian -- for orientation training to board the International Space Station, even though his trip is not assured. A California entertainment company, Destiny Productions, has been lining up sponsors to pay for the estimated $20 million cost of his flight. A14

Chancellor Adds Two Days To the Coming School Year
Chancellor Joel I. Klein, in his first attempt to improve instruction for New York City schoolchildren, has added two days to the coming school year. The last-minute change is on top of a decision made earlier this year to extend teacher workdays by 100 minutes a week. Under a new contract agreement, teachers will spend half of the additional time on training and half on instruction. A1

More Getting 9/11 FEMA Aid
Since late June, when it overhauled its programs to assist New Yorkers devastated by the Sept. 11 attack, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted more money to nearly as many people needing help with their mortgage or rent than it did in the previous nine months. The agency has eased its eligibility criteria, to include more New Yorkers outside of Lower Manhattan. B1

Mayor Embraces U.S. Open
The idea that a mayor would attend a major international sports event in his own backyard would not normally qualify as big news, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's trip to the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, reflects a policy change of sorts: his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, refused to attend the tournaments for eight years.

Dredging Plan Is Approved
New York's bid to stay dominant as a port in the coming generation of super-sized cargo ships got a boost as the Army Corps of Engineers approved a plan to accelerate the deepening of a section of the Kill Van Kull to 50 feet allowing the dredging in New York Harbor to proceed without time-consuming hearings or an evaluation process.

HEADLINE: Next Big Health Debate: How to Help Uninsured 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Concerned that millions of workers are losing their health insurance coverage at a time when health costs are surging, employers and Congressional leaders say the next great health care debate will be over how to help the uninsured.
 Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, an influential moderate Democrat, and leaders of the nation's largest pension plans are trying to drum up support for universal health insurance, a proposal that has received little attention, except from labor unions and liberals, since the collapse of the Clintons' health plan. 
 The House Republican leaders -- Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Dick Armey, the majority leader, who is retiring -- have been working on a package of less sweeping measures, including tax credits for the uninsured, in hopes of defusing the issue before the Congressional elections this fall.
Kate Sullivan, health policy director of the United States Chamber of Commerce, predicts that the issue will heat up next month when the Census Bureau announces the number of uninsured for last year, which may climb above 40 million -- from 38.4 million in 2000 -- and when the Kaiser Family Foundation reports the latest double-digit increases in health costs.
On costs, "the 2003 and 2004 projections are going to be much worse than the 2002 projections," said Helen Darling, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, a group of large employers. 
One of the nation's largest purchasers of health care, the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, which covers 1.2 million people, recently agreed to 25 percent increases in health premiums for next year. The state's $1.58 billion in spending for the Calpers health budget is expected to double in three years, said William Crist, an economist who is president of Calpers. 
As retirees are forced to spend more of their funds, higher payments for health care "are essentially taking away pensions," he said. Mr. Crist, who said he was "trying to get support for coalitions working toward a political base for universal coverage," recently sent invitations to other big state pension plans to join the National Coalition on Health Care, a Washington-based group that favors universal insurance.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission, the New York State Teachers' Retirement System and the New York employees retirement fund -- which is run by H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and candidate for governor -- have all joined the coalition.
Paying for the uninsured is making health care even more expensive for private employers and government programs. Corporations, consumers and taxpayers end up covering the escalating health costs of people who lost jobs in the economic slowdown or who risk going without expensive insurance. 
"The uninsured should be a big issue in the coming year," said Bruce E. Bradley, director of managed care plans at General Motors. 
Adding to the urgency, employers are passing along more of those costs to workers and retirees, and they are increasingly angry and frustrated about those costs.
"We need to do something about the coming meltdown in health care financing," said Larry Atkins, coordinator of the Corporate Health Care Coalition, which includes big companies that supported the Clinton health plan in 1994. "I think the issue is going to pop up in the 2002 elections."
At the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research center, Robert Moffett, a health policy expert, said: "The climate is increasingly ripe for a re-examination of old ideas about health insurance." Heritage is promoting its own longstanding proposal for universal coverage, to be financed by tax credits.
Lack of, or inadequate, coverage is cited along with problems with Medicare as the two "most important health care issues for government action" in a public opinion survey published on the Internet this month by Health Affairs, a policy journal. 
"These findings suggest that this issue may emerge as an important one in the post-2002 Congressional election term," said the survey director, Robert J. Blendon, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said incremental or piecemeal measures still had the best chance of paring the numbers of uninsured. He suggested "a combination of something like medical savings accounts, tax incentives and refundable credits for individual insurance policies."
But Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, said recently that "many of us have concluded that incremental approaches to health care are not the solution."
A Senate aide said Democrats were expected to work on "a dual track -- seeking to expand the Child Health Plus subsidies to parents," as New York and a few other states have done, as well as "laying down markers for a debate next year on universal coverage."
Labor unions, which have long supported universal coverage, are preparing for tough bargaining over health benefits in the coming months and possibly strikes, said Gerald Shea, assistant to the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John J. Sweeney.
"Wages are being traded for continuing health coverage," Mr. Shea said. Union workers at Hershey Foods walked out for seven weeks in the spring over a demand by the company that employees pay more for their health benefits.
Rob McGarrah, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. senior policy aide, said, "Universal coverage is back on the table."
Senator Breaux, who headed a bipartisan commission on overhauling Medicare and is active in the politically charged debate over a Medicare prescription drug benefit, has been discussing approaches to universal coverage with a number of colleagues, including Mr. Grassley and Senator George V. Voinovich, a conservative Republican from Ohio. 
As Mr. Breaux noted, coverage is available now for the elderly in Medicare, for veterans from the Department of Veterans Affairs, for the poor under Medicaid and for millions of workers in employer-sponsored health plans. 
"As a nation, it is very important to have national insurance for everybody," he said in an interview. 
Each existing program has "its own bureaucracy and rules and regulations and duplication of the others," he said, adding: "We need to get a lot more younger and healthy people in the insurance pool, hopefully reduce the costs for the people who have insurance now."
Existing programs could be reorganized and continued, he suggested, with the government making sure that health care is "delivered properly and also that it is paid for." He mentioned subsidies for low-income people that would be adjusted according to income.
Both companies and their employees get tax advantages for their health costs, he noted, saying: "There is a lot of money in the system already. I think we can rearrange it and spend it more wisely."
Deductions for medical expenses reduce state and federal tax collections by $140 billion a year, Mr. Moffett of the Heritage Foundation said.
The White House and many Republicans, including Senator Grassley and Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, want to provide tax credits, which they say would make insurance affordable for many uninsured people. 
Democrats in the Senate have opposed the credits. "Tax credits would undermine the good employment-based coverage on which most Americans depend, forcing them to rely on the often-volatile individual insurance market," Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said.
In a compromise within the recently passed trade bill, however, both House and Senate voted to include a modest tax credit measure and new federal money to help pay for health care for workers who lose jobs as a consequence of future trade pacts.

Opening Western Eyes to a View of Islam

 BODY:
MILITANT ISLAM REACHES AMERICA
By Daniel Pipes
309 pages. W. W. Norton. $25.95.
 There was a time when America was actually rather popular in what we now call the Islamic world. But that was a time when America exported oil, few Americans had ever seen a Muslim and vice versa. 
 Then came World War II and the historical equivalent of continental drift. Europe receded, by choice and otherwise. Post-colonial nation builders jostled in the newly opened space. Israel was created. The cold war overflowed its European banks. Hot wars proliferated. Populations soared. Economies scrambled and failed to keep up. America ascended to megapower and learned to love imported oil. Globalization spread like kudzu.
Meanwhile America acquired an increasingly visible and audible Muslim minority, part diaspora from all over the Islamic world, part African-American in growing numbers. Then, out of a literally clear blue sky, came Sept. 11.
"Here and now begins a new era in world history, and you can say that you were there," said Goethe of the Battle of Valmy in 1792, the first important engagement in the French Revolutionary Wars. Millions of Americans think of Sept. 11 in much the same way.
Wrong, says Daniel Pipes in this anthology of random pieces going back to 1990. That Tuesday from hell was not the beginning, let alone the end of history. Nor should the hijackers, their shadowy handlers and Osama bin Laden be taken for the authentic voice of Islam, the religion and civilization, with 1.3 billion adherents and nearly 1,400 years of history. On the contrary, says Mr. Pipes. What hit us on Sept. 11 was Islamism, the ideology, a product of relatively recent civilizational discontents in a swath of the world where a glorious past has somehow led to a futureless present.
He estimates the ideology's hard core at 70,000 in some 50 countries. To this he adds a penumbra of fellow travelers, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of the world's Muslims.
As a professional historian and trained Arabist, he regards Islamism as a global menace. But he finds its zeal, animus, organization and technology thoroughly modern and familiar, despite the conspicuous display of beards, caftans and turbans.
For Mr. Pipes the Islamist version of Islam is just another modernizing anachronism. To him its churchlike hierarchy, quasi-papal ayatollahs, quasi-sabbatarian Friday, even unexpected hints of feminism, look remarkably like unacknowledged Westernisms. The real analogues of Islamism, in Mr. Pipes's view, are 20th-century products, too: the great totalitarian heresies, fascism and Communism.
One of the book's most interesting pieces compares Western responses to Islamism and Communism. Mr. Pipes makes a strong case that Left and Right have approached both with impressive consistency. But sturdy, well-connected neo-conservative that he is, he argues just as forthrightly that the Left has been consistently wrong.
His policy guidelines are accordingly simple. Respect and support the moderate Muslims, who are Islam's silent majority. Don't push democracy where Islamists are likely to win. Don't try to appease. It can't be done.
Well, maybe. But is it that simple? Did we do ourselves a favor during the Reagan and first Bush administrations by cozying up to secular Iraq during its war with clerical Iran, and looking away when a bankrupt Algerian military dictatorship canceled an election for fear of losing it, at a time when we were incidentally insisting on free elections in post-Communist Europe?
And aren't there a few self-fulfilling propositions here? Does one size really fit all? Or are we creating solidarity by denying differences between natural adversaries?
And hasn't Islamist success something to do with the failure of secularizing regimes, from liberal to fascist, in a variety of Arab and Muslim countries, going back at least a century? And if so, might not some of the hostility toward us have to do with our support for some of these regimes?
And haven't regimes we call moderate helped Islamists seize the oppositional high ground by stifling alternative opposition: for example, the disgraceful treatment of the Egyptian-American sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim by President Mubarak of Egypt, or of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad?
On the other hand Mr. Pipes also notes that the "war on terror" is confusingly, even dangerously open-ended, when our war is really with radical, politicized Islamic fundamentalism; that we are not engaged in a "clash of civilizations," because Islamists are as dangerous to fellow Muslims as they are to us; and that the containment policy that served us so well in the cold war can work again.

HEADLINE: Australia Lowers Fees Involving Credit Cards 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Australia's central bank ordered sweeping changes in the way credit card businesses operate today. The bank said the changes would lower costs and promote competition.
 The proposal was made over the strong objections of the two main credit card brands, Visa International and MasterCard International. 
 The central bank ordered that the interchange fees that banks charge one another to process card transactions be cut by about 40 percent, to the range of 0.55 to 0.6 cents on the dollar, starting in July 2003. The savings are intended to be passed along to merchants, who pay banks to handle customers' charges.
The central bank also ordered that retailers be allowed to impose a surcharge on purchases made with credit and charge cards, to defray some of the cost of the bank fees. Visa and MasterCard oppose the policy because they say it penalizes card use. 
The central bank, which took over responsibility for regulating credit cards here in 1998, issued the new rules after a three-year inquiry into costs and competition in the industry. Its findings, summarized in an 80-page report published today, were supported by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
The two agencies have said they were concerned about secrecy and price fixing in the credit card industry. The central bank governor, Ian Macfarlane, said today that the new rules "will ensure a more transparent payment system and reduce the size of the transfer from card users to financial institutions," while leaving the basic system intact. "They will also promote genuine competition on credit card interest rates and service fees," he said.
The card issuers see it differently. "The new regulations are clearly not in the public interest, and are a bad outcome for consumers and small business," Gordon Wheaton, Visa's executive vice president for Australia, said today. A MasterCard senior vice president, Lee Clapman, called the new rules unfair.
Australia is a strong market for credit cards -- Visa alone has 13 million cards in use in a country of 19.3 million people, and credit card debt per capita has tripled since 1996, to about $1,200 a person. Retailers in larger markets like the United States and Britain have brought complaints of excessive fees and price fixing to regulators, and analysts said the move by the Australian central bank might set a precedent.
The central bank's order is subject to court review, and Visa, the market leader here, has indicated that it may appeal.

HEADLINE: An American Abdication 

BYLINE:  By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
At present there is much talk about the unparalleled strength of the United States on the world stage. Yet at this very moment the most powerful country in the world stands to forfeit much political capital, moral authority and international good will by dragging its feet on the next great global issue: the environment. Before long, the administration's apparent unwillingness to take a leadership role -- or, at the very least, to stop acting as a brake -- in fighting global environmental degradation will threaten the very basis of the American supremacy that many now seem to assume will last forever.
 American authority is already in some danger as a result of the Bush administration's decision to send a low-level delegation to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg -- low-level, that is, relative to America's share of both the world economy and global pollution. The absence of President Bush from Johannesburg symbolizes this decline in authority. 
 In recent weeks, newspapers around the world have been dominated by environmental headlines: In central Europe, flooding killed dozens, displaced tens of thousands and caused billions of dollars in damages. In South Asia, the United Nations reports a brown cloud of pollution that is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year from respiratory disease. The pollution (80 percent man-made) also cuts sunlight penetration, thus reducing rainfall, affecting agriculture and otherwise altering the climate. Many other examples of environmental degradation, often related to the warming of the atmosphere, could be cited. What they all have in common is that they severely affect countries around the world and are fast becoming a chief concern for people everywhere.
Nobody is suggesting that these disasters are directly linked to anything the United States is doing. But when a country that emits 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases acts as an uninterested, sometimes hostile bystander in the environmental debate, it looks like unbearable arrogance to many people abroad.
The administration seems to believe it is merely an observer -- that environmental issues are not its issues. But not doing anything amounts to ignoring a key source of world tension, and no superpower that wants to preserve its status can go on dismissing such a pivotal dimension of political and economic -- if not existential -- conflict.
In my view, there is a clear-cut price to be paid for ignoring the views of just about every other country in the world today. The United States is jettisoning its hard-won moral and intellectual authority and perhaps the strategic advantages that come with being a good steward of the international political order. The United States may no longer be viewed as a leader or reliable partner in policymaking: necessary, perhaps inevitable, but not desirable, as it has been for decades. All of this because America's current leaders are not willing to acknowledge the very real concerns of many people about global environmental issues.
No one can expect the United States to provide any quick fixes, but one would like to see America make a credible and sustained effort, along with other countries, to address global environmental problems. This should happen on two fronts. The first is at home in the United States, through more environmentally friendly policies, for example greater fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and better insulation for buildings. The second is international, through a more cooperative approach to multilateral attempts at safeguarding the environment. Simply rejecting international treaties (like the Kyoto Protocol) then failing to offer a better proposal cannot be an acceptable option for American policymakers.
Much of the world has come together to help the United States in the fight against terrorism, out of the realization that a common threat can only be beaten through a cooperative effort. It is high time for the United States, metaphorically speaking, to get out of its oversized, gas-guzzling S.U.V. -- and join the rest of the world in doing more to combat global warming and protecting the planet.

HEADLINE: Notably Mixed Signals From 2 Economic R eports 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Orders to factories for durable goods, including cars and computers, rose in July at the fastest rate in nine months, while another report released today showed that consumer confidence fell sharply in August. 
 The Commerce Department said that orders for costly durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rebounded last month -- increasing by 8.7 percent after a 4.5 percent decline in June. 
 While that report provided good news about a struggling economic recovery, the Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence for August raised questions about the willingness of people to spend in the months ahead. 
The consumer confidence index fell to 93.5 in August, the lowest level since November, from a revised 97.4 in July. The showing was weaker than the 97 reading analysts had forecast. The index is used by economists to gauge consumers' future patterns -- spending that accounts for most American economic activity. 
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center, said August's decline was "a strong signal that business conditions have yet to turn around."
Viewed over time, the board said, the index in August is at a level that points "to a continued, but slow, economic expansion."
The report showed no improvement in confidence about current economic conditions. Consumers rating current conditions as good fell to 16.6 percent in August from 20.2 percent in July, while those seeing conditions as bad was virtually unchanged at 22.3 percent in August from 22.1 percent in July, the Conference Board said.
The share of consumers who said jobs were hard to get remained unchanged at 23.9 percent, with those seeing jobs as plentiful falling to 17.2 percent in August from 18.8 percent.
Consumer expectations for the next six months were mixed. The share of those surveyed who expected an improvement in business conditions increased to 22.1 percent from 20.8 percent a month earlier, but a larger share of respondents held the contrary view.
The outlook for jobs also soured, with 18.1 percent of consumers saying they expected fewer jobs to open in the next six months, compared with 17 percent in the previous survey.
In the report on durable goods, the 8.7 percent increase in new orders was the largest since a 9.2 percent advance last October. July's performance was far stronger than the increase expected by analysts, which had ranged from 1.4 percent to 2.7 percent.
And this strength was broad based, with new orders rising in virtually every category surveyed except for electrical equipment and appliances. 
Orders for transportation equipment soared 20.8 percent, more than erasing a drop of 5.8 percent in June. Orders for cars, trucks and parts increased 7.5 percent after a 3 percent decline. Orders for commercial aircraft and parts jumped 121.6 percent in July after a decrease of 46.6 percent in June. 
Excluding transportation equipment, durable-goods orders rose by a solid 3.9 percent in July. And excluding orders for goods used by the military, durable goods rose even more steeply -- by a record 7.3 percent. 
Today's report may be a sign that the seeds are being sown for a turnaround in capital investment by businesses, a crucial ingredient in a full economic recovery. 
Orders for computers increased 13.9 percent in July after falling 9.8 percent in June. For communications equipment, orders rose 10.4 percent after a 15.3 percent decline. 
Orders for machinery were up a record 11.8 percent in July after a 8.3 percent decline in June. 
But orders for electrical equipment and appliances fell 1.6 percent in July after a 1.3 percent decline in June.

HEADLINE: US Airways Puts New Terms On NonrefundableTickets 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
US Airways said yesterday that it was imposing more stringent conditions on most of its nonrefundable tickets, including requiring passengers to buy another ticket if they miss their original flight and want to take a later one.
 Until yesterday, passengers could get on a later flight as long as seats were available and they paid a change fee. Now, on flights originating in the United States, the Caribbean and Canada, they will have to buy a new ticket. 
 The carrier becomes the latest to impose economy-class changes to try to stem losses. US Airways is operating under bankruptcy protection, and it has already said it is eliminating 200 daily flights, or 13 percent of its schedule.
US Airways also announced yesterday that it would bar passengers with most nonrefundable tickets from flying standby; that it would not count miles earned with such tickets toward elite status in the frequent-flier program; and that it would cut corporate discounts.
Passengers who bought tickets before yesterday will be able to fly under the original conditions of the tickets.
US Airways compared the new policy to buying tickets for a Broadway show or a sports event -- missing the event does not entitle the ticket holder to any form of credit.
"Since most people travel as originally ticketed, most customers will not be impacted by this change," B. Ben Baldanza, senior vice president for marketing at US Airways, said in a statement.
Unlike entertainment, however, a flight is generally considered a utilitarian service. In train and bus travel, travelers who miss a scheduled departure usually are allowed to leave later or receive some form of credit.
Passengers will not be able to fly standby. A change to an earlier flight with available seats, can still be done so as long as the passenger pays a change fee and any difference in the fare.
Starting Jan. 1, passengers who fly with most nonrefundable tickets will not have their miles count toward earning one of the three elite categories in the frequent-flier program.
Passengers will also be charged $25 for each paper ticket and will not be able to have alcoholic beverages in economy class on trans-Atlantic flights. 
"Clearly they are reducing the quality of service and reducing their costs, so that strategy is consistent with the low-cost, high-efficiency strategy," said Roland Rust, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland School of Business. "But if the customer can't justify paying more, then there's no reason for them to fly on US Airways."
Professor Rust predicted that passengers accustomed to a certain level of service in economy class would start migrating to low-cost carriers like JetBlue, which competes with US Airways on several routes on the East Coast and has a simpler fare structure.

New York Doesn't Need More Games

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
TO remain the center of the universe -- which New York is, of course -- you need an infrastructure. For example: the National Tennis Center in Queens is built upon the skeletons of past extravaganzas when New York played host to the world.
 Now, for better or quite likely for worse, it could happen again. Yesterday, New York was chosen as one of the two finalists for the one American bid to hold the 2012 Summer Games. 
 The big city does not exactly shy away from big events. We are reminded of that every late summer when Agassi is playing Sampras, or Williams is playing Williams, or a few years back when Jimmy Connors blatantly played to the street-fighting spirit of all New Yorkers. 
There are billions of reasons why New York does not need the traffic, the cost and the distractions of holding the Summer Games. But there is no denying that New York has a certain affinity for drama and struggle, survival and spectacle.
Yesterday, for example, a Russian, Marat Safin, and a German, Nicolas Kiefer, were lurching and staggering deep into a fifth set, with Kiefer cramping on every point and Safin threatening to destroy his entire kit of rackets, and the crowd egging them on.
 When Kiefer finally lost the tie breaker, he hobbled off for medical attention, but he paused to wave, opera-style, at the fairly large crowd in Ashe Stadium. "They were supporting me and him," Kiefer said, as Connors used to say. "It was great for both of us." 
Now there is a possibility that the expensive little playpen for the designer-outfit set would be used for the tennis site if New York were selected in 2005. (There is reason to think, maybe even hope, that the International Olympic Committee will not be ready for another American city that soon.) 
Under the elaborate plans, parkland and an artificial lake near the tennis center would also be used for Olympic rowing and canoeing. This is somewhat hallowed ground for world events. The Open can be traced directly to the World's Fair of 1939 (surely, everybody remembers the Trylon and the Perisphere) and the 1964 World's Fair (surely, everybody remembers the Spanish Pavilion).
When the fair folded up after its reprise in 1965, its remains began to sink into the mushy earth. According to legend, Slew Hester of the United States Tennis Association was seeking a new site for the Open and spotted a dinky little stadium while on final approach to La Guardia.
When Hester inquired about the joint, he was told it was something called the Singer Bowl that had held concerts in 1964-65. Skip quickly through the politics, the economics, the demographics, the protests, and you have the Open and its fabled trademark, the $10 hamburger.
Now New York and San Francisco are the two finalists of the United States Olympic Committee after a vote in Chicago yesterday. The New York organizers emphasized sites for future generations: an Olympic Stadium on the west side of Manhattan that would be used for football, presumably the Jets, as well as for major shows and conventions. And there would be assorted arenas and stadiums scattered around New York, connected by a network of trains, buses and ferries. If it added one more car to the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the city would grind to a halt.
Any way you look at it, spending billions to build and upgrade means ignoring other needs, including rebuilding from the evil attack of a year ago. Athens is struggling to complete some minimal portion of the roads and housing it promised. Montreal's debt from the 1976 Summer Games will outlast its baseball team. The recent World Cup in South Korea and Japan left behind 20 handsome new stadiums, not all of them with a resident soccer team.
There is no hard evidence that major sports events benefit their hosts. Building stadiums is often a Chamber of Commerce boondoggle, to put the Greatest Little Town in the World on the map.
Imagine how embarrassed New York would be right now if it had been stuck building new stadiums for the Mets and the Yankees only to have the blockhead owners and the dunderhead players stage a ruinous long layoff.
Sports have a close connection with bad civic values. There are high schools in New York spending money for football helmets while the city cannot provide enough textbooks to enhance the brains inside the helmets.
The organizers of the New York bid make a compelling case for building for the long run, but New York is already on the map. Ask the Russian and the German who met at the crossroads of Queens yesterday.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Pushes Companies To Disclose Data Faster 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission, responding to recent corporate scandals, adopted rules today requiring executives to be faster in disclosing important company information and their own stock trades.
 The agency also adopted a rule that would require top executives at domestic and foreign companies whose shares trade in American markets to certify regularly the accuracy of their company's financial reports. 
 Most of the rules were ordered by Congress as part of the corporate fraud and accounting legislation signed into law by President Bush four weeks ago. But the agency went further than the legislation by adopting a schedule that will require most publicly traded companies to be quicker in filing their annual and quarterly financial reports. 
For the first time since the end of the Clinton administration, the commission was at full strength today, with all five seats filled. The agency has been hobbled by a lack of adequate financing and manpower. Late last month, the Senate confirmed four members to the commission. Before those votes, the only confirmed member had been Harvey L. Pitt, the agency's chairman, who had been in office for almost a year.
The day's rule-making was the first in a long series of decisions confronting the agency as a result of the legislation sponsored by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio. In the coming weeks, the commission will begin to set up an agency overseeing the accountants of publicly traded companies and re-examine many of the rules governing accountants.
"We are determined to give real teeth and meaning to the protections of the new law," Mr. Pitt said. The rules, he said, "reaffirm our commitment to restoring public confidence in the markets."
Harvey J. Goldschmid, a new member of the agency and a securities law expert from Columbia Law School, said that the adoption of the rules "marks an historic occasion," and that the new law was "the most important securities legislation since the New Deal."
The agency's focus today was limited primarily to issues of corporate disclosure. The collapse of Enron, in particular, highlighted the shortcomings of the requirements on executives to make public their trading in company stock, and their disclosures of important financial information.
Under the rules that were generally described in the legislation and adopted today in more detail, corporate executives and shareholders with more than 10 percent of a company's outstanding stock will have two days to disclose their sale or purchase of their stock. 
In most instances, this means that the public will know about any stock sales or purchases even before they are formally settled. The old rule required executives to file by the 10th day after the end of the month of the transaction, giving executives as many as 40 days to disclose.
"This will provide more information to investors faster," said Cynthia A. Glassman, a commissioner and former economist at the Federal Reserve.
The law requires executives to file the reports electronically to the commission and post them on corporate Web sites, beginning next summer. But Alan L. Beller, director of the agency's division on corporation finance, said he expected that the commission might propose requiring electronic filing sooner than the Congressional deadline.
Another rule adopted today will require most publicly traded companies to make their most important filings quicker. The rule, proposed earlier this year, drew significant criticism from companies that said it would be difficult to satisfy and predicted it could lead to less accurate filings.
Mr. Pitt said the rule reflected a "careful balance" between the needs of investors receiving quick information without "impairing the quality" of the reports.
The rule will be phased in over three years. By then, most public companies will have only 60 days to complete their annual reports, down from the current 90 days. And quarterly reports will be due within 35 days of the close of the quarter, down from 45 days required now.
The commission also adopted a rule ordered by Congress requiring the chief executive and chief financial officer of the largest companies to certify the accuracy of their quarterly and annual reports. 
Mr. Beller of the corporation finance division said the rule would not impose any new legal liability on executives, although he suggested it could make it easier for government officials to make fraud cases against executives found to have intentionally filed false certifications.
Roel C. Campos, one of the new commissioners, who was a Texas businessman and former prosecutor, described the new certification requirements more simply.
"What is being required," he said, "is that senior executive officials must say, 'You have my word that what I am saying is accurate, and I realize if I fib, I will be in a heap of trouble.' "

HEADLINE: Saving Water, U.S. Farmers Are Worried They'll Parch 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: PETERSBURG, Tex. 

 BODY:
Ronnie Hopper grows cotton, and he has learned firsthand that water is precious. The water that he pumps from underground costs him five times as much as it used to, so he does his best not to waste a drop. 
 He has installed new, high-efficiency center-pivot sprinklers, designed to eliminate losses to evaporation. He has cut back on his planting on his 2,000-acre farm to concentrate water on fields that can use it best. He is even considering drip irrigation, water by the trickle. 
 Mr. Hopper has reason to be parsimonious. Though he lives atop one of the world's largest aquifers, the Ogallala, which spans eight states, it is falling every day. Here in dry northwest Texas, the problem is particularly acute, with declines of at least three times the average. 
"Putting more wells in this particular ground would be like putting more straws in a glass," Mr. Hopper said, ruddy-faced in the Texas sun. 
People have warned of the threat to the aquifer, which supplies roughly a quarter of the United States' irrigated farmland, for more than 20 years, and it is still in danger. But the experience of farmers like Mr. Hopper offers reasons both for hope and caution for those struggling to save scarce water elsewhere, and to arrest drastic declines in other underground supplies in places like India and China. 
In a shift of much significance, per capita water use -- on the rise in most of the rest of the world -- is now declining in the United States. That retreat has been led by industrial users and farmers like Mr. Hopper, who began to save water through technology and conservation even before the recent years of drought, which this summer will affect more than a third of states. 
Now, however, after years of conservation, these users now worry that whatever savings are achieved will only be lost to competition from fast-growing American cities and suburbs. Despite America's overall decline in water consumption, these booming population centers are making greater demands than ever on limited water supplies. 
"We're coming to the reality that we may not have enough water to farm all of this land," Mr. Hopper said, in fields that stretched toward the pancake-flat horizon. "But we don't want anyone coming in and telling us that we don't know how to use it best." 
By global standards, the United States remains one of the world's most gluttonous water users. But Americans' water use declined more than 20 percent from 1980 to 1995, to about 1,500 gallons of water per person a day from 1,900, according to the most current data from the United States Geological Survey, which says the downward trend appears to be continuing. 
Today the depletion of the Ogallala -- beneath parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas -- has slowed to an extent not predicted by any forecasts. It is dropping by just a few inches a year on average, after averaging declines of about two feet a year since intensive irrigation began about 60 years ago. 
Still, it is the outlook beyond their fields that makes farmers almost as anxious as the falling water levels beneath them. 
In most of the country, farmers have primary water rights, ahead of suburbs and cities. But competition is intensifying. Texas, for instance, with rapid population growth and few restrictions on water use, is increasing its water consumption faster than any other state. 
By 2050, Texas water planners say the state's population will leap to 40 million people from nearly 21 million in 2000. By the same year, the board has warned, Texas' supply of water, from existing sources, will be 19 percent less than it is today.
Given that imbalance, the Texas water board said, it would be unrealistic to think that the Ogallala could be sustained into the indefinite future. The aquifer should be treated like a mine, it said, and plumbed until it runs out. But then what?

Doing More With Less
At 58, Mr. Hopper remembers when water was so plentiful and the Ogallala lay so near the surface that conservation and cost barely entered his mind. But cotton is a thirsty plant, and out where he lives, farming has always been a marginal business. 
On Mr. Hopper's farm, the aquifer, which stood 95 feet below the surface when he was a boy, now stands at 335 feet, with just 65 to go before it hits bottom. Now, he figures, his water bill (in electricity, for pumping from ever greater depths) accounts for a fifth of his overhead. Last year, he earned 52 cents an acre for his cotton, not enough to break even, and 20 cents of that came from the government. 
Environmentalists call it a waste twice over: the United States produces a surplus of cotton, and pays subsidies to its farmers, yet in places like Texas the water-intensive crop is draining a finite water supply. 
Still, water managers like those in Texas have resisted limiting farmers' water use -- and often do not even gauge it. 
"One of the goals, I think, of most of the producers here is to reduce the use of water," said Jim C. Conkwright, the general manager for the district based in Lubbock, which covers Mr. Hopper's farm. "But it's not something we can accomplish overnight." 
Most water experts say the most urgent task is to find ways to do more with less. "If you become more efficient within reason, we can improve the situation in many places around the world," said Ben Dziegielewski, executive director of the International Water Resources Association.
Mr. Hopper says that is what he and many other farmers have done. American farmers who withdrew 2.9 feet of water for every irrigated acre in 1980 were making do with 2.6 feet by 1995, government statistics show. 
The savings reflect efforts to eliminate losses from evaporation, wind and runoff, as Mr. Hopper has done by installing the center-point sprinklers. They deliver water closer to his cotton with about 95 percent efficiency, compared with about 50 percent for old-fashioned furrow irrigation. 
With the savings in pumping costs, Mr. Hoppers says he has paid for his investment in just a few years. "It all comes down to economics," he said. "I'll take as good care of the land as I can afford to do."
But even as farmers like Mr. Hopper try to conserve, thirsty cities and suburbs in the region have begun to look to the Ogallala to meet their expanding water needs. By 2050, planners in Texas expect municipal water use to rise by nearly 67 percent. 
The competition alarms farmers like Mr. Hopper, who argues that the cities have no claim on the aquifer at all. "Who are they to say that farming is not the most beneficial use?" Mr. Hopper asked.

Controlling Water's Use
In places like Petersburg, there is much talk these days about what is unfolding near Abilene, to the north, as a possible barometer of the future. There, the wealthy investor Boone Pickens and his company, Mesa Water Inc., own farmland, and their plan is to pump the water from underground and sell it to other parts of the state. 
Over a lunch of cheeseburgers and tater tots smothered in chili and cheese, Craig Heinrich, 38, who grows cotton himself, was among the local farmers who said he just did not know what to think of the plan.
"If they're going to pump all that water out of the aquifer, it's going to have a real impact on farming," he said. "But if they start telling him what he can and can't do with his water, they'll be telling us next."
Telling people how to use their water, something many see as a natural right, is a sensitive issue. In Texas and most other Ogallala states, landowners still have the final say over how and how much of the water beneath their land they should use. 
But in Nebraska, local water districts have taken the authority to limit how much water can be used for crops. 
"As we restrict the water supply, the irrigators are more or less required to use the water as efficiently as they can," said Bob Hipple, general manager of a water district in Nebraska's southwest. There, to supplement rainfall, farmers may use just 14.5 inches of underground water per acre per year, down from 22 inches a year in 1980, when the limits were first imposed.
But such restrictions have for the most part been left to states to apply. The federal government has mostly limited its own efforts to promote conservation to making grants available to help farmers switch to more efficient irrigation.
For now, states like Texas seem comfortable with the idea that conservation will more or less take care of itself. 
Over the next 50 years, Texas' water board expects rising pumping costs to push some farmers out of business. That, it hopes, will free up increasing amounts of Ogallala water. To water managers like Mr. Hipple in Nebraska, though, such projections seem optimistic and and misplaced. 
"When I was in Vietnam," he said, "we used to kid about the idea that we might as well live fast, die young and leave a good-looking corpse. An area can let everyone pump all the water they want, or it can say, perhaps it is better to live slower, live to be older and look as good as you can along the way."

 The investment banker turned deputy mayor for economic development has long extolled the virtues of international sports competition, and the choice of New York to be one of two candidates for the 2012 Summer Games yesterday was one step toward that goal. More important than the competition, Mr. Doctoroff has said, is the lasting Olympic legacy of "more than a billion dollars worth of new and renovated parks and sports facilities in all five boroughs, as well as the revitalization of the East River waterfront and the Hudson Yards area on Manhattan's far West Side." 
 It would not even cost taxpayers very much, he said.
It sounded too good to be true to some critics. But he and the local committee, NYC2012, say they believe the city could reap as much as $11 billion from things like new construction jobs, restaurant meals and sales taxes on Olympics souvenirs. New subway lines and ferry terminals would have to be built to get tourists and contestants from a new Olympic Stadium on the West Side of Manhattan to an Olympic Village on the Queens waterfront, volleyball courts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and mountain bike trials and an equestrian complex in Staten Island.
He and others say that much of the cost would be covered by media revenues from Olympic events and millions of dollars in taxes from new residential and commercial development sparked by the stadium and subway on the West Side.
"The Olympics would reinforce New York's role as a premier international city," said Mitchell Moss, director of Urban Research Center at New York University. "It'll improve the recreational infrastructure for all New Yorkers and it's a terrific way to pump up our economy with much-needed public investments."
Not so fast, say some economists.
"The key to an economically successful Olympics," said Mark S. Rosentraub, dean of the College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, "is building no more than one major facility."
"They lost money in Japan and Korea when they built a scad of facilities, none of which got much use afterward," he said. "If the proposal is going to take more money than you'll receive in television broadcast rights, you've taken the first step toward an unprofitable Olympics from the public sector's perspective."
The NYC2012 committee has a capital budget of $896 million and estimates that 60 percent of the sports venues it needs are already built or under construction. They said the stadium, which would become home to the New York Jets, and the $1.5 billion Olympic Village, with 4,300 apartments, would be built largely through private financing. Some critics have argued that New York will actually have to spend $4 billion on construction.
By contrast, San Francisco's capital budget is only $220 million, because, that city says, 80 percent of the fields, arenas and stadiums already exist.
Mr. Rosentraub said that tourists would flock to either city for the Games, but that their economic impact would be relatively small because restaurants, hotels, museums and other attractions in New York and San Francisco operate at capacity when the economy is in good shape. "You just replace one group of tourists with another," he said.
Mr. Doctoroff's Olympic quest began in 1994, nearly eight years after he attended the World Cup semi-finals at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Almost single-handedly, he pulled together a bid for the 2008 Olympics and later the 2012 Games. Often, the most ardent skeptic was turned into a believer after a visit with the curly-haired Mr. Doctoroff, who picked up contributions from Merrill Lynch, AOL Time Warner, J. P. Morgan and many of the city's most powerful real estate tycoons. 
That enabled Mr. Doctoroff and the New York Olympic committee to raise and spend $11.5 million for work on the bid, more than double the amount spent by San Francisco.
In June, the city's Economic Development Corporation, which Mr. Doctoroff now oversees, signed $1.8 million in contracts to hire two teams of consultants to assess real estate revenues and urban design issues related to the development of the far West Side of Manhattan.
Still he faces opposition from community and civic groups, many of which favor the Olympics but oppose construction of a stadium over the rail yards on the West Side. These opponents say a stadium would worsen traffic congestion and destroy a working-class neighborhood. And some downtown landlords fear that the development effort will siphon off scarce state and city funds from the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan.
"The stadium is part of a much larger scam to tear down much of our neighborhood, making it impossible for normal people to live in New York City," said John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition, a civic group. "The impact of the stadium would ripple through much of Manhattan."
Mr. Doctoroff fends off the criticism, saying the Olympics would be good for everyone. 
Much could happen between now and the International Olympic Committee's final decision in 2005 -- and it is still true that that decision rests not only on Mr. Doctoroff's efforts. Yet people who have seen him evangelize say his persuasive salesmanship can go a long way. 
Douglas Durst, whose family owns 10 skyscrapers in Midtown, contributed $45,000 to the effort. He said, "Dan Doctoroff is a very focused and persuasive person, as evidenced by his ability to extract large sums of money from the real estate industry for an event that will not occur for another 10 years."

HEADLINE: New York's Olympic Bid 

 BODY:
Starting from somewhere deep in the back of the pack, New York City has made the cut to stay in the race to be host to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. The United States Olympic Committee announced yesterday that it had eliminated Houston and Washington from the competition. New York will now vie with San Francisco to become the American entry in the international competition to hold the Games. 
 With the potential of bringing billions of dollars to the host city's economy, the contest was and will continue to be hard fought. After the one American city is chosen in November, either New York or San Francisco will be thrust into more than two years of campaigning before the International Olympic Committee selects a winner in 2005. One erroneous news report this summer that New York had already been eliminated because it was overreaching with its proposal seemed an effort to psych out the city's bidders. 
 If not overreaching, its bid was arguably a stretch -- and that may turn out to be a strength rather than a weakness. New York no doubt won sentimental points, particularly as the anniversary of Sept. 11 draws near. But the city's size, diversity, transportation infrastructure and experience with security make it a natural contender anyway. And the bid stood on its own merits as audacious and daring, just the kind of qualities the Olympic Games reward.
The New York City plan calls for more than $4 billion in construction, including a $3.4 billion development of the area west of Midtown, now occupied by Hudson Yards, the largest chunk of undeveloped property in Manhattan. The result would be an Olympic stadium that could become a field for the New York Jets, an expanded Javits Center, a park and hundreds of new hotel rooms. A proposed extension of the No. 7 subway line would make it all accessible. But NYC2012, as the project to win the Olympics is called, envisions more, including a reborn waterfront and programs to encourage youngsters in schools to use the next decade to train for the home games.
To develop and promote the New York bid, some $13 million in private funding will be raised and spent, more than any of the three other candidates had budgeted. But that's chump change compared with the investment that would be required for a New York Olympics; billions of dollars will be needed to build the stadium, the subway extension and Javits expansion. While the developers say none of it will come out of the city or state operational budgets, any commitment of bonding capacity or future tax revenue could be dicey for local governments that are already reeling under heavy debt and shrinking revenues.
As people start taking the whole Olympics idea more seriously, controversy is going to heat up, too. Lower Manhattan boosters are going to look warily at any plan that seems to shift emphasis from development downtown to another part of Manhattan. Residents of Midtown and the West Side have not exactly been unanimously enthusiastic about the idea of a sports stadium in their backyards.
Still, with one hurdle out of the way, the prospect of a New York welcome for the world's greatest athletes is beginning to get exciting. After a long, difficult year, it's hard not to cheer about news that we're in the game.

HEADLINE: A Personality That Says Kennedy, In a Campaign by the Name of Cuomo 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
There are women whose last names are too famous to change when they marry, and others whose husbands have names too famous not to take. 
 And then there is Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, the seventh child of Robert F. Kennedy and wife of Andrew M. Cuomo, the son of a former governor who is now seeking that job for himself. 
 Ms. Kennedy Cuomo, who runs a human rights organization, uses both names when she campaigns for her husband, and the privilege and burden of each are lost on few.
"Are you apologizing?" cracked one elderly gentleman at an Upper East Side senior center after she introduced herself on a recent afternoon. 
"No, I am very proud," she replied, only slightly chagrined.
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo, 42, is more often met with something resembling adoring scrutiny, especially by older women, who seem to be searching for their own history in her face. 
Some of them proclaim that she is the image of her father, or that her pink suit resembles something her Aunt Jacqueline wore, or that they remember the day she and Mr. Cuomo were wed.
They listen patiently as she speaks on behalf of her husband, ticking off his accomplishments and making promises about lower drug costs while slipping in subtle comparisons between her husband and father. "Once again you have a young man running for office in New York," she recently told one group in Riverdale. 
It is almost jarring: she is a woman so unassuming that she sat in a Midtown Starbucks unrecognized for almost two hours last Friday and hid an event on her speaking schedule from a reporter so she "could practice first," according to her publicist. Yet she is also a woman who provides a living, moving memory of one of the nation's most painful periods as soon as she says who she is.
"You've got my vote, honey," said one woman to Ms. Kennedy Cuomo during a campaign stop. She was apparently unclear that Ms. Kennedy Cuomo was not the one running.
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo seems slightly exasperated by the suggestions that have been made since she married Andrew Cuomo in 1990 that theirs was the perfect political union. 
"When you are sitting there with your fella and he is buying you a glass of wine, you're thinking 'Wow, he's kind of cute,' not what his last name and what your last name is," she said.
And yet there is no escaping the political symmetry in the lives of Mr. Cuomo and his wife, who spent her childhood vacations on Indian reservations, once walked unnoticed through the most dangerous streets of Guatemala to ferret out children abused by the police, and who fell in love with Mr. Cuomo when he agreed to fast with her for three days to protest pesticide use on table grapes. 
She has devoted most of her adult life to human rights; he has been obsessed with homelessness and housing issues. Both families, while differing in their class backgrounds, are staunchly Roman Catholic and committed to public service under the umbrella of the Democratic Party.
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo has been a significant figure in Mr. Cuomo's campaign, partly by design, through her increased campaigning around the state. In part, she was thrust more into the campaign by Representative Charles E. Rangel, a supporter of H. Carl McCall, who is challenging her husband for the Democratic nomination for governor in the Sept. 10 primary.
Mr. Rangel, appearing on the New York cable channel NY1 last May, said of Ms. Kennedy Cuomo: "No one knows who she is. She is not like a Ted Kennedy or a Patrick Kennedy or one of the better-known Kennedys. These are professional politicians -- I'm talking about those who have stood for election. And they would know as Democrats that Carl McCall should be the candidate of the Democrats -- not their new in-law." Mr. Cuomo responded sharply at the time in defense of his wife and has since released a campaign ad decrying the McCall camp for taking potshots at his family.
Undaunted, Ms. Kennedy Cuomo, who has mastered the art of the gentle shoulder squeeze and the campaign tagline -- "The ancient Greeks say that the greatest gift the gods can give is a passion" -- is thought by many to be one of Mr. Cuomo's greatest assets on the campaign trail. Yesterday he took Ms. Kennedy Cuomo and their daughters -- 7-year-old twins, Mariah and Cara, and Michaela, who is 5 -- to the Mount Kisco, N.Y., Metro-North Railroad station near their home to greet commuters and pose for campaign photos.
"When they are together it is an extraordinary combination," said former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. "Usually she speaks first, and she has to be careful not to overshadow him. 
"When Charlie Rangel made the mistake of insulting her on television, it was stupid and crude and I think a little bit out of fear," Mr. Cuomo continued. "He tried to diminish her not because he believed what he was saying, but because he believed just the opposite."
A Kennedy name, an undeniable charm and the three small daughters all work to soften Andrew Cuomo's image, one that many voters have complained is too brash, and her lifetime of human rights work has made her at times as much a political activist as her husband.
Some wonder if she brings as much, if not more, to the political future of both families, as Andrew Cuomo does.
"Kerry is the one they have to watch out for," said William T. Cunningham, who has run many political campaigns, including that of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whom he now serves as director of communications. 
"There is something about that family that makes them formidable political candidates," Mr. Cunningham said. "She has spent more time in the state of New York than her father did before he was elected to the Senate. That is not a knock. It is a statement of fact."
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo said one of her strongest childhood memories was sitting around her family's table discussing what every child in the family wanted to be when they grew up. "I said I wanted to be an Indian," she said, laughing, inspired by family vacations on Indian reservations. 
"My father when I was a kid was so deeply involved with Native Americans," she explained, "he used to bring home these extraordinary headdresses and pipes." His advocacy for that group seems to have inspired her interest in human rights issues.
After her sophomore year at Brown University, Ms. Kennedy Cuomo began work for Amnesty International in 1981, tracking abuses of immigrants by immigration officials. After receiving her law degree from Boston College, she decided to expand the work of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, a nonprofit organization that honors human rights workers, by establishing the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights to help support those workers.
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo has spent much of the last two decades visiting troubled nations and the people who defend abused women, children and others. Her work culminated in "Speak Truth to Power," a glossy coffee-table book of photos and stories of human rights workers around the world, from the Dalai Lama to Bruce Harris, who works with children in Guatemala.
"She has been a tremendous help to us on many different levels," Mr. Harris said in a telephone interview. "I have been with her with President Clinton, and in the streets of -- some of the dirtiest underbelly of the streets -- of Guatemala City where a lot of police in Guatemala fear to tread.
"On another level, obviously, politically she is well connected," Mr. Harris said. "She put me in touch with members of Congress and got in touch with her uncle, who called the State Department when I was up for trial in Guatemala. She helps people like myself who do not have access to power in the United States."
On a recent Friday, in between campaigning, she met with Guillaume Ngefa Atondoko, a human rights campaigner in Congo, to discuss female genital mutilation in Africa.
It is somehow wholly unsurprising that Ms. Kennedy Cuomo and Mr. Cuomo's first date was a visit to a transitional housing project that Mr. Cuomo established.
It was 1988, and they had met a dinner party. Ms. Kennedy Cuomo told her husband-to-be that she wanted to see the shelter, but that she was leaving for Boston the next morning. So he picked her up at her sister's apartment at 7:30 a.m. on his Harley-Davidson and took her to East New York to tour the project on the way to the airport. 
A shuttle romance ensued, but Mr. Cuomo sealed the deal by agreeing to fast with Ms. Kennedy Cuomo. The labor leader Cesar Chavez had been fasting for weeks and was very ill, so others, including Ms. Kennedy Cuomo, agreed to take on his fasting for three-day stretches. 
"I thought, 'Well, he builds housing for the homeless and he fasts for Cesar Chavez,' " Ms. Kennedy Cuomo said. "I was really taken with the work he was doing; well look, he was very handsome, very charming, very funny and he's brilliant and terrific in so many ways. It was a traditional crush."
It would seem that Ms. Kennedy Cuomo is still uncommonly smitten. She often tells anecdotes about her husband's work with underprivileged children, and seems completely convinced that he will win the Democratic primary, dismal polls notwithstanding.
"It is so clear that Andrew is the superior candidate," she said at one point. "And it is so clear that he will make by far the greatest governor." She added later, emphatically: "I don't think he's going to lose," and went on to tick off statistics about the upstate economy. 
Ms. Kennedy Cuomo, who attacks Gov. George E. Pataki on the campaign trail more than her husband does, was there when Mr. Cuomo told a bus filled with reporters that Mr. Pataki had "held the coat" of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani after the terrorist attacks. She had eagerly chimed in. "It is reflective of his lack of leadership across the state," she said, to which Mr. Cuomo had added, "I think that's exactly right."
She has come to see the coat statement as a mistake. "I wish he hadn't said that comment about 9/11, because I think it was taken so out of context," she said. "I think it really hurt people. It was very, very painful." 
Mostly, though, she has been shocked at the perception, she said, that her husband can be brash and mouthy, and wishes that the campaign had gotten him in front of more diverse audiences so they could see him the way she does. 
With three small children and a human rights agenda to further, Ms. Kennedy Cuomo said that running for office herself is out, at least for now. "I've thought about it," she said, fingering a small bracelet made of shells. "My husband is in politics and my kids are already a campaign organ for him and I really love being their mother. Maybe in 10 years, 15 years, if the place was right and the time was right."
Mario Cuomo pauses when considering it. "That is an interesting question. That is an interesting question. I don't know."

HEADLINE: New York Announces Details Of Greater 9/11 Business Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
New York State and City gave details yesterday of their plans to increase aid to small businesses in Lower Manhattan that are suffering as a result of the terrorist attack last September.
 In the largest increase, small businesses that were in the World Trade Center or its immediate vicinity on the day of the attack are eligible for up to 25 days' worth of revenue losses, instead of up to 10 days' worth, as was previously the case. A $300,000 maximum for those businesses remains in place. 
 Lesser increases were announced for other sections of Lower Manhattan. Officials have said that businesses farther from the trade center were generally forced to close for shorter periods and thus their losses were smaller.
Nearly 8,800 businesses that have already received the maximum amount of money for which they were eligible under the former rules of the program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, may now ask for more. First-time applicants will be subject to the new rules.
The increase came after many small businesses in Lower Manhattan, and some of their advocates, complained that the grants were inadequate. The increase was reported to be in the works last week.
Yesterday, one advocate called the increases "a welcome step." Referring to the trade center site and its immediate neighborhood, the advocate, Kevin Curnin, said: "The increase within the restricted zone reflects that this is where small businesses have been the most underserved. We hope this is a signal of more changes to come." Mr. Curnin is a lawyer for From the Ground Up, a group of nearly 300 small businesses in Lower Manhattan.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the New York economic development agency, which is one of the primary administrators of the federally funded program, denied that criticism had led to the changes.
"We were dealing with an unprecedented situation," he said of the trade center's destruction and the ensuing effort to fashion a meaningful aid program.
Over all, the program -- which aids businesses with up to 500 employees -- has awarded $242 million out of its $481 million. The application deadline is Dec. 31; businesses that have received aid and reapplied will be notified if they are eligible for more.
The increase in maximum days to 25 from 10 is effective in the area bounded by Chambers and Rector Streets, Broadway and the Hudson River.
In the rest of the area south of Canal Street, the maximum days rise to seven from five, with awards capped at $150,000. Between Canal Street and Houston Street, the maximum number of days rises to five from three, with a $100,000 maximum grant, and between Houston and 14th Streets, the maximum rises to three days from two, with a top amount of $50,000.
More information may be obtained by calling (800) 456-8369 or (866) 227-0458.

HEADLINE: Plan for Alexander Statue Too Great for Many Greeks 

BYLINE:  By ANTHEE CARASSAVA 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Alexander the Great was a megalomaniac. But not even he, based on what is known of his life, wanted the side of a mountain carved to depict his face.
 Now, 2,400 years after the epic warrior's death, an American-based foundation is bent on doing just that, beginning in November. But its plan to have a 240-foot-high likeness of Alexander carved into a craggy Greek cliff -- four times the size of the presidents of Mount Rushmore -- has appalled Greek classicists and conservationists. 
 "This isn't just a monstrosity," said Isidoros Kakouris, a leading archaeologist here. "It's the quintessential example of what Greek tradition is not about: big." Even the Parthenon, he said, "the largest shrine completed in ancient times, was built just big enough to house a 40-foot statue in honor of the goddess Athena."
The scheme is the brainchild of the Chicago-based Alexander the Great Foundation. Its members include influential Greek-Americans, to whom politicians in Athens traditionally turn in times of trouble with the State Department. It says it has pledges for the full $45 million cost.
The local authorities want to go ahead with the project, anticipating economic benefits from tourism, but the national Culture Ministry adamantly opposes it. In April it decreed the project unsuitable for Greece, which has a tradition of building monuments in proportion to human scale and the environment.
The ministry's general secretary, Lina Medoni, warned last week that if the sponsors went ahead with the project at the 2,000-foot Mount Kerdyllion, in the northern Greek region of Macedonia near the birthplace of Alexander, it could be "forcefully blocked."
But the backers do not intend to give up. "Support is pouring from all corners of the world, even from as far east as Jordan," said Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek-American sculptor who conceived the idea six years ago.
"All I ask of the Greeks is to put me on the mountain," he said by phone from his Chicago home. "My pajamas are packed. I'm ready to start work."
The local authorities insist that they expect to have all permits in hand by next month, when a group of Greek-Americans championing the cause is to arrive here to tour the site. Their plan envisions other new facilities, including an open-air theater, museums and parking lots.
"We have assurances from ministers," said Angelos Frantzis, mayor of the sleepy seaside hamlet of Asprovalta, over which the stone portrait of Alexander would stare out to the Aegean Sea.
"We're open, though, to any suggestions and recommendation to ease opposition," Mr. Frantzis said. "But to pull the plug on the project -- that could cause more harm than the good."
Local environmental groups have threatened legal action to protect the pine-clad province from turning into a theme park.
Although it has clean beaches and classy resorts, northern Greece has borne the brunt of the country's decade-long decline in tourism, primarily because of the nearby Balkan wars.
Residents hope the project will bring back the tourists and revive the economy.
"Better yet," Mr. Franztis said, "the project will serve as the final stamp of authenticity for the Greekness of Alexander," who was born in Pella, then in the ancient kingdom of Macedonia but now part of Greece.
Archaeologists and politicians, including Haralmbos Bakirtzis, an authority on the Byzantine period, say such talk raises another potential problem: reviving tensions with the neighboring former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over who has a right to Alexander's legacy.
If the neighboring country should decide to start a similar project, he said, "where would that lead?"
James Rigas, president of the United Hellenic American Congress, which supports the porject, said the planners were not seeking to cause political mischief. "This project is all about Greece expanding its vistas," he said, "being more flexible in its outlook as a modernizing Western state and boosting tourism, its primary source of income.
"Sure this is a huge project, but nothing is too small for Greek tradition."

HEADLINE: Small Businesses After Sept. 11 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "$500 Million Left in 9/11 Aid, but Small Businesses Don't Ask" (news article, Aug. 26): 
 On March 19, I was joined by Speaker Gifford Miller in asking the state agencies responsible for distributing the federal relief aid for Lower Manhattan small businesses to speed through necessary assistance to those very small businesses most affected by the Sept. 11 attack. 
We proposed rent subsidies and the easing of program restrictions for mom and pop businesses, as well as a $50,000 per business grant for the few hundred underinsured retail subtenants and tenants of the World Trade Center buildings that remain shut down.
The program to reopen demolished businesses would cost less than $20 million. It was never financed.
I urge Gov. George E. Pataki to direct his agencies to provide these former World Trade Center tenants and other imperiled businesses in our area with this vital assistance immediately.

HEADLINE: 2 Labor Chiefs Laud McCall, But Don't Say 'Endorsement' 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Two powerful leaders of teachers' unions stood shoulder to shoulder with State Comptroller H. Carl McCall yesterday and urged the state government to spend more money on schools, but both stopped short of endorsing him in his quest to become governor.
 The willingness of the union leaders, Sandra Feldman and Randi Weingarten, to appear with Mr. McCall on the campaign trail seemed calculated to send a signal of support for his candidacy without actually tying the fate of union members to his. 
Andrew M. Cuomo, Mr. McCall's rival for the Democratic nomination, proposed yesterday that businesses get a large 10-year tax break for every job they create as a way to spur the flagging state economy. 
Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, was in Brooklyn to sign legislation requiring insurance companies to pay for infertility tests and therapies.
But education was the motif for the McCall campaign during an appearance at a public school in Midtown Manhattan, as Ms. Feldman, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, praised Mr. McCall effusively for his tenure as the president of the city Board of Education in the early 1990's.
Ms. Weingarten, who succeeded Ms. Feldman as the president of the city's United Federation of Teachers, said she supported Mr. McCall's call for changing the state financing formula for schools, shifting more money to urban school districts, as a Manhattan judge ordered last year. The ruling was overturned on appeal.
Ms. Weingarten said she had no plans to campaign with Mr. Cuomo. She said her union's members had yet to decide if they would advocate that the umbrella group of teachers in the state endorse Mr. Pataki in the general election over Mr. McCall, though another union official said that option had not been ruled out.
"After the primary, we will make a decision about whether to endorse and, if so, who to endorse," Ms. Weingarten said. "But this is something that is so important to both Sandy and myself; the equity of money for kids is so important that we're going to stand with anyone who says that they are in favor of helping kids and creating equity."
Mr. Pataki has used the power of his office to win the support of several influential unions, prying them away from the Democrats they have traditionally supported.
In January, he pushed through legislation providing $1.8 billion more in Medicaid grants to pay for raises for hospital workers. The bill was fervently sought by Dennis Rivera, a Democrat and the president of the state's largest union of health care workers. The union later endorsed the governor.
Mr. Pataki also took care of the New York City teachers in this year's budget when he included $200 million to pay for raises in a new teachers' contract. That move complicated talks among labor leaders when the 480,000-member New York State United Teachers, the umbrella group, met two weeks ago to discuss endorsements, participants in the talks said.
Even though Mr. McCall enjoys strong support among teachers statewide, the delegates decided to put off an endorsement decision until after the Democratic primary, union officials said.
One reason was that Ms. Weingarten made it clear at the meetings that she and her 140,000-member group were unwilling to back Mr. McCall before the primary, and the rest of the union delegates were wary of endorsing him until the city teachers took a position. Mr. Cuomo was never in the running, these officials said.
A similar phenomenon has taken place in the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., where no candidate has enough support to swing the endorsement. Even though the labor federation has a tradition of supporting Democrats, Mr. Pataki has helped gain passage of several labor laws that the unions want, including a ban on using state money to discourage union organizing.
Because of this, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. has also put off its decision on an endorsement until after the primary and may well end up endorsing Mr. Pataki, federation officials said.
"The governor has shown a willingness to work with the trade union movement and a understanding of the basic needs of the movement," said Denis M. Hughes, the president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
For the city teachers, the relationship with the governor has been a two-edged sword. He financed their raises, but also successfully fought a court ruling last year that would have forced the state to spend more on educating urban students.
Mr. Pataki has advocated streamlining school aid formulas, but has never reached an agreement with legislative leaders. His spokesman, Michael McKeon, said Mr. Pataki "has a stellar record" on education.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Baseball Commissioner And Consensus Builder

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The acting commissioner was seething. Taking a break from a baseball owners meeting that had taken an unexpected turn, Bud Selig walked down the hotel corridor gesturing as if he had a machine gun and was mowing down everything in sight.
 "I was not happy that day," Selig, now the commissioner, recalled the other day. "My language was bad. Let's say it was profane." 
 The subject of that meeting in September 1993 was Major League Baseball's proposed realignment into three divisions in each league, and the addition of a wild-card playoff team in each league. The plan encountered unexpected opposition, primarily from the managing partner of the Texas Rangers, who some years later would become president of the United States. 
Selig was irate because he had expected the vote on realignment to proceed smoothly. It was a unique moment. In Selig's 10 years as baseball's boss, that was the only time that he or anyone else could recall that he did not have the votes or know ahead of time what the vote would be.
Two days later Selig did have the votes, and three-division play and the wild card were born.
"It is amazing," John Harrington, the former chief executive of the Boston Red Sox, said of Selig's vote-getting ability. "It comes back to his persistence. There's a saying up on the wall in his office about persistence paying off. He wears on you. His persistence pays off."
With ultimate authority on the clubs' side, Selig is one of two men who will determine whether the players strike on Friday for the sixth time in three decades. The other is Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union. They are the leaders who will decide how far they are willing to go to reach a compromise on a new labor agreement and ensure that the rest of the season and the postseason will be played.
The players trust Fehr to make correct decisions for them because he has built on Marvin Miller's foundation and gained vast riches for them. The owners trust Selig to make the right decisions for them because he was one of them, knows their needs and serves as the consensus commissioner.
Peter Ueberroth, the commissioner from 1984 to 1989, did not talk to owners but told them what to do; Selig talks incessantly to owners and finds out what they want to do and sells them on what he thinks they should do.
Rob Manfred, the clubs' chief labor lawyer, has said more than once in recent weeks that Selig has the votes to approve a deal. Other officials have said that no bloc of owners exists that could block a deal.
That Selig's aides speak with such confidence is testimony to the way he operates.
"He is a master politician; he'd be at home in the U.S. Senate or the House of Parliament," Larry Lucchino, chief executive of the Boston Red Sox, said.
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner and a close friend of Selig's even though they often disagree on issues, said Selig works at building consensus. "He is constantly in touch with all of the people in the game," Wilpon said. "He is able to listen. He doesn't necessarily agree, but he's able to listen."

Lessons of Ownership
Selig, 68, traces his modus operandi to his baseball mentor, John Fetzer, who owned the Detroit Tigers when Selig came into baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970.
Only 35 at the time, Selig had been instrumental in bringing baseball back to his hometown. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin and serving two years in the armed forces, Selig went to work with his father in the automobile business. But when the Braves left Milwaukee after the 1965 season, Selig formed Teams Inc., and worked for four years before heading a group that bought the bankrupt Seattle Pilots and moved them to Milwaukee.
He recalled his first owners meeting, with Bowie Kuhn as a relatively new commissioner.
"Bowie puts me between Phil Wrigley and Gussie Busch," Selig recalled. "It was all about labor, and after two hours I wondered what I had gotten myself into. I remember riding back to Detroit with Mr. Fetzer, who was a very enlightened human being."
Fetzer, Selig said, "convinced me the best way to do things was to listen to everybody," adding: "Everybody needed to be heard, and if you're going to err, err on the side of trying to make people understand. I guess it just sort of evolved over a period of years. The names and faces change, but I've been able at least to get people to think about the problems and see what the solutions are."
Selig does not enjoy universal acclaim. The players and their union see him as public enemy No. 1, and he has suffered losses to them. He is the man who is blamed for canceling the World Series in 1994, even though it was the players who were on strike, and just last month he was seen as the man who ended the All-Star Game in a tie, even though it was the managers who created the impossible circumstance by using all the available pitchers.
And even though Selig has presided over the creation of the wild card, expanded the playoffs, instituted interleague play, increased revenue sharing among clubs and undertaken the consolidation of the league offices, his critics still ridicule him as Bud Lite.

An Ear for the Owners
When Selig retires -- his term as commissioner runs through 2006 -- the owners should give him not a gold watch but a gold telephone. He is famous for his telephone time, spending, by his estimate, seven or eight hours a day on the phone speaking with owners. 
"Selig is the best guy on the planet at returning phone calls," John Moores, the San Diego Padres' owner, said. "I've never known anyone to return calls as quickly as he does."
Explaining his penchant for listening, Selig said: "I thought early on in baseball there were a lot of owners who felt disenfranchised. They felt they weren't being heard. I don't know if they were right or not, but I'm very sensitive to that. It's their life, their money, their franchise. They have a right to be heard."
If there is any owner who does not feel he gets a full hearing from Selig, he has not talked about it publicly. But then no one dares to dissent because it would be futile. Selig, whom the owners rewarded with a three-year extension and a $5 million annual salary last November, has immense support in just about anything he wants to do.
"No one dares to question him," a former owner said, "because he has so much power."
Selig gains much of his support because of his efforts to enhance the game and improve the economic lot of the owners. His critics, perhaps not even a handful within baseball but many outside the game, say he has other ways of ensuring that owners are aligned with him. 
Peter Angelos is an example often cited. The owner of the Baltimore Orioles, Angelos opposed the owners' labor position during the last strike but is now a member of the negotiating team.
He has become a strong Selig ally, critics say, because he wants to do everything he can to dissuade Selig from allowing a team to move to the Washington area. Selig has taken advantage of that situation, they claim, to the extent that he has put Angelos at the bargaining table.
Selig and Angelos both deny that situation. "I've heard that many times," Selig said. "I have a great deal of affection and respect for Peter. I visited him and we talked. Did he or I talk about keeping a team out of Washington? We've never had that discussion."
Angelos said his position in 1994-95 was misunderstood. "I wasn't opposed to what the owners were doing," he said. "My disagreement was over the use of replacement players. I was also concerned with the termination of the Ripken streak."
The new Red Sox ownership is another strong Selig supporter. No wonder, Selig's critics say. He made sure John Henry and his group got the team when it was sold last winter.
"I know people have talked about the Boston ownership deal and the Mets deal," Selig said, referring also to Wilpon's recent purchase of Nelson Doubleday's 50 percent share of the Mets. "But so much of this is misunderstood. The owners of the Red Sox voted to sell to these people. But what commissioner wouldn't want each franchise in the best possible hands?"
Selig says he knows that people say he calls in chits when he needs to but responded: "That's just nonsense. Do I think there's any quid pro quo for that? No, I've never discussed any of that."

Not One to Give In
His critics have brought other charges, especially one about making decisions as commissioner that are in the best interests not of baseball but of the Brewers, who are now operated by his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb. He placed his share of the Brewers' ownership in trust when he officially became commissioner, a position he had said for six years that he did not want.
In fact, much of the time Selig was not expressing interest in the job, George W. Bush, then the managing partner of the Texas Rangers, was expressing interest and was only waiting for the nod from Selig. But the nod never came, and he ran for governor of Texas instead.
Selig's path to the position began when he and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox led a move to oust Fay Vincent in September 1992. Selig and Reinsdorf felt Vincent, who had been in office for three years, had become too chummy with the union; they did not want him around for the next round of negotiations.
For years, Vincent refrained from speaking out about baseball matters in general and Selig in particular, but he has recently become Selig's severest critic.
Speaking recently of Selig's long involvement in baseball's labor battles, Vincent said: "He can't give in. We had a tough time in '90 getting him to give in. He's psychologically incapable of giving in to Fehr and making a reasonable deal."
Selig was chairman of the owners' labor relations committee in 1990, when the owners locked the players out of spring training for the first month.
"In '90," Vincent recalled, "we had a vote in my office. People were saying should we do it. I said we can't win. This was just after collusion. Half the clubs were encouraging settlement. Bud couldn't make a decision. Bud had to walk around the block. He was in a terrible bind. He couldn't give in."
Selig is aware of the favoritism charges but strongly denies them.
*He became commissioner ignoring the obvious conflict he had as owner of the Brewers. "That's been the most painful part of the whole job," he said. "While I knew when I put my stock in trust there would always be the perception from some that there was an inherent conflict, I talked to every club about it at the time. I was really fastidious about it." 
*He went through the motions to realign the leagues just to get the Brewers into the National League. "We needed one team to move," he said. "I begged David Glass to move Kansas City because I worried about the conflict. David thought about it and turned it down. I was still agonizing over it when Larry Lucchino sent me a fax signed by 12 members of the committee beseeching me to do it." Lucchino labeled as "utter nonsense" the idea that Selig manipulated realignment. "He was in favor of a much broader realignment plan than was ultimately adopted," Lucchino said.
*He engineered contraction to eliminate the Minnesota Twins and open the upper Midwest for the Brewers. "The contraction process came from ownership," Selig said. "I knew contraction would be painful and bloody. But there was no question the owners wanted to contract." 
*The Brewers will benefit from the clubs' preferred method of distribution of revenue-sharing money. "I've heard people say that," Selig said. "Given the Brewers' current position, revenue sharing will benefit 15 or 16 clubs more than the Brewers. The thing that bothers me is on these perceived conflicts, people haven't taken the time to find out what the real story was. I say give me a real situation where you feel my past association with the Brewers is a conflict."
Perceived conflicts aside, Selig faces difficult decisions in the hours ahead. Another strike, another canceled World Series, could occur on his watch. The game's problems, which he is trying to solve, do not lie lightly on his shoulders. He has seen them grow for 32 years. No owner or official has been in baseball as long.
"I blame myself," he said. "This is as much a criticism of myself as anyone. We went many years without addressing any of our problems. What makes this all so difficult is we've come to a moment in history where we don't have that luxury anymore. The longer you don't solve your problems, the harder they become. They become more painful."

 The country's 1,400 United Way organizations raised an estimated total of $5 billion last year, an increase of 6.8 percent over the amount collected in 2000, the United Way of America said. Without the $501 million of contributions to the Sept. 11 Fund, which is jointly administered by the United Way of New York and the New York Community Trust, however, the total was $4.5 billion, a 4.2 percent decline over the previous year. Adjusted for inflation, giving to the annual workplace campaign fell 1.8 percent to $3.95 billion, or somewhat less than the 2.3 percent decline in philanthropic giving over all.

HEADLINE: Sony to Offer PlayStation Games Online 

BYLINE:  By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
The battle for dominance in the multibillion-dollar video game industry flared yesterday as Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that its PlayStation 2 game console, the market leader, can now play selected games over the Internet. Sony also kept an earlier promise that it would not charge a fee to play its popular games online.
 The Microsoft Corporation, which entered the highly competitive video game arena last November with its moderately successful Xbox console, says that it will start an online gaming service, Xbox Live, on Nov. 15. The service is expected to be fee-based and sold through retail outlets in a $49.95 kit, which is to include a headset and one-year subscription. 
 Nintendo, whose GameCube sales are generally comparable to Xbox's, has announced that it will offer at least one online game this fall that will require a $34.95 adapter to play.
"We have to take this step," Molly Smith, a Sony spokeswoman, said of PlayStation 2's expansion to the Internet. "We have to invest in the future of this platform."
Ms. Smith said using PlayStation 2 as a means for providing online entertainment in the home was always part of Sony's core vision. But changes in the Internet economy and the generally slow adoption rates of broadband connections in North America caused Sony to rethink its always-on, broadband-based strategy, she said.
As a result, PlayStation 2 requires a network adapter that can be used with any Internet service provider, either broadband, like cable and D.S.L., or narrow-band dial-up.
The adapter, which went on sale yesterday, costs $39.99. Sony says it plans to ship 500,000 of the adapters to North America by the end of its fiscal year in March. Sony says five games are available for online play. One, Twisted Metal Black, is being offered free with a coupon included with the adapter.
Playing video games over the Internet has been popular for years among gaming enthusiasts who mostly use their personal computers to engage in vivid role-playing and shooter games with opponents as close as the same room or nations away. But the process of setting up games and playing them often proves confusing and cumbersome for more general players, game console makers say.
PlayStation 2, Ms. Smith said, has greatly simplified online gaming by permitting players to use their existing Internet service providers as well as use either broadband or narrow-band connections.
Xbox Live is being planned as an exclusively broadband service, a decision that may reduce its potential market. But the Xbox console is sold fully equipped for online play, without need for an adapter.
This is not the first time Sony appears to have outmaneuvered Microsoft to better position PlayStation 2, which has sold 33 million consoles compared with the 3.9 million consoles Microsoft reported in June. In May, Sony cut its price on PlayStation 2 in North America to $199 from $299 -- a day before Microsoft made a similar cut in its pricing of Xbox.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Forecasts Shift From Surplus To Big Deficits 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office predicted today that the federal government would run big budget deficits through 2005, and those estimates do not include the impact of President Bush's proposals for higher military spending and his ideas for additional tax cuts.
 The bipartisan office also estimated that tax revenues this year are about $131 billion, or 6.6 percent, lower than last year, the biggest one-year drop in nearly half a century. 
 The forecast is considerably more pessimistic than what the Bush administration has predicted, and it virtually wipes out the trillion-dollar surpluses that the White House and the Congress had foreseen over the next decade.
The new estimates point to a sharp reversal in the government's fiscal position, which shifted from a sizeable overall surplus last year to an even bigger overall deficit this year. 
They were immediately seized as fodder by Democrats and Republicans alike in the battle over extending the tax cuts that Mr. Bush pushed through Congress last year.
Democrats said Mr. Bush's tax cuts were the main culprit behind the abrupt lurch into the red, and they used today's report to attack the president's plan to make those tax cuts permanent.
"The president is taking us down the path of soaring budget deficits, and he wants to dig the hole even deeper," said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
But White House officials and Congressional Republicans argued that the new deficits merely reflected the recent economic slowdown, the price of the war in Afghanistan and the costs of beefing up domestic security against terrorism.
Dan L. Crippen, the director of the budget office, said the recession and the plunging stock markets appeared to have played a bigger role than the tax cuts in reducing tax revenues.
But Mr. Crippen also said that the magnitude of the drop remained somewhat of a mystery. Tax revenues have declined faster than the economy itself, and nobody knows why. 
Much of it may stem from huge stock-market losses, but it may also reflect deeper changes in tax-paying behavior that endure beyond today's bear market.
By law, the Congressional Budget Office cannot base its estimates on proposals by the White House or Congress. It assumes that the tax laws remain unchanged and that spending continues on the same trend over the next 10 years.
Inevitably, the forecasts diverge with reality as both the laws and the nation's economy evolve.
Perhaps the most striking trend in the latest forecast is the long string of deficits that would occur under almost any situation.
When excluding the "off-budget" surpluses accumulating in the Social Security trust funds, which are supposed to be reserved for the baby-boom generation's retirement, the new forecast estimates that the deficit will stretch until 2010 and be followed by small surpluses in the next two years.
But even those modest surpluses assume that Mr. Bush's tax cuts last year expire in 2010, as scheduled. The president is pushing hard for Congress to make them permanent.
If he is successful, then tax revenues would decline by an additional $350 billion in 2011 and 2012 and even the modest non-Social Security budget surpluses in 2011 and 2012 would evaporate.
The other element not included in today's forecast are Mr. Bush's ideas for some incremental tax cuts next year as well as large additional spending increases for the military and domestic security.
Republican analysts on the Senate Budget Committee said the combined impact of those changes would increase next year's total budget deficit to $180 billion.
All of that adds up to considerably higher deficits over the next several years than the White House Office of Management and Budget predicted in July. At that time, the administration said the total deficit would shrink to $71 billion next year and disappear in 2004.
In a historical perspective, the bickering about deficits over the next year or two is probably less important than the much longer-term outlook. Even the pessimistic plans envision a federal deficit that would be less than 2 percent of the American gross domestic product and would decline over the next few years.

HEADLINE: Windmills On Their Minds; 
Battle Lines Drawn Over a Source of Power That Some Say Obstructs a Gorgeous View

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: CHERRY VALLEY, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A small but vocal band of preservationists is tilting at windmills here in this town of 1,270. 
 High-tech, 400-foot-tall wind towers, to be precise. The kind with 100-foot-high blades that cost $1 million apiece. With the encouragement of New York State, an entrepreneur wants to put as many as 27 windmills on a 1,900-foot-high ridge that is visible for miles. 
 Environmentalists might be expected to celebrate the scheme. If constructed, the Cherry Valley turbines could produce pollution-free, wind-generated electricity that, its proponents say, would help relieve power shortages and foster energy independence from Arab oil. 
And this cash-starved town should be jubilant at the arrival of a new industry. On Aug. 20, Gov. George E. Pataki announced that the Cherry Valley project would receive $2.5 million in state start-up funds, as part of a $17 million grant to develop 315 megawatts of electrical power at five wind farms in upstate New York. 
"Clean energy technologies like wind farms will help New York State and the nation accommodate the growing demand for electricity," the governor said, "in an environmentally responsible manner that avoids air pollution." 
But the windmills are hardly welcome everywhere in Cherry Valley. "This is green power on the surface, but when you scratch it, it's black underneath," said Roberta O'Neill Kieler, a Cherry Valley resident.
The newest manifestation of Nimby, or not in my backyard, requires a different acronym: not in my viewshed. Wind-farm opponents contend that, like a watershed, a viewshed, or public view, is the common property of those who share it, and must not be degraded unilaterally by any one property owner. 
The Cherry Valley windmills would be visible for miles in several local communities, and near Cooperstown from the Hyde Bay section of Otsego Lake, the model for the Glimmerglass of the James Fenimore Cooper novels.
Henry Cooper, a great-great-grandson of the writer, is president of Otsego 2000, a planning and historic preservation organization in Cooperstown next door.
"James Fenimore Cooper developed his strong feeling toward nature in this very landscape, at this very lake," he said. "This landscape is a historic source of modern American views of conservation and the environment. It would be ironic if a place that is deeply associated with our whole view of nature is now to be overrun."
Windmills have been tilted at before. A proposal to place a wind farm in the middle of Nantucket Sound has raised the ire of Cape Cod homeowners, yachting groups and fishermen. And a proposal to put wind turbines near Montauk Point on Long Island was halted after residents claimed that they would spoil the view.
In the Cherry Valley area, environmentalists have had to do much soul-searching in opposing the towers. "I am absolutely committed to wind power," said Paula DiPerna, a board member of Otsego 2000. But Ms. DiPerna, who worked for the environmentalist Jacques-Yves Cousteau for 18 years, paraphrased her onetime boss when she said, "Do we want to live in a world where everything is spoiled just a little bit?" 
Robert Loucks, the Cherry Valley town supervisor, is thinking of the money the wind turbines would bring. "We all use electric power, but a lot of people don't want it produced in their neighborhood," he said. "It is a selfish view to say that 'I support wind power if I don't have to look at where it comes from.' " 
A wind-prospecting company, Global Winds Harvest, has signed contracts with Cherry Valley landowners on a ridge called Cape Wykoff. The company hopes to build up to 27 wind towers producing as much as 40.5 megawatts, generating enough electricity for 13,500 households. The total cost would be $30 million to $35 million, including the construction of a power substation. 
Global Winds Harvest is a three-year-old American offshoot of a German wind-power firm that has installed about 300 towers in Europe. The company is involved in 10 other United States projects, none of which are up and running yet.
Jeff M. Peterson, program manager of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority in Albany, said that New York's wind-power push began three years ago, when the state set about "trying to develop a competitive utility marketplace, while trying to encourage companies to develop renewable energy resources."
Last year, Governor Pataki signed an executive order that set a goal for the state to supply 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2005. 
Since 1999, Mr. Peterson's agency has provided $596,203 in seed money to six companies that are prospecting for wind sites, and an additional $7 million to build two wind farms. Generally, wind prospectors sell the completed project to power companies and other operators, then move on.
Green power has already come to the town of Madison, site of the first wind farm in the state, which is 48 miles west of Cherry Valley. The seven wind towers there generate 11.5 megawatts of electricity. Another 23 turbines are in Fenner, 18 miles northwest of Madison, generating 30 megawatts in the largest wind farm on the East Coast. 
Under New York State law, wind and solar power qualify for a tax exemption to encourage new development, so wind prospectors negotiate in-lieu payments to local boards. The company initially offered Cherry Valley $2,500 for each of the 50 turbines it originally hoped to build. (Each landowner was also offered $2,500 per tower.)
Since the project has been scaled down from 50 to 27 or fewer, "the amount is still being negotiated," said Erich Bachmeyer, project manager for Global Winds Harvest. 
Mr. Loucks said that the greatest benefit of the money would be to improve the town's 45 miles of road, 35 miles of which are unpaved. 
"As supervisor, I have to come up with new tax ideas," Mr. Loucks said.
Though wind power would not bring the town many jobs, several people would be paid to maintain the towers, Mr. Bachmeyer said. Regionally, the economic situation is grim and census statistics place Otsego County among the 10 poorest in New York. "I get calls from farmers who want to know if they can site wind turbines on their land," Mr. Peterson said. "That income could mean survival." 
Supporters trumpet the fact that the wind towers create no air, water or heat and therefore do not contribute to global climate change. The green-power mantra is that one megawatt of electricity generated from wind saves 5 pounds of sulfur dioxide, 2 pounds of nitrogen oxide and 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions from equivalent fossil fuel plants. 
Despite such green credentials, opposition to the towers is growing in Cherry Valley. "The whole thing seems to be about the bottom line, making money for a private sector company," said Mrs. Kieler, a director of Advocates for Cherry Valley, a group of 130 windmill opponents. Her farmhouse would overlook the wind towers that she opposes. 
Most residents said they knew nothing about the wind towers until last spring, when the process was fairly advanced. "There is no sharing of information," Mrs. Kieler said, "and they are being very elusive.
"Why should we give our commodity -- wind -- to the first low-ball bid we receive?" 
Mr. Loucks said that Global Winds Harvest presented its plans publicly at town board meetings for more than a year, and Mr. Bachmeyer of Global Winds said, "We never hid anything." 
Some preservationists, including Ms. DiPerna, the board member of Otsego 2000, are disturbed that "the beautiful idea of green energy all comes down to paying the lowest price to the least stringent community to make a profit for private developers." 
To which Larry Thompson, proprietor for the last 30 years of Larry's Barber Shop, said: "America was built on entrepreneurship and capitalism. I think there is plenty of room for another business to come into Cherry Valley." 
Adding much confusion to the debate, many residents said they believe that the power from the windmills would flow directly to Cherry Valley. But the electricity will go into the grid of the New York State power pool. It would be too expensive to put up a separate network of new power lines to Cherry Valley homes just to deliver wind-power electrons to their homes, Mr. Bachmeyer said. 
Opponents say the windmills make too much noise, can fling ice in winter and are dangerous to migrating birds. Supporters say these complaints are exaggerated. 
But though the opponents also reject the towers' required nighttime airplane warning strobes and red lights, the primary objection is the daytime visual impact of the 27 windmills.
"The 19th-century landscape we value would become an industrialized landscape," Ms. DiPerna said. 
Mr. Bachmeyer countered, "A lot of people say the towers are beautiful, they look like works of art."
He added, "Right now there are radio towers and cell towers on the hills around Cherry Valley, and I think those are uglier." 
Andy Minnig, a retired schoolteacher whose property faces an alternative Cherry Valley wind-turbine site, acknowledged that the towers "may be sculptural in small groups."
But, he added, "Once the towers dominate the features of the landscape, they are objectionable."
And opponents worry that future residents may be stuck with the towers forever, since they question the fundamental economics of wind power. According to energy analysts, electricity generated from wind power costs 1 to 2 cents per kilowatt hour more than the wholesale average cost of 3.5 cents from fossil fuels. Wind-power advocates are hoping to create "green energy" initiatives where environmentally minded consumers can pay slightly more on their utility bills for the privilege of using wind-generated electrons in their toaster ovens. 
Mr. Bachmeyer said the towers should recoup their investment during 20 years of operation. 
But opponents say the entrepreneurs do not have to post any bond for the wind towers' removal. So, Mrs. Kieler said, "We worry that we could be left with a hill of rusting hulks."
Mr. Bachmeyer said that even in case of a bankruptcy, the towers' electricity would have value and they would continue operating. Furthermore, he said the cost of wind-power electricity "is much cheaper than conventional energy when you consider its health costs, the costs of environmental degradation and climate change, and the military cost of protecting offshore power resources."
There is an urgency on the part of wind prospectors to get projects up and running, because a government subsidy -- a 1.8-cent-per-kilowatt-hour production tax credit that helps makes wind-tower operation profitable -- expires at the end of 2003. 
Yet at the same time, Cherry Valley opponents are pressing for a moratorium. If they fail, the next step would likely be a public hearing in mid-September, to be followed by a vote, and conceivably a robust round of lawsuits. 
Meanwhile, the resident-vs.-outsider debate in Cherry Valley has been intensifying. "Most of the people who live in our town year-round aren't against it," Mr. Loucks said, adding that a lot of the tower opponents live in New York City. 
One of them, Patrick Shearer, a 76-year-old retired manager for the ABC television network who lives in Manhattan, bought 65 acres on a Cherry Valley hilltop a decade ago. "I think the towers would make my property worthless," he said.
He sighed. "To see these giant towers near your house -- it would be like driving through oil derricks to get to your front door."

HEADLINE: Planned Bill Would Spur U.S. Sale of Diesel Cars 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Representative John D. Dingell plans to introduce a bill that would encourage the sale of diesel cars in the United States, a prospect strongly supported by the auto industry but opposed by environmental groups. 
 Industry executives have said in recent years that modern diesel engines are far less dirty and noisy than those of the 1970's and offer a relatively easy way to improve fuel economy and reduce global-warming emissions. 
 That argument has carried weight in Europe, where about one-third of light-duty vehicles sold each year are powered by diesel engines. But regulations in the United States have restricted diesel engines -- they are in fewer than 1 percent of new light-duty vehicles -- and Volkswagen is the only company selling diesel passenger cars here. 
Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors, said at an auto industry conference last month, "We should get diesels in the mix because it's one way we could get 10 to 15 percent fuel economy improvement while keeping the size mix that we have."
Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who recently won a rare and hard-fought Democratic primary election, is the longest-serving member of the House and a staunch ally of the Big Three automakers. His spokeswoman on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Laura Sheehan, said that the bill was still being drafted but that "the goal of the legislation would be to enable this technology to have widespread clean-diesel usage."
She said it would involve tax credits for oil companies that produced diesel fuel with low sulfur content and possibly some incentives for the auto industry. The industry has previously lobbied for tax credits for consumers who buy cars with advanced diesel engines. Mr. Dingell's plan was reported today in The Detroit News. 
Diesels can be a third more fuel-efficient than a comparable gasoline-powered car. They can also cut emissions of carbon dioxide, linked by some scientists to global climate change, because such emissions are tied to fuel economy. Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Tech Forum, a trade group that includes G.M. and diesel engine makers, said: "We have concerns about fuel economy and carbon dioxide. Diesel can provide ready-made solutions for both of those."
But diesel engines also have much higher emissions of particulates, or soot -- which can worsen asthma, according to some studies, and lead to cancer. They also emit more nitrogen oxide, a contributor to smog.
A new set of regulations related to the Clean Air Act will restrict these emissions, but even the new rules will allow diesel engines to emit more than twice the quantity of particulates of a gasoline-powered engine. The biggest challenge for the industry, though, will be developing a way to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide.
Environmental groups in this country oppose the wider use of diesel-powered vehicles. One prominent group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, is preparing a report expressing skepticism about improvements made in diesel technology. The report also contends that diesels emit 40 chemical compounds that lead to various cancers, birth defects and other health problems. 
"We remain to be convinced," said Michelle Robinson, a senior advocate with the group, adding, "In terms of cancer risk and immune-system disorders, diesel is far and away more problematic than gasoline exhaust."
European standards are not so strict on emissions from diesel engines, and environmentalists in Europe have not been as strongly opposed.
"Our colleagues in Europe have not been as concerned with smog-forming pollutants," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club. 
"They are just as concerned as we are about global warming, but they are willing to make trade-offs we are not willing to make."
And not all automakers seem eager to push to bring the technology here. 
"We do get customers at our dealerships asking for hybrids, we don't get customers asking for diesels," said Ben Knight, vice president for automotive engineering at Honda R&D Americas, referring to cars with hybrid engines that combine gasoline and electric power. "They are intrigued by the superclean, superefficient gasoline hybrid with a fuel that's available."
Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club added that hybrid cars offered a technology that could also provide greater fuel efficiency without increased particulate or nitrogen oxide emissions.
Diesel also has a high sulfur content, and regulations in Europe and the United States will require that to be reduced later in the decade, a move supported by the industry.
"Sulfur does nothing good for fuel," said Greg Dana, vice president for environmental affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group. "It's simply a poison to catalysts and all the advanced control technologies in cars."

U.S. Trade Panel Rejects New Tariffs on Foreign Steel
A federal trade panel has rejected pleas by the steel industry to impose new tariffs on imports of cold-rolled steel. In a 4-to-1 vote, the International Trade Commission ruled that American producers were not being injured by imports from five countries.
 The ruling is a setback for integrated steel companies because it suggested that the producers were exhausting the government's patience in seeking ever-higher levels of protection against foreign competition. Page A1.

HEADLINE: New York City Makes a Cut In Olympic Bid 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
New York and San Francisco advanced today in their quests to play host to the 2012 Summer Olympics, winning selection as the United States' finalists in an international competition that will end in three years.
 The United States Olympic Committee's bid evaluation task force eliminated Houston and a joint Baltimore-Washington bid from consideration. On Nov. 3, the U.S.O.C. will choose one of the two finalists to compete against an all-star group of foreign cities vying for the International Olympic Committee's final designation in 2005. 
 "Washington and Houston did not fall down," said Charles H. Moore, the chairman of the task force and a gold medal hurdler in the 1952 Summer Olympics. "It was a question of riches from all four cities. It wasn't a unanimous vote, but it was a clear consensus." 
Upon hearing the choices, the leaders of New York's bid, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, and Jay Kriegel, the executive director of NYC2012, sighed and shook hands without saying a word.
Mr. Doctoroff began his long-shot campaign to bring the Olympics to New York in 1994, almost single-handedly putting together a bid for the 2008 Olympics, and following that, for 2012, which he continued last year despite the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and fiscal problems that have mounted with the economic downturn. He stepped down last December as president of NYC2012 to become deputy mayor for economic development in the Bloomberg administration.
Mr. Doctoroff remained so closely identified with the effort that some critics referred to him as the deputy mayor for the Olympics, worrying that the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan and other economic development projects would lose out to his obsession. Mr. Doctoroff has maintained that New York can redevelop the West Side and downtown at the same time. Yesterday, however, the Olympics were front and center.
"The I.O.C. wants to build the Olympic brand and demonstrate the importance of the Olympics in the contemporary world," Mr. Doctoroff said. "Coming to New York would let them do that in multiple ways."
Mr. Moore and other task force members refused to explain in detail why New York and San Francisco emerged from a field of 75 in a process that began in 1997. Generally, Mr. Moore said New York's infrastructure and security plans impressed the panel, and San Francisco's international strategies and environmental plans were important considerations.
In a statement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, "Bringing the Olympic Games to the 'World's Second Home' would celebrate our unequaled diversity and participants from every nation would feel welcome."
When asked about New York's rival, Mr. Bloomberg said, "San Francisco is a very nice small town."
The biggest things that New York needs to build, according to the bid, are a $1.5 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan; an extension of the No. 7 subway line at a cost of at least $1.5 billion; and the construction of 4,300 apartments in an Olympic Village at the Queens West project on the East River plus a number of smaller sites like a velodrome, a whitewater canoeing course and areas for equestrian sports, archery and beach volleyball.
The biggest construction projects for the San Francisco bid include a renovation of Stanford Stadium and an Olympic Village, as well as a velodrome. An extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system is also planned.
Even the best-laid plans of either New York or San Francisco could be undone by a location lottery in which the International Olympic Committee has tried to rotate the continent and location of the games every four years. Vancouver, British Columbia, for instance, is vying with Bern, Switzerland, and South Korea to be selected as host of the 2010 Winter Games, a decision that could work against New York and San Francisco. South Korea has little chance of winning because the 2008 Olympics are headed for Beijing.
"There are decisions being made that could determine New York's fate in 2012, without New York being part of those decisions," said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp, a marketing firm in Chicago.
"If the Winter Olympics go to Vancouver in 2010, it's unlikely that the Summer Games will come back to North America in 2012."
The task force started meeting this morning at the O'Hare Hilton, where for the first time it compared the cities based on the scores they were given during recent visits by members of the group. 
However, the scores, assessed on a 1 to 10 basis, in 14 categories, were not enough for two finalists to clearly emerge. Some of the scores from the 10 task force members displayed a preference for Washington and Houston.
But Mr. Moore said before the meeting that he expected the decision would come down to the cities' international appeal and how each would market its global allure. 
"Charlie said the international reputation would be a major factor," Mr. Kriegel said. "We anticipated that the technical foundation of our bid would be the central factor" -- which refers to the facilities, infrastructure and financial plans -- "but we worked to prove that New York had a strong international story to tell."
Anne Cribbs, the chief executive of San Francisco 2012, agreed that New York and San Francisco started with built-in advantages, as major cities that are meccas for international travelers.
"It's an easy thing to say that people love to visit San Francisco," Ms. Cribbs said. "But there's something mystical about the air, the cable cars, the bridges, but also the marriage of San Francisco and Silicon Valley. And there is the weather, the weather and the weather."
Mr. Moore said New York received no explicit consideration for the impact of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center. "Was anyone not sensitive to 9/11?" he said. "No. But it wasn't part of the process."
Now, New York and San Francisco must wait for the U.S.O.C.'s vote in Colorado Springs on Nov. 3 to learn which city will face an international field that might include Moscow, Paris, Toronto, Rio de Janeiro, London, Milan, Istanbul, Madrid and Tel Aviv. Those cities will begin declaring their intentions more clearly after the I.O.C. chooses a 2010 Winter Olympics site next July.

HEADLINE: Frankfurt Ballet Director Says He'll Leave in 2004 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
William Forsythe, the American choreographer who has led the Frankfurt Ballet since 1984, announced this week that he would leave the company when his contract expired in 2004.
 Mr. Forsythe, 52, who has turned the Frankfurt Ballet into one of the most admired experimental dance companies in Europe, had been seeking guarantees of his artistic freedom from the city government in Frankfurt, which largely finances the troupe. He avoided pointing an accusatory finger at the municipal officials in announcing his decision. 
 "Simply said, I wish to pursue a more independent organizational path," he said in a statement late Tuesday. "I must admit, however, it is difficult to leave a body of work, my life's work, behind."
Mr. Forsythe, a Joffrey Ballet School graduate, indicated through a company spokeswoman today that he would not elaborate for the moment. "It's too early to speak of his future plans," the spokeswoman said. "He doesn't want to talk about it right now. But he wants to change, not to work in these kinds of organizations."
One implication is that Mr. Forsythe might prefer to work as a freelance choreographer or with small groups of dancers rather than to create a new company. In recent years his works have been frequently performed by major dance companies, including the New York City Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London.
The possibility that Mr. Forsythe might leave Frankfurt was first raised in late May, when he said he had learned privately that the city government had decided not to renew his contract and might replace the company with a classical ballet troupe. He also complained then that there had been "a smear campaign against me carried out insidiously by anonymous politicians saying I was burned out."
A few days later, after a meeting with the mayor of Frankfurt, Petra Roth, Mr. Forsythe said he had been assured that the city wanted the company to continue its work after 2004. He acknowledged, however, that the city government was experiencing a severe financial crisis. The city's $5.7 million annual subsidy represents 87 percent of the Frankfurt Ballet's budget.
The two sides then met to discuss whether satisfactory working conditions for the company could be assured beyond 2004. After Mr. Forsythe returned from vacation earlier this month, he had one further meeting with Hans-Bernhard Nordhoff, the director of the cultural department of Frankfurt, before deciding to leave the company. Mr. Nordhoff said on Tuesday that he regretted Mr. Forsythe's decision but would respect it.
In his statement Mr. Forsythe thanked Frankfurt for its "unwavering and generous support" over the last 18 years, adding that its commitment "has enabled the evolution of my thought-work to a degree which would have been difficult or even impossible to realize in a majority of metropolitan cultures in the world."
In explaining his decision, though, he opted for vague language to suggest that he found it impossible to run a dance company that was subject to the vagaries of politics.
"For the present," he said, "I feel strongly that my own methodological evolution would be best served if conducted in a context less integrated into a field of political practice that is, understandably, challenged by the task of establishing primary descriptive models of cultural policy that can be accurately represented by numbers."
He continued: "It is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to objectively translate or reduce intrinsic, multiple values as are typically embedded in art, into interest-maximizing numbers that explicate its relevance in political models of cultural well-being."
Mr. Forsythe's reference to numbers is puzzling because attendance for the Frankfurt Ballet is 96 percent of capacity in Frankfurt, and it invariably performs before full houses on its frequent tours around Europe.
In his statement he also implied that managing a dance company was limiting his artistic freedom. "Over the course of the last several years I have experienced a shift in my perception of the field in which I am operating," he said. "This has engendered a very specific professional intention which lacks adequate identity with my current position as director of a large municipal institution."
Neither Mr. Forsythe nor Frankfurt officials have indicated whether the troupe's 67 dancers and staff members will survive his departure. Mr. Forsythe, who also has a home in Vermont, has two more seasons left in Frankfurt. On Sept. 11 he will present a still unnamed new work there. Later that month he is scheduled to take his company to Paris, where he has a strong following.

HEADLINE: When the Cellphone Is the Home Phone 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
WHEN my wife and I moved recently from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to a larger apartment in Harlem, it was a short hop on the map. Technologically, however, it was a journey to the heart of the current turmoil in the telecommunications industry.
 Of all the troubles associated with a move, we expected phone service to be the least of them: a routine order for a telephone line and two jacks. But when I called Verizon Communications, our local phone company, I was told that it would take a week and a half to fulfill the request, at a cost of $250. 
 Other companies now offer local phone service, but they would need to have authorization from Verizon to make a connection to our apartment. So faced with unanticipated cost and delay, we took a step that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: we decided to abandon conventional phone service altogether -- and we are not alone. 
In what may be the start of an alarming trend for the nation's largest telephone companies, the total number of business and residential telephone lines declined last year for the first time since the Depression -- to 192.3 million at year's end from 192.6 million a year earlier, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
Those who follow the industry attribute the land-line decline in small part to the general economic doldrums, while some consumers have dropped second lines as they switched to cable modem or D.S.L. for Internet access. But tellingly, a small but growing number of consumers, many of them students or recent college graduates, have abandoned land-line telephones altogether in favor of wireless service. Nearly 3 percent of telephone users have made wireless phones their primary telephone, according to the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company in Boston. So far the shift is evolutionary rather than revolutionary, but that is likely to change, said Keith Mallinson, an analyst at the Yankee Group.
"It is more like gradual displacement than a complete eclipse," Mr. Mallinson said. "But the disruptive effect of substituting land lines is likely to become more far-reaching during the next few years."
Joel Kamm, a graphic designer in Waltham, Mass., uses a cable modem for his Internet connection and depends on a cellphone for the rest of his communication.
"I moved around so much in recent years, so getting a new phone line installed in each place was a hassle," said Mr. Kamm, 28, who gave up his conventional phone line two years ago. "This is the right solution for anyone that moves frequently."
One cellular company, Leap Wireless of San Diego, is at the forefront of this trend. Its Cricket service allows unlimited incoming and outgoing local wireless calls. Leap said last month that its customer research showed that a quarter of the 1.4 million Cricket subscribers did not have traditional phone lines at home.
Jennifer LeHockey, a 24-year-old Cricket customer in Westminster, Colo., said she had canceled her land line the day she got wireless service, cutting her monthly phone bills from about $90 to less than $50.
"I was just sick and tired of forking over so much money every month to Qwest," said Ms. LeHockey, a hair stylist. "As a single person, just having a cellphone was right for me."
Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, said the decline in the number of land lines was no surprise. "The old telephone company measure of access lines is less accurate today as a measure of a company's health," Mr. Rabe said. Large local phone companies like Verizon are seeking to compensate for the decline in conventional phone lines by investing in the wireless and Internet access businesses, he said.
Still, the decline may be evidence of a fundamental change in the telecommunications landscape.
"It's a behavioral shift from the last hundred years in which we called a geographical place and got a person," said Jeff Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. "We're now moving to a model of calling a person -- regardless of geography. The consequences of such a change could be profound."
In my own case, there was confusion over the location of our apartment (vacant for several years before it was renovated, it had disappeared from Verizon's records) and a misunderstanding about how long it would take the company's technicians to install the line and jacks that my wife and I urgently needed, since we both work from home some of the time.
Both issues were later cleared up (a Verizon spokesman said the company would have listed our apartment in its computer system if we had ordered service; he also said the installation would most likely have taken three days, the average in Manhattan). But my wife and I could not afford to wait before settling our telephone service arrangements.
We decided to use our two wireless phones from Sprint for local and domestic long-distance calling. Time Warner Cable installed a high-speed Internet connection in two days. We make international calls using an Internet service, Net2Phone, whose rates are cheaper than what Verizon charged in our previous service plan. All told, we figure we're saving about $50 a month by not having a local telephone line, on top of the installation charge.
Relying on cellphones for voice communications has quirks both good and bad. My wife has her voice mail available on her cellphone instead of an answering machine or a voice mail system tethered to a land line at home. She no longer goes straight for the answering machine upon arriving home.
The divisions between home and work and nearly everywhere else we take our mobile phones are also blurred. Family or friends may now reach us in a supermarket or on the street, instead of in our apartment, which is quieter, and sometimes the background noise confuses the caller.
Cellphones, as nearly everyone who has one knows, are far from perfect in terms of service. Calls are impossible to make from areas known as dead zones, whereas service on a traditional line is almost always infallible.
There are other drawbacks. Wireless calls tend to drop more often than calls on land lines, as Tracie Jacobs, a customer service representative in Orlando, Fla., who gave up her land line two years ago, has experienced.
"Cellphones are not perfect, but it's worth the $90 we save each month," said Ms. Jacobs, 33. She and her husband had two traditional phone lines, one for a dial-up Internet connection, before disconnecting both to go with two cellphones and a cable modem connection.
For those whose wireless providers do not offer unlimited local calls, there is a risk that cellphone bills will be higher than those for conventional telephone service.
"Widespread unmetered local calling would really be the catalyst for wireless substitution to take off," said Paul Melton, an analyst at Telegeography in Washington.
For the time being, however, these imperfections are part of the give-and-take involved in severing dependence on a traditional phone line. Our apartment, minus two telephone jacks and land-line phone, is testimony to that.

What to Consider
Weighing Costs And Convenience
Why you might want to give up conventional phone service: 

COST -- If you already have a cellphone, your overall phone-service cost may be lower.

PORTABILITY -- There is no need for connecting and disconnecting land-line service for people who move frequently.

CONVENIENCE -- You can place and receive calls and retrieve voice-mail messages anywhere -- not just home, office or pay phone.

CHOICE -- Most consumers have many more options for wireless service than they do for land-line service.

Why you might not want to:

COST -- A realistic estimate of the number of calls you make and receive every month is essential. If you make frequent or lengthy local or long-distance calls, your bill could be higher, depending on your service plan. And with most wireless plans, you also pay for incoming calls.

STATIC -- Service quality of cellular systems does not yet approach that of land-line networks.

SECURITY -- Emergency 911 services are not as comprehensive for cellphones as they are for conventional telephones.

HEADLINE: Canadian Transit Giant Having Summer ofWoe 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Robert E. Brown, the chief executive of Bombardier Inc., assumes that things are bound to go wrong occasionally in a company like his, which has delivered more than 100,000 railcars and 7,000 aircraft around the world, and bids on 225 new contracts each year.
 What makes Mr. Brown wince, however, is the intense interest being shown by politicians and the media in the latest crop of troubles experienced by Bombardier, which makes leisure boats as well as regional and corporate jets and rail equipment. 
 In late July, Bombardier was the loser in a widely publicized contest to build 1,700 cars for the New York subway, one of the world's largest transit contracts. Then, earlier this month, Amtrak temporarily idled the Acela high-speed trains supplied by Bombardier and its French partner, Alstom, after cracks were discovered in the locomotives' suspension system 
Capping its difficult summer, Bombardier surprised investors last week by saying it would miss its goal of increasing earnings by 10 percent this year, a target it had confirmed little more than a month previously. 
The company, which is based in Montreal, said today that its earnings fell to $65 million -- 101 million Canadian dollars, or 7 Canadian cents a share -- in the three months to July 31, from 287.9 million Canadian dollars, or 22 Canadian cents, a year earlier.
The company now projects earnings at 70 Canadian cents a share for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2003, down from its earlier estimate of 89 Canadian cents. Bombardier's stock has lost about two-thirds of its value over the last year.
"They're at the mercy of their end-markets right now," said Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the Dlouhy Merchant Group, a Montreal brokerage firm. "They're being hit with three or four different things at once."
In an interview here today, Mr. Brown said that those who have pounced on the recent missteps have not given Bombardier enough credit for the diversity of its businesses.
Started more than half a century ago as a maker of snowmobiles in Quebec, Bombardier is now the world's biggest supplier of passenger railcars, regional aircraft and corporate jets.
The name comes from the company's founder, and the Bombardier family still owns 63 percent of the voting stock. Its products include the Learjet, Challenger and Global Express business jets and the CRJ regional jet.
Bombardier and Amtrak are suing each other over the Acela problems. "A technology of this kind that travels at this speed needs a certain quality of roadbed," Mr. Brown said. "Our feeling is that in the past there hasn't been enough investment in this area."
Scott Leonard, assistant director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers in Washington, said "there may be blame enough to go around on both sides." According to Mr. Leonard, "there was a tremendous amount of learning involved" in the introduction of the Acela.
Mr. Brown said that despite the lawsuits "we've got to keep our eye on the ball and make sure we deliver to the customer what we said we'd deliver."
As a short-term measure, Bombardier has repaired the defective parts and is testing the trains daily. In the meantime, it is designing new brackets in conjunction with Amtrak.
David Gunn, Amtrak's president, told The Globe and Mail last week, "I have to give the manufacturer really high marks for putting resources here and trying to fix the problem."
On the New York subway contract, Mr. Brown said he had no regrets about losing out to Kawasaki Rail Car Inc., the United States subsidiary of Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, in his view, "clearly went for the lowest price" and "I was determined not to lose money on this contract."
Bombardier's biggest headache now is its aerospace business, Mr. Brown said. Demand for business jets has collapsed, a situation that he attributes to the unexpected weakness being experienced by the American economy. The company delivered 21 corporate jets from April to June, down from 43 a year earlier. And eight orders were canceled in early August, six of them from North American customers.
The market for regional aircraft also shows signs of weakening, said Douglas Abbey, president of Avstat Associates, a Washington consulting firm.
Bombardier, whose CRJ's make up 59 percent of the 700 regional jets flying in the United States, received orders for 30 planes in the second quarter, down from 125 in the period last year.
US Airways, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, operates 110 Bombardier-built Dash 8 turboprops. Mr. Brown said that the airline was likely to seek lower lease payments on these aircraft, which could have a ripple effect on other operators.
Still, Mr. Brown said, regional airlines are doing well. "They're profitable," he said. "We see them adding routes." For example, United Airlines said this month that it would replace larger jets with a more frequent service using CRJ's between Colorado Springs and Chicago. 
The airline said it also planned to introduce CRJ's between Denver and Palm Springs, Calif. According to Innovata Data, an airline schedule manager based in Oakwood, Ga., 557 new regional jet routes have been added in the United States in the year ending in May 2002 and 294 in Europe.
Bombardier introduced a 70-seat version of the CRJ this year, and is scheduled to deliver its first 90-seat jet in early 2003. "We've been working full steam ahead," Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Water for a Thirsty World 

 BODY:
Water is a vital resource for sustaining human life, growing crops and running many industrial activities. It is disturbing that in many areas of the world the demand for fresh water is rising faster than the supply, leaving about a billion people without access to clean drinking water. Regional water shortages have raised the specter of armed conflict, forced relatively affluent societies to finance huge water projects and left some of the world's most impoverished nations in deepening misery. 
 A four-part series in The Times this week illuminated some of the causes and effects of dwindling water supplies just as the United Nations conference on sustainable development in Johannesburg is beginning to grapple with how to mitigate the problems. Only a little more than half the world's available fresh water is used each year. But by 2015, according to U.N. estimates, at least 40 percent of the world's population will live in countries where it is difficult or impossible to get enough water to satisfy basic needs. It is imperative to accelerate programs that can remedy the shortfall. 
 The potential for conflict over water shows up forcefully in the Euphrates River Valley, where Turkey, with the advantage of an upstream position and a sturdy army, has commandeered much of the river's water through a $30 billion program for building dams and irrigating fields. That has forced downstream Syria to curtail its own water development plans and has left Iraq, even farther downstream, at risk as well. This conflict and similar disputes on other rivers crossing national boundaries underscore the need for a globally accepted formula on how to divide up the water from streams shared by many countries. 
Nations facing water crises have come up with many solutions, none of them ideal. China, whose urban and industrial belt in the north is desperate for water, is undertaking an enormous project to move water from the mighty Yangtze River Basin in the rainy south to parched northern areas. Keeping the water free of pollution will be a major problem, and the costs will be gigantic. Meanwhile, Argentina turned to private companies to overhaul and manage some of its water systems, only to encounter cost and technical problems. Privatization can work, but clearly it must be done carefully and with strict public oversight.
Although per capita water use in the United States has declined substantially since 1980 thanks to greater efficiency by farmers and industrial users, those gains could be threatened by the increasing thirst of fast-growing American cities and suburbs, particularly in arid regions of the West. As yesterday's concluding article pointed out, the Ogallala aquifer that spans eight Western states and supplies roughly a quarter of the nation's irrigated farmland continues to be depleted, albeit at a much slower rate than before. By 2050 the population of Texas is expected to double, while the available water there drops by a fifth. That could suck the aquifer dry quickly unless new conservation and efficiency measures are found to slow its depletion.

Desperate to trim costs and starving for new ways to make money, the nation's largest airlines are cutting service, tightening rules and charging extra fees to their low-fare passengers. But many travelers and industry experts say the strategies could backfire and drive customers away.
 Over the last two weeks, a domino effect has taken hold in the industry, with airlines announcing one after the other a host of restrictions: charging $10 to $25 for each paper ticket issued and $40 and up for each checked bag beyond the second one, levying a surcharge for oversized checked bags and not offering passengers in economy class full cans of soda or plastic knives at breakfast unless they ask for them. 
 The most extreme rule changes to date came on Tuesday, when US Airways announced strict new policies that include barring most passengers with nonrefundable tickets from flying standby or catching a later flight if they miss their original one. Travelers in those circumstances will have to buy a new ticket, perhaps at a walk-up fare that costs hundreds or thousands of dollars more than the original fare. Under the old rules, passengers could board a later flight if they paid a change fee and any fare difference, or received credit for the unused portion of the original ticket that they could apply toward another ticket within a year. 
US Airways also said miles flown on nonrefundable tickets would not count toward earning elite status in its frequent-flier program.
The airline compared the new standby rule to what happens when someone misses a Broadway show or sports event: no refund or credit, period. 
The major airlines operate under a follow-the-leader mentality, and some rivals are considering whether they should match the changes. 
Airlines say some changes are just attempts to enforce rules they had been waiving, and others are intended to encourage business travelers to buy more flexible full-fare tickets again. But the new policies are already stirring worry and resentment among passengers, and industry experts say the changes will make it harder for the largest airlines to distinguish their products from the low-cost carriers.
Many travelers are already saying they could soon start flying on a low-cost carrier like Southwest Airlines or JetBlue Airways, neither of which has imposed the kind of rules announced by US Airways. Passengers who miss a ticketed flight on Southwest can catch a later one or receive credit to apply to the purchase of another ticket within a year. Those who miss a JetBlue flight are put on a standby list. Southwest is known for its friendly workers; JetBlue has leather seats and real-time television. Both airlines have simpler fare structures than the full-service carriers. 
"These changes can backfire if the consumers perceive the airline is trying to nickel-and-dime them," said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an airline consultation company based in Evergreen, Colo. "I really think the way to go in the future is to treat the customer as a friend, not say, 'Here's eight more rules you've got to follow.' This is not Marine boot camp. Enforcing rules like a papal edict is not smart."
Jim Corridore, an airline analyst at Standard & Poor's, said the most recent changes were "a negative for the industry because certainly they're not going to increase customer satisfaction."
"They're all scrounging for extra revenue," he added. "I think US Airways is going to see very quickly a drop-off in the passengers that they have."
US Airways is in a better position than many of its rivals to take a gamble because it has less to lose. It is operating under bankruptcy court protection and must show that it can carry out a stringent business plan if it is to obtain a $900 million loan guarantee from the federal government. Its new rules are intended to discourage business travelers from buying cheap tickets, which have become more and more popular among such passengers during the economic downturn.
"Our balance sheet will benefit a couple of ways," said B. Ben Baldanza, senior vice president for marketing at US Airways. "Some people will choose to pay more for the ticket to keep getting benefits. Other people won't, and we'll benefit from not having to give the perks to them."
Mr. Baldanza added that although most travelers would not be affected by the changes, he was "certainly concerned" about a defection to other airlines.
The new rules put out in the last two weeks -- all of which vary from airline to airline -- are sure to cause confusion.
At La Guardia Airport yesterday, few passengers flying on US Airways were even aware of the policies announced on Tuesday. One man who had heard of the changes, Charles Minor of Charlotte, N.C., said he was anxious because he wanted to leave on an earlier flight but had a discount ticket and was not sure whether the airline would let him fly standby.
"I'm not that thrilled with flying anymore, and these things nag on you," said Mr. Minor, a 53-year-old business consultant. "Their business will continue to deteriorate if they don't pay attention to the customers. Things like not refunding a discount ticket, that will just eat away at customer loyalty."
At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Anu Sing, a 32-year-old hotel manager from Washington, said that the changes by the traditional carriers were eliminating the positive differences between them and Southwest.
"You shop around for the best price, but you also take other things into consideration, like service," Mr. Sing said. "If you take that away, then they are all the same."
The new rules also complicate the jobs of flight attendants and ticket agents, who have to deliver news of the changes to customers.
Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 50,000 workers in the industry, said attendants were finding it difficult to keep all the rule changes straight and that "when you're explaining reduction in service to a passenger, that's not a comfortable conversation."
The new rules could lead to a mad scramble among passengers to carefully scrutinize which airline will give them the most benefits for their money. Passengers who know they might not make their ticketed flight could very well shun US Airways or AirTran Airways, which has always had a similar no-credit policy on its low fares. But AirTran could attract customers who want to check more than two bags because it allows a third checked bag free, as does Southwest. Continental Airlines has attracted customers that want food on their flights as rivals have cut back, although that could soon cost extra as Continental rolls out more trims in the next several weeks.
Continental has said that it will charge additional fees for certain services to low-fare passengers, and it is thought to be looking at the same kinds of rules that US Airways just put in place. Continental said last week that it would charge low-fare travelers $80 for each checked bag beyond the second piece as well as not giving out full cans of soda or breakfast knives in coach class unless people ask for them.
Joe Elenteny, a 66-year-old passenger who arrived yesterday in Chicago on Continental, offered this view of the situation: "I'd be pretty ticked off if they told me I had to pay extra to bring my golf clubs. They would definitely lose my business. Why wouldn't you just go to Southwest?"

C6) Chart: "Paring Back"To try to stem losses that have driven some to seek bankruptcy protection and led others to consider doing so, full-service airlines are cutting amenities for passengers, particularly those who buy the cheapest tickets. These changes are in addition to eliminating hundreds of flights each day to cut costs. American AirlinesTICKETS -- Charge $20 for paper tickets.MEALS -- Eliminate hot food on some flights. US AirwaysTICKETS -- Require passengers with nonrefundable tickets to buy another ticket if they miss their original flight and want to take a later one. Charge $25 for each paper ticket.

HEADLINE: Morris Heights Journal; 
Youths Find Hope in Jobs Academy

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in the Bronx was 9.2 percent in June, the highest of any borough in New York. If a softball team were to take the field in Melrose, Clason Point or Bedford Park, the odds would be that someone in the lineup did not have a job.
 While this number may be striking, it does not give a complete picture. Government statistics tell part of the story, but they do not tell it all. 
 For that, it takes a man like Travis Greene. Mr. Greene is 19 and has no job. When he talks about himself, it is often to tell the tale of living in a group home through his boyhood and slipping on a bright blue set of beads each morning, which marked him as a member of a street gang, the Crips. 
In a dozen years, he went to a dozen schools -- in the Bronx and Brooklyn, in Queens and Manhattan -- but he always got kicked out. He has been handled by an endless string of principals and teachers, drug counselors, social workers, welfare agents and family-intervention teams. "I've been with the government all my life," he said.
These days, Mr. Greene is with the South Bronx Job Corps, living in its Gothic-style academy in Morris Heights as he prepares himself to find a job. He is studying fiber optics and learning how to function in the 9-to-5 world. Get an alarm clock. Open a bank account. Buy some khaki pants. And, while you're at it, cut your hair.
The Job Corps Academy is the only place in the borough where a young man or woman can go to learn all there is to know about getting and keeping a solid job. There are centers throughout the Bronx where jobs are listed and resume-building skills are taught, but the academy stands alone as a full-scale university of work.
The students take classes in computer networking, nursing care, security and the culinary arts. They live in dormitories and are taught that a clean home is a happy home -- that, in the future, after the workday is done and the bills are paid and the children fed, they must still find time to do their laundry and mop their dirty floors. 
In the evenings, there are fashion shows and poetry readings and trips to professional basketball games. There is also a good amount of plain, old-fashioned hanging out. 
Jason Gotay is 18. He came to the academy five months ago because, as he explained it, "I was bad."
He was selling drugs and running with a gang and attended Morris High School for a month or two but then dropped out. His mother did not stop him, so he closed his books and left. When he had a child of his own, however, his girlfriend had enough. 
"She told me if I didn't come here, we were through," he said last week. "At first, I didn't like it here -- it was boring and I felt locked up." 
Then he started reading books on CPR and decided that emergency medicine would be his field. "Now," he said, "I'm destined to succeed."
To be fair, the academy is not some Harvard for the jobless. There is no guarantee its students will leave and find good work. Nevertheless, nearly 80 percent of the 275 students who live there go on to earn a paycheck, its director said. And they are not flipping burgers, either. They are working for Time Warner and Verizon, for example. 
"When you've got broken homes with no supervision, these kids tend to look at the street and their friends as home," said Louis Joseph, the academy's social development director. "What we do is grab hold of them in a residential setting. We teach them skills, but even more, we teach them drive."
"Grab hold" may be the operative phrase, since discipline at the academy is strict. The students are fined $5 every time they break a rule. The rules are posted in the dormitory halls and each begins with "No." As in, no gambling, no abusive language, no ethnic agitation, no horseplay, no hitchhiking, no drinking, no drugs, no cutting lines.
Although the academy is part of the national Job Corps program, certain difficulties come with a South Bronx setting. Sixty percent of the students are high-school dropouts and many read no better than fifth or sixth graders do. There are students from Puerto Rico and Colombia. Often, they have problems writing Spanish and find writing English is twice as hard.
In every room, it seems, there is a student with another obstacle to overcome. In one room, it is a high-school drug arrest. In another, an absent father or parents who never worked. 
For Latoya James, it was the child she bore in her senior year of high school. She could not leave the child at home because her mother had a job. She worked as a drugstore clerk herself but could not afford the day care, so she quit. 
Now, at 20, she has enrolled in the academy to study nursing, while the child's father takes over. She knows the jobless rate is high, but she also knows she has no choice: the numbers might be bad, but she needs a job right now. "I think about it all the time," she said. "It's bad. Here, at least I'm on my own -- at least, I'm independent. Finally, I'm doing something just for me."

HEADLINE: Study Rates Bangladesh Most Corrupt Country 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
More than two thirds of the world's countries are rife with corruption, a problem that especially affects wide swaths of Latin America, Africa and the former Soviet republics, an international watchdog group said today.
 The group, Transparency International, which is based in Berlin, said that 70 percent of the 102 countries it surveyed for its 2002 Corruption Perceptions Index scored less than a 5 on an index in which 1 is the most corrupt and 10 is the least. The numbers were a sharp deterioration from the group's 2001 list. 
 The group rated Bangladesh as the most corrupt nation, with a score of 1.2. Nigeria, Paraguay, Madagascar, Angola, Kenya and Indonesia, in order, were the next most corrupt. Finland scored a 9.7 on the index, ranking as the least corrupt country for the second year in a row. It was followed by Denmark, New Zealand, Iceland, Singapore and Sweden.
The United States was ranked the 16th-least-corrupt country, with a score of 7.7.
Latin America in general has slipped down the rankings of perceived corruption of its politicians and public officials, the group said.
"In the past year, we have seen setbacks to the credibility of democratic rule. In parts of South America, the graft and misrule of political elites have drained confidence in the democratic structures that emerged after the end of military rule," said Peter Eigen, chairman of Transparency International. For example, Argentina, ranked 57th last year with a score of 3.5, dropped to 70th with a 2.8 rating this year.
Mr. Eigen, who spoke to a news conference before heading to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, said corruption ruined a nation's chance to relieve poverty and heal the planet.
There were a few positive signs in former Communist nations. Slovenia showed improvement, climbing from 5.2 points to 6.0, although many nations of the former Soviet Union were still riddled with corruption.
Russia, for example, had improved. But it still scored below 3 points, as did many former Soviet republics like Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Azerbaijan.
Among the nations of the European Union and North America, Greece was the lowest-ranking country at 44th, at 4.2 points.

HEADLINE: Native New Yorkers (The Original Kind); 
American Indians of Many Tribes Work to Preserve Identity in City

BYLINE:  By JASON BEGAY 

 BODY:
The city with the largest American Indian population, according to the 2000 Census, is not Phoenix. Not Los Angeles. It is New York City.
 The news is a surprise even to some Indians living in the city. "You're kidding, right?" said Rosemary Richmond, the director of the American Indian Community House in Manhattan. 
 The census counted 41,289 American Indians and Alaska natives living in the city in 2000. And although the Census Bureau's form allowed people to claim more than one race, helping increase the numbers from previous years, when the census counted those people who claimed only some American Indian or Alaska native heritage, New York City was still No. 1, with 87,241. (Los Angeles and Phoenix ranked second and third in both population categories.)
One reason people do not realize how many Indians are in the city is that they are spread throughout the boroughs. "There's no concentration of a community, because there's such a diversity of tribes," said Michael A. Taylor, who works with the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, and was the head male dancer in the annual Thunderbird Powwow in Queens last month. 
"And the diversity of percentage of blood, it's across the board."
There are more than 500 American Indian tribes in the country, and many are represented in New York City. Most tribes, Mr. Taylor said, have their own languages and religions.
The American Indian Community House in Lower Manhattan provides services to about 6,000 people a year, including a free lunch program, food and clothing banks, medical referrals and job and computer training. Some board members, however, say that the center, which was formed in 1969, is in need of expansion, both of its offices at 708 Broadway and of its services.
"One of our problems is that we are defined by our social problems," said Leota Lone Dog, an artist and board member, of the center's focus on helping the poor and the unemployed. 
"The people who are coming into the city don't have the same types of problems that this organization was built on."
One of the biggest problems now, says Louis Mofsie, the chairman of the center's board, is more intermarriage.
"As time goes on, we're going to have more and more Indian people in urban areas with less and less Indian blood," said Mr. Mofsie, who is Winnebago and Hopi and has spent all of his 65 years in and around New York City.
So even though the community house is the largest meeting place for American Indians in the city, with a solid flow of regulars who attend the monthly powwows and lunches for the elderly and youth council meetings, Mr. Mofsie said that he would like to see the center offer more social gatherings and events.
Perhaps, he reasons, that would make it easier for the city's American Indians to meet one another. Some have found that hard, and harder still to meet someone from the same tribe.
"I went through it myself; I did look for a Seneca husband," said Stephanie Betancourt, 48. "But you can't say who you're going to care about."
Mrs. Betancourt's husband is Puerto Rican. Their son Paul Betancourt married outside the tribe as well. Because tribal lineage is passed through the mother, his children will not be considered Senecas by the tribe, the Seneca Nation of Indians.
Mr. Betancourt, 25, was born on a reservation in western New York but has spent most of his life in the city, growing up in the Bronx and going to school in Harlem. 
He shares the passion of his tribe's history and culture that his mother tried to instill in all three of her children. He and his mother both now work at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, in Lower Manhattan 
Mrs. Betancourt tried to balance the Seneca and Puerto Rican cultures of her three children. But the tribal policy means that it will be hard to remain an Indian family.
"How much blood do you have to have to be an Indian?" Mrs. Betancourt asked.
Alyse Eggleston, a spokeswoman from the clerk's office at the Seneca Nation of Indians in western New York, said this tribally mandated rule was an extension of tribal history. "It's always been that women traditionally have more power," she said. 
This is little consolation to Mrs. Betancourt. "I think we live in times where we have to think about changing things," she said. "I don't think we're ever going to have a homogeneous race again."
Mr. Mofsie and Ms. Richmond do recall when there was an identifiable American Indian community in the city. Both talk fondly of the time in the 1960's, when Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, around Nevins Street was full of Mohawks who worked in steel. 
They also talk about a church on Pacific Street, where the pastor learned to speak Mohawk.
"We were there all the time," Mr. Mofsie said. The Rev. David Munroe Cory, the pastor, even allowed Mr. Mofsie's group of friends, who called themselves the Little Eagles, to use the church to sing and dance. That group eventually became the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers.
But even without a similar neighborhood now, Mr. Mofsie sees Indians working to hold on to their heritage, despite documentation disputes in the tribes. 
"I see the enthusiasm the people have in keeping the traditions alive," he said. "Being an Indian is becoming more a cultural than a blood issue."
There are already some groups in the city that have accepted this and are dedicated to continuing the cultures of their tribe, regardless of official tribal recognition.
Walter Red Eagle is a founder of the Cherokee Language and Cultural Circle. He is 58, a retired truck driver and walks with a cane wrapped in buckskin. His great-grandfather, he said, was Cherokee.
He is not enrolled in the tribe, and has no plans to be. "Why would I want to?" he asked. "They don't ask any other ethnic group to enroll or prove their heritage." 
Mr. Red Eagle learned to speak some Cherokee growing up in Radford, W. Va. He said he learned to speak fluently from a tribal elder he met in New Jersey in the early 1990's. Since 1997, he has met weekly with the circle, although many of the members are not enrolled in the tribe. 
Mr. Red Eagle's Cherokee heritage is a small portion of his ethnic background, but it is the part he feels bonded to. "It doesn't matter what mix of culture you have," he said. "What you were meant to be in life comes out."

HEADLINE: Iran's President Trying to Limit Power of Clergy 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, said today that hard-line clerics had made it all but impossible for him to do his job and that he would propose legislation to adjust the balance of power so that he could pursue reforms.
 President Khatami's statement amounted to a clear expression of frustration with the clerics who hold most real levers of power and have thwarted a president elected twice on promises to open the economy and usher in greater civil liberties. 
 "I am announcing today that the president must have the power to perform his duties within the framework of the Constitution," he said at a news conference.
"We cannot speak of democracy if we are not ready to play by its rules," he added. "The main aspect of democracy is the right of people to change a government if they do not like it." 
The president acknowledged that dialogue with the hard-liners had proved fruitless so far, and his challenge today suggested a new willingness to confront them more forcefully. It seems certain to intensify a long power struggle in the country.
Mr. Khatami said he would seek to bolster his powers through Parliament, where his supporters hold a majority and his proposals seem certain to pass. 
But any such changes can be blocked by a religious panel called the Guardian Council, which has turned back reforms before, though never proposals so sweeping.
Among his statements today that are sure to infuriate opponents, Mr. Khatami said he was open to ties with the United States. "We haven't said there will never be a change in policy toward America," he said. 
But he said that "America's policies have created concern in the world" and that relations could change only if America treated Iran with the same respect that European nations did.
"We cannot engage in a dialogue in which the other side constantly uses an intimidating tone against us," Mr. Khatami said. "We are willing to have dialogue when we become confident that this situation has changed."
The United States severed ties with Iran in 1980 after the Islamic revolution in early 1979 and the subsequent seizure of the American Embassy here by students who took 52 Americans hostage. 
President Bush has labeled Iran part of an "axis of evil" along with North Korea and Iraq, against which the administration is openly considering war. "I hope the U.S. makes no mischief against Iran," Mr. Khatami said.
Mr. Khatami's election in 1997 and re-election last year seemed to offer opportunity for a thaw with the United States. But his achievements have been limited as hard-liners have retained control of the judiciary, security forces, army, large economic centers and the government-run television.
One of the most substantial obstacles to change is the religious panel called the Guardian Council. Members of the panel are appointed by the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and are authorized to reject any legislation they consider counter to the Constitution or Islamic law.
Among its powers, the watchdog body is authorized to interpret the Constitution itself and has the right to disqualify candidates for elections.
Mr. Khatami said his government had already presented Parliament with a bill to limit the powers of the council, which has used its authority to prevent many politicians supporting reform from running for office.
The next election for Parliament is scheduled to take place within 18 months, and analysts say that without limiting the powers of the council, many reform candidates may be thwarted again.
In addition, Mr. Khatami said he would soon send Parliament a bill to restore presidential powers from the time when Ayatollah Khamenei held the office in the 1980's.
Those powers would allow the president to act as head of state, enforce the Constitution and protect citizen's rights.
Mr. Khatami noted that he had been the first president deprived of those powers.
In recent months some of the most serious political struggles have come between the president and the judiciary, which the hard-liners control and which has been backed by the Guardian Council.
The head of the judiciary, appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei, has shut down nearly 60 publications and jailed scores of reform activists and political opponents, including 33 members of a religious nationalist party who were sentenced to prison and lashes last month.
Mr. Khatami has tried to use the presidency to supervise the judiciary, which has conducted closed trials of political dissenters. 
Today, Mr. Khatami said the Guardian Council had vetoed that attempt.
But he insisted that the judiciary's performance remained unconstitutional. The fate of newspapers should be decided by a jury, he said, and trials should take place in open courts with the presence of a jury.
"But they have never listened," he said.
Mr. Khatami warned that public disaffection was rising in Iran, where a sluggish economy has spawned an unemployment rate of 14 percent. But he acknowledged that much of this dissatisfaction stemmed from his government's failure to bring citizen's greater freedoms. His own frustration was evident.
"The Guardian Council should not reject the bills," he said, "because they are logical and none of them are against the Constitution or the Islamic law, unless it intends to violate the Constitution."
The president insisted that he wanted to avoid any social unrest. But he also acknowledged that the faith and patience he had placed in dialogue with his opponents had worn thin.
"Unfortunately I have had no success," he said. "My warnings have been ignored, and the president's duties, which are clearly stated in the Constitution, have been suspended."
Chief among those duties, he said, was to enforce the Constitution, and he insisted that at a minimum he should have the power to do so.
"A president who cannot perform that role is no good," he warned, "and we will seek other alternatives if this fails."

Marketing Agency Opens in New York

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
 Turf, a brand marketing agency, is being opened in New York by Mark Trippetti, who will be president. The agency has 10 employees and clients like American Express Publishing and Chelsea Piers. Mr. Trippetti, 44, had been leading the New York office of Asylum, a San Francisco agency focused on strategic creative content. Mr. Trippetti said the Asylum New York office, which had handled the American Express Publishing account, was closing. "In this economy, we will retreat into our core competency, which is advertising," Mr. Trippetti said. "I think that's where the budgets are now."

Talks Are Feverish With Strike Due Tomorrow

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When Commissioner Bud Selig arrived at baseball's office on Park Avenue in Manhattan late yesterday afternoon, a fan was waiting outside the building. "Get the deal done," the fan said emphatically. "You're making me miserable."
 The negotiators for the owners and the players wanted a done deal, but despite their feverish efforts to accomplish their goal and avert a strike that is scheduled to begin after tonight's games, they seemed to be failing. 
 A person familiar with the talks said late last night that there was no reason for optimism. "Substantial differences remain in the area of the luxury tax," the person said.
Negotiators had one session during the day and four brief meetings in the evening. At the fourth evening session, the two sides learned that their attempt at progress was falling short. The brevity of the earlier sessions was not a bad omen. "The meetings are not unexpectedly brief," a negotiator said.
He meant that in exploring ways to solve the differences, the negotiators were delivering updates on their positions, then breaking for internal discussions before the next session, where more updates would be given.
The two sides reached agreement on a steroid-testing program on Tuesday, and yesterday they were working on the two key economic issues: revenue sharing and a luxury tax on payrolls. Some player representatives seemed to become more optimistic yesterday that an agreement could be reached.
"We feel like we can really see the end," Mike Stanton, the Yankees' player representative, said in Boston. "There is still work to be done. I don't want to give the impression it's all done and waiting for Bud's signature. But we're in the ballpark."
A union official suggested, however, that the player representatives' optimism came more from what they were hearing from their clubs than what they were hearing from the union.
Union officials and management representatives were basically silent on the subject of progress, however.
The negotiator who talked about the brief meetings, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that in past days negotiators had focused on structural elements of the luxury tax, such as the number of years it would be in effect.
"In the last few days, the focus has been on numbers and we don't have anything resolved in either area," he said. "But we're working at it."
Numbers, as in payroll thresholds and tax rates. Those numbers, along with the numbers of dollars that richer teams would contribute to poorer teams, will determine whether the season continues with a day game in Chicago tomorrow and 14 night games tomorrow night or whether the players will scatter to their homes at the start of baseball's sixth strike and ninth work stoppage in three decades.
Asked if there was time to avert a strike, Selig, who did not participate in the bargaining sessions, said in a telephone interview: "I hope so. I believe so. Time will tell. It's a tough situation to read."
A day earlier Selig had said that if a deal was not reached by midnight tonight or not long afterward, baseball would be "on dangerous ground." Last night he amended that view slightly.
"We have to stretch this out as far as we can," he said. "Hopefully, if we're making progress, you can go as long as you can."
Many teams delayed their charter flights for tomorrow's games. Teams customarily travel to a playing site the day before a game.
Union officials have instructed players not to report to parks for tomorrow's games if there is no deal. They do not want to have players walking out of parks, walking ducks for photographs that would certainly elicit scorn from fans.
In 1994, when games ended the night of Aug. 11, clubs and players faced no uncertainty about their destinations because they knew the strike was on. The two sides were far enough apart on the clubs' demand for a payroll cap that a strike was guaranteed.
In this instance, players today will most likely finish six day games and four night games not knowing whether they will walk out before tomorrow's games.
What they do know is that they will undergo testing for steroid use next spring training, if there is a spring training. Although some details must be worked out, the two sides agreed to a schedule of survey testing and unannounced, random testing.
The initial testing will be done as a survey. As long as tests show that fewer than 5 percent of the players use steroids, survey testing will continue. If in any year the tests show that more than 5 percent use steroids, a two-year program of random testing will begin.
Random testing will end if fewer than 2 1/2 percent of the players test positive. Survey testing would take its place. The two sides still have to work out whether that 2 1/2 percent would apply to the second year of random testing or both years.
Wherever players are in the program, random testing will not survive the labor agreement. The two sides will have to negotiate a new plan for the next agreement.
If random testing begins, a player will not be disciplined for testing positive the first time. A player instead will be placed in the joint drug program for treatment and for more frequent testing. 
Players will be disciplined for additional positive tests. The plan calls for six terms of progressive suspensions for second and third offenses, the discipline becoming more severe with each offense.
Paul Lo Duca, the Los Angeles Dodgers' player representative, was the first person to disclose the steroids agreement to reporters on Tuesday night, but he incorrectly said players had also agreed to testing for cocaine and marijuana. The players had agreed to continue testing only for cause, as has been in effect for years.
In the efforts to get agreements on the luxury tax and revenue sharing, negotiators had floated 50 to 100 ideas in the last few days, one of the negotiators estimated. 
One of those ideas, another negotiator said, dealt with an extra year in the agreement. Instead of having it run through the 2006 season, it could go through 2007. In that way, the clubs could get the four years of payroll taxes they want and the players could get the last year of the agreement tax-free, which they want.
But that idea did not survive, both negotiators said, and it is unlikely any agreement will run through 2007.

HEADLINE: France Mutes Its Criticism Of U.S. Stance Toward Iraq 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The new center-right French government has decided to stop criticizing American war planning against Saddam Hussein and instead maximize its leverage with the United States by stressing areas of agreement, according to senior French officials.
 Under the previous center-left government, French-American relations were often poisonous, characterized by repeated spats over issues ranging from perceived American unilateralism to policy in the Middle East. 
 The decision reflects an important tactical shift. Its proponents, including the new foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, argue that a more conciliatory policy will avoid needless friction between the two longtime allies and allow the government of President Jacques Chirac to keep open its options in case the United States decides to wage war unilaterally against Iraq. 
The move may also help protect France's national interests in Iraq, including its oil trade, should the United States wage war and win, the officials said.
The tonal shift does not mean that France has suddenly embraced the American position that a military campaign to oust President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from power is justifiable and perhaps necessary.
Rather, Mr. Chirac and Mr. de Villepin have come to the conclusion that it is wiser to present France as an active, strategic partner of the United States and to keep quiet about specific policy differences.
"More and more at the highest levels people are saying, 'We don't like a military operation but there's likely to be one so what do we do,' " a senior French official said. "So the goal is to keep all our options open and not criticize, not to provoke a backlash. We feel that Washington is expecting us to react negatively and we have decided not to. It's a tactical choice."
Another senior official put it more bluntly, "We're driving the Pentagon crazy by keeping silent." 
The French shift leaves France and Germany in uncharacteristic positions. Germany, normally the most pliant of allies, has said it will not participate in an American "adventure" in Iraq. This tone has played well for Chancellor Gerhard Schroder as he campaigns for re-election next month. Meanwhile France, normally the most combative of allies, has been restrained.
French officials seem to be relieved, even amused, that it is now the Germans who have taken the lead in taking on the Bush administration for its Iraq policy
On Tuesday, Mr. Schroder described Washington's course as a "mistake" that undermines United Nations efforts to resume weapons inspections in Iraq. He has also said a war could wreck the international antiterror coalition, inflame the Middle East and hurt the world economy.
The French attitude towards the United States was reflected in a speech by Mr. Villepin that opened a conference of French ambassadors at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.
Unlike his predecessor, Hubert Vedrine, who seemed to relish any opportunity to criticize the United States, Mr. de Villepin, who lived and worked for years in Washington, stressed the positive. He spoke glowingly of American "dynamism, energy and exceptional enthusiasm," and the need for the United States and Europe to unite in a "new Euro-Atlantic partnership." 
As for Iraq, he branded it a regime that "defies international rules set by the Security Council, holds it people hostage and threatens security, particularly that of its neighbors. Such behavior is not acceptable. We Europeans, know too well the price of weakness in the face of dictatorship if we close our eyes and play a passive game."
The emerging French strategy is to take diplomatic cover by putting any talk of war in the context of the rule of international law. Indeed, in his speech, Mr. de Villepin said that the international community must demand the unconditional return of United Nations inspectors to the country, but did not say what should be the response if Iraq refused. As for waging war, he reiterated the French position that "no military action can be conducted without a decision of the Security Council."
In his speech, Mr. de Villepin did not say, as other French officials have said privately, that the Iraq problem can only be dealt with after the war between Israel and the Palestinians is resolved. 
The passage on Iraq was carefully negotiated for hours inside the Foreign Ministry and with the Elysee Palace. It will be reiterated by Mr. Chirac when he delivers a speech to the ambassadors at the Elysee Palace on Thursday, according to Catherine Colonna, Mr. Chirac's spokesman. 
"For the moment, the most useful position is to remind people of the obligations of Iraq and the role of the Security Council," Ms. Colonna said. 
Last evening, in a meeting with ambassadors assigned to the Middle East, Mr. Villepin was peppered with questions that underscore the delicacy of France's position. "It was a real brainstorming and shows how things are too hypothetical now to take a stand," one participant said. "People were asking, 'What do we do if the Americans come up with a U.N. resolution and we don't accept it? Do we take part in the drafting? Do we vote for it? If we vote for it, do we send troops?' " 
According to his aides, Mr. Villepin simply listened.

HEADLINE: At Development Talks, U.S. and Its Allies Clash Over Issues of Energy and Pollution 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
For days now, the battle between rich and poor nations has dominated the United Nations talks here on the environment and development, with marches and fiery debates over how to reduce poverty. 
 But one of the fiercest struggles has been raging behind the scenes as the United States and the European Union clash over strategies to preserve the planet. 
 The allies are battling over the question of targets and time frames for the conversion from oil and gas to windmills and solar panels, for the cleanup of garbage and hazardous pollutants and for the preservation of endangered plants and animals. 
The European Union says these talks must produce a strong plan with firm deadlines so the world's leaders can be held accountable for their actions. The United States opposes targets and deadlines, saying it would rather finance specific projects than support goals that might ultimately prove meaningless. 
The negotiators on both sides are still cordial. But everyone agrees that the dispute has aggravated tensions that have been simmering since President Bush angered his European colleagues last year by refusing to ratify an international treaty aimed at preventing global warming. Nowhere is that rift more visible than in the debate over renewable energy. 
Scientists say the industrialized nations are endangering the earth by using fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Renewable energy sources like wind power and solar energy produce smaller and more expensive amounts of electricity than plants using traditional fuels, but renewable energy sources generate a tiny fraction of the carbon dioxide and gases that are believed to accelerate global warming. 
Under the plan favored by the European Union, nations would commit to ensuring that renewable energy sources account for 15 percent of the world's total energy production by 2010. The United States has rejected such proposals. Canada and Saudi Arabia, significant producers of fossil fuels, have also objected. With both sides digging in their heels today, the talks seemed deadlocked. 
"We have a range of issues -- renewable energy, sanitation, hazardous chemicals and the reversal of the decline in biodiversity," Yvon Slingenberg, a senior member of the European delegation, said in an interview. "On all of those issues, we have not managed to convince them." 
American officials dismissed such criticism. In the coming days, the United States will announce programs aimed at providing clean water and reliable electricity in developing countries. Action, they insist, matters more than words. 
"We have maintained consistently that targets alone will not deliver the energy services needed," said Griff Thompson, the director of the Office of Energy, Environment and Technology for the United States Agency for International Development. "It's not the words in and of themselves that will electrify classrooms." 
David Garman, an assistant secretary in the Department of Energy, said the United States was focusing on trying to reduce the costs of renewable energy, which is still more costly than coal or gas. "Renewable energy is great because it's clean," he said. "It also tends to be more expensive." 
But at the talks here, the United States has been repeatedly, and sharply, criticized for refusing to commit to concrete obligations. 
Today Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, and Jerry Brown, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, assailed the Bush administration's energy policy at a news conference here. They called for a new commitment to solar power and an end to fuel subsidies. 
"There are people in the administration who will say, 'We don't need to talk about timetables,' " Mr. Kucinich said. "But when scientists can show that over a period of time that global warming can, in fact, impact on the increase in world temperature, we better be talking about timetables." 
The debate, however, is more nuanced than some American critics suggest. 
The United Nations describes the United States as a pioneer in renewable energy; it is already one of the largest producers of wind energy in the world, even though the technology is still costly. Even the European Union has rejected proposals favored by environmentalists that would demand an even larger commitment to renewable energy. 
"You can't say that the Europeans are dashing around reducing emissions furiously," said Gordon Shepherd, the director of international policy at the World Wildlife Fund. "But they have acknowledged that they have to. They've sent a message that things must change." 
Mr. Shepherd said he believed the two sides would come to some sort of consensus, even if it meant horse trading on certain issues. But negotiators were not predicting an easy breakthrough. 
"We've not made any progress," an American official said of the negotiations today. Asked whether he thought the two sides could bridge the gap, he shook his head and said, "I'm not sure."

HEADLINE: Senior U.S. Official Underscores Bush's Criticism of North Korea 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
A senior American official today vigorously defended President Bush's inclusion of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" -- along with Iran and Iraq -- saying the term was "more than a rhetorical flourish, it was factually correct."
 In a strongly worded speech, the official, John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control, cited what he said was "a hard connection between these regimes -- an 'axis' along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology." 
 Besides building weapons of mass destruction, Mr. Bolton said, "North Korea also is the world's foremost peddler of ballistic missile-related equipment, components, materials and technical expertise." There were, he said, "few if any signs of change" indicating that the North was heeding demands by the United States to 'get out of the business of proliferation." 
Mr. Bolton chose a important juncture in inter-Korean efforts for reconciliation to issue a broad warning to North Korea on the development of nuclear as well as chemical and biological weapons.
He spoke on the second day of the first working-level economic talks in nearly two years between North and South Korean officials. South Korean negotiators, hoping for a breakthrough in President Kim Dae Jung's efforts at reconciliation with the North in the final six months of his administration, said they would try to get the North to agree to a timetable for the completion of a railroad linking the two Koreas. Mr. Bolton reiterated the willingness of the United States to reopen dialogue with North Korea but focused on the dangers posed by North Korean weapons of mass destruction. South Korean officials feared that his reference to an "axis of evil" would undermine North-South dialogue and also jeopardize chances for meaningful talks between American and North Korean officials.
Mr. Bolton said he wanted "a little straight talk among friends" when he made the broadest American public policy statement heard here in recent years on the North Korean threat. The remark reflected what was perceived here as Washington's concern that Mr. Kim and some of his top aides are playing down the threat posed by North Korea.
Indeed, some Koreans who attended the speech said that Mr. Bolton wanted to talk publicly because he was having difficulty getting South Korean leaders to listen to what he had to say privately. 
Mr. Bolton placed less emphasis than did Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, on the prospects for a visit to North Korea by a senior American official, probably James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Mr. Armitage, in Tokyo, said that North Korea had indicated its interest in such a visit and that Mr. Kelly might go there fairly soon.
Mr. Bolton said only that resumption of discussions between the United States and North Korea was "one of the Korean government's highest priorities." The United States, he said, would engage in "intense" discussion with South Korean officials "on all aspects of any consultations with the North."
While castigating the North for "continuing development of weapons of mass destruction and exporting the means to deliver them," Mr. Bolton sought to allay concerns that his remarks might provide a rationale for a pre-emptive strike. The United States, he said, still had "no intention to attack North Korea in any way, shape or form."

Directed by John Stockwell
PG-13 109 minutes
 "The Girls Lay Pipe," reads a headline in a Hawaiian newspaper. That's surfer talk for rocketing through the curling overhang of a 20-foot wave on the north coast of Oahu. Fall off the board and you are driven into the bottom by tons of breaking water. Waivers signed by contestants on the beach before the big competition mention possible dismemberment. 
 Three years ago Anne Marie (Ms. Bosworth), a top surfer, bounced her head off a rock and almost drowned in these waves. Now she has to get back out there and compete against the No. 1 woman in the sport if she expects to land all those big product endorsements. Anne Marie isn't sure she wants to do this, although it could mean a major move up the economic ladder for her, her rebellious kid sister, Penny (Ms. Boorem), and her two friends and housemates (Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Lake).
At the moment they barely scrape up rent for their scroungy beach bungalow by working as chambermaids at a resort hotel. There they get to mop up after vacationing professional football players with revolting hygiene. They're all great guys, though, and one of them, a quarterback named Matt (Mr. Davis), takes a shine to Anne Marie and vice versa.
Everybody urges her on for the coming tussle with the huge breakers. But Anne Marie is wave-shy. On competition day she falls a lot, taking a terrific bashing. The waves are coming in sets of four every 20 seconds. Here comes that really big one.

VIOLENCE -- Matt gets into a fistfight with some local surfers.
SEX -- Plenty of references to go with much bared flesh.
PROFANITY -- Off-color talk.

For Which Children?
UNDER AGE 8 -- The surfing could be a little scary for some small children, and the earthy tenor of things on shore is none too favorable.
AGES 8-10 -- Fine if parents agree. The movie leans to the obvious, but it has good things to say about fears and perseverance.
AGES 11 AND UP -- Sure.

Directed by Andrew Niccol
PG-13 100 minutes
Suppose you are the movie director Viktor Taransky (Mr. Pacino) and one day at the studio an unkempt man jumps out of the shadows and yells: "I licked the skin! I licked the hair! I licked all of it!"
Taransky hasn't been having an easy time lately. His new picture, "Sunrise Sunset," has just had the plug pulled after its hissy star (Ms. Ryder) quit in a rage over the cramped confines of her trailer, an Airstream 50-footer. Then the studio chief (Ms. Keener), who happens to be Taransky's former wife, fires him.
So there he is throwing his belongings into a car when he is accosted by this fellow, Hank Aleno (Mr. Koteas). Years earlier Aleno had proposed teaming with Taransky to develop an actor who was completely digital. Now Aleno has done it!
Simulation One (call her Simone) is perfect in every detail, absolutely indistinguishable from reality. Aleno begs Taransky to collaborate and adds that they had better hurry. All that staring at a computer screen has left Aleno with a tumor in his eye. He has a week to live.
Taransky says thanks, but no thanks. Later, though, he is willed Aleno's program. Some months after that, the world is astonished by the radiant Simone (Ms. Roberts) in "Sunrise Sunset." Instantly she becomes a sensation, adored by the public and clamored for by the media. Sharper at subterfuge than he is at moviemaking, Taransky quickly masters the rules of playing the game with a star like Simone. First he makes her a retiring, humble loner who makes Garbo look like a publicity addict. No offense to her fans or fellow actors, but on no account can an artist of such sensitivity come in contact with anyone other than Taransky, not even those she performs with in her movies. All awards ceremonies, all receptions that turn into riots at the very rumor that she might be present, are strictly absentee affairs.
Operating at a computer, Taransky gets through all situations and makes himself the artistic inspiration she refers to on all occasions. On a personal level, his former wife the studio boss wants him back. His daughter (Ms. Wood) adores him (as she always has). But then he realizes that he has had enough. It's time for Simone to die -- mysteriously, of course. Will she?

VIOLENCE -- A few riotous situations but no real violence in the purest sense.
SEX -- Some references.
PROFANITY -- Quite a bit.

For Which Children?
UNDER AGE 11 -- Not for them. This is a very long 100-minute movie, seeming to conclude only to resume just when this audience (and some of the rest of us) will be ready to throw in the towel.
AGES 11 AND UP -- Many will like this film. The technology is fun. Taransky and Simone are winning, as is Taransky's loyal young daughter. At the end we even have a little moral: it's fine to make something fake; just don't be a fake about it.

Serving Sara
Matthew Perry, Elizabeth Hurley, Vincent Pastore, Bruce Campbell, Cedric the Entertainer
Directed by Reginald Hudlin
PG-13 100 minutes
Barging into a gambling den, Joe Tyler (Mr. Perry) asks a mobster if he knows who he is. "You're the guy who's leaving in the trunk of my car," the man answers. Tyler is a process server, not a happy profession. His boss, Ray (Cedric the Entertainer), dispatches him and his obnoxious rival, Tony (Mr. Pastore), to hand out the bad news, provided they can catch up with the intended recipients.
Ray gives assignments, and fees, to the faster man, so Joe and Tony always try to throw each other off the scent. The quarry here is Sara Moore (Ms. Hurley), the beautiful wife of the Texas cattleman and genial cad Gordon Moore (Mr. Campbell). Wanting to be rid of his wife, Gordon and his lawyers hire Ray to serve Sara with divorce papers. After chasing her around a while, Joe is ready to accomplish the task. But surprisingly (not so surprising if there's to be a movie), they like each other. Then they get an idea. Serve Gordon before he serves Sara.
As the film has it, nailing a man in Texas is difficult because of conservative divorce laws and the fact that no judge in the state is still with his first wife. But Joe and Sara infiltrate the Moore spread and chase old Gordon clear to the Mexican border. Will they catch him before Tony catches Sara?

VIOLENCE -- Slapstick scuffles.
SEX -- To get on the Moore ranch, Joe poses as a veterinarian and is called on to stimulate an impotent bull, which he does by thrusting his arm fully inside the animal (it looks real). He and Sara wind up in the same bed at one point, but so anemic is the chemistry between Mr. Perry and Ms. Hurley that they might as well be in different buildings.
PROFANITY -- Much, and a lot of scruffy talk, too.

For Which Children?
UNDER AGE 11 -- No.
AGES 11 AND UP -- It's hard to imagine children crowding into this one. There are some laughs. Parents' decision.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Collectors With a Weakness for the Ornery

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Wasn't late-20th-century American art strange, with its insane variety, outlandish forms and outrageous ideas? I think so; that's why I love it. And I was reminded how strange it was when I visited an exhibition at the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, where objects made 40 years ago felt every bit as resistant and hard to love as they must have the day they were made.
 The show is "From Pop to Now: Selections From the Sonnabend Collection," and the Sonnabends themselves, Ileana and Michael, did, of course, love these objects or at least found them intriguing enough to want to have around. And they bought many of them early, straight from the studio, before most people were aware that such irritating stuff even existed. 
 The Sonnabends had an inside track: they were dealers in contemporary art. More important, Ileana Sonnabend was, and remains, one of the pioneering figures in the aesthetic Big Bang that took place in the 1950's and 60's, and produced the expanding, centerless, diffuse art universe we know today. 
Born in Romania, she came to New York in 1941 with her husband, Leo Castelli. They opened a gallery and discovered, among other young artists, Jasper Johns. The new era began. Divorced from Castelli in 1960, she married Michael Sonnabend and moved to Paris, taking American talent -- Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein -- to Europe.
In the 1970's it was back to New York and to SoHo. There she had yet another gallery, this one in the same building as Castelli, and showed more Americans and artists she had encountered in Europe, like Christian Boltanski, Bernd and Hilla Becher, and the British duo Gilbert and George. And all along, she and Michael Sonnabend, who died last year at 100, collected art.
The exhibition at the Tang -- organized by Charles A. Stainback, the director of the young, very on-the-ball museum -- is a broad sampling of the Sonnabends' acquisitions, from small paintings to bulky installations. On the whole it's a one-work-per-artist affair, and for that reason, combined with the rapid-fire eclecticism of the postwar art itself, it has a disorientingly jumpy rhythm, as if many individual voices were clammering for attention at once.
And unlike the expensively packaged traveling exhibition "Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons: Four Decades of Art From the Broad Collection" now at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Sonnabend show doesn't have the heft and polish of a masterpiece presentation. Instead, it feels personal, happenstantial, like history in the making, almost anti-masterpiece. Individual works are awkward, messy, even ugly. Why on earth would anyone want such things in their home? Because collecting this really radical art required having a brain as much as an eye.
The first work in the first gallery, "Grand Poubelle" (1962) by the French-born artist Arman, is a preview of coming attractions. One of a series of plexiglass virtrines that the artist filled with trash from his New York studio, it is a 3-D collage, a time capsule of everyday life, a post-Dada joke and a monument to consumption and decay.
Some of these identities are picked up in the pieces around it. One is a funky 1962 Rauschenberg combine made of a free-hanging tarp with a stuck-on Coca-Cola sign. Another is smudgy, shop-signish 1959 Johns stencil painting of the numeral 8. A third is "Balcony," a 1961 easel-size painting by James Rosenquist that splices together bodily images -- a honey-blond bouffant hairdo, a cuff-linked sleeve -- and real mirrors.
None of these are grandstandingly important works, but each represents a shift in thinking for the artist or the collector. "Balcony" was among Mr. Rosenquist's first uses of applied objects. The Johns painting was one that Ms. Sonnabend bought early, then sold and later bought back.
From this core display of turning-point art, the show broadens out. In the second gallery, Pop assumes its classic empty-is-the-new-full form in Warhol's stacked Brillo boxes. And generations mix. Near Warhol is Haim Steinbach's neo-Pop "Ultra Red No. 1" (1986), with its shelf of digital clocks and lava lamps. On the wall is a sardonic 1992 paean to alcohol consumption by Ashley Bickerton, while an even more recent painting by the same artist further on pushes Pop's ambivalent social commentary in devastatingly explicit directions.
Then change again -- different look, different mood, different thoughts -- in a gallery of Minimimal and Conceptual pieces. They take a rarefied form in a rose-colored light piece by Dan Flavin, glowing like a stained glass window. But Robert Morris's vulva-shaped, draped-felt sculpture is one of the sexiest pieces in the show. And John Baldessari's 1968 Minimalist sendup is one of the funniest. For it, he hired a sign painter to write on an empty canvas "Everything is purged from this painting but art, no ideas have entered this work."
But there are ideas all over the place. They helped make the Pop-Minimal-Conceptual era one of the most intellectually challenging episodes in 20th-century Western art; no wonder we're still reworking and reliving it. The Sonnabend Gallery played a significant role in shaping it, in part by shaping an American market for European art, including the movement known as Arte Povera, highlighted on the Tang's second floor.
It evolved in Italy during a time of political unrest in the early 1960's. With the country's economy in a slump and students and workers on strike, a group of artists came up with an art that pointedly rejected both painting and consumer culture, then as now closely linked, in favor of work made from "poor," prosaic, often found materials like wood, wax, plaster and cloth.
America never knew quite what to do with this art, which lacked the incisiveness of Pop, the clean lines of Minimalism and the emphatic nothing-thereness of early Conceptualism. Instead it offered a bunch of conceptual opposites: hard-soft, old-new, sweet-sour, nature-culture embodied in scuffed-up, pieced-together objects that might have been invented by a child.
In "Wax and Rubber" (1966), for example, Mario Merz placed two hollow half-cylinders of translucent beeswax and thick black rubber end to end on the floor and put a lighted bulb inside. An untitled 1969 installation by Giovanni Anselmo has six bricks standing upright in a metal container of water. These works are, respectively, about illumination and evaporation.
Arte Povera can look a bit precious, with its discreetly utopian, post-hippie, metaphor-spinning sensibility. But it also has a daffy exoticism that feels refreshing now. This comes across particularly well in a historical survey of the movement, "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-72," now in Los Angeles and opening at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington in late October.
In the 1990's Ileana Sonnabend collected and exhibited a crop of young artists. Several of them -- Elger Esser, Candida Hofer, Clay Ketter, Matthew Weinstein -- are represented at the Tang. Thanks to their presence, the show is less like a valedictory gesture than like an up-to-now status report, as much about the present and future as about the past.
One gets the same salutary lift from an energetic new museum like the Tang. Under Mr. Stainback it has a lively, forward-looking exhibition program; solo shows by interesting young artists like Nayland Blake, Kara Walker and Fred Wilson are scheduled for the coming year. At the same time, with interdisciplinary ties to the academic community of which it is a part, it has its eye on history and how that works. In such an environment, the Sonnabend collection is right at home.

"From Pop to Now: Selections From the Sonnabend Collection" remains on view at the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Skidmore College, 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., (518) 580-8080, through Sept. 29. It then travels to the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University (November to February) and the Milwaukee Art Museum (February to May).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Every Which Way to Paint

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT'S amazing how much you can learn about one medium over the course of viewing a few focused, often modest and seemingly unrelated museum exhibitions. Take the five shows, spread among four museums, that I visited on a sultry summer day here. 
 The shows had so little in common that I felt I had been dropped down on a series of small, isolated islands; so much art-historical ground was covered so quickly that aesthetic jet lag seemed likely. Yet by the end of the day, I realized that the shows' different coordinates were more connected than they had seemed, and that the link was the meandering ways and means of painting. 
 In fact, the works in these shows come from three different continents, span about eight centuries and aren't necessarily on canvas, or even flat. But painting in one guise or another is their common ground and they have much to say about its evolution, persistence and variety. Looked at from these angles, these little islands of painting define a terrain much greater than the sum of their individual territories. 
I am not kidding about the lack of canvas or even flatness. Some of the best painterly effects in these shows appear on the pieces of furniture, ceramics and textiles included in "An American Vision: Henry Francis du Pont's Winterthur Museum" at the National Gallery of Art. 
Sometimes paint is altogether absent, as in Winterthur's superb examples of needlepoint, blankets and quilts. One standout is a veritable monument to crossfertilization: a quilt that was not simply inspired by the profuse floral designs of the woodblock-printed cotton exported from India to the American colonies, but was actually constructed from them. Its maker appropriated these designs directly, cutting leafy flower motifs from a piece of Indian cotton and then quilting them, together with homespun calicos, to create a tree of life. The lush blooms and the plainer calico leaves, bark and ground are delightfully at odds, but the undulating rhythms of the tree's sinuous form -- not so far removed from those of a multi-armed Indian goddess -- provide the unifying force. 
"An American Vision," which was organized by Wendy A. Cooper of Winterthur, also has several impressive works on canvas. There is a wonderfully awkward portrait of the four slightly stiff, very serious children of the Gore family, painted by John Singleton Copley in 1755, before his style was smoothed out by training in England. And an unknown artist's charming full-length portrayal of young Magdalena Douw, from around 1740, depicts the daughter of a wealthy Dutch family. (She later became Mrs. Harme Gansevoort.) She is shown in all her finery, including a blue brocade dress and bright-red shoes. It is a picture in which nearly every element has a life of its own, from the boldly bulbous table she stands beside to the blue and flamingo-pink clouds in the windows behind her. 
My interest in things pictorial should not distract anyone from the fact that everything in this exhibition is exceptional and attests to du Pont's extraordinary eye and passion for excellence. In addition, the show, which is often arranged in period groupings, provides an unusually clear-cut introduction to the different influences and styles -- European, Asian, American, folk, rococo and Neo-Classical -- evident in the American decorative arts before 1840. 
Painting is limited to traditional canvas in "Anne Vallayer-Coster: Painter to the Court of Marie Antoinette," a second exhibition at the National Gallery. This is the first retrospective accorded this French painter, who is known mostly to specialists but was well-established in late-18th-century Paris. It was initiated by the Dallas Museum of Art, where it was organized by Eik Kahng (now a curator at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore); the show is going to Dallas in October and the Frick Collection in New York in January. 
The daughter of a goldsmith, who grew up around artists, Vallayer-Coster (1744-1818) was accepted into the French Academie at the age of 26. She was given an apartment at the Louvre (with the intervention of her patron, Queen Marie Antoinette) and her work was acquired by the most discerning collectors of her day. Diderot mentioned her favorably in his review of the Salon exhibition one year and other critics were similarly admiring, although none failed to mention that the artist was a woman. 
Vallayer-Coster excelled at still-life paintings, especially of flowers, which were her most popular subject. The National Gallery show begins with a room of nothing but flower pictures, and while they are breathtakingly exquisite they also seem fussy and rarely match the quiet straightforwardness of Chardin's flower still lifes, one of which is also displayed in the first gallery. 
After this slightly disappointing introduction, the show grows steadily stronger: by its end, with a gallery devoted to still lifes of plums and grapes, you may consider Vallayer-Coster nearly Chardin's equal. That she is a more daring colorist is confirmed by several large still lifes with seashells, coral, lobsters and other sea creatures, riven with pinks and reds, including one completed the year before she died.
The art historian Marianne Roland Michel, whose 1970 monograph on Vallayer-Coster is the only previous book devoted to the artist, has contributed to the catalog a finely detailed new study of her life that is a model of art-historical sleuthing and insight. Also included are essays by Colin B. Bailey, Claire Barry, Laurent Hugues, Melissa Hyde and Ms. Kahng, as well as a list of all the artist's known works -- a total of 159. It is a powerful experience simply to lay hands on this substantial, informative book and wonder how many more might be written about forgotten artists who happened to be women. 

Ron Mueck
Vallayer-Coster was less successful as a portraitist, but the National Gallery show includes a few and they are more than competent. It is interesting to keep her subjects' soft, translucent and vein-tinged complexions in mind as you walk into Ron Mueck's show at the Hirshhorn Museum. 
Mr. Mueck (the name rhymes with Buick) is an Australian-born but London-based sculptor known for making human figures that look startlingly real, except that they are always larger or smaller than human scale. But a great deal of the jaw-dropping effect of Mr. Mueck's art depends upon old-fashioned painting skills: that is, his astounding ability to paint the surfaces of his sculptures, which are made of molded fiberglass, to resemble, almost exactly, real skin -- young or old, smooth or callused, ruddy or pale, whiskered or bare. It is trompe l'oeil in the round, and it also connects Mr. Mueck to other flesh-obsessed English painters, especially Lucian Freud and Stanley Spencer.
This show, the artist's first in an American museum, consists of four sculptures: a giant, bald rotund man who sits in a corner as if sulking; an ancient, undersize woman asleep in bed; a wall sculpture of a smaller-than-life infant whose dangling legs and arms akimbo suggest that he is being lifted by invisible hands, perhaps from his bath; and, best of all, an enormous masklike self-portrait of the artist's sleeping face. Resting horizontally on a pedestal, it can make you feel like a Lilliputian standing next to Gulliver's pillow. 
Mr. Mueck's alterations of human scale distance his sculptures from the viewer. Yet his work creates a sharpened awareness of intimacy and its liberties by dramatizing the unsettling possessiveness and appetite of the gaze. Much of his sculpture's power comes from the way it simply allows us to stare, up close and to our heart's content, at another human being, another life, that isn't really alive and won't respond. It is the kind of intimacy that most of us have only with the bodies of lovers, parents or children; having it in a museum is unnerving. 

'The Adventures of Hamza'
As for painting on flat surfaces, the high point among these shows is the stunning "Adventures of Hamza" at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. (Those who miss it in Washington will have another chance at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in November.) The show brings together 61 of the approximately 200 surviving folios from the 1,400-page "Hamzanama," or "Story of Hamza," including 28 from MAK (Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art) in Vienna that have never been shown in this country.
Commissioned by the great Mogul emperor Akbar in 1557, and completed 15 years later, the "Hamzanama" manuscript set down on paper the daring feats of Hamza, a Muslim folk hero. It also combined Persian, European, Central Asian and Indian pictorial conventions to form one of the great turning points in Indian painting. The folios are relatively small and portable, although at about 26 by 20 inches they are large for Indian paintings. Still, measured in terms of Western painting, the exhibition is comparable to transporting Giotto's frescoes from the Arena Chapel in Padua to an American museum.
The show has been organized by Massumeh Farhad, associate curator of Islamic art at the Freer Gallery and the Sackler, and John Seyller, professor of art history at the University of Vermont. The catalog, by Mr. Seyller, includes contributions from Wheeler M. Thackston, Ebba Koch, Antoinette Owen and Rainald Franz. 
The paintings are almost excessively rich in color, pattern and action. Hamza and his allies do battle, make great escapes, confront demons and sea monsters, traverse stormy oceans, skulk around pinkish mountainsides and vanquish and often dismember their enemies. Almost always fabulously attired, they rendezvous with beautiful princesses and hold strategy meetings in lush gardens and ornate palaces.
Frequently they seem to do most of these things within the space of a single image. Needless to say, that space is amazing, dense as collage, yet pocketed, full of different, coexisting volumes and perspectives. I sought respite in the closest thing to openness -- those pinkish mountainsides and roiling seas, which are black and covered in delicate coils of white. This is an exhibition worth several carefully paced visits. 

'Sienese Painting'
In contrast with the visual overabundance of "Hamza," the Corcoran Gallery of Art's exhibition "Art and Economics: Sienese Painting From the Dawn of the Modern Financial Age" has a slightly paltry feeling. Those expecting to feast on great Sienese painting will be disappointed. This show is more like hors d'oeuvres, and the flavors are sometimes a little surprising. 
The display features roughly 50 examples of bicchernas, the small painted panels that the city of Siena began commissioning from local painters in 1257 to use as covers for civic documents, especially the city's accounting books. Recently cleaned and lent by Siena's city archives, the panels date from 1258 to the early 1600's. 
Dominated by images of bursars, their offices, desks and piles of coins, the panels, enhanced by use, tend toward an endearing crudeness. Some are still banded by the rough leather straps that originally held the documents together.
Especially in the 1300's and 1400's, the bicchernas reflect the changes triggered by the new naturalism of Giotto, and some are, or are thought to be, by artists who contributed to those changes, including Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Sano di Pietro and Giovanni di Paolo.
But names carry little weight in this exhibition, where some of the most engaging paintings are by unknown artists, for example, a blocky little image of the city's cathedral, its black and white marble walls flanked by its terra-cotta roof and piazza. Basically this exhibition gives a worm's-eye, unedited view of early Italian painting, showing us its artisanal roots, along with history's messy sprawl, and it is an oddly invigorating sight.

HEADLINE: Toyota and Chinese Carmaker in Venture 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation signed an agreement here today with China's largest automaker to begin large-scale production of a wide range of models, becoming the latest multinational to place a big bet on China's fast-growing car market.
 Toyota officials said that beginning next summer, the venture would produce about 100,000 minicars a year and 10,000 to 20,000 luxury sport utility vehicles. Toyota and its partner, First Automotive Works, will also build an assembly plant to begin turning out at least 50,000 midsize sedans a year in 2005. 
 Those plans are in addition to another joint venture that Toyota has already set up and that will begin manufacturing 30,000 compact cars a year, starting in October. First Automotive, known as F.A.W., also has an existing partnership, a venture with Volkswagen to build compact cars. 
Fujio Cho, Toyota's president, said at today's signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that his company planned to build 300,000 to 400,000 vehicles a year in China by 2010, a volume equal to nearly half its current output in North America.
"As China joins the World Trade Organization and gets the Olympics, the economy of China will develop quickly and it will become one of the most important markets for Toyota," he said.
Automakers sold nearly 750,000 cars and 750,000 trucks last year in China, making each market almost a 10th the size of the American car and truck markets. But sales have been rising swiftly, especially lately, with car sales up 40 percent so far this year as China's entry into the trade group forced it to lower import tariffs on cars, bringing prices down sharply.
Auto industry experts said that Toyota's deal underlined the large scale of foreign automakers' investments in China, and they warned that the situation could result in the same overcapacity and disappearing profit margins that have afflicted the auto industry in many industrialized countries.
"I knew they had ambitious plans, but that's a huge plan" that Toyota unveiled, said Graeme P. Maxton, the managing director of Autopolis Asia, a consulting firm in Singapore. "This is yet another company with huge ambitions for China, which means there is half a dozen of them all saying the same thing, and they can't all do it.'
Volkswagen, Honda and General Motors have all announced production plans in China similar or close to those of Toyota, while Ford, DaimlerChrysler and BMW are pursuing somewhat smaller ventures.
Japanese automakers face an extra obstacle here: lingering resentment about Japanese atrocities during World War II, when the Japanese army occupied large areas of China. A Japanese court ruled on Tuesday that the army had conducted deadly biological experiments on Chinese civilians, involving the release of bubonic plague and other diseases. But the court decided that surviving victims and relatives of the deceased were not eligible for compensation because of peace treaties concluded at the end of the war, a decision that provoked indignation here.
If the Chinese market does not grow fast enough to absorb all the cars envisioned, some of them could be exported. Honda has said that it would like to export cars from a new factory it will build in Guangdong Province in southern China.
But auto manufacturing is a capital-intensive business in which low-income countries like China have seldom had much success. Assembly plants here still tend to be either fairly high-cost operations that rely heavily on imported parts for lack of domestic suppliers, or else low-cost, low-quality operations selling modest numbers of cars that do not meet international standards for reliability and defect-free appearance. Big American, European and Japanese auto parts companies are setting up operations here as well, however, which could make factories here more competitive by the end of the decade.
Under the agreement, Toyota will provide management expertise, technology, marketing assistance and cash while F.A.W. will provide workers and much of the factories and equipment. Toyota will not take an equity stake in F.A.W.
"The auto industry in China is not fully developed now, but the market is booming, so F.A.W. and Toyota need each other," said Zhu Yanfeng, F.A.W.'s president.
Mr. Cho of Toyota estimated that building or expanding factories to produce 400,000 cars a year would require an investment of 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in other countries, but he said the cost in China had not been calculated.
The compact cars, midsize cars and what Toyota officials described as minivehicles are all to be produced in Tianjin, where F.A.W. is in the process of acquiring a controlling stake in a local car maker. The officials refused to say whether the minivehicles would be cars or some other kind of automobile.
The luxury sport utility vehicles, both large and midsize, are to be made in F.A.W.'s home city of Changchun, where F.A.W. operates an extremely large truck factory.
F.A.W.'s main expertise lies in trucks, for which it is China's dominant producer and one of the world's largest manufacturers. But it has long sold cars as well and has close ties to China's leadership.
Mao Zedong signed one of the first F.A.W. cars while China's prime minister in the early 1970's, Zhou Enlai, sent company managers to Toyota on one of the first overseas trips by Chinese auto managers to learn how cars are built in a capitalist country. Deng Xiaoping used to tour troops on military parades in Tiananmen Square while standing in an open-roofed Red Banner limousine made by F.A.W. China's current president, Jiang Zemin, has visited the company's operations on at least three occasions.

HEADLINE: 2 New Economic Reports Show Signs of Weakness 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Two government reports released today showed that the economic recovery lost momentum in the second quarter and that new claims filed last week for unemployment benefits climbed to their highest level in nearly two months. 
 A Commerce Department report says that after growing at a rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, the economy stumbled in the spring, increasing at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent. 
 The department's latest reading on gross domestic product in the second quarter was unchanged from its initial estimate a month ago. The G.D.P. measures the total value of goods and services produced in the nation. 
In a second report, the Labor Department said that for a third consecutive week, more Americans filed new claims for unemployment insurance.
Although economists were expecting claims to go down, claims rose by 8,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 403,000, their highest point since July 6, when claims hit 407,000. That was also the last time claims exceeded 400,000, the level associated with a weak job market.
"Right now the economy is in desperate need of a labor market revival, and these data don't suggest that is in the cards," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Argus Research Corporation.
The number of unemployed people continuing to collect jobless benefits increased by 90,000, to 3.6 million, for the week ending Aug. 17, the most recent period for which the information is available. That suggested that employers were not doing a lot of hiring, economists said. 
The unemployment rate, now at 5.9 percent, could hit 6.3 or 6.5 percent by fall, they said. 
The G.D.P. report showed that after-tax profits of corporations rose at a rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, down slightly from a 2 percent growth rate in the first quarter. 
Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors called the profits picture decent and said he hoped businesses would become more inclined to invest. 
"That will require a change in corporate attitudes," he said, "from the wait and see to the let's get going."
Consumer spending in the second quarter grew at a rate of 1.9 percent, down from a 3.1 percent growth rate in the first quarter. Businesses cut spending on plants, office buildings and other structures at a rate of 17.7 percent, a deeper cut than initially estimated. But investment in equipment and software, after six consecutive quarters of decline, increased at a rate of 3.1 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Bankers Have Cushion Should Games Stop

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Despite Major League Baseball's industrywide debt of more than $3 billion, several bankers said that reserve funds built into many of the outstanding loans provide a cushion against business lost to a possible players' strike.
 And they said they are unlikely to exert pressure on team owners to settle a strike quickly to guarantee the flow of uninterrupted interest payments. 
 "We've structured all our sports transactions in a way that minimizes risk," said Rob Tilliss, a managing director of J. P. Morgan Chase, which is part of Major League Baseball's $1.3 billion credit line and was the original lender of $170 million to the San Francisco Giants to build Pacific Bell Park. "Our preference is that it be resolved because it's good for our business." 
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking lent the Detroit Tigers $145 million to finance the construction of Comerica Park and is not worried that the team owner, Michael Ilitch, will not make his payments on the two-year-old ballpark, where attendance has fallen 20 percent this season.
"We have significant reserves built into the loan for as long as a strike can last," said Jim Weinstein, a senior vice president of Sumitomo, which is a lender with FleetBoston Financial on the Philadelphia Phillies' stadium, which is to open in 2004. "We've known and they've known for two or three years that this could happen, and we've built up the reserves."
He added: "We scratch our heads when we hear that we'd pressure them to pay if there's a strike. But we never pressure a client over how they do their business. But there's no question they have to pay on time and no question if they don't, they would be in default."
But he said there is no doubt that they will pay because of the reserve. And he sought to minimize how much Ilitch owes the bank in interest.
"They have $130 million outstanding," Weinstein said. "What's that, $8 million or $9 million a year? That's less than the Tigers will pay Bobby Higginson next year."
In a strike, owners will lose game and local television revenues but will not have to pay salaries.
The so-called "sinking funds" in loans like Sumitomo's require that the borrowers put money in reserve to cover interest if they cannot otherwise pay. As loan balances decrease, the reserve funds shrink.
"Most of the loans we've seen are structured to provide for unforeseen events," Dan Champeau, managing director of Fitch Ratings, a credit rating service that has reviewed more than $8 billion in debt in the four major sports leagues since 1990. "The industry standard includes reserve funds, but we haven't reviewed debt that's been used to pay player salaries."
The $170 million Pac Bell loan that J. P. Morgan sold in 1997 to a group of insurers led by the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association also contains reserves dedicated to paying interest.
"Teachers likes the long-term nature and stability of that kind of asset," Tilliss said at J. P. Morgan, which is also a lender to several teams.
The $1.3 billion credit line -- which is run by FleetBoston Bank -- is similarly protected and is secured by payments from baseball's national television deal with Fox Sports.
"The Fleet reserves are well in excess of $150 million," Weinstein said, and we expect another $100 million in November."
Fox must continue to pay baseball in the event of a strike, even if it causes the cancellation of the World Series. But within 12 months, baseball would have to repay Fox the estimated $300 million and possibly $230 million more when an arbitrator rules on damages to Fox.
As for what payment protection exists in borrowings for a recent purchase of a team, like that of the Boston Red Sox, the team's president, Larry Lucchino, would not comment. A group led by John Henry acquired the team, Fenway Park and an 80 percent interest in the New England Sports Network for $660 million earlier this year.
Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a sports finance consultant, said there is a level of comfort within baseball about teams being unable to pay debt through a strike. "Bankers led by Fleet have been in close contact with Selig, going back one or two years," he said.
Despite protections built into most loans, there are still financial risks posed by a strike. If a strike cancels the postseason and continues into next season, Champeau said that baseball risks the anger of national and local sponsors who may pull out of the sport or demand reductions in their fees. The next local and national TV deals could be slashed. 
Reduced revenues from those sources could slow the owners' cash flow, and they would have to find other sources to finance their working capital with so much money already dedicated to paying loans.
Sal Galatioto, who heads sports lending at Lehman Brothers, said: "The problem isn't loans to healthier teams, but loans or debt to marginal ones. The Tampa Bays have real trouble getting debt under any circumstances. So most teams will be fine, but one or two will have problems if the strike goes past the World Series. If the strike continues to opening day, and some loan reserves go away, lenders will get more nervous."

HEADLINE: Blunt Portrait Drawn of the U.S. Work Force in 2020 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Demographic changes threaten to hamstring economic growth and widen inequality in incomes in the next several decades, according to a report being released today by a nonpartisan group of leaders from government, universities and the private sector.
 In its report, the group, the Aspen Institute, offers some stark forecasts for the quality and quantity of the American work force. The report says that economic growth will be hampered by changes in the population and in education levels. 
 The next 20 years, the report says, will strike a sharp contrast with the last 20 years. For example, higher fertility rates and women working in greater numbers helped the labor force grow 50 percent from 1980 to 2000. Over the next 20 years, the labor force may grow as little as 16 percent, the report says, as fertility rates decline, women's participation in the work force levels off and baby boomers begin to retire. 
At the same time, the number of native-born workers from ages 25 to 54 will not grow at all in the next two decades. And although the share of workers with any post-high-school education rose 19 percentage points in the last two decades, it will probably increase only four percentage points by 2020, potentially curtailing growth in labor productivity.
David T. Ellwood, a professor of economics at Harvard University who directed the report, said the forecasts on native-born workers and education should be right on target. Those future workers have already been born, and many have finished their formal education. The combination of reduced growth in the work force in both numbers and education levels "suggest a very serious slowdown in economic growth," Mr. Ellwood said.
He declined to predict how much the economy's potential for growth could drop as a result of the changes in the work force. Standard estimates of labor's contribution to the economy suggest that the growth of gross domestic product could slow as much as a percentage point a year -- up to a third of annual growth -- absent any changes in policy.
In addition, Mr. Ellwood said, a rising premium on skilled workers could further polarize incomes. "Industry needs more skilled workers," he said, "and if the supply doesn't keep pace with that, wages become more disparate as skilled workers get paid more and less-skilled workers get paid less."
The gap between incomes already widened sharply from 1970 to 2000, according to census data tabulated for the report.
The wave of change in the labor force has been a long time coming, but the report may be the first to consider the broader economic effect. "Everyone understands that the aging of the population has really worrisome features for Social Security," Mr. Ellwood said, "but no one's thought through what it means for the larger economy."
On Wall Street, at least, that statement may ring true.
"We've looked at demographic questions, but we frankly haven't looked at this particular one," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. The slowing growth of the labor force is not a surprise, he said, but the potential for slower productivity growth is a concern. He noted, however, that on-the-job training could sometimes substitute for formal education in promoting productivity gains.
Members of the committee sponsoring the report acknowledged that warnings of labor scarcity might not attract much attention in a slowdown but that the tight labor markets of the 1990's could soon return.
"Before the current economy, you were experiencing all those shortages," said James E. Oesterreicher, a member of the committee, who retired as chairman and chief executive of J. C. Penney in 2000. "Now they've lessened a little bit, but they're going to come back. There's going to be a scarcity both in quantity and in skill level."
Mr. Oesterreicher said the labor and skills shortages could hit medicine, nursing and high technology the hardest. His former field, retailing, is already having problems, he added.
The report points out that only immigration and later retirements will be able to swell the ranks of America's workers in the years ahead. From 1996 to 2001, foreign-born workers accounted for 89 percent of the growth in workers from ages 25 to 54 and for 53 percent of the growth in workers with doctoral or professional degrees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
To keep skill levels improving and productivity growing, the report suggests enlarging government training programs and strengthening their links to employers. The Labor Department, said Sue Hensley, a spokeswoman, is working with businesses to ensure that its programs develop useful skills and that jobs await workers who finish the programs. About 669,000 Americans participated in major training initiatives financed by the department in 2001.
Mr. McKelvey suggested that companies might respond by intensifying their own training programs and by seeking skilled workers abroad. Foreign workers no longer have to leave their homes, he noted, to work for American companies.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Extends Lease of a Renamed Newark Airport 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved the terms of a lease yesterday to extend its operation of Newark International Airport to 2065, and agreed to rename the airport Newark Liberty International in honor of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack.
 The lease approval will also cover the extension of the port agency's operation of Port Newark, one of the maritime ports on Newark Bay through which the region's container cargo passes. All that remains, said officials of both Newark and the Port Authority, is the final drafting of the leases. 
 The authority's payments to the city will include a $165 million cash settlement for longstanding disputes -- money that could provide Newark with financing to help build a long-sought arena for the New Jersey Nets and Devils.
The proposal for the $355 million arena has been hung up in the Legislature under three governors as South Jersey and suburban lawmakers have balked at any state support for the urban arena or assistance to the wealthy owners of sports teams. It now appears possible that Newark can close the deal with the teams' owner, YankeeNets, to build the arena without needing legislative approval. 
The extension of the current airport lease, which is due to expire in 2031, would make it easier for the authority to borrow about $3.8 billion over the long term for improvements and other investments at Newark International, the region's busiest airport. Jack G. Sinagra, chairman of the Port Authority, said the agreement "is fair and equitable and it allows the Port Authority to plan future investments at the airport that will not only improve service but also strengthen the region's economy."
But just as important, agency officials said privately, is the hope that the increased rent to Newark and up-front payments to end the disputes will serve as a template for lease extensions at New York's La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports. 
Those leases, which had been the subject of dispute and rancor between the authority and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, will expire in 2015. The agency has already encountered problems in financing projects there because of the uncertainty whether the city will take over the airports' operations, as it had threatened to do.
The authority's approval of the lease terms comes nearly a week after Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and members of his City Council, faced with a budget gap, unanimously approved the same terms. That settlement would increase the annual rent that the city receives from the port agency from $35 million last year to a base of $65 million. The increase will allow the city to close gaping holes in its budget this year as well as insulate property owners from the impact of a long-delayed revaluation of their property.
The amount would be reviewed every five years and increase as gross revenues of the airport rise.
In addition there would be a cash windfall of $165 million and it is that amount that many expect will be used to help finance a proposed arena in the city for the New Jersey Nets and Devils.
Last week Gov. James E. McGreevey and Gov. George E. Pataki first announced that they would seek to rename the airport Liberty International, to honor the victims of Sept. 11 terrorism. But as opposition grew to the elimination of the city's name, Mayor James negotiated the compromise name of Newark Liberty International Airport as part of the lease talks.

HEADLINE: Improvement, Albeit Slight, Is Noted in Indian Point Safety 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
Federal regulators announced yesterday that the new owner of the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant has made improvements there significant enough to raise the plant's dismal safety rating, if only slightly.
 The plant, on the Hudson River in Buchanan, Westchester County, had the worst safety rating of the country's 103 commercial nuclear power plants. But in a report released yesterday by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Indian Point 2 was listed among the six worst in terms of safety. 
Still, the report was mostly positive, and it provides a timely boost to the image of Indian Point, which the Entergy Corporation bought from Consolidated Edison in September. While Entergy officials hailed the report as a milestone, opponents dismissed it as insignificant. 
Especially after Sept. 11, many environmentalists and politicians have called to have the plant closed, warning that a terrorist attack or a plant malfunction could be catastrophic, spewing radiation many miles around the plant, which is 30 miles from Manhattan.
But that opposition seems to have lost some momentum this summer. Almost a year after Sept. 11, public apprehension about another attack has lessened, and the fear of Indian Point's being a terrorist target has become a less effective rallying cry for the plant's opponents.
Meanwhile, Entergy has been campaigning to convince the public that the plant is safe. The company has mounted a public relations drive that includes broadcast ads referring to Indian Point 2 as an "energy center" rather than a nuclear plant and repeating its new slogan, "Safe, Secure, Vital." The company has encouraged the plant's 1,460 employees to attest publicly to its safety.
Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, called the report crucial in notifying the public about the plant's safety. "People can start feeling better about Indian Point because it's a safe place," he said. "The federal regulator has said so itself, and that's important to us and the community. We feel we can improve further and be one of the best-rated plants in the country."
But foes of the plant dismissed much of the report. Kelly MacMillan, a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, whose district includes Buchanan, warned that "we can't lose sight of the fact that this is still an unsafe plant with an evacuation plan that cannot protect the public health and safety."
She added, "Going from the worst-rated plant in the nation to just one of worst rated in the nation isn't cause to feel there has been a great victory for the safety of the people, economy and natural resources surrounding the plant." 
According to the report, eight federal inspectors spent a month studying Indian Point 2 this summer and concluded that Entergy had operated the plant safely and made progress in addressing its "underlying performance issues," including equipment operation, engineering methods and oversight by senior management.
The report commended Entergy for addressing weaknesses that had led to two major malfunctions: a steam generator tube failure in February 2000 and an unexpected reactor shutdown in August 1999. These two incidents led to the poor rating.
The biggest current flaw cited in the report was weakness in a wall intended to protect the plant's central control room in case of fire.
Alex Matthiessen, executive director of the environmental group Riverkeeper, said: "The report does nothing to address the fact that Indian Point is a potential terrorist target and poses an enormous risk to the 21 million people living in the New York metropolitan area."
While the report makes no specific mention of how the plant would withstand a terrorist attack, Mr. Steets, the company spokesman, said that breaking through the reactor was virtually impossible, especially with recent security improvements.

HEADLINE: Growth Up in Japan in Quarter, But Pace Already Seems to Fade 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Japan's economy grew moderately in the April-June quarter, the first expansion in more than a year, thanks to rising exports and an increase in consumer spending, but the tepid figures suggest the country's mild recovery is already losing momentum. 
 The figures, the first to be calculated using a new method that the government said would improve their precision, show that Japan remains dependent for its economic health on growth in its export markets, especially the United States. 
 With many of those markets flagging Japan's six-month-old economic expansion risks collapse. 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is under pressure to find ways to increase growth at home and limit the country's vulnerability to any slowing of exports. So far, his efforts have been complicated by infighting between politicians who want more public-works spending and ministry officials who want to reduce the budget deficit and pay down debt. Analysts say the jumble of tax cuts being considered has little chance of spurring new growth. 
Instead, Japan will probably trundle anemically along until either growth gathers steam overseas, or a banking crisis or other internally generated calamity sends the economy into a tailspin. 
In the three months to June, the economy expanded just 0.5 percent, or 1.9 percent at an annual rate. Net exports and consumer spending rose while capital spending and government outlays declined. When the new formula for calculating national accounts, which uses additional data on spending and reduces the emphasis on production, was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2002, government statisticians found less growth than had been reported earlier. Instead of expanding at a 5.7 percent annual rate, the economy stood still in the period, under the new reckoning.
Another crucial gauge of the health of manufacturers, industrial production, slipped 0.4 percent in July from June, the government said.
The economy's tepid performance has been made worse by falling prices, which erode profits and make debts more burdensome. Five years of deflation have highlighted what economists here call the three excesses plaguing Japanese companies: too many workers, too many assets and too much debt. To raise cash to pay creditors, companies are closing factories and eliminating jobs, and even companies earning solid profits, like Toyota Motor, are freezing wages.
As unemployment rises -- it stood at a near-record 5.4 percent in July, the government reported separately today -- consumers, in turn, are closing their wallets. Retail sales fell 5.7 percent in July from July 2001 as household incomes fell 4 percent.
"How can you spend money when salaries are going down and unemployment is going up?" asked Akio Makabe, a senior economist at the Mizuho Research Institute. "Exports are the only thing supporting the economy these days."
Mr. Makabe expects these conditions to continue for another year or two at least. Other analysts estimate that companies still need to eliminate about two million more jobs, or 5 percent of the work force, to reach efficient levels. Under such conditions, employers are doing little new recruiting -- the number of workers hired has fallen for 10 consecutive months -- and college graduates and other new entrants to the work force are left to scramble for lower-paying part-time jobs.
Managers are also reducing their capital spending plans. Over all, companies spent 0.5 percent less on factories, equipment and other capital goods in the quarter ended June 30 than in the quarter of 2001. Even exporters enjoying strong overseas demand, like automakers and electronics manufacturers, find sales at home muted. And primary industries like steel and chemicals are running at well below capacity.
Many of these industrial companies are also swimming in debt. On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service lowered the credit ratings of four of the country's largest machinery makers. Moody's cited heavy debt loads and shrinking demand for the ships, power plants and other heavy machinery they build.
Currency shifts also present a challenge. Japanese exporters have been hurt by a rise of almost 12 percent since March in the value of the yen, making their products less competitive and their foreign sales less lucrative. Recently, the yen has nearly reached 115 to the dollar, a common break-even point for automakers and electronics companies that earn the bulk of their profits overseas. The government has spent trillions of yen intervening to keep the exchange rate from breaching that level.
The threat that a strong yen poses to the profits of exporters has also helped take the shine off the Japanese stock market, which earlier this year had been rallying. Worries about the yen and about a looming slowdown in the United States helped send the benchmark Nikkei 225 index down on Thursday to 9,620.14, just 200 points above the post-bubble low it set in February.
With stocks so weak, huge losses may loom for the country's banks, which must revalue their portfolios to reflect market prices when the first half of the Japanese fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Banks are trying to compensate for these expected losses by charging more for loans and cutting off delinquent borrowers. The policy has led to a surge in bankruptcy filings in a country where, for decades, banks habitually propped up teetering borrowers as long as possible.
"The problems in the banking system affect the entire economy," said Rieko McCarthy, a credit analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. Noting that some 22 percent of bank loans are nonperforming, he said, "Unfortunately, the country doesn't have the tools to withstand it."

Boeing Declines to Resume Talks With Its Machinists
With 25,000 machinists ready to walk out on Monday, Boeing has rebuffed a request to resume negotiations that a mediator made in the hope of averting a strike. The mediator had asked Boeing and the union to meet because he had "determined that any job action threatens" to disrupt commerce.
 Negotiators with the International Association of Machinists agreed to resume talks and said the union would postpone a strike for 30 days. But Boeing surprised the union by declining. "There is nothing left to negotiate," the company said. Page A12.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
It's Game 7, Ninth Inning For Baseball

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Operating in a bargaining mode 180 degrees from their last labor confrontation, negotiators for baseball's owners and players struggled all day yesterday to work out their economic differences and avert a strike that threatens games beginning with today's schedule.
 In 1994, the two sides were so far apart and the situation was so hopeless that negotiators did not even meet the day before the players walked out. But yesterday the series of bargaining sessions conducted at the offices of both Major League Baseball and the union in Midtown Manhattan produced movement on the key issue of a tax on the biggest payrolls. 
 "Both sides have moved toward each other," a baseball official said early last evening. But one negotiator acknowledged minutes later that the two sides were moving like snails. 
Gene Orza, the union's No. 2 official, was mobbed by reporters and forced into the street when he emerged shortly after 8 p.m. from the Park Avenue building that houses the commissioner's office.
"I don't want to mislead anybody," he said. "We're doing O.K., but we still have significant differences."
Asked if any potential deal-breaking issues were on the table, he said: "Oh sure, potentially. But they are not the kind of differences that if there's a will to make an agreement, they would stop the talks."
The negotiators had no precise time against which they were working. The first game on today's schedule is between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cubs in Chicago, beginning at 3:20 p.m. Eastern time. The union has not set a time by which a deal would have to be reached for that game to be played, but it would have to be at least a few hours before game time.
The union has instructed players not to go to Wrigley Field, or any other ballpark, unless there is an agreement.
Negotiators, who continued to talk past midnight, were expected to meet through the night and into the morning in an effort to play that game and the 14 other games that are on tonight's schedule.
"We're just going to keep working," said Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer and lead negotiator. "I've been prepared to stay for the night all week."
Before taking part in a late-night union conference call, Mike Stanton, the Yankees' player representative, said: "They're going to stay there as long as it takes. Hopefully, we'll be able to avoid tomorrow."
For most of the recent bargaining sessions, including those held yesterday morning and afternoon, two-member teams met with each other. But just before 9:30 p.m. last night, Donald Fehr, the union chief, led a six-member contingent, including two players, Tom Glavine and B. J. Surhoff, to the commissioner's office.
Before that bargaining session began, with three people from each side, Fehr and the players met with Commissioner Bud Selig for five or 10 minutes. Selig later said it was a social visit. "It was nice," he said.
Asked what he thought about the chances for an agreement, Selig said: "We'll see. I don't know. I really don't. I'm hopeful."
Earlier, Selig had a conference call with the owners' executive council, and a club official who was not on the call said he had been told that some of those on the call sensed that the commissioner would let the negotiations run through the night, then conclude a deal.
The remaining 31 days and 438 games of the season plus the playoffs and the World Series were at stake in the talks. The players' strike in 1994 wiped out the last 52 days and 669 games, the playoffs and the World Series, then shortened the 1995 season, too, by 23 days and 252 games.
The danger inherent in a walkout is that after each side has given more than either wanted to give, bargaining positions could harden.
"If there is a strike," said one person who is involved in the talks, "we won't talk for a long time, maybe longer than '94."
In 1994, the owners' attempt to get a cap on payrolls prompted the players to strike. On the day before that strike, when reports circulated that the owners might back off their cap position, a management official vehemently denied any such intention.
"Players have a choice," Fehr, the union leader then and now, told a news conference the day before the last day of games that year. "Take a salary-cap proposal now, take it after the season because they impose it, or strike. The owners have very deliberately left the players no choices at all."
That was not the case yesterday. The union began the negotiations not wanting a tax on payrolls, known as a luxury tax, saying that in combination with the revenue-sharing plan it could serve as a payroll cap of its own. Management has acknowledged wanting the tax as a means of retarding salaries.
The union has come to accept the idea of a luxury tax and has also lowered the threshold that would trigger the tax. When yesterday's bargaining sessions began, the union was at $120 million for the first year of a luxury tax, the clubs at $112 million. As the day progressed, a person familiar with developments said, the two sides moved closer with their thresholds.
The movement came after the two sides hit a snag Wednesday night that prompted one negotiator to say at the time that there was no reason for optimism. However, the negotiators apparently overcame the problem yesterday.
The two sides had also been far apart on tax rates for a luxury tax. They agreed that clubs would be charged a higher tax each time they exceeded the threshold and that the tax would be assessed on the portions of payrolls over the threshold, but they had vastly different ideas of how steep the taxes should be.
"We're talking about different structures, different grids," a management official said of the rates.
The sides also differed on a luxury tax in the fourth year of a new agreement. The clubs said they had to have it; the union said they had to have the year without a tax. But the management official said the union had begun discussing the possibility of agreeing to a tax in the fourth and final year of the agreement.
Based on this season's payrolls, as computed for a luxury tax, the Yankees ($171.2 million) would pay the tax under either side's plan. The clubs had wanted the clubs with the seven highest payrolls to have to pay the tax, but as they inched upward with their threshold, they figured to lose one or two teams.
Negotiators also had to complete their bargaining on the plan under which poorer teams would receive a percentage of the local revenue of richer teams. The clubs were seeking an annual average of $252 million to $258 million to be transferred, and it was very likely they would get it, or at least come close to it, if a final settlement on the luxury tax were closer to the union's liking.
Also at issue was the owners' contraction plan. An arbitrator has held off ruling on the union's grievance challenging the owners' attempt to eliminate two teams, and the two sides have been trying to resolve that dispute through negotiation.
The White House had no plans to become involved. "This is something the players and owners need to resolve," said Scott McClellan, the White House deputy press secretary.
Later, after speaking with President Bush, the former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, McClellan said, "The owners and players need to keep in mind not only what a strike would do to the future of baseball, but also what it would to America during a time of national unity and national spirit."

To the Editor:
 If, as Bjorn Lomborg asserts (Op-Ed, Aug. 26), for the same amount the Kyoto climate treaty would have cost just the United States every year "we could provide every person in the world with access to basic health, education, family planning and water and sanitation services," what is our excuse for not doing exactly that since we have not signed on to this treaty? 
 Until we see action in this area of humanitarianism, let's not talk about the United States' "moral high ground."

To the Editor:
 How did Bjorn Lomborg (Op-Ed, Aug. 26) tally the cost of climate change? Did he add in the cost of the increased droughts, fires and hurricanes that we're likely to see? How about lost crops, fish migration, the disruption of breeding grounds, the death of coral reefs? How did he value a nice view, a river that is safe to swim in? 
 It's a mistake to regard the term "global warming" as the end-all of environmental consequence. It's about much more than average global temperatures. Let's use "regional fluctuations from the norm, with increasing magnitude and frequency." Then we've introduced a whole host of other issues.

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: THE DETROIT CONNECTION; 
Informer Is Cited as the Key To Unlocking a Terrorist Cell

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
For nearly a year, the three foreigners picked up at an apartment here a week after the Sept. 11 attacks seemed like just another group of Arab men caught up in the government dragnet. They languished in prison while facing charges that seemed minor; federal agents had actually been looking for the previous occupant when they raided the apartment.
 But at least one thing appears to have separated the Detroit trio from hundreds of other Arabs swept up by the government in the last year: a cooperative witness. A fourth Arab man who once lived with the men and who had been charged in the case appears to have become a witness against the other three and is playing a critical role in the government's case. 
 The picture painted by the indictment issued on Wednesday by a federal grand jury is of a busy terrorist cell working hard to avert suspicion. The men used fake names to open post office boxes and had phony visas so authentic-looking that one veteran investigator of visa frauds said he could not tell the visas were bogus, and they even enlisted a "mentally unstable man" to disguise their notes, federal court filings show. 
Much of this evidence comes from an apartment on Norman Street in Detroit which was once the residence of Nabil al-Marabh, who the government believed had ties to Al Qaeda. It was Mr. al-Marabh, 35, that federal agents were looking for when they raided the apartment on Sept. 17. His name was still on the mailbox.
Instead, they found the three men who were indicted on Wednesday as being part of a terrorist conspiracy: Karim Koubriti, 24, and Ahmed Hannan, 34, both Moroccans, and Farouk Ali-Haimoud, 22, an Algerian. A fourth man from Chicago and known as Abdella was also indicted. He is still at large.
The Detroit case has been aggressively investigated by federal authorities since last September when the men were first arrested. The case has stirred debate within the government, government officials said. Some officials have hinted that they suspected the men had ties to Al Qaeda, but others have said that no evidence has emerged to show any definitive connection. 
The indictment paints the men as operating a terrorist cell, though no definitive connections to Al Qaeda are revealed. None of the men are now suspected of knowing in advance of the Sept. 11 attacks, government officials said. 
While the men are regarded by counterterrorism officials as low-level operatives, the charges against them are serious, particularly an accusation that they conspired to provide material support for terrorism against the United States. 
Some officials said today that the case was important but not a breakthrough in understanding terror operations in the United States. The indictment provides little information about the nature of the terror operation that the men are accused of supporting, nor does it indicate how far plans for an attack had progressed.
Investigators did find in the Norman Street apartment a cache of material they considered suspicious, including audiotapes that preached jihad, notes suggesting a plot against William S. Cohen, the former secretary of defense, and a cache of phony ID documents. The indictment said investigators also found a videotape that had surveillance footage of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.
It remains unclear whether the material belonged to the three men or to Mr. al-Marabh.
Mr. Koubriti, one of the three men, implicated a fifth man, Youssef Hmimssa, whose picture was found among forged identity documents. Mr. Koubriti said that a day planner that contained notation in Arabic referring to an American airbase in Turkey, the American foreign minister and an airport in Jordan, belonged to Mr. Hmimssa. 
Mr. Koubriti and Mr. Hmimssa had lived together in Dearborn. Mr. Hmimssa was arrested shortly after the first raid, on Sept. 28, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
Kevin Ernst, a lawyer for Mr. Ali-Haimoud, said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Hmimssa was cooperating with the government. 
"The only difference between October of last year, when the government dismissed the charges against my client because there was no evidence, and today, when they issued the superseding indictments, is one snitch," Mr. Ernst said referring to Mr. Hmimssa.
Mr. Hmimssa's lawyer, Stephen Rabaut, did not return calls. Government officials would not say whether he was an informer.
Jim Thomas, a lawyer for Mr. Hannan, said his client had been held since Sept. 17 without a bond. "He is still, in the face of these very serious charges, presumed to be innocent," Mr Thomas said. "The trial will be scheduled hopefully for some time in January and at that time we expect to have a full and fair hearing in front of impartial jury."
While the case against the three men in Detroit has grown more serious, the case against Mr. al-Marabh, the initial target, appears to be winding down. Mr. al-Marabh, who is being held at a prison in Batavia, N.Y., is likely to be deported to Algeria after pleading guilty to illegally entering the country.
"We brought an immigration violation charge against him; that charge does not contain any evidence linking him terrorism," Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said. 
In the indictment against the other men, the government says they were part of a terrorist cell that provided support to other operatives, recruited members, collected intelligence on potential targets and cased the Detroit Metropolitan Airport while all three worked there. 
Part of the men's intent was to "cause economic harm to U.S. businesses," the indictment said, and previous documents said they planned an "economic jihad."
The men went to some length to conceal their plan, it said. They used a "mentally unstable man" to try to disguise their writings in a notebook. They used the man, who is not identified in the indictment, to write his name and personal information on some of the notebook pages found in the apartment, which contained plans and sketches of an American airbase in Turkey and a Jordanian hospital. They also had the man temporarily hold on to the notebooks.
It appears that they also had high-quality false ID documents. 
Edward Seitz, a special agent for the State Department who has investigated visa fraud for 14 years, testified at an April hearing that one of the visas was so authentic looking that he had to check the agency's database to find out if it was fraudulent.
"It was of such a quality that to the naked eye it would have probably passed," Mr. Seitz said. "It would have passed me."

HEADLINE: China Expected to Sell Stakes To Foreign Companies 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The Chinese government is likely to allow the sale of government stakes in publicly traded state-controlled enterprises to foreign companies, a senior regulator said here today, signaling what could be the next big step in China's movement toward a market economy.
 Wang Jianxi, assistant chairman for international policy, futures trading and accounting at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, also said in an interview at his office today that China would give permission to multinational corporations to sell shares in their Chinese operations to Chinese citizens. 
 Taken together, the two measures outlined by Mr. Wang would draw China more into the global economy and give the country's securities markets a considerably greater role in bringing Western investment and management practices to businesses. 
As China's leaders prepare for the 16th Communist Party Congress early in November, when many current leaders are expected to retire, high-level expressions of interest in international investment like Mr. Wang's are also a sign that this country remains committed to a market-directed economy.
Dennis Zhu, managing director of investment banking in China for J. P. Morgan Chase, said that while there was little interest yet by multinationals in selling stock in China, the sale of government stakes in state-controlled enterprises would have "tremendous" effects. Although the government had given no hint until today that it was ready for such sales, foreign companies have been evaluating many state-controlled enterprises anyway, he said.
"Based on the inquiries, we've got, you will see quite wide interest," Mr. Zhu added.
While some of China's largest state-controlled enterprises are traded on stock exchanges in New York and Hong Kong, where foreigners can buy shares, more than 1,000 are traded only on the A-share stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, in which foreigners are not allowed to invest. These include large companies like Baoshan Iron and Steel, Xugong Science and Technology and Shanghai Automotive.
The total value of the shares in these businesses is about $450 billion. A third of the shares, or $150 billion worth, is held by Chinese citizens and can be traded. The government holds the remaining two-thirds, worth some $300 billion, which are designated "nontradable." 
The Beijing authorities -- faced with a large budget deficit, a shaky banking system and a public pension system with virtually no reserves -- have been looking for a way to sell some of the government-owned shares to raise money.
But the domestic stock markets have fallen steeply in the last year, giving up huge previous gains that may have been created in part by speculators' market manipulation. So, regulators reluctantly promised early this summer not to sell any more government-owned shares on the exchanges for fear of driving stock prices down even further.
Mr. Wang said today that the government was "likely" to allow the sale of such stakes instead to the Chinese subsidiaries and to joint ventures of international companies.
China's State Council -- effectively the nation's cabinet and the highest level of the government, though subject to being superseded by the Communist Party leadership -- now bans foreign companies and individuals from owning stakes in Chinese companies traded on the A-share markets. The authorities are still reviewing whether to lift the ban but are likely to do so, Mr. Wang said.
"We should allow the foreign-funded companies here to acquire nontradable, state-owned shares," he said.
The securities commission fills the roles here that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission together serve in the United States. Within the Chinese bureaucracy, the commission has tended to support greater foreign investment in China. But officials in this country are usually wary of predicting that something is likely to happen unless the idea has already attracted broad official support.
China is expected to sell only minority stakes in the publicly traded state-controlled enterprises to foreigners, and would most likely require that the stakes be held for long periods as strategic investments, although the rules for any such sales have not yet been drafted. 
It already allows foreign companies to buy stakes in state-owned enterprises that are not publicly traded, or that are traded on the very small B-share markets, which are open to foreign investors. But many state-owned enterprises that are not listed on exchanges have not issued shares because they are either small or, in many cases, virtually bankrupt -- making them unattractive to investors.
A few are in good shape, however, and Shenzhen's municipal government coincidentally announced on Wednesday that it would sell stakes in five local nontraded companies by tender to international investors.
While there are some struggling state-controlled enterprises on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, the exchanges also list many of the country's healthiest enterprises. With China's economy growing at 7 percent a year, these businesses, often with nationally known brand names and excellent distribution networks, have drawn hungry looks from executives of multinational corporations.
Investment bankers and economists said that the toughest part of selling nontradable shares could lie in deciding how much to charge for them. The A shares in Chinese companies typically sell at a steep multiple to corporate earnings, in part because of the scarcity created by the government's ownership of two-thirds of the shares. Foreign investors may balk at paying such a premium, but if they are offered a discount, then the Chinese investors might object.
Selling nontradable shares to foreign investors could also depress China's domestic markets, though not as much as a direct sale of extra shares on those markets. Western experts say that some foreign businesses have managed to buy a small number of A shares by supplying the money to individual Chinese or companies who then buy the shares. This source of investment, while apparently modest, could dry up if foreign enterprises are allowed to acquire shares directly from the government.
Mr. Zhu said that the government might also be reluctant to sell shares in companies in strategic sectors, like energy, even if these companies were especially attractive to foreign investors.
The Chinese officials' willingness to let multinational companies sell stock here also shows a philosophical change by financial regulators, even if the multinationals are not actually lining up to do so. Until the last year or two, regulators here mostly thought that domestic savings should be invested in domestic enterprises.
Mr. Wang said that multinationals should be interested in selling stock in China in their Chinese operations because this would allow them to raise money in the local currency, the renminbi, instead of exposing themselves to the exchange-rate risks inherent in financing domestic operations with fully tradable foreign currencies.
He added that a consumer goods multinational with a listing here would also receive widespread media coverage that would serve as free advertising, saying he hoped that the first foreign company would list on a Chinese market by the end of the year.
But Pauline Dan, director of I.G. Investment Management (Hong Kong), a large fund management business, said that foreign companies would be wary of going to the trouble and the risk of listing in China. 
"They do not want to expose to competitors their operations and the profit margins they're earning in China," she said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, Calling His Own TV Ads Ineffective, Intensifies Attack on McCall 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo intensified his attacks against H. Carl McCall today in the third debate of the Democratic gubernatorial campaign, raising familiar complaints about Mr. McCall's performance as state comptroller but using stronger language than he has on the campaign trail.
 Mr. Cuomo's assault came amid some signs of disarray in his campaign, 11 days before the Sept. 10 primary. For the first time, he criticized his own tactics, saying his television commercials have not been effective. But he declined to detail any impending change. 
 "I believe my advertisement has not communicated the message of the campaign well enough," Mr. Cuomo said after the debate when asked to elaborate on similar comments that appeared today in The New York Post.
Mr. McCall generally did not reply in kind, and acted the front-runner that polls suggest he is. Adding to his confidence, Mr. McCall received an endorsement today from the editorial board of The Daily News, the first major newspaper to weigh in on the primary race.
Mr. McCall's supporters are already looking beyond the primary, with one key advocate, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, calling on Mr. Cuomo and his choice for lieutenant governor, Charlie King, to get out of the race now. Mr. Rangel, in an interview, said such a move would allow Mr. McCall to conserve resources he will need in the general election.
"They don't want to be remembered for having derailed Carl McCall by having him spending all this money on television that he needs in the general election," Mr. Rangel said. "If they believe that they should be concerned about the general election, and if they believe that they should become heroes instead of villains," then they should get out of the race, he said.
But during the debate both candidates seemed engaged in the race, although on different tracks.
True to form, Mr. McCall reserved most of his criticism for George E. Pataki, the Republican governor who is seeking a third term, and dismissed Mr. Cuomo's attacks.
"I don't think there's really any need to take him on," Mr. McCall said at public television station WXXI after the debate, which was sponsored by WXXI, WORK, the ABC station here, and The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle and broadcast on PBS and ABC affiliates statewide.
But on the eve of the pivotal Labor Day weekend, when campaigns often ratchet up, Mr. Cuomo seemed eager to take on Mr. McCall during the hourlong discussion.
Time and again, he said Mr. McCall had not done enough as manager of the state's pension funds to invest that money in causes like upstate economic development or affordable housing. And whenever Mr. McCall criticized Mr. Pataki's record on education, budgeting, campaign finance reform or the Rockefeller-era drug laws, Mr. Cuomo turned that into an attack on the comptroller.
"When you listen to the comptroller speak, it sounds like he hasn't been in Albany the last nine years," said Mr. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary. At one point, addressing Mr. McCall directly, he said: "Stop the excuses. Stop the reasons why you couldn't do anything for nine years. You were there."
Later, he said: "My opponents, both Governor Pataki and Comptroller McCall, were there for the past eight years. If they didn't do it over the past eight years, what makes you think they're going to do it over the next four years?"
When Mr. McCall raised other issues, like his experience as president of New York City's Board of Education, Mr. Cuomo seized on them, too.
"The comptroller was the head of the Board of Education in New York City, and look what happened," he said. "Scores went down in all 32 districts and class size went up." In truth, test scores were mixed during Mr. McCall's 1991-1993 tenure, with some grades improving and others falling behind.
Mr. Cuomo's aides said the criticism of his own ads reflected his frustration at the campaign's attempts to soften his aggressive image, a strategy that has precluded him from taking on Mr. McCall more forcefully.
It was not the only potential point of frustration for his campaign.
Douglas Harriman Kennedy, a son of Robert F. Kennedy and a brother of Mr. Cuomo's wife, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, said in an interview that he believed his father would have discouraged Mr. Cuomo from running.
"I think Carl McCall's story would have moved my father greatly," said Mr. Kennedy, 35, a reporter for Fox television in New York. "I think the mix between his political and business experience was everything my father advocated. And I think Carl McCall's story would have touched him in his heart."
Mr. Kennedy, who had first voiced his opinions to Mr. Rangel, added: 'I believe that if my father were alive, he would have asked Andrew not to run."

HEADLINE: Panel Advises Bloomberg To Sell Stock 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The city's Conflicts of Interest Board yesterday urged Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to sell all of his stocks, along with his interests in a hedge fund, within 90 days because the holdings -- valued at possibly tens of millions of dollars or more -- violated a provision of the City Charter.
 The board spent more than eight months studying the unusually thorny ethical issues that have arisen over the holdings of Mr. Bloomberg, one of the world's wealthiest businessmen and mayor of one of the world's most complex cities. 
 The board's 13-page advisory opinion outlined a series of areas in which Mr. Bloomberg should withdraw participation from the selection of the city's bond underwriters, so as not to appear to favor Merrill Lynch, which owns 20 percent of his firm, Bloomberg L. P., to making decisions about cable television franchises, so as not to appear to favor Bloomberg Television. But its most immediate recommendation was its call for the mayor to sell all of his stock. 
Mr. Bloomberg's aides said he would comply. "As the mayor has said and demonstrated repeatedly, he's very sensitive to conflicts of interest, and he's going to abide by the ruling of the Conflicts of Interest Board," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor. 
In a sign of just how many potential pitfalls can arise when a rich man is elected mayor, there was even a potential conflict with a member of the conflicts board. One of the four members of the board, Benito Romano, withdrew from participating in the decision because his law firm, Wilkie, Farr & Gallagher, has represented Mr. Bloomberg's company.
It was unclear just how much money Mr. Bloomberg's stock was worth, partly because Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, does not release his tax returns to the public the way that most mayors have. But limited financial data that he disclosed in June indicated that he owned at least $51 million in stock in 2001, and possibly more. 
When Mr. Bloomberg was a candidate for mayor his aides said that he had divested himself of all of his stock holdings so as not to pose any conflicts, but added at the time that they could not say if he was buying new stocks. Aides have now explained that he sold off his portfolio and then hired private money managers to buy and sell stocks for him without his knowledge, so he would not know what stocks he held.
But the conflicts board found that the arrangement did not go far enough. It ruled that the mayor's holdings violated a section of the City Charter that bans public servants from having an interest in firms engaged in business dealings with the agency they work for "because Mr. Bloomberg owns his stock directly and not, for example, through a mutual fund, because many of the firms in his portfolio have business dealings with the city's executive branch, and because of the size of his holdings."
The mayor's limited financial disclosure showed that he owned more than half a million dollars in stock in Waste Management, which controls nearly a third of the city's out-of-state trash transport system, as well as in several large financial firms that are important players in the city and big retailers seeking to expand in the city.
Mr. Bloomberg's aides said that he would sell the stock, and possibly donate some of the money to charity, and invest the proceeds in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. In giving Mr. Bloomberg 90 days to sell his stock, the ruling could cost the mayor some money. Some stocks may have declined in value; others that rose in value may be subject to higher taxes because he has not held them long enough to qualify as long-term capital gains.
The ruling also touched on Mr. Bloomberg's ownership of government bonds. To avoid the possible appearance that the mayor could take actions that would financially benefit himself as the owner of municipal bonds, the board prohibited the mayor from selling city and state bonds, saying that it would make exceptions only under unforeseen circumstances. The board ruled that the mayor could continue to buy bonds, though.
And, with the city refinancing much of its debt, the board ruled that the mayor should not participate in decisions about which bonds can be retired or called.
The board outlined a number of ways in which Mr. Bloomberg could avoid conflicts stemming from his ownership of Bloomberg L. P., a financial information and media company that he founded in 1981.
Mr. Bloomberg resigned his position and stepped down from making day-to-day decisions there, but wanted to remain involved in large business matters, such as any potential sale of the company; the sale or purchase of any major assets; any major borrowings; and any big changes in the company's salary structure. The board advised Mr. Bloomberg to seek its guidance before getting involved in such matters.
The board also weighed the mayor's dealings with Merrill Lynch, which owns 20 percent of his firm, and frequently underwrites the issuance of city bonds and manages assets for the city's pension funds. The report noted that Mr. Bloomberg has agreed not to participate in Merrill Lynch's dealings with the city, whether in terms of selecting bond underwriters or making decisions about Economic Development Corporation job-retention benefits or grants from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation grants.
But the report made no mention of the fact that Mr. Bloomberg selected E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch, as one of his four appointees to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the reconstruction of downtown Manhattan. When he made the selection in April, Mr. Bloomberg said that there was no conflict of interest.
The report also called on Mr. Bloomberg to be absent from all decisions involving cable television, because Bloomberg Television is distributed by cable systems that obtain their franchises through the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee, on which the mayor serves. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about an advisory opinion by New York City's Conflict of Interests Board that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg should sell his stock holdings misspelled the name of a law firm that represents his company. It is Willkie Farr & Gallagher, not Wilkie.

HEADLINE: U.S. BACKS INCREASE IN PEACEKEEPERS FOR AFGHANISTAN 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Pentagon officials who long opposed expanding the international security force in Afghanistan now say that enlarging it and placing its troops outside Kabul may help secure the country and allow American troops to leave sooner, senior Bush administration officials said today. 
 The shift, officials said, may be necessary because of the lingering difficulties in rebuilding the country and establishing law and order in a nation still wracked by banditry, warlords and renegade Taliban fighters. 
 One senior Bush administration official described the shift as a "mid-course correction." 
The change in the Pentagon's thinking is an important precondition for other nations to contribute troops for a peacekeeping effort that would extend beyond the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
Foreign nations have been reluctant to consider such a venture until the Pentagon agrees to help with logistics, command and control and intelligence, and promises to withdraw the peacekeepers if they are endangered. 
American officials said that steps to enlarge the peacekeeping force might not come for months and that finding nations to contribute the forces would not be easy. 
Even if the force is expanded, it is likely to be more modest than the one proposed by the Afghan leader, Hamid Karzai, blunting but probably not ending the debate over whether the Bush administration has done enough to rebuild Afghanistan.
American officials say a number of ideas are under consideration, all of which would involve American support, but not troops. They include setting up a mobile group of peacekeepers, which could be whisked from Kabul to trouble spots.
Another idea is to place peacekeepers in several cities outside Kabul, like Mazar-i-Sharif, where there are tensions between rival warlords. 
A sizable deployment of peacekeeping forces in all the major Afghan cities is the least likely possibility, American officials say. The Bush administration itself has not offered to place American peacekeepers in Afghanistan.
It has also had a tough time finding another nation to lead the force once Turkey's command expires this year. 
One of the first hints of the Pentagon's shift came early this week when Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the head of the United States Central Command, discussed expanding the peacekeeping force. 
"There are in fact views and a number of places that would indicate the desirability of expanding the International Security Assistance Force," he said at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul.
The deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, also signaled a new receptivity to expanding the force in an interview with the British Daily Telegraph. 
"We are looking very seriously at what might be done if we get more contributions to ISAF," Mr. Wolfowitz said. "At the moment the issue is sustaining ISAF first. Expanding it is valuable, but it cannot be the first priority." 
Expanding the force beyond Kabul has been a contentious issue within the administration. President Karzai has urged an extension to Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, Kandahar in the south, Herat in the west and Jalalabad in the east. 
State Department officials were generally supportive. Richard N. Haass, the director of the State Department Office of Policy Planning, told the World Economic Forum in February that the force might be expanded to as many as 25,000 troops spread around Afghanistan. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain said Mr. Karzai had made a persuasive case for expanding beyond Kabul.
But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his aides resisted the idea, fearing it would tie down American forces and extend the stay of American troops in Afghanistan, even though American troops would be cast largely in a supporting role. 
Mr. Rumsfeld pushed for setting up an Afghan army as the solution to the country's security problems, saying that would enable the Afghans to become more self sufficient. American Special Forces in Afghanistan and United States Civil Affairs teams were also asked to use their influence with local warlords to bring calm in the country.
"The question is, Do you want to put your time and effort and money into the International Security Assistance Force -- go take it from, say, 5,000 to 20,000 people?" Mr. Rumsfeld said in February. "Another school of thought, which is where my brain is, is that why put all the time and money and effort in that? Why not put it into helping them develop a national army so that they can look out for themselves over time?" 
But the establishment of the Afghan army has gone slowly. The Pentagon says that army will number only 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers by the end of this year. Meanwhile, local warlords have continued to erode the authority of the central government in Kabul. 
Problems in restoring order and delays in providing money from international donors have slowed efforts to rebuild the country, develop the economy and establish the rule of law. As a result, reconstruction has fallen well behind the pace in Kosovo after NATO's confrontation with Serbia. 
"The creation of the Afghan army is a distant prospect," said James Dobbins, who served as the Bush administration envoy for Afghanistan and is now a senior official at the Rand Corporation, a government-financed research center. "There has not been a high enough level of security outside of Kabul to allow reconstruction outside the capital." 
The slow pace has not been lost on the Pentagon, where officials are well aware that it will be harder for American forces to leave the country unless the economy develops, Mr. Karzai's authority is reinforced and warlords are reined in.
As these efforts have lagged, Mr. Rumsfeld has sought to rebut criticism that the Pentagon has not been doing enough.
Earlier this month, he asserted that he had no objection to enlarging the peacekeeping force if other nations were willing to contribute the troops. 
But he did not offer to provide the logistical support and security guarantees that foreign nations say would be needed to encourage them to contribute more peacekeepers or to take an active role in organizing an expansion of the force.
The main problem, Mr. Rumsfeld said, was that foreign nations have provided relatively little of the $4.5 billion in aid they promised to rebuild the country. At the State Department today, a senior official said European nations had failed to contribute the necessary food aid. 
"The U.S is the champion and the predominate financial supporter of the multilateral relief and recovery program in Afghanistan," said Gene Dewey, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration. "We desperately need our flagging, all too unilateralist allies, especially from Europe, to join the multilateral bandwagon and come up to their fair share."

HEADLINE: Just Trust Us 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The story so far:
 Summer 2000: Candidate George W. Bush assures voters that his tax cut is affordable. He illustrates his point with four $1 bills. One bill, he says, represents the tax cut; one represents new programs, such as prescription drug coverage; the other two are funds set aside to pay down debt, strengthening Social Security. He pledges, without qualification, not to dip into the Social Security surplus. 
 Spring 2001: The Bush administration pushes its tax cut through Congress. Officials dismiss concerns that projections of a huge surplus may be excessively optimistic, assuring Congressmen that the projections are actually on the low side. Mr. Bush also claims that his budget includes a trillion-dollar reserve, enough to deal with any contingency. 
Summer 2001: Just weeks after the tax cut passes, officials reveal that tax receipts have been coming in far below expectations. Budget projections are revised sharply downward, but the administration still claims that it will run an overall surplus greater than the Social Security surplus, that is, more than $150 billion per year. The administration also claims that the tax cut, conceived at a time of runaway boom, is exactly the right medicine for an ailing economy. 
October 2001: "Lucky me: I hit the trifecta." So remarks Mr. Bush, claiming that recession, national emergency and war have let him off the hook on his budget promises. Though some think that it's in bad taste, the trifecta joke becomes part of Mr. Bush's standard stump speech. He claims to have made this exception to his budget pledges during the 2000 campaign, but there is no record of his having done so.
November 2001: Budget director Mitch Daniels admits that the overall budget -- not just the budget outside Social Security -- will actually be in deficit for fiscal 2002.
July 2002: The White House admits that the deficit for fiscal 2002, which ends in September, will be $165 billion -- a non-Social-Security deficit of $322 billion. But it still says that the budget will be back in surplus by 2004.
August 2002: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issues a much grimmer projection, with a 2003 deficit twice that predicted by the administration, and deficits persisting until 2006. Moreover, the C.B.O. is required by law to make unrealistic assumptions that cause it to understate future deficits. A new analysis by Goldman Sachs, which is not under these constraints, predicts deficits well over $100 billion each year for the rest of the decade. 
This $7 trillion reversal of fiscal fortune has received remarkably little public attention; it has been crowded off the front page by talk of war. But its consequences will be immense. 
Where did the surplus go? The "trifecta" is not the main story; recessions have only a small impact on long-run projections, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that increases in military and homeland security spending account for only 16 percent of the 10-year deterioration in the C.B.O. projection. In fact, it's clear that we would be facing large deficits outside Social Security, and probably significant deficits in the budget as a whole, even if neither the recession nor Sept. 11 had happened.
The two main culprits are the tax cut and "technical changes" in the estimates: perhaps because of the end of the bull market, a given level of G.D.P. is yielding much less revenue than it did during the late 1990's. Or to put it another way, our brief era of big surpluses seems to have been a fluke.
Despite assurances that the tax cut would promote recovery, the economy seems to be sputtering. Early indications are that the administration will propose another round of tax cuts, all of them aimed at stock market investors. It's important to notice that such measures as increased deductions for capital losses provide no benefit to those whose investment takes place through 401(k) plans; so these tax breaks are mainly for the very affluent. A careful analysis by William Gale and Peter Orszag -- experts at Brookings who have consistently, and correctly, warned that administration budget projections were overoptimistic -- shows that these measures will be ineffective as stimulus, and will further worsen the budget outlook.
Of course, administration officials will brush this aside, assuring us that their proposals are just what the nation needs. Can anyone think of a reason not to trust them?

HEADLINE: As Bush Campaigns, Cheney Talks of Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush traveled to Oklahoma and Arkansas today to raise $1.1 million for Republican candidates, and he joined a back-to-school event to press his education agenda, even as his vice president was talking about whether the country needed to go to war.
 Mr. Bush repeated standard lines about the fight against terrorism at all his stops, his only public events this week, but he never mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney, in contrast, used a meeting of Korean War veterans in San Antonio to repeat the arguments he made on Monday that Mr. Hussein could acquire nuclear weapons "fairly soon" and that American forces might be called on to prevent that.
As the debate over Iraq grows, Mr. Bush shows no sign of letting it distract him from helping Republicans try to recapture the Senate and maintain control of the House. He is planning two to three campaign-related trips a week from now to the November election.
Most of the trips focus on tight races like the one here in Arkansas, where Mr. Bush spoke tonight at a fund-raiser for Senator Tim Hutchinson, who is being challenged by Mark Pryor, the Democratic attorney general of Arkansas. The Senate contest here is considered one of the most crucial of the year, and Mr. Bush was raising $600,000 this evening at a $500-a-plate dinner in the shadow of the Capitol, where Bill Clinton began his political career.
Mr. Bush has raised more than $100 million this year, appearing at roughly 50 fund-raisers, a record that puts him well ahead of Mr. Clinton at an equivalent moment in his presidency. The White House is determined to avoid the position Mr. Clinton found himself in two years into his presidency when his party lost control of both houses of Congress.
But that has left to the vice president the job of making the administration's public case on Iraq. Tonight, the president alluded to the issue, mentioning speculation in the press about what his next step would be in the fight against terrorism, but he did not specifically mention Iraq.
Mr. Bush had not been seen in public since last Saturday, and today's appearance will be his only one this week. He is to return to Washington on Sunday and make a quick Labor Day trip to Pittsburgh on Monday to talk about the economy.
Mr. Bush began the day in Oklahoma City at a luncheon for Steve Largent, the former professional football player who is the Republican candidate for governor. The current governor, Frank Keating, also a Republican, could not run because of term limits. Mr. Largent appears ahead in the race. The lunch, which also benefited Senator James M. Inhofe, raised about $500,000, and Mr. Bush used a 30-minute speech to talk about worker compensation, energy, prescription drugs and defense spending.
Then Mr. Bush came to Little Rock, stopping at the Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School to announce that Arkansas would be among a small group of states in a new program to encourage high school students to take more rigorous courses. The program is based on one in Texas when Mr. Bush was governor. But announcing the program here also served another purpose: whenever the president travels to deliver a noncampaign message, the federal government pays for much of the trip.

To Some Owners, TV Money Comes First

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Baseball strike or no strike, many sports and media experts say that the growing number of media companies that own teams has increased the economic gap between rich ball clubs and poor ones -- an issue that has been at the heart of baseball's labor negotiations.
 Teams owned by media companies have often been willing to pay more for players than their competitors because marquee players not only attract more fans to the ballpark, but they also attract more viewers and advertisers to the broadcasts. For many of the most successful teams, stadiums have increasingly become television backdrops. 
 "What it has done is exacerbate the competitive balance problem because the teams are being run as software or programming for the media companies," Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who writes about sports, said in an interview. "The teams are subordinated to the profit-maximizing schemes for the media operations." 
Two decades ago, Ted Turner (who owned the Atlanta Braves) and the Tribune Company (which owned the Chicago Cubs) were the only major media players with baseball in their stables. (The Yankees were owned by CBS before the team was acquired by George Steinbrenner's group in 1973.)
Now, the major media companies that own baseball teams outright are AOL Time Warner (the Braves), the Walt Disney Company (the Anaheim Angels), the News Corporation (the Los Angeles Dodgers), Rogers Communications (the Toronto Blue Jays) and Tribune (the Cubs). Then there are the media companies that own stakes in teams, like Cox Enterprises (the San Francisco Giants) and The New York Times Company (the Boston Red Sox).
Individuals with major media holdings also own teams, including Lawrence Dolan of Cablevision (the Cleveland Indians) and Tom Hicks of the investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst (the Texas Rangers). Although the Yankees are not owned by a media company per se, the team's success in attracting television money and in spinning off the YES Network has been perhaps the most powerful testament to the dominating role of TV revenue in sports these days (despite Cablevision's refusal to carry the network). 
"Traditional owners used to run their business to build the asset value of the club itself," said one executive at a media company that owns a baseball team, speaking on condition of anonymity. "For us, it's all about building the asset value of the television contract using the team."
The desire for viewers and television dollars as well as fan loyalty and individual team profitability explains many of the key financial decisions in baseball in recent years.
It explains why in 1998, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation was trying to build Fox Sports West and prevent Disney from starting an ESPN West cable channel, Murdoch made Kevin Brown baseball's first $100 million player, with a $105 million contract with the Dodgers. It explains why two years ago, when Hicks was trying to make television syndication deals for the Rangers, he gave Alex Rodriguez the richest contract in sports, a $252 million deal.
Teams that do not control their own television deals may not be able to compete.
"Few of these companies, if any, view the overall profitability of the various sports teams as meaningful in their overall operations," said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst in New York for UBS Warburg. "The money is all on the television side."
That is one reason media companies that own teams have generally taken a softer line in the recent labor negotiations. They have the most to lose in a strike: not only gate receipts, but also advertising sales; not only merchandising opportunities, but also cable television contracts.
"The media companies do tend to be more conciliatory and closer to the players' point of view," Zimbalist, the sports economist, said.
A spokesman for Major League Baseball declined to comment.
Murdoch's News Corporation has appeared particularly fearful of a strike. Of all of the media companies that own baseball teams, the News Corporation has the most to lose -- even if many of the company's explicit financial losses would be reimbursed by Major League Baseball and individual teams.
Besides owning the Dodgers, the News Corporation is in the middle of a six-year, $2.5 billion television contract with baseball. The vast majority of the contract is associated with Fox's rights to baseball's playoffs, which would be jeopardized by a strike. In all, baseball's contract with Fox could force the league to essentially refund about $520 million if there is a strike.
Some analysts believe that the News Corporation has actually been preferring a strike because, in addition to the refund, a strike would almost surely mean that future baseball contracts would be cheaper. Publicly, however, the News Corporation and Fox appear to be taking a softer line toward the players and are urging a settlement.
"If there is a long-term strike that stops play for any length of time at all, it is going to fundamentally damage baseball," said David Hill, president of Fox Sports. "It could be the death knell for the sport, or if not the death knell, it would take a long time to get over."
Also, even though Fox would be reimbursed in the event of a strike, the network would lose the ability to promote its other programs during baseball's playoffs.
In the end, television matters far more to the News Corporation than whether the Dodgers are profitable.
At first, AOL Time Warner might appear to be in a similar position. AOL Time Warner distributes Braves games on its TBS cable and satellite channel. But with the company's stock struggling and with pressure on the company to improve its financial performance, the company has taken a hard line against the players in the labor talks, according to baseball executives and people close to the company.
A spokeswoman for AOL Time Warner declined to comment.

HEADLINE: New Jobs For Labor Unions 

BYLINE:  By Samuel Leiken; Samuel Leiken is a consultant on work-force development strategy and a former union shop steward.

DATELINE: CHEVY CHASE, Md. 

 BODY:
In today's economy, rare is the worker who will spend his entire career in the same job. People are likely to have many employers, perhaps even several careers. Yet the labor movement remains attached to a 20th-century notion of its role: protecting members' employment, wages and benefits through collective bargaining.
 If labor unions are to flourish in the 21st century, however, they will have to reach workers who no longer have long-term ties to one employer -- or even to a single industry. These new circumstances present unions with an opportunity to expand their membership. Today's workers need to continually improve their employability through better education and training, and unions are uniquely qualified to help. 
 Going to college is not what it used to be. Higher education has evolved to a marketplace where companies even offer their own "degrees"; Microsoft now offers training and certification for computer programmers and engineers. The result is a kaleidoscope of career options accompanied by a complex array of educational choices. In the face of these changes, labor's continued focus on collective bargaining is a little like the proverbial French generals preparing for the last war.
But unions can help workers make their way through the tangle of educational and career choices. They have a well-organized communications network. In addition, they enjoy credibility within the network. Union members rely on shop stewards and local officials to represent them in conflicts with employers; to help them get confidential treatment of alcohol and drug addiction problems; and, in case of layoffs, to provide information on services and benefits for which they are eligible. Unions already provide members with information about pensions and health care, in some cases providing these services themselves. Why not do the same in education?
Survey data indicate that roughly 42 million workers want an organization focused on information, career assistance or consultation with management -- but still independent of management. That represents an enormous untapped market for unions; currently, there are only 13.5 million unionized workers in America. By offering learning services on their Web sites and expanding access to nonmembers, unions could bring millions into their network.
The labor movement is already reaching out to the wider work force by developing various projects, like low-interest credit cards, to recruit "associate members." But a union-sponsored credit card is not the same as a union card. It does not authorize the union to speak for you.
Union members and nonmembers alike benefit from a voice that can demand their rights and express their needs to schools and the government. For example, adults are excluded from federal student loans unless they attend classes at least half-time. Such a schedule is almost impossible for working mothers or fathers. When they relocate, they need to be assured that credits from one institution will be accepted elsewhere. And how can workers who want to enroll get credit for college-level learning acquired on the job?
This approach challenges existing notions of organized labor's role and purpose. Unions would still represent the interests of certain members in negotiations with particular employers, of course. But they must also begin reaching out to workers in nonunion shops or sectors. Unions may not be able to bargain for these workers, but attracting such workers is critical to the labor movement's growth and success. 
With their tradition of involvement in education -- apprenticeships, tuition-assistance grants and loans, joint labor-management training programs -- unions are ideally poised to lead the American worker into a new era. But for their leadership to have an impact, they must be able to speak for all workers, not just the 9 percent of the private-sector work force they currently represent. Expanding union membership will require extending membership rights to individuals independent of their workplaces.
Serving the learning needs of members and nonmembers alike could rescue unions from the decline in membership they have been suffering for the last several decades. A greater focus on education will also serve the needs of society.

PERSON: Mark Shuttleworth 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
The First 'Afronaut' Plans a Mission Back Home

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
PERHAPS the most obvious question to ask Mark Shuttleworth is this: after making half a billion dollars from the Internet bubble at the age of 26 and, two years later, buying a $20 million ride in space to become what Nelson Mandela called the first "Afronaut," what do you do for an encore?
 The response from this unassuming, South African-born entrepreneur is unexpected. Having achieved in a few years what most would not achieve in a lifetime, Mr. Shuttleworth, 28, said he did not want to try to re-create the intensity of his experiences in space or in business, despite having the personal wealth to try almost anything. 
 Passing his days in a spacious apartment in a chic part of London, Mr. Shuttleworth has resolved to invert his personal telescope, exchanging the celestial visions of space or the dizzying deals of high finance for a view of life from the narrow end, from the perspective of the penniless and the earthbound who will -- if his calculations are borne out -- fuel a new revolution in his native continent. 
"I'm not going to try and top either of these things in the same way," he said, "I'm not going to try and do a bigger business deal. I'm not going to fly again for flying's sake."
Rather, he said, he plans a road show in South Africa in September and October, taking models of the Soyuz space capsule he flew in and a rocket booster to 100 of the remote, rural schools where the country's greatest poverty is most evident. His goal is to fire up young South Africans with the same enthusiasm for science and math that underpinned his own success story. He tried to accomplish the same result with ham radio and Internet linkups to South African schools during his space flight with Russian cosmonauts in April and May.
He has set up a philanthropic foundation to promote the desire for schooling in a land where young people once boycotted classes to protest apartheid (one of its first pro-math campaigns is called Hip 2 B Square). Suffusing that effort is a belief that, as he put it, Africa is set for a half century of rapid growth, fueled by a surge of democracy and freedoms, that will make it far more interesting for an entrepreneur than the United States or Europe.
"If I do believe that the next 50 years are going to be more dynamic, I do need to get hands on, walk the streets, get the feel of it," he said. 
ON the way, Mr. Shuttleworth is also seeking to transcend the stereotypes of race and class and establish his credentials as an African. 
He had the kind of early life and education in one of Cape Town's top private schools that came with privilege. He was born too late to experience the ravages of apartheid firsthand -- while he was in his teens, segregationist legislation was being dismantled, and his high school was open to all races. By the time he graduated from college, in 1995, South Africa had already held the elections that gave Nelson Mandela the presidency.
At a private dinner recently at the home of Lindiwe Mabuza, South Africa's high commissioner, or ambassador, in London, Mr. Shuttleworth enthralled a table of senior African diplomats from Senegal, Ghana and Mozambique with tales from his space flight.
He spoke of the fear that comes before but not during the terrifying moments of blastoff and re-entry; he spoke of observing the earth's fragility as he spun through space. But as the son of an English-born father with only a half-generation of African roots, as a multimillionaire from a continent of paupers, he also spoke of wanting to become a diplomat for Africa. Most critically for him, he said later that he felt that his credentials had been accepted.
In an era when radical figures like Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya rail against intruders into the continent, the welcoming mood around the dinner table offered a poignant counterpoint.
As a youthful entrepreneur challenging global business giants, Mr. Shuttleworth was lauded as the Bill Gates of South Africa. But when he left two years ago to set up base in London, he was condemned for abandoning the country. That changed only after the space trip, which led to him being celebrated as a national hero. "I have been lionized and vilified," he said.
MR. SHUTTLEWORTH agreed to be interviewed in his new apartment, which is simply furnished and comfortable, and includes a work area littered with unpacked boxes of computer gear. The walls of the living room are decorated more with large, flat television screens tuned to 24-hour news channels than with art or books.
His smile is open and untroubled. As is the custom in South Africa, Mr. Shuttleworth received a guest without formal ceremony, serving an impromptu lunch of bread and cheese with lime marmalade -- one of his favorite combinations.
The conversation ranged over his school years when, having no great liking for rugby or cricket in a sports-crazy white world, he excelled academically. After graduating first in his class, he went on to the University of Cape Town, where his grades suffered after he found himself locking horns with teachers over the looming importance of the Internet.
His startup company, a consultancy called Thawte, began in what has become the time-honored way -- in his mother's garage, where he developed a system to certify the authenticity of Web sites used in e-commerce. He sold the company in December 1999 to an American rival, VeriSign Inc., in an all-stock deal worth about $575 million.
Contractual restrictions prevented him from selling the acquired VeriSign stock quickly, and he watched in frustration, he said, as the market first soared -- making him a paper billionaire -- and then began to fall. When he finally sold his stake, he discovered that South Africa's currency laws made it hard to move his fortune overseas, even as its value fell with the seesawing South African rand. Those financial considerations, in part, were behind his move to London.
If he was a prophet in his own land, then his stature could only soar farther with his Soyuz flight from April 25 to May 5. As the second fare-paying space traveler after Dennis Tito, an American, Mr. Shuttleworth spent eight months training for the flight, determined to be viewed as a cosmonaut rather than a space tourist. He conducted stem cell and human embryo experiments during the flight, and spoke by ham radio and the Internet to South African schoolchildren.
These days, he likes to depict his apartment as a retreat where he can read and think about the shape of Africa and the world and how he can best "position" himself for the future. He leaves others to manage his money and his South African venture capital company, HBD (short for "Here Be Dragons"). He would rather listen to unknown people than high-flying gurus of business.
"I'm a lot less fussed about the way things pan out in life than when I first went to Russia," he said, adding that he had not checked his financial portfolio for two months.

HEADLINE: Consumers Praised, or Blamed, for Aiding Recovery 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Though the economy took a pummeling in the second quarter, consumers struck a modest blow for the recovery at the beginning of the third. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that personal spending in July jumped 1 percent, to $7.35 trillion -- the biggest increase in nine months -- thanks largely to low interest rates.
 Consumers managed to spend more even though their total incomes did not change. Mortgage refinancing and lower income-tax rates helped to put more of consumers' existing income at their disposal. In addition, saving as a share of disposable income dropped to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent in June. 
 The rise in spending did little to comfort an established Wall Street pessimist, Stephen S. Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley. "You have to ask yourself, 'How long can consumers go into debt, draw down savings and keep spending?' " Mr. Roach said. "This denial that consumers are steeped in is going to crack later."
Most of the overall increase in spending came from a 3.9 percent rise in purchases of big-ticket items, defined as those expected to last at least three years. Consumers reacted to lower interest rates by snapping up cars, appliances and other items, which they often buy on credit, said Christopher J. Wiegand, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Two other reports yesterday offered little indication, taken together, of the economy's direction. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its index of business activity in the Midwest rose to 54.9 from 51.5 in July. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment fell slightly, to 87.6 from 88.1 in July. The predictive power of that index is strongest several months into the future.
The figures were still better than economic data released on Thursday that showed increased claims for unemployment benefits last week and anemic economic growth in the second quarter.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not comment on the current economic situation in his remarks yesterday to central bankers at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Consumers have taken advantage of the Fed's leaving short-term interest rates low, a stance that is helping to keep 30-year mortgage rates under 6.3 percent.
"Refinancing activity, both in the form of lowering monthly mortgage payments and undertaking cash-outs, is definitely padding consumer spending," Mr. Wiegand said. He estimated that refinancing would add $50 billion to consumers' purchasing power in the second half of this year.
Consumers' direct borrowing from banks actually slipped a bit in July, according to figures the Fed published last week, but credit card debt could also be used for spending. "Some consumers are very responsive" to changes in rates, said David B. Gross, a senior economist at Lexecon, an economic consulting firm. Rates on fixed-rate credit cards dropped steadily this year until June and have stayed low since then, according to Bankrate.com.
First USA and MBNA, the biggest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, respectively, both declined to comment on recent trends.
Nonetheless, Mr. Gross expected consumers to respond more to mortgage rates than to credit card rates. "The house represents such a large fraction of people's net worth that any change in their payment is going to have a big impact," he said. "There is no doubt that the mortgage interest rate is, for most people, the most significant interest rate that they face."
Though incomes as a whole remained unchanged in July, disposable income -- what consumers have left to spend after taxes -- rose 0.2 percent. Mr. Wiegand attributed about half the gains in disposable income, which has ballooned more than 5 percent in the last 12 months, to the cut last year in the federal income tax. "For all the political heat that the tax cut is taking," he said, "it's helping steady consumer demand right now."
Mr. Wiegand recommended accelerating the tax rate reductions scheduled for 2004 as an extra stimulus for the economy. Mr. Roach disagreed. "The last thing we need is a tax cut aimed at upper-income investors," he said. "If we do want to provide some support to consumer demand, it should be for lower- to middle-income households."
Judging by the Census Bureau's most recent figures on the distribution of income, the rate reductions would probably benefit fewer than half of Americans who receive any income.
Mr. Roach acknowledged that the strong spending by consumers in July did not support his earlier prediction of a return to recession this year. But he warned against ignoring the burden of consumers' debts merely because of their current behavior.
"I haven't slept well in a couple of years," he said, "and I'm not going to sleep any better tonight."

HEADLINE: Professors Offer A Reality Check For Politicians 

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
When Leonard Wantchekon set out to investigate what kind of campaign messages are most effective, he could have done the standard review of past political advertisements or interviewed candidates, consultants and voters. But Professor Wantchekon, who teaches politics at New York University and is an expert in game theory, wanted a more scientific approach. 
 So he chose a novel but controversial approach: instead of observing an election, he participated in one. 
 Born and reared in Benin, Professor Wantchekon decided to use the 2001 presidential primary in his small West African home country as his case study. As a younger man, he had helped found the Democratic Front of Benin, in the early 1980's the only opposition group to military rule in that country, and in 1988immigrated to Canada as a political refugee. With his previous political ties, he was able to convince Benin's four primary candidates to allow him and his researchers to write and disseminate campaign messages for each of them and then test them on villagers. 
Working hand in hand with the two opposition and two pro-government parties, Professor Wantchekon and his team created two types of messages. One used specific promises -- to build schools, clinics and roads in a particular village, for example; the other invoked a much broader appeal to improve the nation's general welfare. The team enlisted tribal leaders, soccer stars, popular musicians and local officials to help deliver their messages. From December 2000 to the primary in March 2001, they campaigned in about 20 villages, each with some 700 inhabitants. Each village was randomly assigned to receive either the specific promise or the broad appeal. Some 4.1 million voters in other villages who received the candidates' regular campaign messages, and not ones prepared for the experiment, served as a control group. 
The research, known as a field experiment, was unusual, Professor Wantchekon said, because "it involved real candidates in real elections."
But intervening in real elections creates problems, say some political scientists, who argue that potentially tampering with election results is unethical, as is having people unknowingly participate in an experiment. 
"There are some major ethical concerns with field experiments in that they can affect election results and bring up important considerations of informed consent," said Rebecca B. Morton, who also teaches politics at New York University. 
F. Christopher Arterton, dean of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said he was not familiar with the study but cautioned that in general with field experiments, "one has to be careful not to cross the line between being a researcher and being an advocate."
Professor Wantchekon, who still counts himself among the pro-democracy advocates in Benin, said such concerns were overblown. Villages were carefully screened to help ensure that the experiment would not influence the results, he said. Only villages where the votes were not close in the previous election were selected. (As it turned out, the incumbent, Mathieu Kerekou, a Marxist former military ruler, won). Professor Wantchekon also argued that it was perfectly reasonable not to inform villagers that they were participating in his experiment because doing so would have skewed the study's results. In the end, he emphasized, it would be the villagers who might eventually benefit from his findings.
Professor Wantchekon said his results, which are under peer review, showed that specific promises worked well for incumbents, but not for challengers or underdogs, who won more votes when they used broad appeals. Women also preferred broad appeals. The findings, he added, could sharpen the political debate: "There are clear benefits to voters from this experiment." Candidates courting women, he said, might be motivated to work for more lasting changes in children's health care and education. 
To Professor Wantchekon and other proponents of field experiments, that method has a scientific rigor that is lacking in other types of political analysis. It is well accepted in medical research, for example: when scientists test new medical treatments, they compare a new drug to an existing one or to a placebo by testing it on people who are randomly chosen and who do not know which drug they are getting. Random selection gives researchers confidence that any difference in results between the two groups is due to the treatment. Similarly, field experiments, supporters say, promise to shed light on important political questions, from why people vote to what makes for successful welfare reform.
"We see experiments in medicine and say, 'We can do that,' " said Donald P. Green, who heads the Institute for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University, a research center that sponsors field experiments, including Professor Wantchekon's. 
Professor Green concedes that critics of the method raise important questions. But in his view, designing social programs around untested theories or allowing problems to go unfixed is worse than staging randomized experiments that can produce important findings. 
Some scholars point out that because the method takes the researcher into the real world with all its complexities, it offers less control over what is being measured, which makes the results less verifiable. Unlike the messy real world and all its hard-to-control variables, the laboratory is "refreshingly free of confounding influences," argues James E. Alt, director of the Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences at Harvard University, who says he personally favors statistical analyses.
But Professor Alt also acknowledges that the artificial environment of the laboratory can distort results. He said that while some researchers in recent years have sought to make laboratory experiments more realistic -- setting up television sets in shopping malls, for example, where participants can view campaign commercials in a natural setting -- laboratory experiments still lack the context and realism of the field.
Field experiments began in the 1920's with agronomists, who wanted to improve crop yields -- hence the method's name. An early experiment in politics, in 1927, looked at voter turnout in Chicago. 
Although a handful of political scientists tried the technique, their efforts were almost completely forgotten by the 1960's, as the statistical revolution swept through the social sciences, including political science and economics.
A small but influential group of academics, including Professor Green, began resurrecting field experiments in the late 1990's in an effort to put the "science" back in political science. 
He began in his own backyard. He and Alan S. Gerber, another political scientist at Yale, wanted to find out which type of campaign was most effective in getting voters to the polls: mailings, telephone or door-to-door canvassing. During the 1998 local elections in New Haven, Professors Green and Gerber randomly surveyed 30,000 registered voters. They found that canvassing in person increased turnout by 9 percentage points. Telephone appeals had no effect. Mailings increased turnout by up to several percentage points, depending on how frequently they were sent out. The results, they said, could be used to create programs that promoted greater voter turnout.
There are huge questions that field experimentation cannot answer, for obvious ethical and logistical reasons. For example, what conditions make for a successful coup d'etat and what causes genocide? And while scholars might find it useful to identify the reason people don't bother to vote, most would consider it unethical to stage an experiment that kept voters away from the polls.
Kathleen McGraw, who teaches political science at Ohio State University, said that while field experiments provided more rigorous findings that could be used to improve democracy, the ethics of a particular experiment must be considered on a case-by-case basis. "It all comes down," she said, "to whether in specific experiments, the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm" to participants.
One place likely to feel the impact of field experiments, if they become more widely used, is the multimillion-dollar political-consulting industry, which thrives on creating campaign messages of unproven and untested value, said Professor Arterton of George Washington University. "It's an industry that is very skilled at talking about the factors that produce a result," he said, "but it's not very effective. Field experiments could make some political consulting firms out there very uncomfortable."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Not the Only Nation Resisting a Strong Pact at the Summit Meeting on Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The photograph appears in a full-page advertisement in The International Herald Tribune under the headline "Put a Face on Global Warming and Forest Destruction." 
 It is a picture of President Bush, whose country is accused by protesters and some delegates at an international conference here of derailing any hope of progress at the talks to reduce poverty and protect the environment. 
 "Corporate criminals!" the protesters shout as they assail American officials for opposing targets and deadlines intended to promote development while preserving the environment.
But in the private negotiating rooms at the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development here, the United States is far from the only country balking at approving a strong, ambitious agreement. 
Saudi Arabia, Canada, Japan and Australia, for instance, also oppose deadlines for the conversion from oil and gas power to windmills, solar panels and other forms of renewable energy. The European Union objects to eliminating subsidies for activities that threaten natural resources, like commercial fishing.
Developing countries have joined the United States in pressing to water down language that would have committed nations to significantly reducing the threat that dangerous chemicals pose to health and the environment.
The large number of countries opposed to various targets and time frames is the main reason why negotiators have struggled this week to complete the summit meeting's plan, which is meant to be an ambitious blueprint for the world.
On one hand, the United States has been almost alone in refusing to support an agreement to reduce the number of people who lack sanitation by half by 2015. Australia also opposes that time frame. 
But on the other hand, the American decision to accept timetables for restoring depleted fisheries and for reducing the risk of hazardous chemicals has been nearly lost in the storm of criticism.
"The situation has been very polarized, but it's not a matter of singling out one country," said Gustavo Ainchil, the diplomat from Argentina who is leading the negotiations on energy. "You cannot simplify a problem that is very complex."
Everyone here supports the summit meeting's overall goals of protecting plants and wildlife, reducing pollution and bringing water, electricity and housing to the poor. But poor nations object to environmental targets or strong language that would require costly intervention on their part. Wealthy nations refuse to budge on subsidies that protect their industries. 
Oil producers are reluctant to embrace commitments that promote alternative energy sources. Other countries, in many cases, view the deadlines as unnecessary regulation.
The result is that the plan, which officials hoped would be completed tonight, is still incomplete, with deadlocks on issues ranging from subsidies to renewable energy and from corporate accountability to globalization.
Washington has borne the brunt of the blame for the delay. The United States has the world's largest economy and is one of its largest polluters. Many leaders complain that it has been reluctant to eliminate the agricultural subsidies that make it difficult for poor nations to export to the American market. Other officials complain that it has failed to acknowledge and accept its obligations for cleaning up the environment.
Last year, Mr. Bush angered many leaders when he rejected a treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, that set targets for reducing emissions of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Mr. Bush said such accords should also bind developing nations, especially China and India, that are also major emitters of such gases. Developing nations have refused, saying wealthy countries are among the largest polluters and should clean up first.
The European Union, which wants to set deadlines for resolving environmental problems, has been sharply critical of Washington's reluctance to make commitments to such agreements.
"On targets and timetables on the environmental issues, we haven't seen a concrete proposal, nothing at all except watering down the text, avoiding anything concrete," said Jos Delbeke, a senior member of the European delegation. "We cannot understand why the United States, being a world leader, is taking such a harsh stance."
Environmentalists agreed, saying the United States deserved the criticism because it had objected to so many critical aspects of the summit meeting's plan, including time frames for converting to renewable energy and for reversing the decline of endangered plants and animals. 
Among the critics is the Rainforest Action Network, the advocacy group that placed the advertisement in The International Herald Tribune.
"Any progress is welcome," Paul L. Joffe, the director of international affairs for the National Wildlife Federation, said of the American agreement on fisheries and chemicals. "But what we've seen so far is very minimal compared to the enormous challenges here and the enormous lack of commitment to goals, timetables and funding."
But United Nations officials described the American concessions on fisheries and chemicals as significant. The Americans have agreed to restore depleted fisheries, where possible, by 2015, and to make commitments for sound management of chemicals with the goal of minimizing their adverse effects on health and nature by 2020.
Environmental groups complain that the wording is weak. But some officials warn that the intense criticism of the Americans has given a distorted picture of the negotiations, as if the rest of world were eager to embrace difficult decisions.
"They're always the focus because they have so much power," said Jon Pronk, the United Nations special envoy to the meeting.
"But it's necessary not only to be critical of the Americans," Mr. Pronk said. "You have to be also critical of the Europeans. Agricultural subsidies are outrageously high in Europe. It's complex. It's not only a north-south dispute."

DATELINE: VALEMOUNT, British Columbia 

 BODY:
In this tiny lumber village in the Canadian Rockies, people are more likely to take their vacations in Las Vegas or Disney World, retire in Arizona, drive Chevrolets and live in mobile homes imported from the United States.
 With the ties to the United States here so tight, disruptions in relations with the United States can hit as hard as a family squabble. And relations now are pretty raw. 
 The squabble is over a 27 percent American tariff levied in May on Canadian softwood lumber -- wood from any conifer, like spruce, fir or pine. People here blame the levy for the shutting down of their only lumber mill in September, causing one in three local workers to lose their jobs. 
"The United States is acting like a bully," said Valemount's mayor, Jeannette Townsend, an otherwise soft-spoken official. "Our military went over to Afghanistan even though it was not our war. That was a neighborly act, and in response the U.S. government and lumber barons are devastating our communities."
A look at the dispute from both sides of the border, however, shows that this trade issue is a lot more complex than it may look to the parties involved. The tariffs have not stopped American mills from closing or curtailed Canadian exports or bolstered slumping lumber prices. The finger-pointing may be as much a measure of a troubled industry on both sides of the border as anything else. The underlying reason, analysts say, is that despite a housing boom in the United States and Canada the last few years, the world is awash in lumber, thanks largely to the enduring recession in Japan and a marked increase in exports from Russia. 
Months of trade negotiations have been fruitless, making the lumber issue the greatest irritant between the two countries in years. The dispute is so bitter it appears to have hardened Canadian government views on other issues, including the Bush administration's policies toward Iraq and American pressure to strengthen the Canadian military in the campaign against terrorism.
Annual Canadian softwood lumber sales to the United States amount to between $6 billion and $12 billion, depending on highly volatile prices, and supply about a third of American needs. In June, a month after the tariffs were imposed, Canadian softwood sales to the United States plunged 40 percent, shrinking the country's trade surplus and signaling that a deep recession may have descended on the lumber sector.
There are 70,000 Canadian jobs directly involved in softwood production, half of which is destined for the United States. The Canadian Forest Service predicts a loss of 25,000 jobs if the dispute goes on for more than two years, which seems possible.
The signs of hard times are already visible in this village of 1,300 people, where 40 percent of the households have at least one member who works in the lumber industry. Outside the Slocan Forest Products Ltd. plant, 30,000 trees lie like piles of matchsticks, open to weathering by the sun and rain. The local food bank, founded during a previous slump in the early 1990's, is gearing up again, and the Slocan mill has hired a social worker to counsel the newly unemployed. 
"When the U.S. goes to war they always have to have Canada on their tail, and is this the thanks Canada gets?" asked Shirley Gonyou, who has worked in the mill for 27 years. "Do Americans want to know if Canadians are on their knees yet?"
But the same rage expressed in lumber towns across British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario can be heard south of the border as well, where even more lumber mills have been closing down in recent years. In the 13 months before the tariffs were put in place, 93 American mills and 53 Canadian mills temporarily or permanently shut down production. (In the four months after the tariffs, 42 Canadian mills and 28 American mills sharply reduced production or shut down.) 
"The Canadians want to access our markets at the expense of our workers," said Robert Lockwood, president of TreeSource Industries Inc. His company, which had 12 mills employing 1,500 people in 1998, was already down to four mills employing 400 and another was scheduled to close at the end of August. 
At the core of the dispute is a divergence in lumber economies. 
In the United States, most timberlands are privately owned, with harvesting rights auctioned off or sold at market rates. But in Canada, more than 90 percent of timberlands are owned by provincial governments that set cutting fees. The governments adjust the fees and otherwise regulate cutting and manufacturing in such a way as to guarantee employment in remote rural areas.
American companies say Canadian timber fees are so low they amount to a hefty subsidy. The Commerce Department has estimated that the margin of cutting costs between the countries is 27 percent -- hence the size of the tariffs. Canadian officials say that figure is based on old data, and that their fees more or less match market forces.
Canadian government officials and lumber executives say their older forests are superior to those in the United States, producing a better product favored by American carpenters. And they maintain that their American competitors are suffering more from their own inefficiency than from unfair competition. In the southern United States, analysts note, costs of logs have risen more than sixfold over the last 30 years for lumber producers while the selling price of lumber has increased only by a factor of 2.6.
Stephen G. Atkinson, a forest-products analyst at the Bank of Montreal, wrote in a recent report that when American officials speak of Canadian "stumpage fees" they are merely stating the average cost paid to the government for timber. He noted that harvesting costs also include fees for forest management, road building, replanting and environmental remediation.
"Canadian companies are responsible for forest management and the U.S. companies are not," Mr. Atkinson wrote. "An honest comparison looks at total costs and profitability."
But according to Cheri Burda, a forestry analyst at the David Suzuki Foundation, a Canadian environmental group, Canadian companies do not have to abide by the kind of strict endangered-species legislation that restricts operations in the United States and raises costs substantially. 
Lumber prices for American mills have remained low despite the tariffs because Canadian companies stepped up production in the weeks before the duties took effect and because Russian, Scandinavian and Eastern European producers have increased their exports to the United States. Currently, 1,000 board feet of green Douglas fir fetches around $285, well below the $400 average since January 1995 and the $305 required for the average mill to break even, according to American industry sources.
Talks between the two countries broke off in March, but are expected to resume in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, Canada is appealing to panels of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Association. 
"The tariff policy has backfired," Canada's trade minister, Pierre Pettigrew, said in an interview. "We will win before the W.T.O. and Nafta, but that will take time, and in the meantime Canadian communities are suffering and American consumers are being deprived of Canadian lumber."
In a separate interview, Peter Allgeier, the deputy United States trade representative, said he saw no likelihood of a quick solution. "If the Canadian provinces were to sell their timber through a market mechanism like an auction we would say that would be a good way to solve the problem," he said.
Just south of Tacoma, Wash., at a TreeSource mill that closed in mid-August, there was little argument over who is to blame for the industry's troubles.
"Free trade and the Canadians bringing their lumber in have brought the lumber prices down to nothing," said Ted Smith, a 36-year-old mill operator. "There's a bitterness, but we don't have a whole lot of control. I just hope the tariff will help."

HEADLINE: TRADE PANEL SAYS EUROPE CAN IMPOSE PENALTIES ON U.S. 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization, the international arbiter in global trade disputes, ruled today that the European Union can impose $4 billion in penalties on the United States because an American tax break that promotes exports is illegal.
 The penalty is the biggest handed down against a country since the trade organization based in Geneva came into being in 1995, and it could hurt companies like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. that have been heavy users of the tax break. 
 But the ruling is probably less important for the actual money involved than for the diplomatic and political repercussions.
European leaders have made it clear they will give the United States time to change its law and will not impose the penalties, which would be in the form of retaliatory tariffs on American exports, anytime soon. 
But trade experts said the Europeans would now have what amounts to a Damoclean sword they can hold over the United States on bitterly disputed issues ranging from steel tariffs to farm subsidies.
"This gives the European Union a $4 billion club against us," said Gary Hufbauer, an international trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics, a policy research group in Washington. "It can keep the club in the closet, but it will be a presence that surrounds all the negotiations at the World Trade Organization."
The trade organization had already ruled twice that the tax break violates international trade treaties, and lawmakers in Congress have already been making their second effort to pass a new version of the law that would pass muster under the international rules.
Today's decision, which had been anxiously awaited for months, was simply about the size of the penalty that the European Union could impose. The United States contended that the penalty should not be more than $1 billion, but the trade panel accepted the European claim that the damage it has suffered from the American tax breaks was $4 billion.
In Washington, the Bush administration played down the significance of today's decision, predicting that the offending American law will soon be rewritten.
"I am confident that today's findings regarding damages will be rendered moot by our coming into compliance," said Kenneth Dam, deputy secretary of the Treasury, in a written statement.
Today's verdict could also have a profound impact on American political attitudes toward the World Trade Organization, providing ammunition to critics who see the group as a threat to national sovereignty.
Though it has been hailed as a major force in lowering trade barriers around the world, the trade organization is frequently attacked by trade unions and other critics as a faceless and secretive agent of "globalization."
The actual dispute centers on what are called "foreign sales corporations," which are offshore subsidiaries of American corporations used to export American-made products. These subsidiaries are exempt from normal United States taxes, but the European Union has argued for years that the tax breaks amount to illegal export subsidies.
The ruling's biggest effect is likely to be on a handful of major American manufacturers who have used the disputed tax break most heavily. Boeing and General Electric are both believed to have received tax benefits from the provision of more than $100 million a year. Motorola, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Cisco Systems have been among the other biggest beneficiaries.
Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's chief trade negotiator, made it clear today that he would give the United States time to rewrite its laws before imposing any penalties.
But he also said Europe's patience would not last forever. The verdict, he said, "makes the cost of noncompliance with the W.T.O. crystal clear." Another European trade official who works below Mr. Lamy put the matter more bluntly. "We are patient," he said. "But patience has its limits."
Despite the Bush administration's optimism on fixing the problem, trade experts, including lobbyists who are pushing for a rewritten law, say the task is harder than it looks.
Congress passed one new version of the tax break in 2000, but the trade organization ruled in February that the law was no better than the previous one because it still gave a selective tax break to exporters.
Lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee drafted another law this summer, but the measure became ensnarled in feuding about other more explosive issues. One of them is a proposal to cut back on the ability of American companies to avoid almost all taxes by incorporating in offshore tax havens.
European officials are reluctant to press their case to the limits, in part because they want to avoid a trade war with the United States but also because new tariffs would raise prices for European consumers.
"What this does is give Europe the legal right to retaliate against us, but this is a legal right that will prove difficult and self-damaging to exercise," said Susan Esserman, a trade lawyer who was deputy trade representative in the Clinton administration. "It would be a self-inflicted wound."
The bigger issue is whether European leaders will try to use their new authority to exert pressure over other contentious issues.
European leaders are still furious about the steep tariffs on imported steel that President Bush imposed this year. The administration has diluted those tariffs by making exceptions for hundreds of products, but European leaders are still threatening to impose retaliatory tariffs on American products like orange juice.
"They can pull the $4 billion sanctions trigger whenever they want," said Christoph Feddersen, a trade lawyer in Brussels with the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. 
"Even if there is no legal link" between the foreign sales corporations case "and the other disputes, such as the one over steel tariffs, there is obviously going to be a connection," he added. "The W.T.O. is not just about the law. It is also about politics and diplomacy."

HEADLINE: Nassau Budget Deficit Is Worse Than Had Been Predicted 

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Nassau County's financial outlook is worse than officials had previously thought, with a possible deficit of $268 million next year, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi said today.
 The county, which needed state help to pay its bills last year and to balance this year's budget, projected in April that its deficit could be $185 million in 2003. 
 Mr. Suozzi said that Nassau, like counties across the state that have suffered during the economic downturn, has suffered, too. Mr. Suozzi, who took office in January, said that Nassau's problems were compounded by what he called a decade of fiscal mismanagement and unresolved labor disputes. 
In April, Mr. Suozzi outlined a plan to deal with the budget crisis. Today, in a presentation to the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, which was created in 2000 to oversee county finances, he said, "There is no one big dramatic solution to the problems." His plan, though, is still the best way to deal with the problems, he said.
The plan consists of resolving labor disputes over wages and benefits, restructuring debt, increasing property taxes and reducing the size of the work force.
"I don't want to do layoffs," Mr. Suozzi said, noting that he could not rule them out. He said he had basically frozen departmental budgets for next year in an attempt to reduce the work force by at least 1,200 people by the end of 2003, which he thought would be sufficient to help balance the budget.
On property taxes, Mr. Suozzi said he would not raise them next year above the 19.4 percent that he had previously projected. He has committed to using the extra revenue solely to pay down the debt.
Mr. Suozzi is required to submit a budget proposal to the County Legislature before Sept. 16.
Stressing that Nassau's predicament is partly a function of the downturn in the economy, Mr. Suozzi said, "Every county in New York State is facing increased pension costs."
He said $15 million was initially budgeted to meet pension costs but that the fall in the prices of some stocks, where the pension funds were invested, meant that the county would have to pay more than $60 million.
Another problem common in counties was reduced sales tax revenue, he said. "People are not buying as many clothes or cars or shoes," Mr. Suozzi said. "These are tough times for the entire state."

HEADLINE: Despite Slump, Cities See Drop In Welfare Rolls 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
During the boom years of the late 1990's, when the 1996 welfare law was still sending public assistance rolls plummeting nationwide and more recipients were leaving for jobs than anyone had expected, critics of the law had one big warning: wait until the economy sours, the poor will come back.
 But despite the economic downturn, it has not happened in New York City, which has the largest number of public assistance cases of any city in the nation. Nor has it happened in many other large urban areas. 
 Although unemployment in New York City has risen more than 20 percent from its low in March and the numbers of families calling themselves homeless have jumped to record levels, the number of people who get public assistance has tumbled to 418,277, down 9.5 percent since the start of the year.
No one really knows the reasons for the decline, though given the passionate welfare debate, theories abound. All sides agree that factors such as how the city has chosen to administer the national mandate and the culture of the local bureaucracy have so far trumped cycles in the economy in affecting the rolls. Harmony ends there. 
On one side of the debate, advocates for the poor say they see the decline as yet more proof that the system is callous by design. Pointing to swelling lines at food pantries and housing shelters, they say there is overwhelming anecdotal evidence that the city is discouraging needy people from getting aid.
For proponents and administrators of changes in welfare, the continued downward march is evidence that their policies have had a long-lasting impact on improving the self-reliance of former welfare recipients. Independent researchers have also pointed to other factors, like quirks in the types of employment that single mothers are most likely to find in New York and the fact that welfare rolls in the city are disproportionately high.
Most important, proponents of change say, New York City's experience is not particularly anomalous when viewed against national data. Because of how the 1996 law was written, the Administration for Families and Children in Washington collects data on caseloads by state instead of city.
For 2001, the most recent period for which data is available, 26 states had rising caseloads, but the overall number of people receiving federal welfare benefits fell by 5.6 percent.
"There is great variability, but the overall trend continues to be down," said Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary for children and families. Despite economic contractions across the country, he added, "we are not seeing increases in caseloads which would bring us back to anything close to the level we saw in 1996."
An informal survey of counties with major urban centers done by New York City itself, while not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, suggests that many other cities continue to see steady declines.
From January through May of this year, New York City public assistance caseloads dropped 4.1 percent. In the same time period, Chicago's Cook County saw the number of recipients of federal aid decline 6.9 percent while Detroit's Wayne County dropped 1.3 percent and Los Angeles County lost 2.9 percent.
The main reason the downward trend continues nationally even in these times of economic frailty is that welfare and the state of the economy, surprisingly, have historically had weak statistical correlation. Verna Eggleston, the city's commissioner of Human Resources, says the rolls are going down and may continue to decline in the near future because "there are still people on our caseload who are engageable" in the work process.
Lawrence Mead, a professor at New York University who has been studying welfare nationally, is more blunt. "It continues to go down because the levels of dependence in New York City are still well above those that would be dictated by economic conditions," he said.
Professor Mead points out the percentage of New Yorkers who get public assistance is still several points above the national average.
Another possible explanation for the continued exodus is that former welfare recipients have been shielded from the economic downturn because of the kinds of work they have tended to go into.
"Single mothers have kind of dodged the recession bullet," said Mark K. Levitan at the Community Service Society of New York. "They are particularly well represented in health care, education and social services," industries that grew strongly through 2001.
For example, 17.9 percent of single mothers in New York are employed in education and social services jobs, a field that grew 15 percent in the last two years, Mr. Levitan said.
The city's peculiar employment pattern may also help to explain why federal assistance caseloads here have declined rapidly while caseloads in 26 states, including California, Massachusetts and Michigan, increased in 2001, the most recent period for which the federal government collected data.
"Expansion in those particular industries in New York City help explain why it is not increasing as much as in other states," said Margy Waller, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who studies welfare and poverty. In other localities, Ms. Waller said, single mothers were more heavily employed in travel-related industries like hotels, which were crushed after the Sept. 11 attack.
Demetra Nightingale, director of welfare and training research at the Urban Institute, said many states seeing sharp increases in their rolls also had shorter time limits for public assistance than New York and cut back on their benefit amounts more drastically. Since they were quicker to shed dependents, she said, they have seen quicker rebounds. 
That means, she added, that New York should not congratulate itself too heartily yet. Unemployment payments and temporary job programs took some of the edge off the displacement caused by the events of Sept. 11, but adverse consequences of that economic shock have been delayed, not avoided.
"You might not see its effects until about now or in the next few months," she said.
In fact, applications for public assistance in New York rose to 19,083 in July from 15,395 a month earlier, according to the city's Human Resources Administration. Average monthly applications for 2002 are also up by about 800 people over the monthly average in 2001, indicating that the decline in rolls may be on the verge of slowing.
Advocates for the poor, however, insist that regional differences and economic quirks cannot explain the demand increases they are seeing at food kitchens and housing shelters. Instead, they insist, the city is so focused on shedding people that it is scaring away the truly needy.
"Because the whole program under the previous administration was driven by punitive action, clients don't feel they can turn to the benefits when they really need it, " said Carlos Rodriguez, director of food stamp programs and policy at the Community Food Resource Center, an advocacy group that also runs a soup kitchen in Harlem.
"The picture is painted perfectly by the long list at the E.A.U.," he said, referring to the Emergency Assistance Unit, the city's intake center for homeless families, "and even longer lines at emergency food providers."
Two recent reports bolster claims by advocates for the poor that the decline in welfare numbers conflicts with other indicators that show the poor in increasing distress. More than three-quarters of the food pantries in New York City faced an increased demand for food in the six months after Sept. 11, according to a study conducted by Hunter College for the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. Food pantries give provisions to needy families as opposed to single homeless individuals.
In addition, the report surveyed food pantry directors on the causes of the increase and 76 percent said the loss of welfare benefits was a key reason. "The people running nonprofit, community-based feeding agencies overwhelmingly indicate that people kicked off welfare are coming to them for help because they do not have jobs," said Joel Berg, the group's executive director.
And a report to be released next week by the Public Advocate's Office compared food stamp use in 10 major urban areas in the period from June 2001 to June 2002 and found participation in programs increased in every city but New York, where it fell 2 percent. The report concludes, "New York City's previous administration's opposition to public assistance may also contribute to the city's low participation levels."

 BODY:
W.T.O. Rules Penalties Can Be Imposed on U.S.
The World Trade Organization, the international arbiter in global trade disputes, ruled that the European Union can impose $4 billion in penalties on the United States because an American tax break that promotes exports is illegal.
 The verdict is the biggest penalty ever handed down against a country since the Geneva-based trade organization came into being in 1995, and it could hurt companies like Boeing and General Electric that have been heavy users of the tax break. Page A1. 

5-Month Fall for Dow and Nasdaq
The Nasdaq composite index ended August in the red, its fifth consecutive monthly loss. It has not suffered a five-month fall since April 1984. The Dow Jones industrial average also had a five-month decline, for the first time since September 1981. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index just managed to avoid a fifth month of decline. C4.

Plans for an Ad-Less 2003 Masters
CBS Sports and the USA Network will televise the Masters without commercials next year from Citigroup, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola. The Augusta National Golf Club said it made the decision to protect its sponsors from being pressured by a campaign to add women to its membership rolls. A1.

Boeing Machinists to Vote Again
The machinists union at Boeing will vote again on management's latest contract proposal because of confusion among workers about the ballot, union officials said. Workers said they voted on Thursday without knowing what they were supposed to do after the contract expired midnight tomorrow. That prompted the union to seal the results and call a new vote. A16.

The F.A.A. ordered commercial airlines to check more than 1,400 planes manufactured by Boeing to see if they are equipped with an improperly wired fuel pump. A16.

Andersen Payout to Enron Creditors
Andersen Worldwide, the umbrella group for overseas accounting firms affiliated with Arthur Andersen, confirmed that it would pay nearly $60 million to creditors, employees and shareholders of Enron. C3.

Flight Attendants Criticize Plan
United Airlines flight attendants called the plan to reduce labor costs 15 percent too drastic and joined other unions in urging the airline to name a new chief executive to hasten financial recovery efforts. C4.

A July Surge in Consumer Spending
The Commerce Department reported that personal spending in July jumped 1 percent, to $7.35 trillion -- the biggest increase in nine months -- thanks largely to low interest rates. Consumers managed to spend more even though their total incomes did not change. Most of the increase in spending came from a 3.9 percent rise in purchases of big-ticket items like cars and appliances. C3.

Record Stock Fund Withdrawals
As the stock market declined, investors withdrew a record $52.6 billion from stock mutual funds in July and shifted a record $28.1 billion into bond funds, an industry report said. C4.

Regulators Investigate Airlines
The Japanese Fair Trade Commission will look into whether Japan Airlines and two other airlines violated the country's monopoly law by cutting fares on a route also operated by an upstart carrier, Skynet Asia Airways. C2.

A Whiff of Failure Is Still in the Air

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
In the Mets' clubhouse, the television was showing the Cubbies, "the only game in the majors this afternoon," as Ernie Banks loves to enunciate. 
 There was the ivy on the wall. There was the brick wall that has been behind home plate since time immemorial. It all looked so sweet and normal, but it will take more than the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field in the middle of the afternoon to bring baseball back to anything approximating sweet and normal. 
 The Mets drifted in, seeming to relish the routine of slipping into uniform. 
"Contentissimo!" shouted Armando Benitez, sounding very happy to be there, playing ball, earning a paycheck, and a big paycheck at that.
But for all the ritual, there was a hangdog air over all the players and the people who own the teams. They had gone to the last possible moment with their labor negotiations, only to discover that a small percentage of people care anymore, and some of those are angry. Fans had demonstrated in Anaheim the night before, protesting the potential wreck of a winning season. 
"There will be some fan fallout," admitted Vance Wilson, the backup catcher who worked his way out of the minors and became the Mets' assistant player representative. "We need to spend time with the fans to let them know they are important."
But even the sincere impulses may not be enough. The players and the owners cannot merely open the gates and tell America that everything is just the way it was.
After the last sour month of labor discussions, the baseball nation saw the furry-tongued Bud Selig and Donald Fehr trying to assure us that this was a wonderful and historic step for humankind, because baseball was spared a stoppage this time around.
For all their overnight negotiating, it does not sound as if anything has changed. The rich teams -- that is to say, the Yankees -- will continue to stockpile their cable riches in order to load up on Mussinas and Giambis, their Mondesis and Weavers. 
Not even a new luxury tax, which will cost the Yankees a few million dollars here and there, will stop them from putting their foot on the face of the American League, forever.
There was one clear development during a month of blather, and that was the immense distaste the public now has for baseball's posturing. This is new. It has never been this bad. Oh, there was an old guy here and a little kid there, holding up signs saying, "Please, don't go away," but mostly the reaction was, whatever. Prove it. Show us some moxie. Take a hike. Come back in a year.
In the end, the players could not walk because where else are they going to make an average of $2.4 million a year in salary?
Some words flickered across the screen in the Mets' clubhouse. Steve Kline, the Cardinals' player representative, was quoted as saying: "It came down to us playing baseball or having our reputations and life ripped by the fans. Baseball would have never been the same if we had walked out."
He was right about that, but coming to an agreement was hardly an act of statesmanship. Not much is different. Selig threatened to contract a few weak teams last winter, but contraction has now been put off for four years. 
A lot of economists have said that baseball is in a precarious position with advertisers and television, but nevertheless an owner like Jeffrey Loria trades up on franchises the way yuppies trade in S.U.V's. 
In the new settlement, baseball is going to work toward distributing about $250 million a year to the weaker teams -- with no guarantee that the owners won't do the Enron Shuffle with the books to build themselves a hacienda rather than a farm system. 
And the bogus steroid clause, letting the lads beef up all winter and take their drug tests in the friendly confines of spring training? Fehr and Selig insult our intelligence with that one. 
While the two sides pulled their all-nighter on how to divide the swag, I could not help but think about Pete Coscarart, the old Brooklyn Dodger second baseman, who used to send me a few handwritten letters reminding me that baseball had adamantly refused to include the pre-1946 players in the pension plan. 
"They are waiting for us to die," said the spunky Al Gionfriddo, another old Dodger who has been ignored. 
Well, Coscarart did die in late July at age 89, so now there are about 75 players left. Oddly enough, they were not mentioned in yesterday's settlement. 
Meanwhile, George Steinbrenner and the other big-market owners were more than willing to hold all the fans' money for playoff tickets during a potential layoff. But the working stiffs who waited outside the ballparks did not know whether they were going to make a decent pocketful of beery quarters and dollar bills from working as vendors and waitresses and ushers last night.
This is not their game. And at the new ticket prices, this is not the people's game anymore, either. 
The players got into their uniforms. They are good at what they do, and must prove it in public, over and over again. In general, they deserve their money, as well as the friendly applause from the tiny crowd when they took the field last night. 
"Nobody got hurt," Mo Vaughn said, meaning there was no labor stoppage. But something has been hurt. Baseball's image has been bruised, even disfigured. It has never been this bad.

 "Poverty in a Land of Plenty: Can Hartford Ever Recover?" (front page, Aug. 26) did not cite one key cause of Hartford's decline: the state has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to expanding highways out of the city, and to other infrastructure required to support the middle-class exodus to the suburbs. 
 Think how different the city would be if this money had been invested to make it attractive to people of all income levels. And Hartford is not the only city where dysfunctional land use and transportation policies have led to decline.

 The Aug. 26 front-page article on Hartford's problems could have mentioned the many things that are helping the city recover, like the efforts of the higher-education community. 
 The Learning Corridor, a kind of educational park, has been developed by Trinity College and the Southside Institution Neighborhood Alliance. Trinity continues to create programming synergies with neighbors like the Connecticut Historical Society. Capital Community College is beginning new life in unfilled downtown space, and the University of Hartford is converting a former car dealership into an arts center. 
These efforts, to name just a few, are hardly a sign of a city simply sitting and awaiting its comeback.

LAST-MINUTE DEAL IN BASEBALL TALKS PREVENTS A STRIKE

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
For the first time in 30 years, Major League Baseball and its players reached agreement on a new labor contract without a work stoppage yesterday, concluding the deal a few hours short of a strike.
 "This represents the first time in baseball history that we have reached a collective bargaining agreement without the loss of a single game," Commissioner Bud Selig said at a news conference in Manhattan announcing the agreement. 
 Selig's reading of history was off -- negotiations in the 1960's were completed without work stoppages -- but, given the contentious relationship that had produced five strikes and three lockouts in the eight negotiations since 1972, the development was surprising.
It not only ensures labor peace for four more years, but it also guarantees that the World Series will be played this year. The last time the players and the owners tried to negotiate a new agreement, in 1994, the World Series was canceled for the first time in 90 years. 
"All streaks come to an end, and this is one that was overdue to come to an end," Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said.
The agreement includes greater sharing of local revenue among baseball's 30 clubs and a more serious penalty for high payrolls, called a luxury tax, than the previous agreement had employed. The agreement also ensures that no teams will be eliminated through the 2006 season and provides for testing of players for steroids for the first time. News analysis, Page D1. 
In this negotiation, the players union, the Major League Baseball Players Association, may have given up more than it ever had since winning free agency for players in 1975. Selig, however, had made a persuasive argument that some aspects of the game needed fixing and players concluded that the time was right to settle and not squabble. The agreement must be ratified by both sides, but they say that is a foregone conclusion.
"This was definitely a time that with the market and people's portfolios down and Enrons and Arthur Andersens, WorldComs, certainly the effect of Sept. 11 coming up, people being laid off, all of that whole gamut made the players realize that a strike's not good for anyone," said Al Leiter, the Mets' player representative.
The players had set yesterday as a strike date, fearing that if they ended the season without a new agreement the owners would declare an impasse and put a new economic system in place after the World Series.
A series of all-day and all-night bargaining sessions took the negotiators to a deal completed little more than three hours before the day's first game was scheduled to be played in Chicago. Without an agreement, players would not have gone to Wrigley Field or 14 other ballparks where games were scheduled for last night.
But they played the game knowing their sport had changed its economics with the alterations in revenue sharing and the luxury tax. The union had been concerned about the effect of the combination of those two elements on the higher-spending teams, like the Yankees, but its negotiators succeeded in getting the clubs' negotiators to accept a tax system that should not be as costly to as many teams as they had wanted to affect.
"Obviously, that's a subject that we're very sensitive to," Fehr said. "We believe this is an agreement we can live with. Otherwise we wouldn't have made it."
Selig and the clubs have cited the disparity between teams' payrolls and competitive imbalance as serious problems. They point to the dominance of the Yankees in recent seasons as the epitome of their problems.
But in their economic proposals management did not want to affect only the Yankees; it was also going after six other big-spending teams, including the Mets. In the end, though, Selig settled for a plan that, if in effect this year, would tax the Yankees $9.5 million, the Texas Rangers $2.5 million and the Los Angeles Dodgers $315,000.
Management's preference would be for every team to be under the threshold and pay no tax. But when players hear that, they think the clubs want the tax to serve as a payroll cap. The money will be combined with the revenue-sharing proceeds.
Clubs that exceed the designated threshold will pay the tax on the portions of payrolls over the threshold. The threshold will be $117 million in 2003, $120.5 million in 2004, $128 million in 2005 and $136.5 million in 2006. The tax rates will range from 17.5 percent the first time a team exceeds the threshold to 40 percent the third and fourth times it goes beyond.
The two sides compromised on thresholds and rates.
But in a tradeoff, the players accepted a tax in the fourth year, which they initially opposed, in return for the clubs' acceptance of returning the termination date of the agreement from Oct. 31 to December. The union had wanted Dec. 31, which was the date before the last agreement, but settled for Dec. 19. The difference in dates deals with control over player contracts after the final season of the agreement, 2006.
Compromise was also present in the revenue-sharing plan. The union wanted part of the total amount phased in over four years, with the revenue sharing fully reached in the fourth year. The clubs wanted no phase-in. They agreed to a partial phase-in, with full revenue sharing in the final two years.
That full annual revenue-sharing sum will be $258 million, and the four-year total will be $988.68 million.
The bulk of the money, representing 34 percent of net local revenue, comes from the richer clubs and goes to the poorer clubs.
The idea of transferring money is for the poorer clubs to use it to improve their teams and become more competitive. Because the money will be divided equally among all recipients, as opposed to a different distribution system under the old agreement, middle-revenue clubs will benefit most from the plan.
Negotiators had basically completed their work on revenue sharing first, but it was contingent on reaching agreement on the luxury tax. It took four bargaining sessions through Thursday night and yesterday morning to get there.
Working primarily with two negotiators from each camp, Bob DuPuy and Rob Manfred for the clubs and Steve Fehr and Michael Weiner for the players, the two sides met for the better part of four hours between 9:30 p.m. and close to 2 a.m. Then at a 4 a.m. meeting, the players' two negotiators gave the clubs' pair a proposal. Two and a half hours later it was the clubs' negotiators who were offering a proposal.
With management officials growing impatient because there were travel plans to carry out if games were to be played yesterday, the union representatives went to the commissioner's office at 9:15 a.m. Fehr, who had not been at the smaller sessions, attended that meeting, which Selig also joined for his first appearance at the bargaining table.
The Boston Red Sox, meanwhile, were at Fenway Park, having delayed their 7:30 a.m. departure for Logan Airport and their flight to Cleveland. They waited more than an hour.
Other teams and players waited, too, to find out if their games and maybe the season were in jeopardy. Finally, shortly before noon, the agreement was concluded.
"It goes without saying we're really excited and happy we got this done," said Tom Glavine, the Atlanta Braves pitcher who is the National League player representative and a veteran of the 1994-95 strike. "We don't have to go through the uncertainties of another work stoppage and what it does to the game."
Selig remained euphoric. "I think there were a lot of people," he said, "who never believed they'd live long enough to see these two parties come together, make a very meaningful deal and do it without one game of work stoppage."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Economic Output Is Up 

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Canada's gross domestic product grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 4.3 percent in the second quarter, propelled by strong consumer demand for services, a recovery in business spending on machinery and equipment, and inventory replenishment, Statistics Canada said. Though the latest figure falls short of the 6.3 percent advance in the first quarter, it is further evidence that Canada's economy is outperforming that of the United States. Economists are divided whether the Bank of Canada will again raise its overnight lending rate at its policy review on Wednesday. The rate, currently at 2.75 percent, has been increased three times this year.

HEADLINE: Iraq Stance Puts Blair at Odds With Party 

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
An intensifying debate within his Labor Party over Iraq has thrust Prime Minister Tony Blair into an unusually vulnerable position as he prepares for the party's annual conference next month. 
 Publicly, Mr. Blair's government has repeatedly emphasized its support for the United States on Iraq. But there are increasing signs -- in the government, in Parliament and in the country at large -- that Britons are alarmed with the Bush administration's talk of war and with Britain's apparent acquiescence to the American position. In an ICM/Guardian poll this month, only 21 percent of voters surveyed said they supported America's Iraq policy. 
 Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said this week that a resumption of arms inspections in Iraq would be a step forward in resolving the crisis. That statement seemed at odds with the American position, as articulated by Vice President Dick Cheney, that such inspections would not be helpful and could be counterproductive.
Mr. Blair, scheduled to spend three days in Africa starting Saturday, has yet to address the increasing perception that Britain, America's staunchest ally in the campaign against terrorism, is losing its ability to temper American policy. Asked to comment today, he told reporters, "Let's leave that for another day, shall we?"
Others have not been so tight-lipped. Peter Mandelson, a Labor member of Parliament, said on Thursday that while Saddam Hussein's failure to accept a series of United Nations resolutions on arms inspection meant that military action might be necessary, unilateral action by the United States would be "a recipe for disaster."
The Guardian reported that Mr. Mandelson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, added, referring to the United States, "We cannot have a system in which one state feels it has the right to change the political system of another, or foment subversion, or seize pieces of territory it claims."
Mr. Mandelson -- who made his remarks in a speech in Jakarta -- is no longer a member of the government, and Downing Street emphasized today that he had been speaking only as a back-bench member of Parliament. But in the past he has been one of Mr. Blair's closest friends and allies, and his remarks are an indication, at the very least, of Labor's growing worry. 
A survey of 100 local Labor chairman around the country by The Times of London found that the overwhelming majority opposed an invasion of Iraq. Of the 70 chairmen who gave their views, only five said definitively that they would support military action. 
Writing recently in The Spectator magazine, Gerald Kaufman, an influential Labor member of Parliament and former shadow foreign secretary, said there was wide opposition in Parliament to the prospect of war against Iraq. "There is substantial resistance in the parliamentary Labor Party against war on Iraq, not just from the usual suspects," he wrote, "but from many mainstream M.P.'s. Tony Blair would find it difficult to support and participate in a war against Iraq whose majority in the House of Commons was provided by the Conservatives."
Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Mr. Blair was obligated to ensure that any action in Iraq be preceded by a United Nations mandate. "Since Sept. 11, much has been made of Britain's role as a 'pivotal power' with the ability to act as a restraint on the United States," Mr. Kennedy wrote in The Times of London. "Unwavering loyalty has brought much criticism and little public achievement. I would argue that Britain's pivotal moment has come."
Mr. Blair is in a particularly tricky position because he wants so many possibly contradictory things at once. He wants to keep the United States happy, to continue to influence American policy, to quell the fears of his back-benchers and local Labor supporters, and to placate European allies opposed to an invasion. 
"The government is desperate to find a way out of this," said John Kent, a specialist in international relations at the London School of Economics. "They're caught in the ultimate dilemma of having to stand by in defiance of all sorts of people they'd normally want to keep good relations with, most of all their European friends and the grass roots of the Labor Party."

HEADLINE: To Greenspan, 90's Bubble Was Beyond Reach of Fed 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, defended the central bank today against criticism that it had mishandled the rise and fall of the stock market and said that the Fed could not have prevented the bubble on Wall Street without damaging the economy.
 Mr. Greenspan said the only way to have reined in the stock market would have been to raise interest rates sharply, a step that he said would have put the entire economy in peril. Smaller but more frequent rate increases, he said, would not have done the trick either. 
 "The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have been calibrated to prevent the late 1990's bubble is almost surely an illusion," he said. 
The other tactic that critics have suggested he could have used, limiting the ability of investors to pay for stock purchases by borrowing against their shareholdings, would also have had little effect, Mr. Greenspan said.
His speech, delivered here to an audience of government officials and economists at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was his most extensive and detailed explanation so far of how he viewed the Wall Street boom of the late 1990's and what the Fed did -- and did not do -- about it.
It addressed head-on the assessment of some investors and economists in the last few years that the Fed had failed to protect the economy and millions of 401(k) accounts from a wild and destabilizing swing in stock prices.
Though the stock market's course may be far outside even Mr. Greenspan's ability to control, he received some of the credit when the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq seemed to have no ceiling. And his remarks today suggested that he is sensitive to what the market's downturn, however inevitable, has done to his reputation for successful economic management.
"As events evolved, we recognized that, despite our suspicions, it was very difficult to definitively identify a bubble until after the fact -- that is, when its bursting confirmed its existence," he said. "Moreover, it was far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, could be pre-empted short of the central bank inducing a substantial contraction in economic activity, the very outcome we would be seeking to avoid."
Mr. Greenspan made no mention of how the Fed was dealing with the bursting of the bubble and the economy's difficulties in recovering from the recession of last year. Neither Mr. Greenspan nor any other Fed official here said anything to counter the growing impression that signs of halting economic improvement and increasing hope on Wall Street that stock prices may have bottomed out will keep official interest rates unchanged in September and perhaps for the rest of the year.
His speech today had the air of a defense of his legacy as, at 76, Mr. Greenspan starts his 16th year as chairman. His main message was that even in retrospect, he could find no way that the central bank could have averted the boom and bust on Wall Street without giving up much of the benefits of the 1990's, from low unemployment to improved international competitiveness.
"It seems reasonable to generalize from our recent experience that no low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tightening exists that can reliably deflate a bubble," Mr. Greenspan said. "But is there some policy that can at least limit the size of a bubble and, hence, its destructive fallout? From the evidence to date, the answer appears to be no."
After Mr. Greenspan's speech, many economists here said they agreed that rate increases were too crude a tool to contain an unsustainable rise in stock prices and that the Fed should not be in the business of managing or second-guessing Wall Street in any case.
But some economists said Mr. Greenspan had glossed over the Fed's role at critical times in the stock market's rise, especially in 1999, when some analysts thought the Fed was too slow to raise rates in the face of a red-hot economy and a steep rise in equity prices. These economists also said the Fed chairman had not fully acknowledged his own role in promoting a bullishness about the economy's prospects and therefore about stock market valuations.
"This was his defense, and it was a credible defense," said David D. Hale, chief economist for Zurich Financial Services. "But you can still ask questions about other channels he could have used. He could have used moral suasion more than he did to dampen investor sentiment."
Mr. Greenspan has always maintained that the Fed should not use monetary policy to try to push the stock market up and down. But he has also made clear that Wall Street is increasingly a major influence on the economy and that the Fed must therefore be concerned with what goes on there.
In late 1996, Mr. Greenspan sent shudders through markets around the world when he raised the question of whether rising asset prices reflected "irrational exuberance" among investors.
But he subsequently focused his public remarks on the long-term economic gains likely to result from a resurgence in the growth rate of productivity, the most basic measure of business efficiency and the primary determinant of an economy's ability to grow faster without igniting inflation.
Once seen as a dour inflation fighter, Mr. Greenspan was transformed in the late 1990's into a leading advocate of the idea that technology was transforming the world and unlocking untapped economic potential. His optimistic pronouncements were invariably accompanied by caveats, but during the boom most investors seemed to ignore the warnings and seized only on Mr. Greenspan's optimistic side to justify their own bullishness.
Mr. Greenspan pointed today to testimony he gave to Congress in July 1999 that laid out the benefits the United States was reaping from the rebound in productivity. In that testimony, he said explicitly that productivity improvements did not justify ever-rising stock prices and that the Fed's role in a market bubble was to be ready to clean up the mess when it burst.
In his speech today, Mr. Greenspan described the Fed's attempts to determine whether stock prices were going out of hand in the last decade. He said the main focus was on corporate profits and whether the productivity improvements would permit them to rise at a rate that would justify the values put on stocks by investors.
The Fed also tried to judge how much risk investors were willing to accept to buy stocks rather than securities like government bonds that carry almost no risk, he said.
In the end, though, it was psychology as much as a rational assessment of the numbers that led investors to push equity prices so high, Mr. Greenspan suggested.
"Bubbles are often precipitated by perceptions of real improvements in the productivity and underlying profitability of the corporate economy," Mr. Greenspan said. "But as history attests, investors then too often exaggerate the extent of the improvement in economic fundamentals. Human psychology being what it is, bubbles tend to feed on themselves, and booms in later stages are often supported by implausible projections of potential demand."
As a strong believer in market forces, Mr. Greenspan has always been uncomfortable in the role of second-guessing the decisions of millions of investors. But he said today that he had few tools at his disposal even if he was able to conclude that the market was dangerously out of whack.
Jawboning the market, he said, "will be ineffective unless backed by action." One course of action is moderate interest rate increases, but history suggests that they are ineffective in dampening stock prices over the long run, he said.
"In fact, our experience over the past 15 years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices," he said.
The alternative is big rate increases. But raising rates enough to squeeze the speculation out of the financial markets would also probably kill off an economic expansion, he said, making the cure at least as bad as the disease.
The other weapon open to the Fed, which besides controlling official interest rates helps regulate the financial system, would be to tighten requirements for margin lending. Some economists say the Fed could have sent a powerful signal to the markets that prices were becoming excessive by making it harder for investors to borrow to purchase shares.
But Mr. Greenspan said there was little evidence that raising margin requirements would have tamed the market.

HEADLINE: German Unit Will Pull Out If U.S. Attacks 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
If the United States attacks Iraq, Germany will withdraw its specialized unit designed to respond to nuclear, chemical and biological warfare from Kuwait, the German defense minister said in an interview published today.
 The conservative challenger in upcoming German elections, Edmund Stoiber, also said today that he would do the same in the case of a unilateral American attack on Iraq, but only after consultations with allies. 
 The new German position marks another shift away from Washington in the heat of a campaign that Chancellor Gerhard Schroder is trying to turn toward questions of peace rather than the high unemployment.
The specialized German unit, consisting of 6 Fuchs tanks and 52 soldiers, is designed to detect the use or presence of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and then to try to destroy them. It was sent to Kuwait as part of Germany's contribution to the campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan that followed the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. 
The German Parliament approved sending the unit after a bitter debate, and the defense minister, Peter Struck, a former parliamentary leader for Mr. Schroder's Social Democrats, said a new American war against Iraq would fall outside that parliamentary mandate and would mean that the unit should be withdrawn.
"If the danger exists that our soldiers could be involved in a conflict situation in Iraq, that would not be covered by the mandate given them" by the German Parliament, Mr. Struck told the Berliner Zeitung. "They would then be withdrawn."
Mr. Schroder, in a close and bitter election fight with Mr. Stoiber, has said that Germany would not participate in any war against Iraq or contribute financially to one, even if there were a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. 
That position has annoyed the Bush administration, but it is popular with the German public, and it has put Mr. Stoiber on the defensive. The more bellicose the noises coming from Washington, officials of Mr. Stoiber's party say, the more Mr. Schroeder looks like a man of peace. 
Mr. Schroder, who pronounced Germany's "unconditional solidarity" with the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, has said that a military strike on Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein is a different matter. 
Six months ago, however, Mr. Schroder reportedly told party officials and parliamentary leaders at a meeting that a decision to withdraw the Fuchs unit from Kuwait would have bad consequences for German-American relations for many years.
According to records of that closed meeting, which were seen by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr. Schroder said no one could be responsible for the consequences "for the German-American relationship over the next 30 to 50 years" if the Fuchs units were withdrawn, and nuclear, chemical or biological weapons were then used against Kuwait or allied forces.
For that reason, the paper said in its account of his remarks, the units would remain in Kuwait and could be used there even in the case of "unilateral action" by the United States.
But the tough election campaign has caused Mr. Schroder and his party to move sharply to the left, to try to inspire supporters disappointed over the economy to vote.
Mr. Schroder has been the most outspoken European leader warning the United States against an attack on Iraq, calling it "an adventure." The Schroder position is harder than those of the British and French, who have said that any attack on Iraq must have the mandate of the United Nations and be preceded by further efforts to get Iraq to allow the resumption of inspections by United Nations arms monitors. 
"According to our present knowledge there is no concrete threat for us here in Europe emanating from Saddam Hussein," Mr. Struck said today -- a common German view that contradicts the view of the Bush administration.
Mr. Stoiber said today that he, too, would withdraw the Fuchs units if Iraq were attacked unilaterally. He added, however, "We should coordinate our action, which depends on decisions by the United Nations, above all with the Europeans."

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier to Visit North Korea in Sign of Thaw 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Japan's Prime Minister announced today that he would travel to North Korea next month for a summit meeting, a significant step toward ending the North's half century of isolation. 
 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's bold move to engage North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, coincided with another sign of the North's tentative opening, as North and South Korea announced a timetable to start repairing road and rail links closed since the Korean War. 
 A meeting between the two leaders, scheduled for Sept. 17, holds out the promise of a thaw in Northeast Asia that would greatly ease tensions between a staunch American ally and a nation that President Bush has labeled part of an "axis of evil." 
It could also mean billions of dollars in aid and compensation for a North Korean state whose economic hardship has raised the question of its very survival. 
Today, North Korea's official news agency hailed the visit as "an important occasion in settling the issues between the two countries and normalizing the bilateral relations."
Still, the issues dividing the two nations run deep. Japan colonized and occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945. While Japan established relations with South Korea in 1965, it has not had diplomatic relations with the North. Outstanding issues include the development of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles by North Korea, which test-fired a missile over Japan four years ago.
North Korea's weapons programs are also of grave concern to the United States, which maintains 37,000 troops in the South. 
With North Korea, where decision-making is concentrated in the hands of one mercurial leader, the Japanese prime minister is gambling that a rare, direct visit over one day can make progress where a decade of talks by lower-level officials have proved fruitless. 
"I felt we couldn't make a step forward unless the leaders have a talk," said Mr. Koizumi, who added that he had discussed the move in a telephone call to President Bush. "Probably the leader Kim Jong Il feels the same way." 
With Japanese diplomats talking about a possible "breakthrough," there is an auspicious precedent. In 1972, Japan established relations with China after Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited Beijing. 
In the last two years, Mr. Kim, who is famed for his reclusiveness, has met with the leader of the rival South, as well as leaders of China and Russia, which played host to Mr. Kim during a rail visit a week ago. In the same time, relations with the United States cooled decidedly after Mr. Bush took office. 
"There is a consensus in the region that North Korea can be drawn out of its isolation," Donald P. Gregg, chairman of the Korea Society, said today from New York. Referring to the Bush administration's verbal confrontations with North Korea, he added, "And I don't think we are in sync with that." 
But others credited the administration's hard line with scaring North Korea into making tough choices.
"It is producing results, after a decade of trying to appease and coddle this guy," said Debra Liang Fenton, executive director of the United States Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, a private group with growing influence in Congress. "In January, Bush calls this guy part of the axis of evil, and all of sudden he moves."
Masao Okonogi, a North Korea specialist at Keio University here, said: "It is necessary for North Korea to proceed with normalization of relations with Japan before the U.S. attacks Iraq. That way, North Korea can avoid becoming a target."
Normalization of relations with Japan may also add pressure on the United States to allow North Korea access to low-interest loans from groups like the World Bank. 
"Their economic stagnation is a very serious problem for the survival of the regime," said Selig S. Harrison, a North Korea expert at the Center for International Policy, a Washington research institute. "The real driving force is that North Korea has an economy that is stalemated, that once depended on Russia and China for energy and food." 
North Korea has long demanded compensation from Japan for damage caused during Japanese colonization and World War II.
When Japan established relations with South Korea, it agreed to $500 million in economic credits and grants, in return for the South's renunciation of further claims. 
This time around, the aid could amount to billions of dollars. 
"They haven't quantified the amount, but they would like more than $10 billion," said Mr. Okonogi, a political science professor.
Bad blood between Japan and North Korea dates back half a century, to the days when Japan served as rear base for American troops fighting the North in the Korean War. 
"North Korea's overall attitude to Japan has not changed: they want a total apology and compensation," Tetsuo Maeda, a Tokyo International University professor of arms control, said today after returning here from his sixth visit to North Korea. 
While North Korea appears to have initiated the overtures to Japan in recent months, it will face several Japanese demands as the price of normalization. 
A primary one, with strong support in public opinion polls, is a full accounting and return of at least a dozen Japanese citizens who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970's and 80's. Family groups say as many as 100 people were kidnapped and taken to North Korea, largely for use as language teachers. 
During some of the years when the kidnappings were occurring, Mr. Kim was running North Korea's spy service. At Red Cross meetings this month in Pyongyang, the North Korean side confirmed the fates of six Japanese women who either had died or were still alive.
Japan also wants a continued suspension of North Korean missile tests beyond the 2003 moratorium deadline set by Mr. Kim. 
Mr. Koizumi's visit will probably lead to extended negotiations with Japan, a process that is expected to moderate North Korea's behavior.
"This dialogue will be a restraining force during a long period of time when North Korea will not want to rock the boat," Mr. Harrison predicted from the United States.
Under the timetable announced today at the end of inter-Korean economic talks, construction of the road and rail links is to start Sept. 18, the day after Mr. Koizumi's visit. 
The two nations said they hoped to complete a western rail link and an eastern road link across the demilitarized zone by the end of this year. By next spring, an additional western highway is to link the two capitals, Seoul and Pyongyang. By the end of next year, a railroad is to go up the east coast. 
South Korea also promised to ship to North Korea 400,000 tons of rice on easy credit terms and won a promise from the North to allow southern companies to build an industrial park for low-wage, labor-intensive industries across the border from Seoul.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts, Again 

 BODY:
President Bush's summer idyll in Texas, which comes to a close this weekend, has been interrupted more than once by bad economic news. As a result, the White House says Mr. Bush may present yet another package of tax cuts when he returns to work after Labor Day. Some of the proposals are said to be based on ideas proposed at the stage-managed economic "forum" in Waco, including new tax incentives to encourage stock market investments and expanded tax breaks for investors who have suffered losses. Details are skimpy, but based on what officials are saying, it looks as if Mr. Bush's proposals would do little to help the economy while deepening federal deficits over the long term. 
 The White House's urgent desire to offer a second round of cuts is understandable in political terms. So far, Mr. Bush's strategy has consisted entirely of actions whose impact will not be felt for years. They include extending or expanding tax cuts toward the end of this decade, pursuing trade agreements in coming years and permitting more drilling for oil and gas on federal lands, another step that -- even if it were desirable, which it is not -- would have no short-term impact. Mr. Bush is thus said to be intrigued with the idea of tax incentives aimed at boosting the stock market right away. In addition to new breaks for gains and losses, there is some thought of allowing Americans to contribute more to their 401(k) retirement plans or reducing taxes on dividends. 
 Some of these ideas have kicked around for years, and there are respectable economists who think they could help. But history shows that it is very risky to craft a tax-cut package to influence the stock market. Some steps, such as letting investors deduct their losses from their taxes, might actually encourage more selling of stocks. Besides, it is unacceptable for the administration to push for more tax breaks for wealthy investors when it has opposed the extension of unemployment benefits for those thrown out of work in the recession.
But the overriding problem with more tax cuts is the cost. The proposals Mr. Bush is looking at are expensive. This week the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the recession, combined with increased spending and the cost of the 2001 Bush tax cuts, had vaporized all but $1 trillion of the 10-year, $5.6 trillion surplus projected less than two years ago. It would be unconscionable for Mr. Bush to propose any tax cuts without explaining how they will be paid for over the long term. A case can be made for some tax-cutting now, but only if the huge tax cuts scheduled to take effect several years from now for the wealthiest Americans are repealed.

HEADLINE: Slouching Towards 9/11 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There are eight million 9/11 stories in the Naked City. Be grateful that I will spare you mine.
 The avalanche about to descend is heavy enough as it is: more than 150 books, a landfill of commemorative magazines and newspapers, 90 hours of special television programming replaying the greatest hits from America's most lethal hit. "We're going to be reliving it in such a way that newspapers can sell newspapers and networks can get ratings," said Madeleine Smithberg, the executive producer of Jon Stewart's "Daily Show." "The overall effect is that you become numb to something you should never become numb to." 
 Though "The Daily Show" will be mum on the 11th, nearly every other market niche will be patriotically served, each according to its demographic. The Food Network will replace its morning programs with what one executive calls "tasteful, mellow instrumental music." ESPN has a documentary on sports in Afghanistan after the Taliban. My own favorite channel, Turner Classic Movies, will offer the camp take on an attack on the Manhattan skyline: a rerun of "King Kong" (mercifully not the World Trade Center-relocated Jessica Lange remake). 
Fox has titled its 9/11 special "The Day America Changed," and those looking for an alternative can surf to "The Day That Changed America" on CBS. But here is one way America has not changed. Our history still repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce, but most of all as entertainment, with a full line of merchandise and an undertow of nostalgia. Only the time frame has been compressed. In merely a year, "Let's Roll!" has gone from being a hero's brave cry to a Neil Young song to the Florida State football team's official slogan to a T-shirt to No. 1 on next week's Times best-seller list. This is all reassuring. If the terrorists' aim was in part to wreck America's premier export -- our culture -- we can say with confidence that they have not won.
Even so, there have been some changes over the past year, starting with the strange disappearance of the Democratic Party. In foreign-policy debates on TV these days "the left" is now represented by the G.O.P. gargoyle Lawrence Eagleburger. On the right, political correctness has also turned inside out. Those who once deplored the suppression of free speech on campus are now calling for it if the subject under discussion is the Koran. 
But we remain a resilient nation, and much is just as it was a year ago. Old Normal: Gary Condit, Lizzie Grubman. New Normal: Michael Skakel, Lizzie Grubman. Last Labor Day's Time magazine cover story, "Where Have You Gone, Colin Powell?" -- depicting the secretary of state as the Bush administration's odd man out -- is as timely as ever. Afghanistan has again dropped off most Americans' radar screens. We are still encouraged to guzzle gas without feeling guilty about our slavish dependence on allies like the one that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers. Union Square once more is innocent of fliers with the legend "MISSING."
Of course we still remember the missing, and mourn them, and not even a maudlin, self-aggrandizing media orgy a year later could so deaden our senses that we would forget. But a certain national numbness, or perhaps amnesia, is settling in. If we remember the dead of Sept. 11 vividly, we are gradually losing sight of those who carried out their slaughter. Wasn't our mission to track down Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, dead or alive, before they struck again? We are now gearing up to fight another war that has been grandfathered into the war on terrorism. While it too targets an unambiguous evildoer, it is a different mission that is already obscuring the first and may yet defeat it.
Each week brings new evidence that our original task has largely been left unfulfilled in the wake of our early and successful routing of the Taliban. The Los Angeles Times has reported that the nearly 600 prisoners from 43 countries being held in U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay have yielded no senior Qaeda leaders whatsoever. On Wednesday The Washington Post found that two of the most important of those missing leaders are operating at full tilt out of Iran, where they are "directly involved in planning Al Qaeda terrorist operations," despite the Pentagon's announcement that one of them had been killed in Afghanistan in January. 
The fact that this unhappy news arrives late and muted can be attributed in part to one other post-9/11 change. The Bush administration, never open to begin with, has now turned secrecy into a crusade so extreme that it is even fighting in court to protect the confidentiality of Bill Clinton's sleazy dealings with Marc Rich. (Why? Perhaps the executive privilege at stake would help hide its Energy Task Force's sleazy dealings with Enron.) There's a legitimate debate whether the defeat of terrorism justifies constitutional shortcuts -- and that argument is playing out in court, where there have now been four judgments against the government this year, including a unanimous appellate decision this week. But more and more the argument is academic. The administration's blanket secrecy has less to do with the legitimate good of protecting our security than with the political goal of burying its own failures. 
By keeping the names and court proceedings of his detainees under wraps, John Ashcroft could for months cover up his law enforcement minions' inability to apprehend a single terrorist connected to 9/11. The same stunt has been pulled by designating prisoners "enemy combatants" at Guantanamo. Jose Padilla, the "dirty bomber," whose arrest was trumpeted by the attorney general as the breakup of a major terrorist plot, turns out to be a nonentity who may not be charged with anything. But as long as Mr. Padilla is locked away in a legal deep freeze, that embarrassment can be kept on the q.t. In the same spirit, the F.B.I. is now investigating 17 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee for leaks to the press; revealingly, the leaks that angered Dick Cheney and prompted this investigation were not leaks about intelligence per se but leaks about how our government bungled intelligence on this administration's watch just before 9/11. 
Now "America's New War," as CNN once branded it, is about to give way to "America's Newer War," and you have to wonder what if anything we have learned. George W. Bush is in a box, and one of his own making. If he does not attack Iraq now, after months of swagger, he will destroy his own credibility and hurt the country's. But if he does, he is in another bind. Even though the administration maintains that it needs neither allies nor Congressional approval, the president still needs the support of the American people unless he wants to mimic another hubristic Texan president who took a backdoor route into pre-emptive warfare. 
"An all-out attack on Iraq will entail a level of risk and sacrifice that the U.S. has not assumed since Vietnam," wrote the author of "Black Hawk Down," the combat journalist Mark Bowden, this week. As this reality sinks in, support for war with Iraq is falling -- from 70 percent last fall to 51 percent now, according to the new Time/CNN poll. A Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that only 40 percent would approve if there are ground troops and significant American casualties. 
But let's posit that the Iraq drumbeating is not a cynical effort to distract the country from the stalled war against Al Qaeda or the stalled economy. Let's posit that the administration rationale, set out by Mr. Cheney when he emerged from the Halliburton witness protection program this week, is solid. If indeed "there is no doubt" that Saddam Hussein already "has weapons of mass destruction" to use against us and "time is not on our side," then why these months of dithering that allow our enemy to lay his traps? Why doesn't a president with a high approval rating rally the country at once and count on it to follow? Is it that Mr. Bush doesn't trust the evidence against Saddam, or is it that he doesn't trust us -- or is it that he still thinks terrorists can be fought on a schedule we dictate? The logic of Mr. Cheney's urgent arguments, William F. Buckley observed this week, would suggest that "the American people should now be told that we are at war against Saddam Hussein." 
We should also be told, in the words of James Baker, that it "cannot be done on the cheap." Does a president who since 9/11 has asked us for no larger sacrifice than longer waits at the airport have the guts to tell us this? If not, we are back where we came in one long year ago.
