HEADLINE: With U.S. as Partner, Ukraine's Ship May Be In

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having just returned from Ukraine, I found much to agree with in "Despite U.S. Hope and Help, Ukraine's Star Fades," your June 27 news article on the economic situation there. 
 While you might have given equal time to the more hopeful economic indicators -- sharp drops in inflation, the greater pace of privatization (of small and medium-size enterprises like Viktor Gumankov's factory in Zhitomir) and recent exchange-rate stabilization -- the main point is well taken: Ukraine's economy is a mess, and it will not improve significantly in the near future.
What I do take issue with is the imaginary reference point of a once rich and powerful Ukraine with which to evaluate the situation. Ukraine's unfortunate location at the intersection of more powerful empires has always served to blunt whatever plans its leaders had for economic and political development.
In this century alone, Ukraine's colonial status in the Soviet empire resulted in horrific famines, an economy distorted by a concentration of inefficient, defense-oriented industries and the ecological nightmare of Chernobyl, for which Ukraine continues to pay a high price.
Paradoxically, Ukraine's geographical position is now an asset, not a dangerous liability. Washington has abandoned its Russocentric policies and recognized Ukraine as an important strategic partner in the region. Within this partnership lies independent Ukraine's first chance to achieve a measure of wealth and influence.

HEADLINE: Turkey's New Prime Minister Lobbies for Parliamentary Support

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, June 30

 BODY:
Having assembled a Government, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's first leader from an Islamic political party, has turned to the urgent task of winning parliamentary support in a vote of confidence expected next week.
Since being named Prime Minister on Friday, Mr. Erbakan has made a series of statements aimed at calming fears that his Government would upset the commitment to secularism that has been Turkey's guiding principle for three-quarters of a century. 
 At a news conference on Saturday, he did not mention his campaign pledges to withdraw Turkey from NATO, cut ties with Israel, forbid the charging of interest and create a Pan-Islamic currency.
Instead, he pledged that his Government would provide "all conditions of a free market economy" and maintain Turkey as "a democratic, secular and social state based in law and the principles of Ataturk."
He then led his new Cabinet to the mausoleum where the resolutely secular founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, is buried.
After laying a wreath, he wrote in a guest book that Ataturk's beliefs would be the "guiding principles" of his new Government.
Seeking to balance fidelity to Ataturk's, pro-Western ideology with his own pro-Islamic views, Mr. Erbakan said, "Cooperation with both the West and with the Islamic, Central Asian and Balkan countries with which we have historical and spiritual links will be increased."
Asked whether he would keep his promise to end Turkish support for the American-led mission supporting Kurds in northern Iraq, he replied: "We will consult our respectful army's valuable generals and listen to their suggestions about the future of the mission." Kurdish rebels fighting for greater autonomy have been battling Turkish security forces for years.
The Turkish generals support the mission in Iraq and oppose any weakening of Turkey's close ties to Europe, Israel and the United States. They have signaled that they will tolerate the ascent of Mr. Erbakan's Welfare Party as long as it does not seek to undermine existing domestic or foreign policy principles.
Mr. Erbakan and his coalition partner, former Prime MInister Tansu Ciller, met with undecided members of Parliament in an effort to win their support. They were understood to have appealed to some on ideological grounds while offering special considerations to others with particular personal or political needs.
Members of Parliament have an incentive of their own to support the Government, because the alternative could be new elections in which many of them might lose their jobs.
Diplomats here said that while last-minute surprises are common in Turkish politics, Mr. Erbakan seemed to be making progress toward winning the parliamentary vote.
Opponents of the new government are organizing an effort to bring it down.
"We are doing all we can to prevent this Government from getting the confidence vote," said Ismet Segzin, a former leader of Mrs. Ciller's True Path Party.

HEADLINE: Trade Laws That Punish Allies

 BODY:
Economic sanctions can be a legitimate and useful way for the United States to pressure other countries to change offensive policies. Banning American companies from trading with or investing in Iran, for example, makes Teheran pay a price for exporting terrorism, seeking to acquire nuclear weapons and grossly abusing human rights. It also adds credibility to Washington's diplomatic efforts to enlist European and Asian countries in the sanctions.
Regrettably, most other countries remain unpersuaded. In frustration, the House has vote unanimously to impose American penalties on foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil industry or sell sensitive goods to Libya, another target of American sanctions. 
 The Senate is expected to endorse the measure as well and President Clinton says he will sign it. Foreign companies that violate the law would be prohibited from drawing loans from private American banks and lose eligibility for United States Government credits and loan guarantees. The legislation follows last year's Helms-Burton Act, which penalizes foreign companies that do business with Cuba.
Such secondary boycotts, which directly punish America's allies in order to indirectly punish its enemies, are a bad idea and run counter to normal American standards of conduct. Secondary boycotts are illegal in domestic labor disputes. For years, Americans rightly protested the Arab League's efforts to impose a secondary boycott against companies doing business with Israel.
Even when deployed on behalf of an otherwise worthy cause, secondary boycotts offend the sovereignty of America's closest allies, invite retaliation and may violate international trade treaties like those governing the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization.
Today's trading patterns involve many countries and to be most effective, economic sanctions need to be applied internationally. But the way to achieve concerted action is by diplomatic persuasion, not by overreaching acts of Congress.

HEADLINE: Buoyant at 79, Vietnamese Leader Denies Divisions in Party Over Reform

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, June 30

 BODY:
"They will not let me rest!" said Do Muoi happily, striding up unexpectedly to a group of foreign reporters today during a break in the Communist Party Congress, where his term as the country's top leader had just been extended.
"I am almost 80 and I am still young!" 
 The official announcement had not yet been made, but party officials had already told reporters that Mr. Muoi and the other two members of Vietnam's ruling group would remain in their posts, keeping the younger generation of leaders waiting for their turn in power.
"I don't know how long I will stay," said Mr. Muoi, who has served for five years as the party's General Secretary. "I represent friendship between all the peoples. I want to be their best friend. Are you happy to have me as your best friend?"
Immaculate in a gray suit with a red-flag pin, Mr. Muoi seemed fresh and vigorous as he joked and lectured a sweating crush of reporters in the hot sun in a garden outside the Congress's meeting hall.
He spoke of the need to balance rapid economic development with stability, of the Government's battle against corruption, of its hope for increased foreign investment and better living standards, of his desire for good relations with the United States.
But his purpose seemed to be to demonstrate his confidence during a moment of national debate and transition as well as his personal power, his energy and even his virility as he lavished special attention on a young woman reporter.
"Are you married?" he said, turning away the reporter's question about party politics. "Would you like to have a Vietnamese husband?"
A three-minute warning bell sounded and other delegates filed dutifully back into the meeting hall, but Mr. Muoi kept on talking as the delegates waited in their seats.
The other two top leaders, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President Le Duc Anh, had denied requests for interviews, saying they were too busy. They, too, waited for Mr. Muoi to return.
Still in the garden, Mr. Muoi denied reports about divisions in the party over the pace of economic reforms, which diplomats and Vietnamese officials have said contributed to a stalemate in the leadership transition.
"We have never had any divisions since our August revolution in 1945," Mr. Muoi said. "Our motto is unity, unity, unity, and we have had great success."
After a decade of economic liberalization, the current Congress, which meets every five years, was preceded by debate in the press and reports of battles in the leadership over the balance between a free market and strict party control.
"I think we will have to accelerate our development," Mr. Muoi said. "Slow development means hunger, don't you think?"
"But at the same time I want to see efficiency and stability," he said, apparently reflecting the cautious course the party has settled on for now. "If reform is too fast, we will make mistakes. If you run too fast and there is something in the road, you may fall down."
He added: "We have to raise living standards. In some areas in Vietnam there are very low living standards. This is my biggest concern."
Mr. Muoi said corruption was another major concern.
"As long as governments exist, corruption will exist," he said. "It is an illness of government, and it can be cured only by the people. It will be severely punished, even by execution, no matter what position that person is holding."
The ambivalent pace of economic liberalization and the pervasiveness of corruption are of particular concern to foreign companies, which have complained that Vietnam has not lived up to its promise as Asia's new frontier for business. Mr. Muoi urged reporters to relay his invitation to foreign companies, saying, "We would like to encourage foreign investors to come to Vietnam."
But in remarks that could make investors nervous, he endorsed part of the Congress's political report that called on the Communist Party to expand its creation of party cells inside enterprises, including joint ventures with foreign companies.
"Don't be scared of party cells in foreign investor companies," he said. "I think party cells and trade unions are beneficial to foreign investors."
Vietnamese officials said such cells were common in large enterprises and were already present in many joint ventures, attached to the Vietnamese partner company.
As for his own future, Mr. Muoi smiled and said: "I belong to the party and the people. The party and the people tell me what to do. Do you want me to continue in my job?"

HEADLINE: Dominican Republic Holds Runoff, Capping Fierce Race

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, June 30

 BODY:
Both presidential candidates are men of the left who have scrambled back toward the center. As a result, the runoff vote here today has been transformed into a brutal struggle for power in which ideology means virtually nothing and personalities, feuds, grudges, innuendo and deal-making have determined almost everything.
After months of campaigning and a preliminary round of balloting six weeks ago, voters in this Caribbean nation of 7.5 million turned out in large numbers to choose between Leonel Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Liberation Party and Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Final results are not expected until late Monday. 
 With little of substance to differentiate the candidates, the outcome is expected to turn on whose style and image proves more appealing.
Almost unknown three years ago, Mr. Fernandez, 42, a suave lawyer who grew up in New York, has packaged himself as embodying "a generational change of command" but counts on the support of the country's old guard.
Mr. Pena Gomez, on the other hand, is a veteran politician and firebrand orator in the Latin American tradition who portrays himself as the target of a racist plot organized by his opponent's main ally.
"This has been a dirty, negative campaign on both sides," complained Carlos Dore Cabral, a prominent magazine columnist and political science professor. "The important issues have not been ventilated, and the electorate has been fed a diet of intrigue and animosity, of charges and countercharges."
Both candidates began their careers as proteges of Juan Bosch, the 87-year-old patriarch of the Dominican left, famous for his "anti-imperialist" and anti-American oratory.
Their platforms are nearly identical, pledging to stamp out the corruption, poverty and authoritarianism that have always plagued this country, the largest source of recent immigrants to New York City.
"We're Coke and they're Pepsi," one adviser to Mr. Fernandez acknowledged. "That's why we hate each other so much."
The vote is expected to be extremely tight. An opinion poll conducted by the Gallup organization and published Wednesday by the newsmagazine Rumbo shows Mr. Fernandez, who finished second in the first round of balloting on May 16, with the support of 51 percent of voters and Mr. Pena Gomez favored by 46 percent, virtually the same share he received in the first round, when he fell just short of the majority required to avoid a runoff.
Three percent of voters described themselves as undecided, and the margin of sampling error in the poll was 2.5 percent. That forecast left both candidates predicting victory and election observers worrying that this country might be in for another bout of the political turbulence and accusations of vote fraud that have followed every election here since the collapse of Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in 1961.
Initial returns tonight conformed to predictions. With 68 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Fernandez had 51.2 percent of the votes, compared with 48.8 percent for Mr. Pena Gomez.
Regardless of their preferences, voters agree that this election is a watershed, and have consistently expressed a desire for change. The winner is to be sworn in on Aug. 16 for a four-year term, replacing the country's ailing President, Joaquin Balaguer, 89, who after seven terms over the last 35 years is reluctantly stepping down, unable to succeed himself as a result of recent constitutional reforms.
If elected, Mr. Pena Gomez, 59, a former elementary school teacher and radio sports announcer, would be the first black Dominican to serve as President in this century.
"I think my victory would be a good thing, a healthy thing, not just for the Dominican Republic, but for all of Ibero-America," Mr. Pena Gomez, who has also served as Mayor of the capital and is making his third run for the presidency, said in an interview. "It would represent a resounding defeat for racial and social discrimination anywhere it rears its head."
But throughout the campaign, his enemies have sought to use his background against him, suggesting that he is not really a Dominican, but rather an agent of neighboring Haiti and an adept of voodoo intent on undoing 150 years of history by reuniting the island of Hispaniola under Haitian rule.
Born in the northwestern province of Valverde, Mr. Pena Gomez was separated from his parents as a newborn when the Trujillo dictatorship massacred some 15,000 Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent in 1937. Various biographies and news reports say Mr. Pena Gomez's father, August Vincent, was killed and his mother fled to Haiti.
As a foundling, Mr. Pena Gomez was taken in and raised by a poor couple, whose name he took, with the approval of the wealthy family on whose ranch they lived. In an ironic twist much savored by the poor, dark-skinned voters who are the backbone of his support, the scion of that land-owning family, Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, is now Mr. Pena Gomez's running mate.
At the time of the 1937 massacre, Mr. Balaguer was the Foreign Minister of the Trujillo dictatorship and is said by Dominican historians to have overseen the killing of the Haitians. The enmity between the President and Mr. Pena Gomez is deep and longstanding, and Mr. Balaguer, author of a notoriously racist tract called "The Island in Reverse," has repeatedly urged his followers to vote for "the authentic Dominican" and avoid "unstable" candidates.
Mr. Balaguer's hatred of Mr. Pena Gomez runs so deep that the President has even been willing to overlook grudges dating back to the 1930's and ally himself with Mr. Bosch, his lifelong rival and fellow octogenarian, who supports Mr. Fernandez, in an alliance of convenience called the Patriotic Front.
That development has tainted Mr. Fernandez's claim to represent "the new road" and raised concerns among voters that Mr. Balaguer would retain a dominant role in a Fernandez administration.
Mr. Fernandez has rejected all charges of race-baiting, saying it is Mr. Pena Gomez who is playing the race card demagogically. His opponent's objective, Mr. Fernandez argued, is to create sympathy for himself abroad as a victim of bigotry and lay the groundwork for a challenge to the outcome if he loses.
"This is not some competition between Robert Redford and Nelson Mandela," Mr. Fernandez scoffed during a recent interview. "Look at me. I myself am not white. The population in this country is predominantly mulatto, and I too am a mixture of white and black. So how can anyone talk of a racist campaign?"
For his part, Mr. Fernandez also has personal ties to a foreign country that looms large in Dominican history -- in this case, the United States -- and his own tale of a rise from humble origins.
Though born here, Mr. Fernandez joined his immigrant mother in New York City as a 7-year-old, attending elementary and high school in Manhattan before returning home to enroll in college and become a successful lawyer, journalist and professor.
During his decade-long residence in Manhattan, Mr. Fernandez acquired a taste for such artifacts of American pop culture as rock-and-roll and basketball, a sport he still plays with considerable skill.
One of his campaign commercials, intended to project an image of youthful vigor, shows him sinking one shot after another from the three-point line. He learned to speak English so well that his accent is more that of a New Yorker than of a Spanish-speaker.
"Leonel Fernandez is the Dominican equivalent of Benjamin Netanyahu," a Latin American diplomat here said, referring to Israel's new American-educated Prime Minister. "There's no question that he's Dominican to the core, but because he lived in the United States so long, he can talk and act just like an American whenever he wants to."

HEADLINE: Look Who Dropped In At the Stork

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
For a big chunk of the 20th century, from the speak-easy era to the Vietnam War, it was the nation's and perhaps the world's most storied nightspot, a plush oasis where starlets stalked millionaires, a headwaiter pocketed a $20,000 tip, and Ernest Hemingway scuffled with the warden of Sing Sing.
It was, of course, the Stork Club, the fantasy creation of a flamboyant Oklahoma bootlegger, Sherman Billingsley, who fought running battles with racketeer partners and liked to boast that everything he wore and carried, from the buckles on his sock supporters to his collar stays, was made of gold. 
 Now, three decades after the demise of the Stork in a bitter strike and Mr. Billingsley's death in 1966, several hundred pages of hitherto private pen-and-pencil-scrawled notes by the inveterate socializer recount the birth of cafe society and the antics of its habitues that titillated Americans through years of boom, economic collapse, world war and recovery.
The recollections were to be the basis of an autobiography written with the youngest of his three daughters. But after Mr. Billingsley's death she put the project aside, and books that Mr. Billingsley had said Hemingway and Damon Runyon intended to write about him never materialized. In recent years, the daughter, Shermane Billingsley of Ridgewood, N.J., who as a little girl table-hopped with her father at the club, has sought to revive interest and allowed a reporter to study the material. She said that while the Stork Club had figured over the years in countless news stories, several films and books, including Neal Gabler's recent biography of Walter Winchell, no published account had been based on her father's personal papers.
In the not-always-flattering memoir, Mr. Billingsley confirms what was often suspected but never documented: that the club, last located at 3 East 53d Street (now Paley Park), was founded as a front for a nasty trio of Jazz Age mobsters, including Owney Madden, owner of the Cotton Club. He says he thwarted schemes by Jack (Legs) Diamond and Dutch Schultz to take over the Stork Club and that he was kidnapped and held for ransom by gangsters muscling in on the booming business.
"Another way they tried to scare me was to get into my private offices on the seventh floor where no one has the keys to the locked doors except myself," Mr. Billingsley wrote. "They left skull and crossbones two different times. I don't mean pictures or sketches of skulls and crossbones, but real ones. We kept these incidents quiet."
The account chronicles the rise of a celebrity culture well before the age of television (although the Stork Club later had a show successively on all three networks), when all the world's wealth, power and beauty seemed to rendezvous nightly in the Cub Room.
Starting with circulars sent to stars of Hollywood and Broadway whose addresses he obtained from Western Union clerks, Mr. Billingsley boasted of courting the rich and famous with free drinks and gifts, from cases of wine to $5,000 one-gallon bottles of perfume (one of which he grandly presented to a patron celebrating her 100th birthday). "This with the great added help of World War," as he put it, "brought all the movie stars in."
He treasured acknowledgments of his largess. "I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties," one letter from 1955 began. "At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House?" The signatory: President Eisenhower.
But much simmered beneath the glittering surface. An unnamed "ex-glamour girl" left her toddler in the dining room one night and went up to the powder room to swallow a handful of sleeping pills. "I have seen mothers steal their daughters' boyfriends and marry them," Mr. Billingsley wrote. "I have seen girls steal their sisters' boyfriends and marry them. In one case the loser went insane. I know one father that was familiar with his son's wife. These were all high-society folks."
Mr. Billingsley also recounted being summoned by Tallulah Bankhead to her suite at the Gotham Hotel, finding her, he said, naked in bed and beckoning him to join her. "I ran out," he wrote, "her after me still nude, but I got to and into the elevator before she caught me."
 
Dropping Names (By the Ton)
When it came to dropping names, the club owner had few equals. Vito Genovese, later the boss of his own Mafia family, once worked for him as a whisky salesman. Among his "kindest" guests, he wrote, were "all of the Roosevelt boys, all of the Kennedy boys, their father, mother and sisters, Margaret Truman, Al Smith, Herbert Lehman, Averell Harriman, and Governor Dewey, Barry Goldwater, Dick Nixon and Edgar Hoover."
But the club was also noted for its spats. There was the night Walter Winchell, the Stork's scribe in residence, gave the cold shoulder to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. "I never could understand Walter doing this to an ex-king" Mr. Billingsley wrote, "but Walter had his feelings."
Hemingway one night got into a shoving match with Lewis E. Laws, the warden of Sing Sing, and knocked him down. Mr. Billingsley said his press agent told him not to worry, that "one fight a year is good publicity providing the fighters are big names."
Another night, he wrote, Hemingway tried to pay a bar bill with a $100,000 movie royalty check. Mr. Billingsley said he told the author to wait until the night's receipts were in and then coolly cashed the check. It was a place, he said, where a woman could lose a $25,000 compact -- and expect to have it returned.
At a time when the rest of the country reeled under the effects of the Depression and wartime privations, "I saw many people throw their money away," Mr. Billingsley recounted. "One night a customer gave the doorman a $1,000 tip and asked him if it was the largest tip he had ever received. The doorman said no, I received a $2,000 tip about a year ago. The customer asked who gave it to him. The doorman said you gave it to me."
Another night, he said, "a man named Belcher gave Victor Crottor, another headwaiter, a $20,000 tip."
Largely absent from the memoir is Mr. Billingsley's freewheeling love life, as portrayed in the only published nonfiction account of life inside the club, "Welcome to the Stork Club," by a former maitre d', Mearl L. Allen (A. S. Barnes and Company, San Diego; 1980). Mr. Billingsley is also silent on the uproar after the legendary black dancer Josephine Baker and her party charged they were denied proper service at the Stork Club one night in 1951.
Mr. Billingsley himself came from modest beginnings, his date of birth not even recorded although he gave it as March 10, 1900. He was the youngest of nine children of Robert and Emily Billingsley, who traveled west as teen-age newlyweds in a covered wagon to stake a claim to land in the Oklahoma Territory, settling in Enid, a rail depot town on the former Cherokee Strip.
It was dangerous country. Mr. Billingsley recalled once watching his father fight off an attack by six wildcats. Young Sherman and his brothers and sisters rode to and from their one-room school bareback on a single horse. "At dusk I was given a warm glass of milk which would put me to sleep, and the first one of the family that went to bed would pick me up and take me with them and that's the one I would sleep with that night," he recalled.
 
The Birth Of a Bootlegger
When he was still small, his oldest brother, Logan, killed the father of a girl he was accused of getting pregnant, and the family moved to Andarko to be near Logan's jail cell. After he got out he enlisted Sherman in selling bootleg beer to the Indians, hiding it in a child's red wagon. Sherman collected 50 cents a bottle. "All I got out of it was the empty bottles which I sold to saloons for a penny each plus I think becoming the youngest bootlegger that ever lived," he wrote.
After the family moved to Oklahoma City, then a wide-open town of 100,000 with gambling houses, opium dens and brothels, Mr. Billingsley said he entered the bootlegging business in Oklahoma with another brother, Fred, smuggling in the whisky by train and car from Texas. They expanded to Omaha, Detroit and Toledo. "World War I was on and everything was booming," Mr. Billingsley wrote.
But at 18 he was caught and convicted in Detroit on Federal charges and sentenced to 15 months in prison and a fine of $5,000. He spent some months in Leavenworth, where he worked in the prison bakery but later won reversal of the conviction. Meanwhile his brother Logan was working with the mob syndicate in Detroit, shipping whisky in boxcar-loads of 1,000 cases at a time from Canada to Cuba and the Bahamas. Logan gave his racketeer partners the slip and turned up in New York, soon followed by Sherman.
New York in 1921 thumbed its nose at Prohibition even more than the West, Mr. Billingsley recounted. He soon learned, he said, "that if you owned a drugstore you practically owned a liquor wholesale business, and if you owned a dozen drugstores you had a dozen wholesale liquor houses -- which I did have soon."
"Money was coming in very fast," he recalled. "My pockets were loaded every night with it, money, money, money." He bought property in the Bronx -- including a parcel still named Billingsley Terrace now overlooking the Major Deegan Expressway -- and dated Ziegfeld girls. He also started a real estate brokerage to help him buy up drugstores for his bootlegging operations.
It was in 1929, he said, when two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma, Carl Henninger and John Patton, came into his real estate office and said they wanted to open a restaurant. He found a three-story building at 132 West 58th Street across from the New York Athletic Club and became their partner "and that was the beginning of the most famous nightclub the world has ever known."
"Don't ask me how or why I picked the name," he wrote, "because I just don't remember."
 
Looking for a Body, Finding a Bar
The fledgling Stork Club scraped by but slowly gathered a following while spurring rivals like the Napoleon Club, El Morocco, "21" and, by 1940, Toots Shor's. One of the first patrons was the writer Heywood Broun, who lived down the block and, as Mr. Billingsley recounted it, mistook the Stork Club one day for a mortuary. "Broun walked in quietly, put his hat down on a table and went back in the rear room to pay his respect to the body but instead of a body he found a bar," he wrote. "He walked over to the bar, had several drinks, liked the place and came back very often, bringing his celebrity friends." Soon, Mr. Billingsley's partners were bought out by another investor, Thomas Healy.
One day, he wrote, Mr. Healy confided that he was actually fronting for three men: the gangsters Owney Madden, George Lamange, also known as Frenchy, and Big Bill Dwyer, a former dockworker who built a huge bootlegging and entertainment empire. The trio, who liked to be called "the boys," promised, "we will protect you against everything," Mr. Billingsley wrote. But their relations proved stormy.
One night, he said, after dinner with the hostess Texas Guinan, he was abducted on Madison Avenue, pushed into a car and driven blindfolded to a hideout where he was held for ransom by a rival mobster, Vincent (Mad Dog) Coll. But, Mr. Billingsley wrote, before the payment could be collected, Mr. Coll was lured to a drugstore phone booth on West 23d Street and machine-gunned to death.
"With all these things I had had it," he wrote. He said he tried to buy out his gangster partners but was told: "We didn't pay $10,000 for an interest in the business, we paid 10 for 30 percent interest in everything you do for the rest of your life." Still, he said, he managed to buy them out for $30,000.
With the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the end of Prohibition, he opened a new Stork Club -- with a legal liquor license, perhaps the first in New York, he said -- in a five-story town house that he readdressed as the catchier 53 1/2 East 51st Street. But now, he wrote, the dining room union was under the control of the mob boss Dutch Shultz, and he was harassed for payoffs. He fired the workers and recruited a new staff, under police protection.
By 1934, he said, business was so good he moved the club to a bigger spot at 3 East 53d Street, just east of Fifth Avenue. The move ushered in the club's glory years. Jimmy Durante, Alfred Vanderbilt, J. Paul Getty, Alfred Drake, Rudy Vallee and Charlie Chaplin, among many other notables, married women they met at the Stork. Prince Rainier of Monaco and Grace Kelly leaked news of their engagement there.
With the 1950's and 60's, as problems with the unions multiplied after the firing of a kitchen worker, Mr. Billingsley hired Roy Cohn as his lawyer and defied the protesters. Sabotage mounted. Something was put in the plumbing, "so when you drew water it would be a deep dark blue," he wrote. "Salt was put in the sugar bowl and sugar in the salt. Telephone wires were broken and slugs put in telephone slots that would stick." Drapes were torn, upholstery was sliced with razors and mirrors were cracked. Fires started. "Once the elevator was fixed so it would and did drop with me in it."
At night when he went home, he wrote, "I would have all lights out in the house, would have to feel my way in and through the house to my bedroom with keys in one hand and pistol in the other hand."
He tried to catch union leaders in threats. "One time I had about twelve tape recordings going in every room in my home where there was a union man who wanted to see me," he wrote. "I even had one recorder over the front door to catch his first and last words." But the demonstrations, changing tastes and dwindling crowds worked to close the Stork Club's doors for good on Oct, 4, 1965. (Two years later it was demolished to clear the site for a vest-pocket park bequeathed by William S. Paley of CBS.) A year to the day after the club closed, Mr. Billingsley, in broken health, died of a heart attack at 66, leaving his daughter his sheaves of notes. "Myself," he wrote, "I can remember every one that was good or bad to me from the time my memories started."

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Two Cuban Olympic Boxers Flee To the U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 30

 BODY:
Just weeks before the Atlanta Olympics are set to open, two highly rated members of the Cuban Olympic boxing team fled the team's training camp in Mexico and sought asylum today at a border crossing near San Diego, a lawyer who said he represents the men said.
The details of the apparent defection could not be confirmed with United States authorities, and some of the details themselves were sketchy. The two boxers -- Joel Casamayor, 24, a bantamweight who won a gold medal four years ago in Barcelona, Spain, and Ramon Garbey, a two-time amateur world champion in the light-heavyweight division -- were being held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the lawyer said. Immigration officials at the border refused to comment. 
 But Luis Murillo Evia, a sports reporter in Guadalajara, where the Cuban boxing team is training, said he interviewed Miguel Barrientos, the head of the Cuban sports delegation, on Saturday night and that the Cuban official had confirmed the two boxers were missing from the camp.
An article on the missing boxers appeared in the Guadalajara newspaper, Siglo XXI, this morning.
There is no telephone at the Cuban training camp and Barrientos could not be reached today for comment.
Reached by phone tonight, an official at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, Cuba's de facto embassy in the United States, said no one was available to comment on the situation.
 If true, the defections could prove a major embarrassment to the Cubans just weeks before the Olympics open and they could hurt the Cuban team's chances. The Cubans won seven gold medals in boxing at the 1992 Olympics. Barrientos was quoted in the Mexican newspaper as saying the team had already located two replacement boxers and that they would be participating in Atlanta.
The defections would be the latest instance in which Cuban athletes have chosen to leave their homeland. In the 1990's, more than 70 Cuban athletes with international experience have defected, mainly to the United States and Puerto Rico. At the 1995 Pan American Games in Argentina, Cuban officials and athletes spoke openly of the severity of the problems caused in sports by the island nation's worsening economic crisis and its political isolation. At the time, the Cuban officials indicated they would not stand in the way of those who wanted to leave.
In the case of the two boxers, the lawyer, Frank E. Ronzio, an immigration specialist from Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview from the San Ysidro border crossing that they had fled the training camp because of unrelenting political persecution.
Asked why the two men could not just wait a few more weeks, compete, and then defect in Atlanta, he said, "It was unbearable. They had been singled out for persecution and they felt they had to do it now."
But Casamayor has had problems unrelated to politics, including a suspension for taking a banned diuretic, according to Kurt Stenerson, a spokesman for the United States Boxing Federation.
Ronzio manages several boxers, and he was asked if the two Cubans intended to turn pro and box in the United States. Ronzio said the subject had not been discussed and he did not know the future plans of the two boxers.
Ronzio said that the two men fled the camp separately. The Mexican news article said Garbey left last Sunday on the pretext of going to purchase some cigarettes, and Casamayor left on Friday.
The two then had to hide, and were shuffled among different hotels because they were being pursued by Mexican authorities at the request of the Cubans, Ronzio said.
He said he was contacted several days ago by people in Mexico who were helping the Cuban boxers and who knew of his immigration work. The two flew today from Guadalajara to Tijuana, which is adjacent to the border with San Diego. They were then driven across the border at San Ysidro and immediately requested asylum.
J. C. Walker, the supervisor today for the immigration service at San Ysidro, one of the busiest border crossings in the world, said he could not comment on the case. He referred a reporter to a public information office, but people there said no one was available to comment.
Curtis Shute, an officer at the border crossing, said in a telephone interview that he was not familiar with the case, which would have taken place on an earlier shift, but that generally several Cubans a week seek asylum at San Ysidro.
By defecting, the two boxers would have lost their chance of competing in the Olympics, and it was not certain how long they might be held by the American immigration authorities. Ronzio said it could be days or weeks, depending on the swiftness with which their case is handled. He claimed that they have a very strong case, however.
"In my opinion there is clear, credible evidence of their political persecution," Ronzio said. "They have an excellent case."
He said that the two men were under great pressure to join the Communist Party and to declare their fealty to the Cuban revolution and its leader, Fidel Castro. When they refused, he added, they were abused both physically and psychologically, which is why they were willing to throw away their chances for an Olympic medal.

HEADLINE: Daniel J. Terra, 85, Founder of Art Museum in Giverny, Dies

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Daniel J. Terra, an American businessman and art collector who founded two museums of American art, one in Giverny, France, and the other in Illinois, died on Friday at a hospital in Washington. He was 85 and had homes in Chicago, Washington and Vernon, in northwestern France.
He died of complications following a heart attack, said his wife, Judith. 
 At his death, he was chairman of Lawter International -- based in Northbrook, a suburb of Chicago -- which produces printing chemicals and ink. He stepped down as the company's chief executive officer in January. In recent months, he spent much of his time overseeing activities of his foundation, Terra Foundation for the Arts, which operates his two museums, holds title to numerous art works, and carries out philanthropies, mainly in the arts and education.
Earlier, Mr. Terra was finance chairman of Ronald Reagan's 80 Presidential campaign and became the first -- and only -- United States ambassador-at-large for cultural affairs, serving in that post throughout the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Terra, in collaboration with his wife, was an avid collector of American paintings, largely by 19th- and early-20th-century artists. In 1982, when he paid $3.25 million to buy an 1832 painting, "The Gallery of the Louvre," by Samuel F. B. Morse -- who was a noted artist before he invented the Morse code and the telegraph -- Mr. Terra said, "We read so much about our industrial and economic development over the last 150 years, but I think that our cultural development is just as great."
American art experts have said that it was Mr. Terra who was the buyer, at a Christie's auction in May in Manhattan, of "In the Box" (about 1879), a painting by Mary Cassatt; and of "Paradise Garden" (1866-68), a painting by another American artist, John La Farge. The Cassatt went for $4 million, a record price for an oil by that artist. The La Farge brought $2.2 million, another record. But Christie's has not confirmed that Mr. Terra was in fact the buyer of the two works.
In 1992 the Terras opened the Museum of American Art in Giverny. The Norman village of Giverny, along the Seine, is where Monet dwelled and painted for four decades until he died in 1926. The scores of paintings on regular display in the museum are mostly by American Impressionist artists.
Mr. Terra collected, among other works, paintings by American Impressionist artists who admired Monet and flocked to Giverny while the French master was there. Mr. Terra was encouraged in his art collecting by his first wife, the former Adeline Evans Richards, who died in 1982, after four decades of marriage. She collected chiefly 18th- and 19th-century British landscape paintings.
The museum in Giverny is a low-lying limestone structure down the street from Monet's home and its gardens, which appear in many paintings. A nearby house and garden used in the 1890's by Lila Cabot Perry, a painter from Boston, are being restored by the foundation.
Mr. Terra set up Terra Foundation for the Arts some years after the opening of the other museum he founded, Terra Museum of American Art. That institution was opened in 1980 in Evanston, Ill., another Chicago suburb, and was moved in 1987 to Chicago. The art works on regular display in the Chicago museum are all by American artists, and most of them are from the 19th and the early 20th century.
Mr. Terra was born and grew up in Philadelphia. His father, Louis J. Terra, ran a lithography plant in Philadelphia, and his mother, the former Mary DeLuca, was a dancer. He received a bachelor's degree in 1931 from Pennsylvania State University and moved to Chicago as a young man.
In 1940, Daniel Terra borrowed $2,500 to start what is now Lawter International. He went on to become a close friend of President Reagan and to play a substantial role in forming the Reagan Administration's attitude toward the arts and humanities.
The honors Mr. Terra received included decorations from the Governments of France and Belgium. He was also honored by the National Endowment for the Arts.
In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1986, he is survived by a son, James, of Grayslake, Ill.; a stepson, Andrew Banks of Hamilton, Bermuda; a stepdaughter, Lisa Leiser-Banks of Lake Forest, Ill., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Getting to the End of the Road, at Last

BYLINE: By E. THOMAS WOOD 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
Some people say the Natchez Trace Parkway, which spans 424 miles that few drivers have any compelling reason to cover, is a road that goes nowhere.
But supporters say its bucolic expanses, which are closed to commercial traffic and largely devoid of roadside amenities, are just what this country needs. 
 The two-lane parkway began as a Depression-era relief effort for an impoverished swath of the rural South and just kept going. It commemorates the Natchez Trace, a frontier trail between Nashville and the Deep South, ending in Natchez, Miss., one of the oldest cities on the Mississippi River.
Parts of the parkway have been open for decades, but most were in remote areas.
"It has taken three times longer to complete than the heyday of the original Natchez Trace actually lasted," said Daniel W. Brown, superintendent of the parkway.
Congress has appropriated $393 million for the Trace since construction began in 1937, but its cost when adjusted for inflation is much higher.
On June 22, on an asphalt cloverleaf at the outskirts of Nashville, Vice President Al Gore snipped a ribbon opening the road's northern end, one of the last parts of the parkway to be finished. Officials of the National Park Service, which runs the parkway, predict that it will cost $65 million to finish the remaining 20 miles, in segments at Natchez and Jackson, Miss.
The Park Service has spent much of that money reluctantly, although it has listed the parkway as one of its more widely visited attractions. Mr. Brown said the Trace has taken away money from a "significant backlog" of other projects. But the parkway passes through the district that had been represented by Jamie Whitten, Mississippi's legendary Congressional baron.
Largely because of Mr. Whitten's influence as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the financing tap never ran dry. "If we didn't request money, or didn't request what he thought was enough, he saw to it that more money was put in there," recalled Paul Winegar, a spokesman for the Park Service in Atlanta.
"Those things should frustrate everybody who wants to see the park system be the crown jewel of what the Government does," said Scott Hodge, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington.
"When precious resources go into these parochial efforts, they tend to come at the expense of the things most of us associate with the national parks." Mr. Hodge cited the case of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, a historic landmark that "was crumbling for years while huge amounts of money were going to these kinds of projects."
In Natchez, though, where much of the local economy relies on tourism funneled in by the Trace, support for the road runs high. Roger Satterstrom, president of the Natchez Pilgrimage tour agency, said completing the Trace is a "moral obligation" from the Federal Government to the states.
Other fans love the Trace for what it lacks: billboards, 18-wheelers and bike-chasing dogs. Nashville bicyclist Glen Wanner regularly rides the parkway with the 300 other members of his biking club. Mr. Wanner has met many cyclists who chose the Trace as a destination, coming from around the United States and abroad to ride it.
The Trace is one of a number of roads built in the 1930's, including the Park Service's Blue Ridge Parkway, that were designed for pleasant drives in the country, rather than speedy transportation.
In a 1941 report the Park Service proposed a nationwide system of Federal scenic parkways, that was never built, that would have been an antidote to the "eyesore and abomination" that the nation's highway roadsides had become.
Sheila Shay, chair of Tennessee's Sierra Club chapter, concedes that if the Trace had been "built as a corridor from point A to point B, it wouldn't be worth it." But she finds the quiet road a welcome getaway from urban life.
Ms. Shay said the Audubon Society conducts bird counts along the roadway. Other travelers report sightings of deer, armadillos and wild turkeys along the roadside.
The Trace also has camping and canoeing opportunities, as well as an array of historic sites such as the grave of the explorer Meriwether Lewis -- who either committed suicide or was murdered along the old Trace, his demise remaining a topic of debate to this day.
Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, contends that "it would have been fiscally irresponsible to have invested 55 years into this project and not completed it."
Asked whether the same project would have a chance if proposed today, Mr. Gordon replied:
"It might not make sense to build the Hoover Dam or the interstate highway system now."
Still, support for the Trace crosses party lines. Representative Roger Wicker of Mississippi was president of the 1994 freshman class of House Republicans, a group known for being tight with the purse strings.
But Mr. Wicker sees no contradiction in supporting the Trace just as strongly Mr. Whitten, whom he defeated and who died last year.
"It's one thing to want to live within your means," Mr. Wicker says. "It would be quite another to be hostile to any Government program."

HEADLINE: Japan Is Planning Vast Increase in Science Research Budget

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IN an effort to make Japan as strong in pioneering research as it is in product development, the Government is planning a vast increase in public spending on science and technology and an overhaul of the decrepit and rigid university system that many see as stifling creativity.
The plan is aimed at least partly at correcting the situation in which Japan capitalizes on breakthroughs achieved elsewhere to develop successful products but does not contribute much original research of its own. For example, Japanese scientists have won only five Nobel Prizes in natural science as against 175 for the United States. 
 The Council for Science and Technology, which is headed by Japan's Prime Minister, proposed in June that the national Government spend 17 trillion yen, or about $155 billion, on science and technology over the next five years. That would be an increase of about 50 percent over the 11.3 trillion yen spent in the last five years.
The situation in Japan is in contrast to the one in the United States, where scientists have been facing deep cuts in the Federal research budget. But Japanese scientists note that until now, they have been the poor cousins of their American counterparts.
"We waited for an amount like this for many years," said Akito Arima, president of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and a member of the working group that developed the new plan. "We Japanese scientists suffered so many years."
There are some cautions. The Ministry of Finance, worried about the nation's growing budget deficit, is likely to resist a big spending increase, so it is not clear that the entire amount will end up being allocated in future years. Still, it is virtually certain, officials say, that there will be a big increase in spending beyond this year's budget of 2.7 trillion yen, or $25 billion.
And, experts say, there are many problems with Japan's research system that money alone cannot fix, like a system that makes assistant professors and young researchers beholden to full professors and unable to pursue their own ideas.
"The report shows the course of action that should be taken to effect drastic reforms, but this is no more than a starting point," the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, said in an editorial. "What the public wants is the actual enforcement of the reforms."
The new plan signals a growing role for Japan's Government in science and technology, filling in for corporations, which have cut back in the last two years because of Japan's economic slump.
Companies account for 80 percent of the research and development spending in Japan, with the remaining 20 percent provided by the Government. By contrast, government accounts for more than 35 percent of overall research funds in the United States and Germany and more than 40 percent in France.
The result is that while Japan's overall research and development spending as a percentage of its total economy is as high or higher than that of the United States and European nations, most of the spending goes to product development, not university research.
The new plan, devised by a working group of scientists, businessmen and Government officials, does not specify how much of the money should go to basic research. But its overall thrust is to revitalize research in universities and national research laboratories.
"The biggest priority is to make the environment that surrounds science and technology more flexible, competitive and open," the council's report said.
For a nation that is the world's second largest economy and a technological powerhouse, Japan often falls short in the quality of its universities, many of which look like something out of the third world. Laboratories are often housed in buildings that are literally crumbling and are so overcrowded that copiers and book shelves are placed in the halls.
Yet there is a growing recognition here that Japan needs more basic research and innovation if it is to be strong in industries of the future like biotechnology and information sciences, in which it now lags behind the United States.
The report calls for upgrading of the physical facilities of national universities and laboratories, a job that Dr. Arima, who was formerly president of the University of Tokyo, estimates will cost $37 billion by itself.
It also calls for improving computer networks and increasing the number of technicians, so that professors do not have to do basic laboratory chores by themselves. It also calls for an increase in the number of post-doctoral researchers at universities to 10,000 from 6,000.
Another recommendation is for universities and national laboratories to hire some researchers on a fixed-term contract. Currently, because of the lifetime employment tradition in Japan, even assistant professors at national universities have tenure, removing an incentive to excel.
Still, experts say there are many other barriers to overcome before Japan achieves excellence in basic research.
One is that the elementary and high school system teaches children to cooperate in a group rather than to follow their own dictates, and to memorize facts rather than think creatively.
Universities are very ingrown. More than 80 percent of the faculty members at the University of Tokyo, Japan's most prestigious school, are graduates of that university.
And rather than attracting the best scholars from all over the world, Japanese universities have been basically closed to foreigners. As of 1993, there were only 25 tenured foreign professors in all of Japan's 100 national universities.
The proposal was developed in fulfillment of the Science and Technology Basic Law, passed last fall by Parliament, which calls for a "radical" increase in public investment in science.
It is expected that by the year 2000, the last of the five years under the plan, Government financing of research will exceed 4 trillion yen, or $37 billion, roughly double the 1992 figure of 2.1 trillion yen.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Weaker as Traders Seek a Haven in Swiss Franc

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against most leading currencies in quiet trading yesterday as traders turned to the Swiss franc for safety.
Questions about the health of Boris N. Yeltsin before Russia's runoff election tomorrow bolstered the Swiss franc, traditionally a haven currency. While the German mark is also considered a haven, the close economic ties between Germany and Russia diminished the attractiveness of the mark. 
 Mr. Yeltsin, who has not been seen in public since Wednesday, appeared briefly on television yesterday, urging Russians to vote for him.
The Swiss franc rose because "people had nothing to do today but speculate on the health of Boris Yeltsin," said John Rothfield, an international economist with Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago.
Trading was light yesterday, with many market participants reluctant to increase their positions before a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers today and tomorrow and a United States employment report on Friday.
"The markets are holding their ammunition ahead of events later in the week which may have more impact on the currency market," Mr. Rothfield said.
In late trading in New York, the dollar fell to 1.2499 Swiss francs, from 1.2538 Swiss francs on Friday and to 1.5234 marks from 1.5241 marks. The dollar stood at 109.55 yen, down from 109.72 yen.
Traders also bought the British pound in place of the mark and dollar as British data indicated an improving economy. The pound rose to $1.5570 from $1.5505 in New York trading.
A report by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed that British manufacturing grew in June for the first time this year. The purchasing managers' index also showed lower prices.
The dollar remained steady against the yen after the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said yesterday that monetary policy would "aim at insuring that the recovery is on solid ground."
David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at SBC Warburg Inc., said the market interpreted this to mean that the central bank's low-interest-rate policy would remain, dashing speculation that the bank would raise rates on signs of an improving economy.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Soar on Signs Of Threat to U.N.-Iraqi Plan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on signs that a United Nations plan allowing Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil was in danger.
On other markets, corn prices also rose. 
 Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, accused Iraq yesterday of trying to use the oil-sale plan to import high-technology goods in violation of economic sanctions.
James Rubin, a spokesman for Ms. Albright, said Iraq's proposal "contains several provisions that make it clear Iraq is not serious at this point as far as implementing the oil deal."
The agreement between Iraq and the United Nations would allow Iraq to sell as much as $2 billion of oil over six months to pay for food and medicine. Iraq had previously estimated that about 800,000 barrels of oil a day could begin flowing in early July.
Crude prices jumped after Ms. Albright's comments.
"The precipitating factor was the U.S. saying it has problems with Iraq's distribution plan," said Jerry Samuels, managing director at ARB Oil Inc. in Los Angeles. "All this is doing is pushing back the date on which the crude would enter the market."
Crude oil for August delivery rose 61 cents, to $21.53 a barrel.
Corn rallied to a record high on concern that stronger-than-expected consumption by the nation's livestock herds could wipe out stockpiles before this year's harvest.
On Friday, the Agriculture Department said there were only 1.72 billion bushels of corn in storage, 50 percent less than last year's levels.
While many ranchers pared their herds to cope with the higher costs, the nation's hog herd is still the fourth largest since 1980, and demand from poultry producers remains strong.
"It's going to be nip and tuck what to feed these animals until the harvest comes along," said Joel Karlin, vice president at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago.
July corn rose 22.25 cents, to $5.385 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, a record closing price for corn. December corn, representing this year's crop, rose to 9.75 cents, to $3.71 a bushel, a new high for that contract.

HEADLINE: H.I.V. Risk From Blood Transfusion Is 2 in Million

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 1

 BODY:
The latest scientific calculations put the risk of catching the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion at just two in a million.
"The safety of the blood supply has dramatically increased over the past decade," says George B. Schreiber, an epidemiologist with Westat Inc., a research company in Rockville, Md., that figured the odds. "While there still is a risk, it is exceedingly small." 
 Blood banks routinely find most tainted donations when they check blood for antibodies to the AIDS virus, H.I.V. But infected pints of blood occasionally slip through if donors are newly infected and have not started producing antibodies to the virus.
Dr. Schreiber and his colleagues reviewed the records of 586,507 repeat donors to estimate how many newly infected people give blood in the 22-day period before they begin to make detectable amounts of antibodies to H.I.V.
Donations in the period can also allow blood infected with a cancer virus, H.T.L.V., for human T-cell lymphotropic virus, as well as hepatitis B and C, to avoid the screening process.
The report appears in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, along with a study by Cathy Conry-Cantilena and others from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases about the source of hepatitis C in infected donors.
The researchers estimated the risk of AIDS-tainted donations in the 22-day period at two in one million. Anyone who receives a tainted donation has a 90 percent chance of being infected.
The risk of H.T.L.V. coming into the blood supply this way was also given at about 2 per million, while hepatitis C was 10 per million and hepatitis B 16 per million.
The hepatitis C study found a surprisingly strong link between infection and sniffing cocaine. Other risk factors for hepatitis C included sexual promiscuity, intravenous drug use and, for men, ear piercing.
In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Paul V. Holland of the Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Center in California said the risk of catching a life-threatening virus from a transfusion was "remarkably low."
He said this was especially notable considering that even a few years ago, the risk of hepatitis C was one in 200.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Jumps And Manufacturing Surges

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Consumer spending jumped in May and manufacturing activity surged last month, reports showed today, the latest signs of solid economic growth ahead of a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.15 trillion after an increase of three-tenths of a percent in April. Incomes rose four-tenths of 1 percent after a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in April.
A clearer sign of robust growth was seen in a separate report by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The purchasing managers said their index of manufacturing activity jumped to 54.3 percent in June from 49.3 percent in May. A reading below 50 percent signals a slowing manufacturing economy, while a reading above that level suggests growth.
"Clearly the economy is still on a rebound when you look at these numbers," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Consumers are spending money and manufacturers are busy trying to produce goods to meet demand."
A third report showed construction activity weakened in May, as rising mortgage rates apparently sapped the confidence of commercial and residential builders.
 The reports are certain to be reviewed by Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to weigh their next move on interest rates.
Investors have become concerned that the Fed may soon raise short-term rates to ward off any pickup in inflation. But most analysts said after the latest reports that they continued to expect the Fed would leave rates unchanged this week.
Despite the jump in manufacturing activity, price pressure remained restrained, the purchasing management report said. The group's price index fell to 49 from 50.8 as manufacturers paid less for the goods they bought for processing.
An important factor behind the rise in consumer spending was strong new-car sales, the Commerce Department said. Auto makers reported strong sales for the month.
Auto makers increased production rates in the second quarter, contributing to a pickup in overall economic activity.
Some economists expect the economy grew as fast as a rate of 4 percent in the quarter, compared with 2.2 percent in the first quarter.
Mr. Sohn noted that not only was current demand strong for new cars, but auto makers were also likely to be building inventories before fall labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union, which could lead to work disruptions or a strike.
Whatever the case, the increased tempo of manufacturing businesses was evident in every phase of activity.
"The manufacturing sector grew at a strong rate in June, with production, new orders and order backlogs all indicating increased activity," said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the purchasing managers' business survey committee.
Much of the rise in consumer spending in May was for durable goods like cars, refrigerators and other long-lasting items, the Commerce Department said.
Auto sales dipped in April, partly because a three-week strike in March at the General Motors Corporation left a shortage of some popular models.
The Commerce Department also reported that May construction spending fell a sharp nine-tenths of 1 percent after strong back-to-back increases in March and April. Spending fell on residential and nonresidential building projects.
The department said personal incomes rose four-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.38 trillion, up from $6.35 trillion a month earlier, when incomes advanced five-tenths of a percent. Disposable income -- income after taxes -- shot up 1.3 percent, the largest increase since a 1.6 percent gain in May 1994. Disposable incomes had fallen five-tenths of a percent in April, when $59.3 billion in tax payments were made.
Despite stronger spending, savings rose in May to a rate of $222.5 billion from $193 billion in April. That meant 4 cents of each dollar earned was saved, up from 3.5 cents in April.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bond's Yield Rises To 6.91%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates this week helped limit losses in the Treasury market yesterday, as a report showed new strength in manufacturing.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32, to 88 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.91 percent, from 6.89 percent on Friday.
Prices weakened after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity jumped to 54.3 percent in June from 49.3 percent in May.
A reading below 50 percent signals a slowing manufacturing economy, while a reading above that level suggests growth. But the association's price index fell to 49 from 50.8
The purchasing managers' report "said that manufacturing is starting to pick up after a short cycle of inventory adjustment, which is now basically over," said Waldo T. Best, senior economist at Barclays De Zoette Wedd Securities Inc.
Another report also pointed to growth. The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Analysts said yesterday's reports did little to ease market concerns that the Fed would soon raise interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating as economic growth picked up.
But most market participants did not expect the central bank would move this week, as Federal Reserve policy makers begin a two-day meeting on interest rate policy today.
"We believe that they have insufficient economic evidence to justify raising rates at this time," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers of Columbus, Ohio.
"One shouldn't forget that Alan Greenspan will soon be be headed to Capital Hill to present his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to both the House and Senate, possibly in mid-July, though no date has been set," he said. "Any changes in monetary policy would have to be justified beyond a reasonable doubt."
Mr. Best of Barclays De Zoette Wedd Securities said the market's sluggish reaction to the strong economic data reflected a paralysis as the Fed meeting approached.
"There was more reaction to recent reported comments from sources both within the Fed and near to the Fed that Chairman Greenspan is wary of raising rates at the July deliberation," Mr. Best said.
"I think the second half of the year will not be as strong, but still stronger than the downward spiral people had expected," Mr. Best added. He said the Fed should not wait too long to make its impact on the economy.
"You can play hurry up when easing rates, but once the economy starts going, there are fewer options available to eliminate inflation in the economy," Mr. Best continued. "And once the market believes the Fed is losing inflation credibility, it will be felt on the long end of the market, with a 7.25 percent yield on the long bond a possible starting point from were yields could go higher."
The Treasury's regular weekly bill auction went off as expected yesterday, with decent investor demand. The average rates at auction were mixed, with the rate on the three-month bill up two basis points, to 5.12 percent, and the rate on six-month issue down one basis point, to 5.22 percent for the six-month bill. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Issuance of corporate and global debt is expected to be limited this week, with the market closed on Thursday in observance of the Fourth of July and with a half-session on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Review Finds More Deception In Trading at Bankers Trust

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Attempts to take advantage of customers, by employees of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation were far more widespread than the bank had indicated earlier, according to the conclusions of an investigation released yesterday by two independent lawyers.
Bankers Trust's "derivatives business was not well managed or controlled in certain important respects and certain individuals at B.T. -- concentrated principally on the N.Y. interest-rate desk and N.Y. corporates desk -- exploited these weaknesses for their own purposes," the report said. 
 A number of Bankers Trust clients, including the Procter & Gamble Company and Gibson Greetings Inc., experienced large, unexpected losses from dealings with Bankers Trust in the complex financial transactions known as derivatives.
Derivatives are a family of transactions used either to hedge the risk of a financial market or index or to speculate on it.
Subsequent government investigations and civil suits uncovered instances in which Bankers Trust employees misled their clients about the risk of derivatives deals. In recorded conversations disclosed in civil trials, salesmen boasted of how little their clients understood about the risks they were taking and how much money the salesmen were making as a result.
Still, throughout this series of disclosures, Bankers Trust insisted that only a few employees were responsible for these incidents. The independent counsel's report, however, said such deceptive practices occurred in a number of departments in the company.
Moreover, attempts by the bank's internal control departments to enforce appropriate standards -- such as determining if a transaction was suitable for a customer -- were suppressed by Bankers Trust's senior management.
The report called for disciplinary action against 10 Bankers Trust employees not identified by the published summary of the investigation. People close to the bank, who insisted on anonymity, said that 9 of the 10 people had already quit or been discharged by Bankers Trust.
The report also criticized several executives for failing to supervise derivatives activity. Most of these executives have also already left the bank. They include the retired chairman, Charles S. Sanford Jr.; the retired president, Eugene B. Shanks Jr., and the former co-head of the derivative and investment banking department, Brian Walsh.
The other co-head of the department, Yves De Balmann, remains in that position.
The report acknowledged that the problems "were not due to any institutional effort by B.T. to defraud, mislead or to otherwise take advantage of its customers" and that many employees acted properly.
The report criticized the desk that sold complex derivatives in New York for the lack of disclosure on proposed deals. "To a few of these employees, the customers' interests were often secondary."
"Others were well intentioned but inexperienced and undertrained for their positions," the report said. "A few were venal and engaged in misconduct to further their self-interest." Employees of this sales desk have been the center of the previously reported disciplinary actions.
The report criticized the activities of the separate trading desk that established prices for derivative transactions and hedged the risks. In one example, the report said, a trader "used his facility with mathematics to develop a formula for a leveraged derivative product that would conceal the amount of leverage that was embedded in such products."
The report also criticized the bank's internal controls, noting that existing policies were not strictly enforced. In some cases, attempts by officials involved in internal control to look more closely at derivatives deals were rebuffed.
"When the credit department sought an expanded role in 'appropriateness-suitability' decisions, this effort was successfully resisted by marketers with the support of senior management," the report said.
The report includes 10 pages of recommendations, some of which are now standard practice in the industry, such as keeping written policy manuals. Others are unusual, such as requiring that "non-English- speaking customers receive adequate disclosure regarding the terms and risks of derivatives transactions." Most financial dealings around the world are currently conducted in English.
The report was written at the order of four regulatory agencies with which Bankers Trust reached settlements: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve, the New York State Banking Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The independent counsels were Derrick D. Cephas, former superintendent of banks in New York State and Benjamin R. Civiletti, a former Attorney General of the United States. The report was based on almost 300 interviews and the examination of more than one million pages of documents.
The bank has six months to respond to the report and its recommendations.
In a letter to employees, Frank N. Newman, the new chairman and chief executive of Bankers Trust, said the events covered in the report occurred from 1991 to 1994.
"The policies and procedures now in place have been approved by our banking regulators and bring to our derivatives business and clients a level of transparency and control that is state of the art," Mr. Newman wrote.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Visits Romania Children

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, July 1

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton began an 11-day tour of Central Europe today with a visit to children's programs in a country notorious for backward orphanages and a high rate of child abandonment.
Instead of touring one of Romania's many harsh orphanages, Mrs. Clinton visited a cheerful AIDS pediatric center and a creative primary school program, in the hope, apparently, of showing what can be done. 
 She met 9-year-old Simion, an H.I.V.-positive girl abandoned in an orphanage, who is now in a foster family. She played spacemen with Alexander, 8, and watched, bemused, as Larissa, 7, pressed a pile of clothes with a toy iron and ironing board like a 1950's American housewife.
In Romania, such heartening scenes of children were unheard of during the rule of the Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown six years ago. They are now only beginning to emerge in scattered model programs, mostly financed by international organizations.
But against a backdrop of stark statistics that show the highest number of H.I.V.-positive children in Europe, the highest rate of maternal mortality and an increasing number of abandoned children, Mrs. Clinton took care to congratulate the Romanian Government on the steps it has begun to take.
Aides traveling with Mrs. Clinton said that instead of scolding the Government of President Ion Iliescu, a former official in Ceausescu Government, on what many consider to be harmful policies toward children, praising small progress was thought to be a better tack.
Chatting with a group of parents whose children attend Primary School 57, where an experimental curriculum has just been introduced, Mrs. Clinton reassured them that freedom of expression rather than rote learning was the right way to go.
"The classroom looked very familiar," she said of the project, financed by the United States Agency for International Development. "I thought I was walking into the classroom of my daughter 12 or 13 years ago. Young children learn by doing, and playing is their work when they are in kindergarten."
Today was the first leg of a trip by Mrs. Clinton across Central Europe, Estonia and Finland.
In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the three leading contenders to join NATO, Mrs. Clinton plans to applaud advances in democracy and the need to consolidate them. All the while, she will be keeping an eye on the ethnic vote back home, where the sizable Polish-American community will be courted by President Clinton and Bob Dole, the almost certain Republican presidential candidate.
But as Mrs. Clinton was praising Romania's limited gains, officials of the European Union said they were disturbed that new statistics showed the number of children abandoned in Romania's institutions was increasing. In part, this is because the attitude fostered by the Ceausescu Government that children of impoverished mothers were better off in state institutions persists among many officials as well as the public.
The officials said that despite Western encouragement, there was little effort by the Government to disband the institutions, in part because the orphanages had become a kind of "industry."
At the pediatric AIDS center at the Gheorghe Lupu Hospital, Mrs. Clinton saw about 50 children, all of whom had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, from contaminated needles used for injections of medications, according to Anne McNicholas, a director of Health Aid U.K., a British agency that looks after some of the children.
"We found some children in the first two years of life had received 500 injections," Mrs. McNicholas said of a survey that her organization had conducted. "The average was 200 injections. Giving injections is still often the first line of treatment. In many cases, the needle is changed, but not the syringe."
Mrs. McNicholas said hospitals in major cities in Romania were now reporting two or three new cases of H.I.V. infection every week in children 4 to 11 years old. These cases were caused, she said, by injections with contaminated needles. Because of discrimination, most of these children are condemned to live in large institutions where they are often left in cribs with little care, she said.
But of the 50 children who receive treatment at the hospital visited by Mrs. Clinton, 38 live in six group homes financed by Health Aid U.K. Four children have been placed in foster families in Bucharest.

HEADLINE: Lawyer Raised in New York to Lead Dominican Republic

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, July 1

 BODY:
Overcoming his youth, lack of experience and a second-place finish in an initial round of voting six weeks ago, Leonel Fernandez Reyna was officially declared the winner today of the presidential runoff election on Sunday.
Mr. Fernandez, candidate of the Dominican Liberation Party, won 51.25 percent of the 2,875,000 votes cast, or 72,000 more than his competitor, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, according to virtually complete returns made public by the Central Elections Board. The President-elect immediately pledged a Government of "modernization and development" that would discard the authoritarian habits of the past. 
 "We are beginning a new era," Mr. Fernandez, a 42-year-old lawyer who was raised in New York City and still has the green card that would allow him to live and work in the United States, said at a news conference this afternoon. "A new generation of politicians has taken office with the desire to do things for the good of the nation."
Mr. Fernandez has never held public office before, but managed to turn his inexperience into an advantage in a country whose politics have been dominated for a generation by a pair of strongmen who are now octogenarians. He billed himself as "the new road," a phrase that seemed to resonate with young voters yearning for change in this Caribbean island nation of 7.5 million people, the largest source of recent immigrants to New York City.
In the first round of balloting held here on May 16, Mr. Fernandez won 39 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for Mr. Pena Gomez. His margin of victory in Sunday's vote clearly came from the alliance he made last month with Joaquin Balaguer, the country's wily 89-year-old President, the leader of the Social Christian Reform Party and a bitter enemy of Mr. Pena Gomez.
Both the election and the ballot count were praised by Dominican and foreign observers as the cleanest and most orderly in the country's history. In the past, elections here have regularly been marred by violence and trickery, most notably in 1994, when Mr. Balaguer engaged in what international observers described as systematic vote fraud to rob Mr. Pena Gomez of victory.
"This puts an end to a long series of manipulations of the popular will," said Isidoro Santana, general coordinator of the Citizen Network of Election Observers, a nonpartisan group that monitored the vote, in which 76 percent of those eligible cast ballots. The organization's poll watchers had observed some isolated "anomalies and irregularities," he said, but none that appeared organized or which were serious enough to cast doubt on the results.
At a separate news conference this afternoon, Mr. Pena Gomez reluctantly conceded defeat. He complained bitterly of being subjected to what he called "the most abject insults and vexations" and vowed not "to renounce our duty to continue fighting for the installation of democracy in our country."
But he also said he would not challenge the result.
"In life, you have to learn to win and to lose," said Mr. Pena Gomez, 59, a former Mayor of Santo Domingo, the capital, who was making his third run for the presidency. "We respectfully accept this verdict."
The victory is the first in a presidential vote for Mr. Fernandez's party, founded in 1973 by Juan Bosch, the 87-year-old patriarch of the Dominican left. Party supporters took to the streets today to celebrate raucously, waving purple flags, sounding horns and sirens and dancing to merengue music blaring from towering loudspeakers mounted on trucks.
"This is the moment we have all been waiting for," Radhames Santana, a 26-year-old gas station attendant, said as he watched the multitude celebrate. "Finally we have someone who will get this country moving and not let us down."
Mr. Fernandez will have little time, however, to savor victory in a country with a limited tradition of democratic give-and-take. "Now begins a second challenge, that of governability," warned Belisario Betancur, a former President of Colombia who, with the former American President Jimmy Carter, shared the leadership of a delegation of international observers.
The main threat to Mr. Fernandez's ability to carry out the ambitious attack on corruption and poverty he pledged during the campaign is most likely to come from his nominal ally, Mr. Balaguer. The President-elect's party has only one member of 30 in the Dominican Senate, and only 12 members of 120 in the lower house.
Mr. Balaguer, in contrast, continues to control his party's much larger legislative delegation, which gives him the kingmaker's role he has sought since constitutional reforms prohibited him from remaining in office. In recognition of that situation, Mr. Fernandez has pledged to "share the bread" and to consult with Mr. Balaguer on all major initiatives.
"Leonel has taken a big and very dangerous risk," one diplomat here said. "He didn't sell his soul to the devil, but he leased it, and now we have to see what he does to get it back."
In his comments this afternoon, the President-elect minimized such concerns, however, saying the strength of rival parties in the Dominican Congress was "not a handicap" but a sign that the Dominican Republic was finally becoming a democracy. "How does Bill Clinton govern with both houses in the hands of the Republicans?" he asked.
During a separate interview, Mr. Fernandez said he planned to implement economic policies that will diminish the flow of illegal Dominican emigrants to the United States. He said "a policy of repression" on the part of the United States would not work and called on Washington to encourage investment and other measures that would make this country grow.
"At its root, this is an economic and social problem," he said of the migratory flow of more than a million Dominicans to the United States over the last 30 years.
The more economic growth there is here, he said, the less Dominicans will be tempted to leave, and the more likely that Dominicans living abroad will be willing to return home.
"We don't believe much in donations," Mr. Fernandez said. The Dominican Republic has "a large common agenda with the United States," he added, and he pledged to pursue it with more energy than previous governments have.

HEADLINE: The Bosnian Minuet

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, July 1

 BODY:
The tussle during the past few days in Bosnia between the Bosnian Serb leadership and the West was all hauntingly familiar.
First came the demand from the international community: Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader who has been charged with war crimes, must leave power. Then came the threat: if Dr. Karadzic does not quit, economic sanctions will be imposed. Then came a vague promise by the Bosnian Serbs to comply, followed by no compliance. 
 And today the diplomat in charge of Bosnian reconstruction, Carl Bildt, who set the whole thing in motion, said that sanctions -- threatened against the Serbian Government in Belgrade, which provides vital economic support to the Bosnian Serbs and is thought to have the power to oust Dr. Karadzic -- are probably not such a good idea after all.
In any case, Belgrade has not taken effective action to force the Bosnian Serb leader out.
The artful dance by the Bosnian Serbs, and the less artful retreat by the West, has been polished over four years of peace negotiations, broken cease-fires, hostage-taking and attacks on sanctuaries under United Nations protection. The Bosnian Serbs have learned that the NATO-led force now in Bosnia, like the United Nations peacekeeping troops that preceded it, has no stomach for a confrontation.
"When faced with a choice between renewed conflict in Bosnia and heavy NATO casualties, the Europeans and the Americans will choose conflict in Bosnia," said a European diplomat. "It is sad, but perhaps understandable."
While they do not openly say it, Western officials have made it clear that they no longer insist, in the short term at least, on their original goal of arresting Dr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic. Rather, with elections looming in Bosnia in September, they have said that Dr. Karadzic, as leader of hard-line forces that reject the goals of the Dayton peace accord, must simply be removed from power.
On Saturday President Clinton and other leaders of seven major economic powers declared that Dr. Karadzic must step down and that they would consider reimposing sanctions on Serbia if it did not press him to do so, although they pointedly did not back up Mr. Bildt's proposed deadline of today.
But Western leaders, afraid to provoking reprisals, have been unwilling to let NATO troops get involved in arresting Dr. Karadzic. And there seems to be little stomach for sanctions either.
In the latest round with Dr. Karadzic, a repeat of a similar struggle between Dr. Karadzic and Mr. Bildt in May, the Bosnian Serbs said he was resigning the office of president -- Dr. Karadzic even signed a letter drafted in Mr. Bildt's office. But Dr. Karadzic's vice president later said he would not formally resign, just hand over his duties for now. In any case, diplomats here say, he is likely to continue controlling the Serbian part of Bosnia unless he is sent out of the country.
In Rome today, the United States Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry, responded to the confusion: "We will see what it amounts to in practice," he said in an interview with reporters. "It has to be clear that Karadzic is out of power and unable to influence events in the country."
Of future Western responses, he added: "That will become clear in the days ahead and as it becomes clear we can make a better decision about what the next steps will be."
The failure of Western resolve is chipping away at the credibility of the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. And some experts fear that the decision by Western leaders to back away from the latest demand today could lead to increasing defiance by the Bosnian Serb leader.
Bosnian Muslim leaders in Sarajevo are in despair over the matter. They said they had hoped, apparently in vain, that once NATO troops took charge in Bosnia, the demands of the international community for the removal of those indicted for war crimes would be backed by force, or at least sanctions.
Although only a few days ago Mr. Bildt was issuing an ultimatum, today he dismissed the threat of economic sanctions, saying they would hurt the wrong people. It was, according to many Western diplomats, a humiliating climb-down and one that was greeted with jubilation among the Bosnian Serbs.
Even as Mr. Bildt had made his demand, the political leadership in Pale, in an in-your-face gesture, re-elected Dr. Karadzic as head of the ruling party on Saturday, insuring his continued control of the police.
"It has never been wise to let the Bosnian Serbs get away with this kind of defiance," said a Western diplomat. "They are not a people who know limits."
Vice President Ejup Ganic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a telephone interview from Sarajevo, said: "The international community has been taken hostage by Karadzic and Mladic. The refusal to send NATO troops with all their firepower to Pale to arrest these war criminals is putting every single civilian aspect of the Dayton peace agreement in jeopardy. The whole peace process is paralyzed. It is clear to us that the West is governed by politicians who lack the vision and the moral probity to do what is right."
A cautious stance may actually endanger NATO troops in the long term. For while the current 50,000-strong force is to begin withdrawing on Dec. 20, everyone expects that a lesser force will be left behind to maintain separation between the Serb and Muslim armies. And if the credibility of the mission is in tatters, it could mean trouble for the troops left behind.
"When the NATO troops deployed here in December, Karadzic and Mladic hid under their shells," said a Western diplomat. "When they saw that NATO troops had no intention of arresting them, or even stepping in to do things like stop the looting by the Bosnian Serbs in the suburbs in Sarajevo, they realized they had a great deal of latitude. They are growing bolder.
"The consequences, if the past is any guide, is that they will not stop until they push the West to respond with force, or entirely discredit the operation."

HEADLINE: U.S. Objects to Details of Plan To Let Iraq Sell Oil for Food

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 1

 BODY:
A plan allowing Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to meet urgent civilian needs was thrown into jeopardy today when the Clinton Administration said Baghdad was trying to twist the exemption to import high-technology goods in violation of economic sanctions.
Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States representative here, said the Iraqis were also hoping to get control of goods intended for Kurdish areas in the north, which they could skim off in a subversion of procedures established by a Security Council resolution. 
 "What is going on now is a deliberate attempt by the Government of Saddam Hussein to yet again try to figure out how to get around the rules," Ms. Albright said. "He's trying to skin the cat 15 different ways. This cat is dead."
Ms. Albright dismissed Iraq's national distribution plan for goods imported through the oil-sale exemption as unacceptable. The 47-page plan, with 500 pages of annexes, was presented to the United Nations last Thursday and is now being studied here.
The American announcement appeared intended to pre-empt acceptance of the proposal, one of several being drawn up in consultation with United Nations officials to cover details of the sale of up to $2 billion in oil over six months and what imports the profits could go to buy.
A decision onthe proposals rests with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is in Europe and has not yet seen the document, according to his spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa.
The situation could be awkward for the Administration, which has vowed to veto a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali but wants him to see things Washington's way regarding what to do in Iraq.
Ms. Albright said that she had not spoken with the Secretary General but that "we are making our views quite clear" to the United Nations Secretariat, whose officials took part in negotiations on details of the plan in Baghdad. A Security Council sanctions committee must also meet to consider the operational details of the oil-sale plan.
The announcement provoked immediate reactions from some other Security Council members, including Sergei Lavrov, Russia's representative, who said the procedures governing the oil sales were clearly laid down on May 20 in a memorandum "adopted to everyone's satisfaction."
"I see no way this can be changed," Mr. Lavrov told reporters. "Everything else is not relevant."
Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi envoy who negotiated the oil-sale memorandum, dismissed the American objections as irrelevant and suggested that they were tied to American presidential politics.
The memorandum was negotiated under the terms of a 1995 Security Council resolution intended to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi civilians living under the strict economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Today Ms. Albright said the Iraqis planned to put food and other goods intended for the Kurds in a warehouse in Baghdad, "and thereby allow the Iraqis to make a discrimination on what should go where, and perhaps skim off."
She said the Iraqis also asked to import "telephone switching networks, computers and a variety of other things that go way beyond what is necessary for monitoring." Another United States official said that helicopter parts and oil drilling equipment were also on the list.
Under the oil-for-food plan. Iraq was to be allowed to bring in some equipment to repair oil installations and for purposes strictly related to the distribution of imported materials. United Nations agencies will be watching to assess whether supplies are reaching their intended recipients.
Mr. Anbari said United Nations officials had suggested computers to keep track of goods going to the Kurdish north.
Of the $2 billion in oil income that Iraq was to be allowed over six months, about $130 million to $150 million must be set aside for the Kurds, which are under international protection after severe repression from Baghdad. One-third of the income is to be set aside for compensation to victims of the Iraqi attack and occupation on Kuwait.
The oil-for-food exemption did not touch the economic sanctions, which will remain in place until Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction, returned stolen Kuwaiti property and accounted for missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war.
American officials said today that Iraq was intent on trying to turn the oil-sale exemption into the beginning of the end of sanctions, and did not understand that this would not work so long as the Clinton Administration remained vigilant.
Diego Arria, a former Venezuelan diplomat and Security Council member during the gulf war who is now writing a book about the functioning of the United Nations during that period, said Iraq seems to be unable to accept that it has to meet all Security Council requirements and cannot maneuver around them by splitting the Council.
"The Iraqis always thought they could play power politics in the Security Council," Mr. Arria said in an interview. "They thought there would be a little opening and they would get through not only with food, but with everything they could. That's what they are trying to do now, with equipment and so forth.
"They always managed to misread the true intentions of the United States."

HEADLINE: Perot's Party Plans to Mail Survey to Select a Nominee

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
Organizers of the Reform Party will formally open their nationwide search for a 1996 Presidential nominee this week by mailing supporters a candidate-preference survey that mentions only the names of the party founder, Ross Perot, and former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado.
But while no other names appear on the survey form, respondents will be instructed that they are free to write in the name of any other potential standard bearer, said Russell Verney, the national coordinator of the party. 
 Mailing the survey to supporters -- estimated to number more than one million -- marks the beginning of efforts to define the field of potential Presidential candidates in time for the party's two-part, two-day national convention. The process will begin in Long Beach, Calif., on Aug. 11.
The results of the mail survey will be tabulated by Aug. 4, Mr. Verney said. Based on the results, he said, party officials will get in contact with everyone who receives "significant support" to see if they are interested in formally becoming candidates. Mr. Verney did not define yesterday what he meant by "significant support."
Until now, Mr. Perot and Mr. Verney have said that anyone who wanted to be a candidate would have to gather petition signatures from 10 percent of the party's estimated 1.3 million supporters. It is not clear, based on what Mr. Verney said yesterday, whether the mail survey will now supplant the petition process as a way to define the field of candidates.
At the moment, Mr. Verney indicated, there seems to be interest in setting a somewhat lower bar. "I'm leaning toward 10 percent of responses," he said in a telephone interview from Long Beach, Calif. "But I wouldn't say it's cast in concrete."
Those chosen as candidates are supposed to make their nominating speeches on the the eve of the Aug. 12 opening of the Republican National Convention in San Diego. The Reform Party plans to reconvene on Aug. 18 in Valley Forge, Pa., to announce the results of nationwide balloting, in which supporters will cast ballots electronically and by mail. At that time, the winning nominee will make an acceptance speech.
Those eligible to receive a survey includes anyone who signed ballot-access petitions for the Reform Party or who enrolled in it. Mr. Verney described the survey process as "an opportunity for members to draft the candidate of their choice."
Mr. Verney said the survey mentioned Mr. Lamm and Mr. Perot primarily for two reasons. Both have been frequently mentioned by those who signed ballot-access petitions in various states, he said. And even though Mr. Lamm and Mr. Perot have not publicly committed themselves to making a bid for the nomination, neither has ruled out running.
Reform Party supporters should begin to receive the survey later this week. The mailing will also include a letter from Mr. Verney explaining the convention sessions. Supporters will be asked to mail their surveys no later than July 20, he said.
Mr. Verney was also uncertain about which official or officials in the party, which has been created and financed by Mr. Perot, would be asked to get in contact with those receiving significant support in the survey to ascertain whether they want to compete for the nomination.
As the Reform Party took steps yesterday likely to shape its Presidential field, a friend and supporter of Jack F. Kemp, a former Republican Congressman from Buffalo, floated his name.
"I continue to try to get a draft-Kemp movement going for the Reform Party," said Jude Wanniski, a Kemp ally and the supply-side theorist credited with helping to persuade Steve Forbes, the magazine publishing heir, to run in the Republican Presidential primaries as the champion of economic growth, lower taxes and opportunity.
Through a spokesman at Empower America in Washington, Mr. Kemp distanced himself from Mr. Wanniski's efforts. "He is unambiguously not interested," said the spokesman, Christian Pinkston. He said that Mr. Kemp, who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Administration of President George Bush, would always remain in the Republican Party and "is strongly supporting Bob Dole."
Mr. Wanniski said he had talked to Mr. Verney about what he sees as the advantages of a Kemp candidacy. "It's not possible for Bob Dole to win the Presidency," he said, asserting that voters are not prepared to turn over power in Washington to a "Dole-Gingrich party." He added that many voters believed that Mr. Dole, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich "can't be trusted to preserve the safety net."
Mr. Wanniski said that he had long had Mr. Kemp's "passive assent to explore possibilities."

Supreme Court Finds Shift By U.S. Unfair to S.& L.'s
The Supreme Court ruled that the Government knowingly went back on its word through accounting changes that plunged three savings and loans into insolvency. The case could cost taxpayers billions in breach-of- contract damages.
The lending institutions were trapped during the savings and loan bailout of the 1980's after regulators had induced them to assume huge liabilities to salvage other savings and loans. The 7-to-2 ruling applies to more than 90 similar cases pending against the Government. [Page A1.] Excerpts from the decision [D20.]
 
Jackpot! That was the reaction among savings and loan investors who, after years of on-again, off-again rulings in the case, saw their most profitable day of the decade. Kurt Eichenwald: Market Place. [D8.]
 
Stock Prices Rise on Confidence That the Fed Will Not Raise Rates
Stock prices surged as investors bought shares that had fallen in recent weeks. Underpinning the rally was confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.35 points to 5,729.98. [D8.]
 
Bond prices fell only slightly, as traders showed confidence that interest rates would remain stable. [D18.]
 
Tribune Company to Buy TV Stations
The Tribune Company will buy Renaissance Communications for $1.13 billion, adding six TV stations to the 10 it already owns. [D2.]
 
Borland Chief Expected to Quit
Borland will announce that its chief executive is resigning in the face of a financially disastrous quarter, several people close to the software developer said. [D4.]
 
Chrysler Continues Strong Sales
Chrysler sales rose 1 percent last month compared with a strong June last year. [D6.]
 
HFS Will Buy Avis for $800 Million
HFS said it had reached an agreement to acquire Avis, the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. [D6.]
 
Halliburton to Buy Software Maker
Halliburton will acquire Landmark Graphics, a provider of computer software and services that help find and produce oil and gas. [D3.]
 
General Re in Deal for National Re
General Re, the largest property and casualty reinsurer, agreed to buy National Re, a competitor, for $940 million. [D2.]
 
Mastercard Issues Rules for Banks
Mastercard said it would no longer allow member banks to issue some competing cards, mainly those of American Express. [D8.]
 
Consumer Spending Jumped in May
Consumer spending jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent in May and manufacturing activity surged last month, the latest signs of solid economic growth. The purchasing managers index rose to 54.3 percent. [D5.]
 
Utility Backs Out of Merger Deal
Washington Water Power said it would end its effort to merge with Sierra Pacific Resources because of objections from regulators. [D3.]
 
HMV Tries to Get Noticed in a Crowd
If the premise of advertising is to raise share of mind or share of voice with consumers, then HMV Record Stores is gambling that a campaign can help gain share of ear. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]
 
Tentative Deal Is Reached on FASB
A tentative deal has been reached on the Financial Accounting Foundation. [D5.]

Islanders Get in Line To Try to Get Arena

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
The new arena/new owner virus has infected the Islanders. And why not? How can any team see the Philadelphia 76ers and Flyers get new owners and a new Spectrum and not be jealous? Or watch as the Quebec Nordiques morph into the Colorado Avalanche, win the Stanley Cup and get a new arena in 1997?
When you're in a dingy 24-year-old joint with a lousy lease, it's easy to suffer from arena envy. So it's no wonder that the quiet team from Uniondale, L.I., wants a refurbished Nassau Coliseum or, preferably, a new and improved arena. 
 "There have been no improvements at the Coliseum since 1972," said Robert Rosenthal, co-chairman of the Islanders, who with three other partners bought 10 percent of the team from John Pickett for $10 million in 1992. The partnership recently invested $5 million more that is convertible into a larger stake in the team. "The landlord's obligation is to maintain a facility and fix it up," Rosenthal said.
The ownership's understandable yen for a modern sports mansion with more than 16,297 seats and 33 luxury suites comes at a complex time. While team sale prices throughout sports are high, and nearly every hockey team will have a modern arena for the new century, the Isles are not exactly a growth stock.
The team is in a long slump. It has not sold out more than 74 percent of its capacity in the 1990's. Its fortunes slid under General Manager Don Maloney. Lord Stanley, once a member of the family, never even visits. The team's lack of playoff success has deprived it of the gravy of post-season revenue. The ownership claims to have lost $12 million during the past two seasons.
Most ignominious: Last season's new fisherman logo cannot be fully rectified until the 1997-98 season. The team can use the old logo 15 times next season under a deal with the National Hockey League.
But there can be value in the lowliest of franchises. The Isles are part of the New York market. They have a glorious past. Their $13 million-a-year SportsChannel cable deal is the best in the N.H.L. and is guaranteed through 2012, three years before the Coliseum lease expires.
The county agrees that the Coliseum is an aging hulk and out of sync with the times. It just doesn't want to pay for a new one. So last week, it issued a request for proposals from private developers to build a new arena and hotel and to convert the Coliseum into a convention center.
"Traditionally, publicly financed sports facilities are money losers for taxpayers," said County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. "The Coliseum loses $500,000 a year."
But Rosenthal said he can't help but look at the help the state has given to the new arena in Buffalo, or will give to new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees, and think that the Isles deserve some of that booty, too.
"We've encouraged ownership to help put together financing to build the arena," Gulotta said. "The larger the role they play, the more they will benefit." Are you listening, George Steinbrenner?
It would be difficult to imagine that any potential buyer or investor would buy into the team without the promise of a new or rebuilt arena. One suitor is the Marquee Group, whose president, Bob Gutkowski, successfully ran Madison Square Garden from 1991 to 1994. Late last season, Isles fans mindful of Gutkowski's marketing sophistication chanted, "We want Gutkowski."
"This is a high-risk team," said Michael Ozanian, statistics editor of Financial World magazine, which valued the Isles at $60 million this year. "It's a franchise whose revenues are directly correlated to how well the team does. Unlike the Rangers, who, even if they stink, would only be hurt a little."
Despite the league-high cable deal, Ozanian reckoned that Gutkowski, or any suitor, would pay a bargain price to buy into the franchise. Rosenthal would not confirm that Pickett is trying to unload his 90 percent stake.
"No more upside can be had from the cable deal," Ozanian said. "The only way to increase the value of the team is by enhancing the money it gets from the arena by 200 to 300 percent, which means getting a new arena."
Meanwhile, New York City is close to selecting an outside adviser to examine how to pay for proposed new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees, and to negotiate terms with the teams, said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "I think the choice can be made soon," he said.
 
AIR WAVES
The women's Olympic gymnastics trials Sunday night generated a 9.6 Nielsen overnight rating on NBC. The 7-9 P.M. program peaked at a 12.0 from 8:30-9. The ably produced program had one problem: the commentators' easy acceptance of the physical rigors these young women endure to retain palpably girlish bodies. At one point the analyst ELFI SCHLEGEL seemed encouraged that KERRI STRUG, 18, has the same body she had in 1992. That's the problem.
TERRY BRADSHAW and HOWIE LONG may have thought they would have the Fox football studio analytical desk to themselves once JIMMY JOHNSON fled for the Miami Dolphins. But RONNIE LOTT is expected to be named this week as Johnson's replacement.

To the Editor:
President Clinton voices outrage at the bombing in Saudi Arabia. The real outrage is that 40 years after President Eisenhower limited Persian Gulf oil imports to avoid having our troops sent there, a succession of Presidents have risked our soldiers and economy on the shaky foundation of gulf monarchs and despots. 
 Failure to account for the cost of our military's defense of the Persian Gulf in oil prices results in a failure to consider cost-effective, safe technologies as well as in the loss of jobs that could employ our own people.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 2

 BODY:
Downsizing? Unemployment? Lower standards of living? Economic uncertainty? Maybe where you are, but not 400 miles southwest of Paris in the staid old city of Bordeaux. These are heady days for the Bordelais: they're having their best wine year in a long, long time.
"I'm afraid it's all gone a bit crazy," said Peter A. Sichel, the owner of Chateau d'Angludet and a part owner of Chateau Palmer, both in the Margaux wine district. 
 "Crazy" may not be the precise term; "euphoric" may be closer. The cause of all the excitement is the 1995 vintage, which has turned out to be the best since 1990.
That the vintage would be a good one has been a poorly kept secret since the grapes were crushed last fall. It had been a successful summer, the wine makers said, and the young wines showed it. Prominent critics weighed in with enthusiastic reports. Excitement began to grow. Last month, the first prices were announced, and no one in the trade was particularly surprised when the wines at some chateaus were priced 50 percent higher than in 1994.
The current frenzy is in the futures market, where wines are sold now for delivery when they are bottled in 18 to 24 months. Both the United States and Britain, top markets for high-priced Bordeaux, have been mostly out of the wine-futures market since 1990, which translates into considerable pent-up demand.
A wine future is a contract to buy wine before it is ready to be delivered. The purchaser is betting that the wine will be worth more upon delivery. Sometimes it is. Stories abound of wines bought for $200 a case on futures that were worth $600 or more on delivery. Those were exceptional wines. No one talks about the wines that dropped in value because they never lived up to early notices, because of currency changes or because an intervening vintage was spectacular, dampening interest in the contract vintage.
Nor does anyone, except the victims, mention the merchants who sell futures, then declare bankruptcy, or who sell futures without any commitments from wine suppliers. Securities laws don't cover investments in Bordeaux wines.
Interest in 1995 futures has also been intensified by the shortage of top-quality Bordeaux wine from earlier years. Shippers in Bordeaux and importers worldwide report severely depleted stocks of the last good vintages, the memorable triumvirate of 1988, 1989 and 1990. "The Anglo-Saxon market is running out of stock," Mr. Sichel said. "There is plenty of wine from the poorer years, but the good vintages are almost gone."
In New York, Michael Aaron, the chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, the wine retailer, said the wine auctions held in that city over the last two years had contributed to the interest in Bordeaux futures. "Thanks to the auctions, a new group of investors has come along," he said, "and this is the first chance they've had to get in on the ground floor."
Mr. Aaron quoted these 1995 futures prices for some famous Bordeaux chateaus: Latour and Mouton-Rothschild, $1,600 a case (12 bottles); Lafite-Rothschild, $1,400; Haut-Brion, $1,200, and the rare Chateau Petrus, $3,900, or $325 a bottle. Futures for the 1994 Mouton-Rothschild were $830 a case and the 1994 Haut-Brion, $800, Mr. Aaron said.
Among the second-tier properties, Chateau Lynch-Bages is quoted at $425 a case, Pichon-Lalande at $695 and Leoville Las Cases at $925, he said, adding, "We haven't seen anything like this since the excitement over the 1982 vintage."
Strong demand from Asia, a relatively new phenomenon in the Bordeaux market, has also pushed prices up. "More and more people are chasing a rather small amount of wine," Mr. Sichel said.
The high prices reflect demand more than quality. Most producers, Mr. Sichel among them, rate 1995 as a very good year, better than the four preceding vintages, but not on a level with 1982, 1989 or 1990. Many put it somewhere between the attractive 1985 vintage and the more concentrated 1990. Adding to the pressure, some better Bordeaux wine districts, including Pauillac and Saint-Julien, produced about 10 percent less wine in 1995 than in 1994.
In Britain and some European markets, the urge to buy 1995's has extended to the famous Bordeaux sweet white wines from Sauternes. These wines depend on the appearance at harvest time of the special botrytis mold that concentrates the grape sugar. There was no botrytis in 1991, 1992 and 1993, and only a limited amount in 1994. Chateau d'Yquem, the best known of the Sauternes properties, is expecting an excellent wine from 1995.
To a large extent, the price increases for 1995 French wines have been limited to Bordeaux. Prices for red Burgundy have changed little. Prices set by the trade for white Burgundy were up about 10 percent because of a short crop. Prices for premium California wines have risen steadily over the last year, because increased demand for the best wines has caused a shortage of grapes. Some California wineries have been buying wine in Europe and South America for their less expensive labels. Prices for the 1995 Beaujolais, which is now in the markets, were slightly lower than the year before.
Not everyone finds the current wave of Bordeaux prices to be unusually high. Some Bordeaux shippers have pointed out that the elites, the so-called first growths like Margaux, Latour and Lafite, were first offered to the trade at about $70 a bottle in 1989, another good year, and that today, with storage, interest and other charges, they have to sell for at least $90, or about $10 more than the average opening price of the 1995's.
Two things to keep in mind: Good wines were made throughout the early 1990's, particularly in 1994, even if they didn't attract investors. Indeed, some excellent bargains can be found among the lesser years. And remember, wine futures are not for everyone.
 
TASTINGS
Handley Cellars Pinot Noir 1994 Reserve,
Anderson Valley (California). About $24.
 
Outside California, there is a tendency to confuse the Anderson Valley, which is in Mendocino County, with the Alexander Valley, in Sonoma County. This wine says a lot about the difference between the two. The cool nights and foggy mornings up in Mendocino are pinot noir weather. Much of the valley's pinot noir goes into sparkling wine, but fortunately, some is reserved for wines like this. Working with grapes from two vineyards, her own and one nearby, Milla Handley has produced a most Burgundian pinot noir: rich but not heavy, fruity without being candylike. The wine has that indefinable earthy quality that denotes a good pinot noir, in California, Oregon or Gevrey-Chambertin. The winery recommends cellaring for a few years, but it tastes good now.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
MOLES: we all have them. Some of us have only one or two, while others have dozens, even 100 or more. Caucasian men and women generally have 10 to 40 -- an average of 24 -- of the pigmented spots on their bodies. That adds up to nearly four billion moles on white Americans. This year, some 19,000 of those spots will be diagnosed as a malignant melanoma, a potentially lethal skin cancer that is increasing at an epidemic rate, faster than any other cancer.
These 19,000 cases represent about half the 38,300 melanomas expected to be detected in Americans this year. A recent survey of 2,628 dermatologists indicated that there might actually be nearly 80,000 new cases of melanoma each year. From the early 1960's to the early 1990's, the melanoma death rate increased by 36 percent in women and by 107 percent in men and is still growing. Early detection through examination of suspicious moles remains the best hope for stemming this lethal trend. 
 Fair-skinned, blond, blue-eyed men and women are especially at risk for melanoma, as well as for superficial skin cancers. Blacks, people of Hispanic descent and other dark-skinned people also have moles, but far fewer than Caucasians, and their risk of developing melanoma is also much lower.
Dr. Richard W. Sagebiel, a dermatologist affiliated with the University of California at San Francisco, has calculated that the chance of any one mole progressing to cancer is about one in 200,000. He likened those odds to the diameter of a dime measured against the length of seven trips across the Golden Gate Bridge.
With odds like these, you might assume there is not much point in worrying about every little dark spot on your body. But while worrying may be an overresponse, paying attention to your moles and noting any significant changes in size, shape or color is the only way to catch and cure this cancer before it spreads.
You have the advantage over melanoma. Unlike other cancers that are hidden inside the body, melanoma nearly always occurs on the body's surface, where it can be detected and treated before it is too late. But melanomas will only be found early if you look for them. And there is perhaps no better time to do that than now, when warm weather permits a comfortable whole-body surveillance by you or your significant other. And, of course, the only way you are likely to know if one of your moles is undergoing a change is to check your body on a regular basis, at least once every few months. Do not wait until next summer to do it again.
What Is a Mole?
In simplest terms, moles are small, dark, benign collections of pigmented cells that usually appear on the surface of the skin. Some are flat, and others are raised. Some are smooth, others wrinkled. Some are hairy, others not. They vary in color, size and shape, from small freckles to large unsightly lesions. Sometimes moles are present at birth, most appear by early adulthood and occasionally people develop additional moles later in life.
The overwhelming majority of moles stay just as they were when you first noticed them. Most moles remain stable for years or decades. Nothing needs to be done about these unless you are distressed by their size or location. With so many moles on so many people, it would be medically and economically prohibitive to remove them all. It is only those moles that start to change that require medical attention.
A mole may change in size, shape, color or elevation, or it may become scaly or itchy or start to bleed. Any such change should prompt a visit to a dermatologist or skin cancer specialist for an examination and a biopsy. Even if you do not think a mole has changed, if a doctor considers its appearance suspicious, removal and biopsy are the wisest course.
Moles that change are said to be "dysplastic," the medical term for growing abnormally. Dysplastic moles, or dysplastic nevi as they are called medically, occur in about 5 percent of the population, most often in people who have an abundance of moles -- 100 or more. Such people tend to acquire new moles in midlife, whereas most people get no further moles after about the age of 40.
The American Cancer Society and the Skin Cancer Foundation together devised an "ABCD" rule to help people tell the difference between an ordinary benign mole and one that is abnormal and in need of medical attention.
"A" stands for asymmetry. The two halves of a dysplastic mole do not match.
"B" means border. The edges of a dysplastic mole may be irregular -- ragged, notched or blurred.
"C" is for color. A dysplastic mole may have differing shades of tan, brown or black and may sometimes have patches of red, white or blue.
"D" stands for diameter. A mole that is more than a quarter of an inch in diameter -- the size of a pencil eraser -- or that is increasing in size warrants a medical examination.
To this list, Dr. Sagebiel adds an "E" for elevation. A mole that becomes raised or more raised than it had been is considered suspicious.
Moles that a child is born with, those that arise after age 40 and those that occur around the nails or the genitals should also be watched by a doctor.
Who Is at Risk?
While most people with moles will never have a melanoma, tens of thousands of people have characteristics that give them a much greater than average chance of developing this cancer. In an article appearing in the current issue of The Skin Cancer Foundation Journal, Dr. Sagebiel listed these factors as raising a person's risk of developing melanoma:
*Having a large number of moles -- more than 75 or 100.
*Having skin that tends to burn rather than tan when exposed to the sun.
*Having a strong family history of melanoma in blood relatives.
*The presence of dysplastic moles or a family history of such moles.
People who have all these characteristics have a risk of developing melanoma that is 35 times as great as that of people without these risk factors, Dr. Sagebiel wrote. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends that such high-risk people be checked by a doctor twice a year. Everyone else, including those with only one or even no risk factors, should be examined each year by a doctor.
Dr. Sagebiel works at a melanoma center in San Francisco, where experience has shown that when a suspicious mole is biopsied soon after it begins to change or appear abnormal, the cancer is nearly always still localized and can be cured simply by surgical removal.
"The cure rate for these early melanomas approaches 100 percent," Dr. Sagebiel wrote, adding that "close surveillance can thus dramatically lower the mortality and morbidity of melanoma," without having to take the aggressive step of removing all moles.

The Oil Factor

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The most striking thing about the response of the G-7 leaders to the latest bombing in Saudi Arabia was the decision they didn't take. Yes, they called for an unstinting effort to track down and punish the perpetrators, and that's essential. But an equally obvious response didn't seem to occur to them -- that the Western industrial democracies should also reduce their energy consumption and reliance on imported Middle East oil, which would be healthy for their economies, healthy for the environment, and make it so every bomb that goes off in Saudi Arabia doesn't become a world historical event.
The absence of such a recommendation from the Group of Seven economic summit is all the more striking because the very reason the G-7 was founded was to deal with the economic fallout and currency disruptions set off by the 1973 oil shock. In a way, it is a signal of the G-7's ultimate irrelevance. It has forgotten what it was founded to do. There was a revealing headline in The Financial Times last week from the Lyons G-7 summit. It blared: "G-7 to Prepare Anti-Terrorism Measures." It was like reading: "World Renowned Chefs to Fix Plumbing." It's not exactly their specialty. 
 But the indifference of the G-7 leaders to oil conservation is typical of the mood these days, certainly in the U.S. We responded to the 1973-79 oil crises by raising taxes on gasoline to reduce consumption. Now we are lowering those taxes. We responded to the 1973-79 crises by shrinking the size of automobiles; now we are upsizing them. We responded to the 1973-79 crises by lowering the speed limits; now we are raising them. To put it in numerical terms, before 1979 the U.S. was importing about 45 percent of its oil. After 1979, as conservation really kicked in, oil imports fell to 32 percent by 1985. Since then, imports have steadily crept up, topping 50 percent last year.
It is as though 1973-79 never happened, and for a lot of people it didn't. Robert Hormats, the Goldman Sachs international economics expert, told me that he was called the other day by a TV network to comment on the Saudi bombing, and when the young woman booking him for the show asked what he thought, he began talking about the potential for another oil shock. "Oh yeah," the young woman responded, "my mom told me there once were gasoline lines." Ancient history.
What's sad is that technological improvements in the oil industry over the last decade have greatly expanded non-OPEC and non-Middle Eastern oil production, creating a much greater opportunity for the U.S. and others to become less dependent on Persian Gulf crude -- if we were more conservation minded. One innovation, called three-dimensional seismic exploration, is like an M.R.I. scanner. It has given oil companies an M.R.I.-like look at the sub-surface of the earth, in a way that has allowed them to find pockets of oil in places they never could see into before. The other important innovation has been the ability to install offshore oil drilling equipment on floating platforms anchored with cables to the sea bottom, instead of putting the drills on huge, fixed steel towers that have to be built from the sea-bottom to the surface. The new system is cheaper, because it requires less steel, and also allows for easy drilling farther out to sea. That means more oil at lower costs.
It's these innovations that have kept oil prices stable, at between $15 and $20 a barrel, for the past decade, despite global demand that is growing at 2 percent per annum. But ultimately oil is a finite, dwindling resource, and with China becoming more oil-thirsty each year, sooner or later the market is going to get out of balance again. But instead of taking advantage of this current window of opportunity, by slowly intensifying conservation measures, we are instead locking ourselves back into excessive consumption patterns and wasteful infrastructure that will make us more, not less, dependent on Middle East oil by the year 2010.
Make no mistake, Saudi Arabia has been a loyal and important ally of the United States. We should not abandon it now just because a few fringe groups try to drive the U.S. out. But much of what evolves in Saudi Arabia over the next decade will be out of our control. What is in our control is to make ourselves less vulnerable to changes in that desert kingdom, which is far, far away, and about which we understand very, very little.

HEADLINE: The Dry Yields to the Droll, the Prosaic to the Provocative in College Offerings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
College-bound students flipping through their new course catalogues will come across offerings like "Great Hits of Medieval Literature" (Wesleyan University), "The Souls of Animals" (Bowdoin College), "Dinosaurs, Mass Extinction and Other Headlines From the History of Life" (Oberlin College), "Really Fantastic Fiction" (Princeton University) and "The Year My Voice Broke" (Sarah Lawrence College).
College course titles have come a long way since "Milton and His Time" and "The Life Cycle of Mollusks" were the rule. Many today sound as though they were dreamed up on Madison Avenue, and they have inspired no small amount of tomato throwing among academics. 
 Even the normally restrained Harvard Divinity School is livening up course descriptions. Among sober offerings like "Evil and Suffering in the West," the school's catalogue now lists "Sports as a Metaphor for Life" and "Television and Religion in American Society."
Small, private liberal arts colleges are the most adventurous (unhinged, some critics would say) in describing their offerings. For the most part, major universities still list straightforward, sometimes dreary-sounding course titles like "Money and Banking," "The History of Canada" and "Medieval Latin."
In today's private liberal arts catalogues, course titles may be imaginative, like "For Every Pharaoh There Is a Moses" (Amherst College), slangy, as in "Girl Talk" (Wesleyan University), and bombastic, like "Contemporary Hysteria: The Drama of Righteous Gullibility" (Bennington College).
The pharaoh-Moses course deals with the work of modern Islamic writers; "Girl Talk" focuses on Virginia Woolf and Oscar Wilde (yes, Oscar Wilde, who would not have found the characterization amusing), and the hysteria course argues the thesis that "the greatest period of hysteria and witch hunting in this country's history is happening now."
Some educators see such course titles as the natural result of a system that pressures professors to market themselves and their courses. Colleges rely on faculty members, not administrators, to name courses.
"The cutesy-fication of course titles is practiced most by departments afraid of losing students," said Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas who studies the academic profession. "If they lose too many students, their courses can be canceled."
Others say that teaching has been profoundly changed by the growth of knowledge and that course descriptions have changed in consequence.
"A course on the United States in the 1880's and 1890's frequently used to be called 'The Gilded Age,' " said Stanley Katz, the president of the American Council of Learned Societies. "But today if that course has been expanded to include popular culture, the role of women and so forth, the old title is misleading. Some of these new titles are just truth in advertising."
Another stimulus is the hotly controversial form of relativism known in academic circles as "pomo," or more formally post-modernism.
David Bernstein, a professor of history and art history at Sarah Lawrence who teaches a course titled "The Unity of the Arts/The Discord of the World," dealing with Renaissance Rome and with medieval France and Rome,explained the approach this way:
"We're now much happier with eclecticism, more tolerant of a variety of approaches, than we used to be. And so these course titles try to suggest unresolved tensions characteristic of post-modernist thought rather than simply to give the answers."
Those are fighting words to Gertrude Himmelfarb, the neoconservative writer and emeritus professor of history at the Graduate Center Program in History at the City University of New York.
"The use of irony and wordplay in these course titles," Miss Himmelfarb said, "is a post-modernist trick to suggest multiple meanings and complexity where in fact there is very little.
"All it does is confuse students as to what the content of the course may actually be. Many of these courses are completely vacuous. They're a terrible, terrible waste of time in a young person's life."
Also dubious about the trend is Mark Ryan, a specialist in the history of higher education in the United States who serves on a Yale University faculty committee that reviews new course proposals.
"We find ourselves putting some reins on course titles and descriptions in the interest of comprehensibility," Mr. Ryan said. "In addition, sometimes faculty who deal with their subject over a period of years begin to focus on a marginal aspect of it or take an idiosyncratic view of the material that is not helpful to students. Those impulses must be restrained."
W. B. Carnochan, a professor emeritus of the humanities at Stanford University and a student of college curriculums, said the new course titles were not objectionable and might borrow from fashionable television commercials that challenge viewers to decode them.
"You look at a Budweiser or Nike commercial and you have a hard time connecting what you see with the product," Mr. Carnochan said. "The object is to get you to think, and it would seem that scholars have borrowed that technique. It's not all bad."
Some course titles seem intended to lure students by being relevant and current. For example, the department of economics at Swarthmore College keeps students up-to-the-minute and then some with courses like "The United States Economy and Economic Thought: Roosevelt Through Clinton" and "Economics of the 21st Century."
Nor have professors been oblivious to the power of sex. At Wesleyan, students can sign up for an English course called "History of Sex," which delves into "the history and representation of sex in Europe and North America." Also at Wesleyan, the department of Asian languages offers "Love and Sex in Japanese Literature."
Bowdoin offers "Representations of Sex and Sexuality in Spanish Novels and Films," which might be even more attractive were it not conducted only in Spanish.
Skidmore College puts a literary spin on the subject with "Self and Desire: A Study of Don Juan." Swarthmore's English department offers "Renaissance Sexualities," which explores "the homoerotic, chastity and friendship, marriage, adultery and incest."
Not to be left out, Swarthmore's history department has come up with "Sex, Sin and Kin in Early Europe." Duke University's department of anthropology takes the long view with "Sexuality in Global Perspective."
The new currency of the word "queer" is reflected in many catalogues, like "Queer Texts and Contexts," at Swarthmore's English department, and "Thinking Queer," at Bowdoin's.
Some colleges and universities seem fixated on certain locutions. Washington and Lee University seems intent on turning out cadres of generalists with courses like "General Biology," "General Botany," and "General Chemistry."
Smith College is similarly basic, with "Introduction to Psychology," "Introduction to Biology," "Introduction to Astronomy," "Introduction to Sociology" and "Introduction to History."
Only Smith's physics department seems to have broken the mold, offering an introductory course called "Principles of Physics: Seven Ideas That Shook the Universe."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Some say the unusual course titles are a matter of marketing; others say they reflect the growth of knowledge.

CNN, New York City's development office and Microsoft keep Madison Avenue booming.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ALONG Madison Avenue, the second half of 1996 is beginning the way the first half ended: with a strong and steady stream of account news.
The accounts being assigned include those of Cable News Network, which has hired an outside agency for the first time in many years. And New York City's Economic Development Corporation has hired an agency based outside the city to handle a campaign to -- yes -- sell the city. 
 There was also a reassignment involving the American account of business products marketed by the Microsoft Corporation.
CNN, the 24-hour cable television news network owned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc., named Deutsch Inc. in New York to handle its account. Billings were estimated at $20 million. Though the network has from time to time used outside agencies like Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, its account has most recently been handled in-house.
The hiring of Deutsch, which is known for irreverent campaigns for consumer products like Tanqueray gin and Mistic beverages, comes as CNN faces intensifying competition. The NBC unit of the General Electric Company is teaming up with Microsoft to start the MSNBC network on July 15. And the News Corporation plans to introduce a Fox cable news channel in the fall.
But Mark Harrad, a spokesman for Turner Broadcasting in New York, said the decision to hire Deutsch was unrelated to the increasingly crowded TV dial. "A review process is a normal one for Turner," he said, adding, "We periodically review our accounts."
The decision came after a monthlong review, Mr. Harrad said, that had been narrowed to Deutsch and two other finalists, both based in New York and owned by the Omnicom Group: DDB Needham and Merkley Newman Harty.
The economic development account, with billings of $10 million to $12 million, represents the first campaign planned by the department. The effort involves advertising and public relations promoting tourism as well as recruiting businesses to move into the city's five boroughs.
The decision to hire an agency not based in New York -- the Martin Agency in Richmond -- was clearly a sensitive one. The first two paragraphs of the news release that announced the decision yesterday mentioned Martin's office in Manhattan (at 500 Fifth Avenue). It also noted that Martin is an affiliate of the Lowe Group -- owner of Lowe & Partners/ SMS in New York -- which is in turn owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, "headquartered in New York City."
Joe Slay, president of Martin Public Relations and a member of the executive committee of the Martin Agency, said: "Location was less an issue than whether an agency could give the assignment the kind of thinking the Economic Development Corporation wanted. One thing they noticed about us was our work for the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Tourism."
That reference was to the familiar campaign, carrying the theme "Virginia is for lovers," that Martin created in 1969.
The development unit has initially hired Martin for 60 days, Mr. Slay said, to "develop the communications strategy and the plan" for the campaign. While the agency's work is just beginning, he added, one fact is clear: unlike Virginia, "New York City doesn't need more fame."
When Martin completes its initial assignment, in about three months, city officials will decide whether to proceed with the campaign.
Martin was chosen after a review that began in mid-February, which included 10 teams of advertising and public relations agencies. The finalists in addition to Martin were Grey Advertising and its public relations unit, the GCI Group, both based in New York, and four units of BDDP Worldwide that are all based in New York: Moss/Dragoti, Wells Rich Greene BDDP, Bastoni Barnes and Byer & McGuggart.
As for the Microsoft reassignment, those duties are leaving Anderson & Lembke in San Francisco for Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The products involved are the Microsoft Windows NT operating system and desktop application products like Microsoft Office. They represent the first pure Microsoft business accounts for Wieden & Kennedy, which handles the worldwide consumer brand assignment. Billings were not disclosed.
Greg Perlot, director for advertising and corporate research at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., confirmed a report of the change yesterday in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age. "We move assignments between the two agencies from time to time," he said, adding that a reason for the change was "the recent performance of Wieden & Kennedy."
The Microsoft reassignment came a day after the company selected Cohn & Wells in San Francisco to handle its business-to-business direct marketing account, which had been handled on a project basis by Anderson & Lembke. Those billings were estimated at $10 million.
Anderson & Lembke, owned by Interpublic, continues to handle Microsoft assignments like games products and on-line media buying. The agency has been striving to shore up its hold on the prestigious account, with billings that had totaled more than $70 million.
For instance, Steve Trygg, 48, chairman and chief creative officer at the Anderson Lembke Group, which oversees the Amsterdam, New York and San Francisco offices, has relocated from New York to San Francisco to assume the additional duties of chief creative officer and creative director on the Microsoft account. Those roles had been handled by Jeremy Clarke, who left.

HEADLINE: Long Bond Hit by Strong Home Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday, as traders were surprised by data indicating strong home sales even as the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm began the first of a two-day meeting to determine monetary policy for the months ahead.
The report yesterday, by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, of much stronger-than-expected new-home sales for May threw market expectations into uncertainty; as recently as Monday, traders felt sure the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates at this week's meeting. 
 Analysts now reason that because of the strength in some of the most recent economic statistics, the Fed may not be able to hold off an interest-rate increase much longer, and may instead choose to rein in an economy that some anticipate could cause inflation to accelerate.
Since such inflationary pressures erode the value of fixed-income investments, the market reacted negatively. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed down 9/32, to a price of 88 10/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.93 percent, from 6.91 percent on Monday.
Barring any further surprises, most people expect the market to remain near current levels until Friday, when the June employment report will be released in a holiday-shortened session.
"Last month it was a huge upward revision to new-home sales that stunned the fixed-income market," said Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston. "This month there were only small revisions, but the May figure was up 7.5 percent versus the Street's consensus expectation of a 4.0 percent drop. Not only did this put the seasonally adjusted number of new homes sold at a new high for the current cycle, but this is the highest reading in more than 10 years."
Other reports released yesterday included the Conference Board's index of leading indicators, which rose three-tenths of 1 percent in May, while weekly retail sales data from the Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi Schroder Wertheim was down two-tenths of 1 percent and the Johnson Redbook Service dropped 1.6 percent. These figures all followed Monday's report that the National Association of Purchasing Management's index jumped to 54.3 in June from 49.3 in May. An index of more than 50 suggests economic expansion.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that it was clear the economy was likely to moderate in the second half of the year from its current pace, "particularly in light of recently released statistics such as durable-goods orders, consumption, the N.A.P.M. survey and this morning's torrid pace of new home sales."
"The crucial issue, however, is to what extent will the economy slow down," Mr. Fine continued. "At the moment, there is virtually nothing to suggest that any impending slowdown is going to totally eliminate the potential for a pickup in inflation as the year progresses."
Mr. Fine believes that should the Fed's Open Market Committee choose to do so, "there is certainly enough data to justify a tightening" of interest rates." But, he added, "there have been many reports in the media quoting unnamed sources inside the Fed saying the F.O.M.C. is unlikely to pull the trigger, preferring instead to wait for more data."
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, a market and research analysis firm in San Francisco, said that after the release of the strong home sales data, the market remained jittery throughout the day. The data, she said, had moved the market to rethink its position about a Fed increase.
Today the Treasury will announce the terms of a new addition to its schedule of offerings, an auction of 10-year Treasury notes on July 9. It plans to increase the frequency of the 10-year notes to six times a year.
Among the data expected today is the weekly unemployment claims, which some analysts expect will total 355,000, unchanged for the final week of June. Also, the factory-orders report for May is expected to show a 2 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Single-Sex Schools and Double Standards

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen; Jeffrey Rosen is the legal affairs editor for The New Republic.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Under the constitutional principles announced and applied today, single-sex public education is unconstitutional," Justice Antonin Scalia lamented in his bitter, lonely dissent from the Supreme Court's decision last week ordering the Virginia Military Institute to admit women. Justice Scalia went on to protest that government support of private single-sex colleges, including tax exemptions for schools like Smith and Mount Holyoke, was now at risk as well.
Are Justice Scalia's fears overblown? Alas, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's landmark opinion is opaque on these crucial questions. Her decision, in fact, can be read in several ways, and not all of the interpretations are easy to reconcile with the vision of equal-treatment feminism that she championed as the Thurgood Marshall of the women's movement in the 1970's. 
 In the central passages of her opinion, Justice Ginsburg declared that generalizations about men and women can't justify "denying opportunities to those whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description."
Just as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor held in 1982 that Mississippi could not support a nursing school for women alone, because the state would be perpetuating the stereotype that only girls should grow up to be nurses, so Justice Ginsburg held that Virginia cannot sponsor a military academy for men alone, because it would be perpetuating the stereotype that only boys should grow up to be soldiers.
But stereotypes are often in the eye of the beholder. V.M.I.'s opponents characterized the institution as a hothouse of the patriarchy, while the academy plausibly perceived itself as a romantically egalitarian 19th-century boarding school.
In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot provide textbooks or other indirect subsidies to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race. The question now is whether private schools, colleges and universities that discriminate on the basis of sex are vulnerable as well. Can we imagine any publicly financed single-sex program that might pass constitutional muster?
In an amicus brief, 26 women's colleges argued that they served an important social function, and Justice Ginsburg quoted their argument in her decision: "It is the mission of some single-sex schools 'to dissipate, rather than perpetuate, traditional gender classifications.' We do not question the State's prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities." What, exactly, does this passage mean?
Read literally, it might suggest that a state could maintain an academy for male nurses or for female soldiers, but not vice versa. Sex-segregated classes and athletic teams might be constitutionally permissible, but only if they challenged traditional sex roles. Home economics classes for boys or shop classes for girls might be permitted, but all-male wrestling teams and all-female ballet classes might not.
This seems like an idiosyncratic vision of equal protection, one that Justice Ginsburg had argued eloquently against. As a lawyer in the 1970's, she declared that men and women should be free to conform to traditional sex roles as well as to subvert them.
Read broadly, the suggestion that single-sex schools are permissible only when they "dissipate, rather than perpetuate" traditional sex roles is even more troubling.
Several groups that filed briefs in the V.M.I. case, including the Clinton Administration, suggested that public and private single-sex education might be permissible for women, but not for men. Citing Justice O'Connor's language in the 1982 nursing school case, they argued that single-sex programs for women, but not men, might serve a kind of "compensatory purpose," helping women overcome the effects of past discrimination in fields from which they have historically been excluded.
The notion that women, but not men, should reap the benefits of single-sex education is distressing on several levels. It reinforces precisely the same paternalistic stereotypes -- women need special treatment and protection -- that Justice Ginsburg resisted in the 1970's.
Moreover, some amicus briefs on behalf of women's colleges in the V.M.I. case relied on the handful of opinions that Justice Ginsburg had lost before the Supreme Court. In 1974, for example, the Court rejected her argument that a purportedly "benign" preference for women, granting widows, but not widowers, a $500 tax exemption, denied men equal protection.
In her V.M.I. opinion, Justice Ginsburg doesn't explicitly endorse the position of her former adversaries in the special-treatment camp. By emphasizing that she doesn't mean to question "the State's prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities," perhaps Justice Ginsburg has something far less controversial in mind.
Perhaps she simply means to suggest that Virginia's mistake was its decision to set up a transparently unequal military academy for women at Mary Baldwin College, a "pale shadow of V.M.I.," as Justice Ginsburg put it. If Virginia had instead created an equally rigorous and respected military academy for women -- and a third coed academy as well -- perhaps she would have approved of an all-male V.M.I. as one option in a diverse menu.
But her opinion was vague on this critical point. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a separate concurring opinion, cautioned that the inevitable consequence of Justice Ginsburg's logic was to require universal coeducation rather than to permit separate but equal single-sex schools.
All of these concerns may be exaggerated. After all, by holding that distinctions based on sex are almost as (but not quite as) constitutionally suspicious as distinctions based on race, Justice Ginsburg's opinion may make it harder for the state and Federal governments to engage in affirmative action and other preferential treatment for women.
This prospect would have made the Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the 1970's proud. Two decades ago, she opposed affirmative action for women in law schools, arguing that since women scored better than men on the Law School Admission Test, all they needed to succeed was "a clear posting of the welcome sign." But if Justice Ginsburg remains committed to her inspiring equal-treatment vision, she could have reaffirmed it more distinctly. At this anxious moment in the gender wars, it's more urgently needed than ever.

From Stark Cityscapes, Dreamscapes Develop

BYLINE: By DAVID GOLZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE monuments of East Harlem are graced with the names of politicians -- Washington, Jefferson and Wagner wrought in drab brick. They commemorate an era when this thicket of housing projects was the ultimate in urban renewal.
Things change, leaving the state of the art in a state of disrepair. Mario Hyman could have told the planners that real renewal takes vision. The junior high school student says he thinks his neighborhood needs a more enlightened monument. 
 So he brought the Buddha to El Barrio.
The path to Nirvana is in Central Park, where Mario drew the Buddha in serene repose among the trees. It's a respite from the blocks to the east, where people already know the Buddhist tenet that to live is to suffer. Mario looks at it differently: to live is to give.
He is among nine students sharing their takes on the neighborhood in an exhibit sponsored by the International Center of Photography and El Museo del Barrio, where "Re-visions of El Barrio" is on display through Aug. 18. In their artwork, they mix photography with drawing, embellishing photos of scenes from the East River to Central Park with images from the peaceful to the fanciful.
A subway kiosk emerges from the rocks of Central Park. Hovercraft cars zip into a fast-food restaurant. Empty lots give way to playgrounds and new houses. A drab housing project becomes a tender memorial to a friend. Faded and flaked murals spring to colorful life.
"Anything can be beautiful," said Matthew Martinez. "If you hook it up. If you renovate it."
Matthew's masterpiece wasn't exactly bucolic. He made the Harlem Meer the centerpiece of a prison where an apartment complex becomes an aerie for guards who watch convicts working inside an urban gold mine.
"They're going to run out of prisons, so why not make one in Central Park?" he said. "There are men beating up women now. They could have a better watch over people with snipers in the towers. In the future Pataki and Giuliani are going to join forces and they're going to get greedy and order the prison people to start digging for gold."
The only people in Brandi Burrus's pictures are the figures she drew in her photos. In her other work, she prefers trees.
"They're real," she said. "People are not. There's something fake about them. When you try to take a picture of somebody they have to pose in a certain way. Trees can't do that."
David Spear, an instructor with the photography center, said the project made the youths slow down and consider their surroundings. He showed them pictures of the neighborhood's past and asked them about how they would use the spaces many of them take for granted.
"They put into the final pieces the things they can't elaborate in language," Mr. Spear said. "It's hard to talk about the specifics, but the image is clear. Some come to it in an emotional way."
Erica Cintron gazed silently at the picture she had made, where the faces of some friends peer out past a rainbow that arches over a baseball field. She had been walking along First Avenue when she stopped to click off a few frames of the barren field.
"I guess it needed life," she said. "I was thinking about people I know who died. I added their faces to the building in the back. The picture still looked sad, so I put in a rainbow and some trees to make it look happy."
Erica looked anything but as she thought about the almond-eyed girl under the rainbow.
"She was a best friend," she said, before lapsing into silence. "Her name was Susan."
Nothing lasts, which is something the youths considered when they started their picture-taking. They looked at an exhibit by Leandro Katz, who photographed Mayan ruins, and the work of urban documentary photographers like Bruce Davidson, who produced a remarkable portfolio of East Harlem in the 1960's. They were amazed to see how so much of their recent past had vanished.
"The building I'm in now wasn't in the book," said Stephanie Estrada. "Back then there was a tenement building with only four floors and it looked totally empty. My building was built in 1989. I hope it stays intact and doesn't fall."
Her own photo took a park scene and made it into a red-roofed country hideaway. It's only a fantasy, since she thinks not much will be left in the future to attract archeologists, or anyone else in search of ruins.
"Nothing here is old because it changes over and over again," Brandi said. "Nothing stays the same. Nothing can last. The only thing I hope they keep is Central Park. That's the only thing that hasn't changed."
Save a tree for the Buddha.

HEADLINE: Soweto Journal;
Dreamer With a Bookstore Wakes to Fiscal Facts

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: SOWETO, South Africa, June 26

 BODY:
Soweto's first bookstore is now one year old. It is still the only bookstore in this immense black township. That probably won't be true for long.
If its owner, Solomon Sikakane, is right, there may be three in local townships soon. If his wife, Edith, is right, soon there will be none. 
 Mr. Sikakane, a retired school administrator, says that his Imfundo Thuto bookstore in the new Dobsonville Mall here is a labor of love. "I'm not looking at this on a profit basis," he said at the opening last year. "I'm looking at it as the social upliftment of my people."
Still, a book lover has to eat. The Sikakanes are barely able to pay the $450 monthly rent on the store.
The small store has few shelves, and a lot of air between the books. Many are simply samples of what can be ordered. Even the impulse buys -- the daily papers -- are in very short stacks. The store has a handsome display stand for Nelson Mandela's autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," but no copies.
"Even today, someone will ask for it -- Mandela, Mandela, Mandela," said Mrs. Sikakane from behind the counter one recent morning. "But we have no capital, and the publisher will not give them in advance."
Mr. Sikakane has great dreams. Developers planning the first malls in nearby Kagiso and Tembisa townships have asked about franchising the name Imfundo Thuto, which means Education, Education in Nguni and Sotho, the country's two African language groups. A New York office supply company is talking about a partnership printing school stationery -- if he can find interested schools and build a printing plant. A Denver bookstore owner wants to distribute books about black Americans through him -- if he can build a customer base.
But all these things take capital, which Mr. Sikakane, like many would-be businessmen in South Africa's black townships, does not have. He lacks the retail experience to qualify for bank loans. He is applying for small-business grants from the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development, but grant-writing is a skill that is foreign to him, so he has an American friend helping him with that.
Suddenly, the police are at the door. Mr. Sikakane brightens at the sight of one of his best customers, Tiro Matshoe, a trainee patrolman with the Soweto Traffic Department. His request almost too perfectly illustrates the store's predicament.
Officer Matshoe wants the complete works of William Shakespeare. "To expand my knowledge," he explains. "I meet members of the public, and I want to be able to quote from Shakespeare. Because I think of being a leader someday."
Virtually any other South African bookstore would have the book, which costs about $15 wholesale. Mr. Sikakane does not, and it is a mark of Officer Matshoe's loyalty that he is willing to wait a week for the order.
He is followed by Gugu Ngema, who heads adult education at Funda Community College here. As part of his desire to "build a culture of learning" in Soweto, Mr. Ngema wants to order his textbooks through Mr. Sikakane's store instead of sending students to stores "that really cater for the needs of white people." But, he said, he faces resistance from a surprising source.
"A lot of my colleagues are still worried about whether you can get quality service from a fellow African," Mr. Ngema said. "I have to use my powers to convince them -- and to be ready to fight."
When he started a year ago, Mr. Sikakane had no retailing experience. He met his former partner, a white housewife named Barbara Malk, through a group trying to start a library in Soweto, where 80 percent of adults read below seventh-grade level. In February, Mrs. Malk remarried and moved to Cape Town, withdrawing from the partnership.
Imfundo Thuto is in the first real shopping mall in this virtually all-black city, which may be home to as many as four million people. Under apartheid laws, blacks were mot allowed to own businesses, though there were spazzas -- informal living-room stores. Even now, black enterprise is in its infancy: several of the mall's shops are Indian-owned, and the larger ones are chain stores. Fortunately for Mr. Sikakane, neither of the country's two large bookstore chains has yet taken a chance on the malls slowly springing up in black townships.
Although the store just had its first birthday, Mr. Sikakane is delaying the celebration until October because that is when Clara Villarosa, the owner of the Hue-Man Experience African-American Bookstore in Denver, Colo., is supposed to arrive. She has promised to ship him hundreds of used children's books, which will be collected by African-American bookstores in the States from their customers. Mr. Sikakane wants to give them to children here.
Ms. Villarosa met Mr. Sikakane last year on a trade mission by black American entrepreneurs. She came hoping to sell new books. Now she is collecting used ones to give away.
"Everybody else found business opportunities," she said. "I found a philanthropic mission. You do what you have to do. I like that old man."

HEADLINE: Military Police Will Replace 1,200 Combat G.I.'s in Bosnia

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: TASZAR, Hungary, July 2

 BODY:
About 1,200 American troops and their tanks will be removed from Bosnia by late this month and replaced by members of the military police sent to provide security during national elections there, the Defense Department announced here today.
The move would be the first major troop rotation since American peacekeepers arrived in Bosnia last year, and it carries some degree of risk, since the military police have nothing like the firepower of the armored units they will replace. 
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, meeting today at an air base here with American military commanders involved in the peacekeeping operation, said the "mission that required the armored units has been quite successful -- we don't need them any longer."
"It's easy to forget now that when our forces came in here," he said, "many people predicted that we would be forced to fight a war, meet armed resistance, and we brought in a force sufficiently strong to meet that contingency. Fortunately that contingency never developed, and we're now restructuring our forces appropriately."
British, French and other Western troops in the 60,000-member American-led peacekeeping force are expected to make similar rotations, sending home many of their tanks and other heavy weapons.
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said that the military police would be sent to Bosnia from Fort Hood, Tex.; Fort Polk, La.; Fort Stewart, Ga., and Fort Bragg, N.C. He said they would be more useful than armored units in preparing for elections scheduled for September and for the resettlement of refugees. The military police are expected to provide security for election workers during the balloting.
"The M.P.'s are a lighter, more nimble force," he said.
He said it was not immediately clear how many tanks would be removed from Bosnia, although he said there would be more than enough tanks and other armored vehicles to protect American forces.
The military police usually travel in Jeep-like utility vehicles known as Humvees, and they protect themselves with machine guns mounted on the roofs of the vehicles.
Gen. George A. Joulwan, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, told reporters here that the United States would have to wait until after the elections to decide when to begin major reductions in the size of the American peacekeeping force, which is scheduled to pull out of Bosnia by early next year.
Although Defense Department officials are leery of discussing the issue publicly, it has become increasingly clear that NATO will retain some sort of peacekeeping force in Bosnia next year, and that American ground troops will be part of it.
NATO's efforts to rebuild Bosnia's war-shattered economy and heal divisions among its ethnic groups have largely failed, and Pentagon officials say that if the peacekeeping force pulls out entirely next year, Bosnia will almost certainly dissolve into civil war again.

HEADLINE: Communists In Mongolia Are Toppled After 70 Years

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 2

 BODY:
Breaking the Communists' hold on power in Mongolia after more than 70 years, the primary opposition coalition captured 50 of 76 seats in the single-chamber Parliament, official election results released today confirmed.
"Mongolia is strongly standing on the path of democracy," said Enkhsaikhan, the coalition's general secretary, at campaign headquarters here, packed with beaming volunteers, officials and members-to-be of Parliament. 
 Nomadic livestock herders and city dwellers across this vast and isolated northern Asian country voted for the Democratic Union Coalition in elections on Sunday, handing it a stunning upset over the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.
On one level, the election result was a resounding vote for democratic reform in a country long dominated by a single party. Though mass demonstrations ended 70 years of Communist rule in 1990, the Communists swept 70 of 76 seats in 1992.
The Communists, initially confident of victory going into Sunday's race, won 25 seats in the Great Khural, as the Parliament is known, and one seat went to the Mongolian Traditional Conservative party.
"I think it means that Mongolia will be seen by the international community to have successfully embraced democracy," said James A. Baker, a former Secretary of State and co-chairman of a team of United States election observers who called the elections "free and fair."
"It is the Mongolian people who have made their democracy and showed on June 30 that they are determined to make it work."
But leaders of the Democratic Union Coalition, which includes the National Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party and two smaller parties, tempered their post-election high spirits with the realization that they will inherit the same problems that toppled the former governing party.
"People voted more against the M.P.R.P. than for the coalition," said Tuya, a member of the National Democratic Party, referring to the Communists. "People want change. The most important thing now is for the coalition to live up to these expectations."
It will not be easy. The economic tailspin that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, bringing the loss of special trade arrangements and Soviet subsidies, has stabilized, but deep-seated problems remain.
Mid-level government jobs pay only $20 to $30 per month, while prices under an increasingly free-market system have skyrocketed. Real unemployment stands around 15 percent; educational and medical systems are in disarray, and inflation continues at levels as high as 50 percent.
"The people are suffering from poverty," said Narangerel, a Democratic Coalition candidate who won her race to represent one of Ulan Bator's poorest districts, an expanse of rundown yurts near the city's sprawling black market. "They need changes. That's why even old people, old members of the M.P.R.P., want changes. Life can't continue like this." Like many Mongolians, she uses one name.
The elderly, who have been hard hit by recent economic problems, may have played a key role in the democratic victory. Pensioners, who number some 220,000 of a total population of 2.3 million, collect 5,000 to 7,000 togrogs a month, the equivalent of $10 to $12, no match for the ever-increasing cost of living.
"These 220,000 people four years ago voted for the M.P.R.P., but now they switched to the opposition," said Erdenebaatar, editor in chief of the weekly Blue Spot, one of Mongolia's few independent newspapers. "During the last few years the pensioners have protested and struck and called on the Government to take action, but the Government has been silent."
Its silence in the face of an 18-month strike by secondary-school teachers last year, and persistent rumors of financial scandals, also were noted as factors contributing to the Government's downfall. For the last two days, the Communists have also been silent about the election results, refusing to speak to reporters.
Under Mongolia's election law, the new Government will officially take office when a new session of Parliament is called by President Ochirbat, himself a Communist-turned-independent who generally has supported democratic reforms. It is expected that he will not convene the new Pparliament until late this month.
But in the meantime, Democratic Union Coalition members plan to begin working to carry out their platform immediately, including reducing taxes and bureaucracy, privatizing housing, and bridging the growing gaps in income and education levels.
"Tomorrow will begin very hard work," said Zorig, a Democratic Coalition candidate who won his race in Ulan Bator. "The main thing is overcoming the legacy of the ruling party."

HEADLINE: Surprise Surge in Home Sales: Leap of 7.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Confounding analysts, builders sold new houses in May at the fastest pace in more than 10 years as buyers appeared remarkably indifferent to rising interest rates, Government figures showed today.
Word of the surprising 7.5 percent monthly advance came a few hours before the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee began a two-day policy meeting that analysts had already believed would involve a close call as to whether to raise short-term interest rates. 
 The fear is that overly rapid economic growth, probably at a pace of 4 percent or more for the quarter that just ended, will accelerate inflation.
Securities markets, suspecting that prospects for tighter credit had increased, slumped on the housing report after having shown little reaction earlier in the morning when the Conference Board reported that its index of predictive indicators posted its fourth straight advance in May after falling four months out of five from September through January.
Bond prices ended the day lower, as the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 6.93 percent, from 6.91 percent on Monday. Stocks recovered much of their early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 9.60 points at 5,720.38.
The housing figures, which the consensus of economists had expected to show a decline after April's hefty gain, baffled almost everyone, especially the industry's closest students, who had been hearing downbeat assessments from builders and who were impressed by recent statistics showing declines in groundbreaking and permits for new homes.
"I'd like to believe the market's that good, but the numbers don't square at all," said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
He said he had supplied Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, with a private survey of leading builders in which "they were all talking about a distinct slowdown." And cancellations of existing contracts were up, he added.
Indeed, the 828,000 annual pace of sales reported jointly today by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development, was entirely concentrated in the South and Midwest, with sales actually edging down in the Northeast and the West. The figures include an estimate of sales that take place before permits to build are issued.
The Clinton Administration hailed the report. In an interview, Henry G. Cisneros, H.U.D. Secretary, said the homes sales implied "deep confidence" among consumers that their "investment is going to pay off."
But many economists were less skeptical about the sales pace, which was the most rapid since 1986, when the nation was gripped by a near frenzy of home buying at a time when it was not yet clear that inflation had been reduced from shoe-size numbers to those less than hat size.
"The fact that screamed to me is that there is no region of the country where sales are less than 15 percent above where they were last year" at this time, said Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist for Technical Data, a Boston financial advisory firm.
For May, the monthly advance in home sales was 10.2 percent, to a rate of 379,000, in the South and 21.2 percent, to 154,000, in the Midwest. Declines in the Northeast and West were less than 2 percent, though activity in the Northeast was less than half that of any other area.
May's sales were mainly in lower-cost parts of the country, and the price of the median new home eased to $135,000, from $139,900 in April, the report showed.
At the end of the month, there was a seasonally adjusted inventory of 360,000 unsold homes, or enough to last 5.2 months at the latest sales pace, the Government also reported.
The Conference Board's index of leading, or predictive, indicators climbed three-tenths of 1 percent in May, the same as in April and in line with what economists anticipated.
Seven of the 11 components increased, the largest positive contributions made by a rise in the price of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle, a lengthening of the average workweek, higher contracts and orders for plant and equipment and a climb in stock prices as gauged by the Standard & Poor's 500.
The main negative forces were a decline in the M-2 money supply and lower expectations by consumers.
The research group also reported that its indexes of coincident and lagging indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent and four-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, in May, further signs of expansion.


GRAPHIC: New-home sales tend to rise when interest rates fall. In late 1993, when rates where flat, the Federal Reserve saw the surge in new-home sales as one sign that the economy was overheating. It began to raise rates in early 1994. In May, new-home sales rose to 828,000, the highest annual rate in 10 years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKINGS;
Dollar Tops 110 Yen on Signs Japanese Won't Raise Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose above 110 yen for the first time in 29 months yesterday, as concern faded that the Bank of Japan would soon raise interest rates.
"The overriding thing that's really driving the currency is the consistent insistence from the Japanese that any further rate hikes are further down the road," said Ricardo Gomes, foreign exchange chief at the Republic National Bank of New York. 
 Japanese officials have said repeatedly in recent months that rates will be kept low to make sure the economy recovers from its four-year slump. On Monday, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said that the central bank would maintain its monetary policy.
"They have pretty much quelled speculation that they will raise rates," said Paul Park, currency trader at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "That certainly is lending support to the dollar."
Higher rates in Japan would raise returns on some investments there, making the yen more attractive.
Indeed, Japan's low interest rates have spurred investors to move their money to other countries, like the United States and Australia, where bond yields and returns on bank deposits are higher.
The dollar also gained as policy makers at the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on United States interest-rate policy yesterday and as currency traders braced for today's election in Russia.
After jumping as high as 110.40 yen, its highest level since Jan. 26, 1994, the dollar settled in New York at 110.35 yen, up from 109.55 yen on Monday. The dollar also rose to 1.5266 German marks from 1.5234 and to 1.2512 Swiss francs from 1.2499. The British pound rose to $1.5575 from $1.5570.
The dollar and the Swiss franc also benefited as safe-haven currencies at the expense of the mark yesterday amid speculation over President Boris N. Yeltsin's health on the eve of today's election in Russia.
The German mark often suffers from turmoil in Russia because of the close economic ties between the nations. Germany is Russia's largest trading partner and biggest creditor.
"That's been hanging over the market," Mr. Gomes at Republic National Bank said.

HEADLINE: Stretching a Fourth of July Holiday Into a Five-Day Weekend

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Neil Bender finished all of this week's business meetings early yesterday morning. Then he went home to the West Village, put on khaki shorts and sunglasses, stuffed his computer in a briefcase and headed off to the Hamptons. His wife, Marika Marko, had ended her work week even earlier, on Monday evening. They were on the jitney by 1 P.M.
Mr. Bender, the president of an interactive multimedia business, said he would telecommute from Sag Harbor if necessary and that a co-worker could do the same from the Jersey Shore. 
 As the couple stood waiting for the bus on East 41st Street, Ms. Marko, a sales executive with a corporate travel agency, said: "There was absolutely no need to stay in. Wednesday is going to be a very slow day. People will start taking off at noon."
The calendar may have said July 2 yesterday but across the New York metropolitan area, the Fourth of July holiday was already getting under way.
In the capital of gimme-a-break, where vacation days are a currency as real as dollars and yen, this is a week when two plus two equals five. With the Fourth falling on a Thursday, the city's worn and weary quickly calculated that taking Wednesday and Friday off meant a vacation as long as a work week. By yesterday afternoon, many were already on their way.
"You take two days and you get five," said a woman who like many others was too bashful about the early escape to give her name. She said she and her husband, an investment banker, had taken the rest of the week off and were planning to attend several benefits on Long Island.
A 35-year-old orthopedist in midtown, also shy about his short week, said he had packed in his patients to clear the way for a week of partying.
"I just crunched everybody into the mornings," he said. "I took the rest of the day off. I took tomorrow off. I took Friday off and possibly Monday."
The vacation migration actually began late last week. Traffic leaving the city has created a series of frustrating afternoon rush hours that seem to start earlier and earlier each day and are not expected to let up until Thursday, said Bob Williams, a spokesman for Shadow Traffic, which broadcasts reports of metropolitan area road conditions.
"Traditionally, the week of the Fourth of July is a very popular time for vacations, and with the Fourth of July falling on a Thursday this year, the traffic flow has been anything but ordinary," Mr. Williams said. "With many people leaving as early as last Thursday and Friday and headed to the island or to wherever they are going, we have had some very heavy rush hours."
For some, the city's downshift to holiday speed was a welcome break. On Monday, Jeaneen Belle answered more than 100 telephone calls at her job as a receptionist at a midtown employment agency. She said she answered 30 calls yesterday and expected next to none today.
"Monday was very hectic and then all of a sudden it got quiet," she said.
Of course not everyone could afford to head for the beach, and for some of those left behind the slowdown was frustrating.
Mamdul Ramadan sells bagels and doughnuts from a cart at the corner of Avenue of the Americas and 46th Street, and by midday he usually has fewer than 10 items left. At 12:30 P.M. yesterday he still had dozens of doughnuts and crullers, rolls and muffins left over. "You see there is a lot of stuff," he said. "It has been very slow."
As everyday commuters made for weekend getaways, yellow cabs were left in long lines at taxi stands across the city and car service drivers waited -- some for hours at a stretch -- for radio calls that mostly did not come.
"We had like 30 percent business today out of the usual," said a dispatcher with Galil Car and Limo Service on the East Side.
Amtrak has been adding extra cars all week to its trains on northeast corridor routes to accommodate the large number of holiday travelers. Four extra trains will be added to Amtrak's Northeast Direct service between Boston and Washington on Wednesday and two extra trains on Sunday. The Hampton jitney has also added extra buses.
For some escapees, vacationing seems a skill that needs practice. Kevin J. Leichter, 35, a lawyer from Los Angeles, was on his way to visit his mother in Westhampton with his wife, Tamara, and 2-year-old daughter, Anna.
In addition to Anna, a stroller and a carseat, the Leichters were lugging four suitcases, two packed with documents relating to a rights case that Mr. Leichter is litigating.
"I have already sent four faxes today," Mr. Leichter said, opening one case to pull out his business card. "So I'm not really sure it's a day off."
The fortuitous falling of the Fourth was not enough to guarantee everyone a long holiday. Some needed luck. "My brother runs my department," admitted Chris Coleman, 22, explaining how he got two extra days away from his job with a securities firm. "I'm going today to Montauk, to get in some early surfing before the crowd comes out."
Beverly Ianucci, who works in the temp department of a Fifth Avenue employment agency, also had the benefit of a kind supervisor. "I was going to have to work for part of the day on Friday," she said. "But my boss is going to play golf, so he felt bad making me come in."
"Companies are silly if they want to bring their employees in on Friday, unless it's something major to the world economy," she said. "It's not our fault the Fourth falls on a Thursday."

HEADLINE: G.M. June Sales Fell 1.2% As Strike Reduced Inventory

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 2

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales slipped 1.2 percent in June from their levels a year earlier as consumer confidence weakened and auto dealers ran short of some models.
Wall Street analysts said it was unclear whether G.M.'s lackluster sales results pointed to a broad slowing of the industry, but added that the results were consistent with an economy that seems to have cooled slightly in June from its torrid pace in April and May. A number of Japanese and European auto makers reported mixed sales results today, while the Chrysler Corporation said on Monday that its sales rose 1 percent from a strong showing in June 1995. 
 General Motors sold 270,322 cars and 171,384 pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles in June. But the strength of G.M.'s sales is particularly hard to gauge because the company drew down its inventories during a 17-day strike in March, only to face unexpectedly brisk sales in April and May. While many G.M. factory workers have been putting in a lot of overtime to catch up, dealers remain short of popular models.
A General Motors spokesman, Dean Rotondo, said the strike was still hurting sales, partly because the company deferred new car shipments to fleets and still had not caught up with the backlog. "I wouldn't say we're 100 percent recovered," he said.
Dealers that had plenty of cars and trucks on their lots when the strike hit said they found themselves with too few starting in late May. Michael R. Cook, a Buick and Mazda dealer in Arlington Heights, Ill., said, "The strike didn't hurt us during the strike, and now it is starting to catch up."
He has run short of his best seller, the Buick Le Sabre. "What the people want, we don't have," he said.
Sales should return to normal by mid-July when the factories are expected to have caught up with demand, he added. G.M. needs to catch up quickly before it begins shutting factories to retool for 1997 models.
Other auto makers reporting sales today posted mixed results. Nissan sales slipped 10.5 percent, Mazda sales slumped 27.1 percent and Mitsubishi sales fell 12.6 percent. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 25 selling days last month but 26 days in June 1995.
But Honda said its sales rose 7 percent in June as its Passport sport utility vehicle sales rose 64.4 percent. Sales of the Civic rose 39.7 percent, while Accord sales rose 6.2 percent. And BMW, which has waiting lists for its Z3 roadster and its 5-series cars, saw sales jump 28.4 percent in June. Volkswagen sales rose 7.3 percent.
The Ford Motor Company and Toyota are expected to report June sales levels on Wednesday. Ford sales are expected to be flat or slightly down and today Ford announced a round of rebates intended to increase sales for a number of its 1996-model cars, trucks and mini-vans.
Starting Wednesday, Ford will raise to $1,500 from $1,000 the rebates on the Ford Aerostar and Windstar mini-vans and the Mercury Villager mini-van. In lieu of a rebate, customers who finance with Ford may choose cut-rate financing of 6.9 percent on the mini-vans. Rebates will also rise to $1,000 on the Ford Taurus and Crown Victoria as well as the Mercury Sable and Mercury Grand Marquis. Ford will offer a $2,000 discount on the Bronco and a $600 discount on the Ford Escort, Probe, Ranger and Thunderbird as well as on the Mercury Tracer and Cougar.
Wall Street analysts said that auto sales should finish the year relatively strong, as expected. They gave various reasons for the slowdown at G.M.
"The products that have been hot have stayed hot and the products that have been weak have continued to be weak, other than a few products where there has been a hangover from the strike," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto industry analyst for Lehman Brothers. The Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Yukon sold especially briskly, for instance, but many large cars made by Buick and Oldsmobile sold slowly, he said.
Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter, said he was not troubled by G.M.'s results. "We were due for a slowdown anyway," he said, predicting that sales will generally level off in the second half of the year from their quick pace this spring.

HEADLINE: 2 U.S. Companies Sue Canadian Concern

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Two United States companies yesterday sued the Sherritt International Corporation, a Canadian mining company, seeking compensation from Sherritt for its operation of several Cuban oil and gas properties.
The two companies, the Consolidated Development and Consolidated Cuban Oil and Gas Rights corporations of Coral Gables, Fla., contend that Sherritt and Cuba entered a series of joint ventures in 1994 to exploit the properties, which were seized from the two companies. 
 The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Miami, seeks damages of more than $1 million.
Officials of Sherritt, based in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, could not be reached for comment. Sherritt has been a high-profile foreign investor in Cuba, which has come under increasing economic pressure from the United States.
The lawsuit filed yesterday, however, was not based on the recently enacted Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to deter foreign companies from doing business in Cuba.
Lawrence Metsch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the companies were concerned that the Clinton Administration might suspend the operation of Helms-Burton. They also wanted to avoid having their action confused with other suits that may be filed under that law, he said.

Lockheed Martin Is Picked For Spacecraft Project
NASA selected Lockheed Martin to build a rocket that could lead to drastic cuts in the cost of putting payloads into space. The X-33, a wedge-shaped reusable spacecraft, is a step toward replacing the space shuttle. The $1 billion project features the first new rocket design in 25 years, and will be built under a program intended to move much of the initiative for developing high-risk technologies out of NASA's hands and into those of private industry.
Lockheed Martin's proposal was picked after a competition with two other California aerospace companies, Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas. [Page A1.]
 
Sybase Expects Loss and Plans Cuts
Continuing to stumble while its rivals prosper, Sybase, the data base software company, said that it expected to post a $20 million loss for the quarter, instead of the small profit analysts had expected, and that it would cut about 10 percent of its 6,200 jobs. [D4.]
 
Borland International shares fell nearly 15 percent after its chief executive resigned and the company forecast a larger-than-expected loss in its first quarter. [D4.]
 
Earnings Up 81% at Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley Group reported an 81 percent increase in earnings for the second quarter. The firm earned $301 million, or $1.83 a share, in the quarter ended May 31, exceeding most forecasts. [D2.]
 
Major Revamping for CS Holding
CS Holding named a new chief executive and other top officials and said it would cut 5,000 jobs and create four new divisions. The move by CS Holding, the parent of CS First Boston, is an abrupt shift from its chairman's defense of the bank's structure and comes two months after a failed attempt to merge with Union Bank of Switzerland. [D2.]
 
Sales Drop a Bit for G.M.
General Motors said its sales slipped 1.2 percent in June from their levels a year earlier as consumer confidence weakened and auto dealers ran short of some models. [D2.]
 
New Platform for the Gulf of Mexico
Shell Oil said it and three partners plan to build a $1.45 billion platform in the Gulf of Mexico that will be the deepest offshore platform yet in the gulf. [D3.]
 
Compaq Reorganizes Into 3 Units
Compaq Computer said it had reorganized its management into three business units, putting a new executive in charge of its flagship corporate server business. [D4.]
 
License Deals For Gene Data
Acknowledging that there may be many more possible gene-therapy drugs than they can research and develop on their own, SmithKline Beecham and Human Genome Sciences said they would license their human-gene data base to Schering-Plough and Synthelabo of France in deals worth more than $90 million. [D3.]
 
Stocks Slip in Cautious Trading
Stocks retreated, but the pullback was tempered by caution as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day meeting on interest-rate policy. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 9.60 points, to 5,720.38, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.27 points, to 673.61. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.30 points, to 1,191.15. [D6.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities dropped, as traders were surprised by data indicating strong home sales. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.93 percent, up from 6.91 percent on Monday. [D16.]

HEADLINE: NASA PICKS MODEL FOR A NEW FLEET OF SPACE VEHICLES

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
NASA selected the Lockheed Martin Corporation today to build a futuristic experimental rocket that could lead to drastic cuts in the cost of putting payloads into space.
The wedge-shaped re-usable vehicle, the X-33, will be the first major new spacecraft built by the United States in 25 years. It is a step toward replacing the space shuttle, and will be built under a program intended to move much of the initiative for developing high-risk technologies out of NASA's hands and into those of private industry. 
 Lockheed Martin's proposal was selected after an intense competition with two other California aerospace companies, Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.
Vice President Al Gore, who announced the winner at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said the $1 billion X-33 project would result in 2,000 new jobs in California. And, if it leads to building a fleet of new rockets, tens of thousands of jobs will be created in the future, he said.
The experimental rocket will lead to a vehicle that "makes space travel more reliable and cheaper for people and payloads," he said.
"We set sail for the future," Mr. Gore said after unveiling a model of the winning X-33 design. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the importance of this moment."
If the X-33 test rocket is successful, it could lead to a larger unmanned vehicle, capable of putting 40,000-pound payload, the same size carried by the shuttle, into low orbit by the year 2006. Experts said the vehicle would not only loft commercial payloads, but also carry cargo and astronauts to the proposed International Space Station that should be operational after the turn of the century. Today's selection of Martin gives it an advantage in the competition to develop that space craft.
Daniel S. Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the selection of the X-33 contractor marked the beginning a new era for his agency. If successful, the program should lead to a fleet of rockets owned and operated by industry that would haul both government and private payloads into space, he said.
This would fulfill Mr. Goldin's long-stated goal of getting NASA out of the business of owning and launching rockets, like the current fleet of four space shuttles, and making it an agency devoted strictly to research and development. Being able to launch satellites and other cargo into space with less cost and risk will also open up new opportunities for NASA, as well as others, in exploiting space, he said.
"This is a revolutionary new test vehicle that we believe will begin a new chapter in the history of space exploration," Mr. Goldin said. "The less we spend on launch, the more resources we will have for science and technology."
Norman R. Augustine, the vice chairman and chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin, said the company saw its selection as a good business opportunity for itself and thousands of new companies that will be doing business in space as costs decline. "History has shown that as costs of transportation come down, visionary business people think of new ways to harness commerce to technological innovations," Mr. Augustine said in a statement.
The new rocket is to be developed in Palmdale at Lockheed Martin's operation called the Skunk Works, noted for designing spy planes and other secret aircraft.
The program calls for NASA to invest $940 million in the project through 1999 and for Lockheed Martin to put up $220 million in the joint program to build and fly the X-33 to test the new technology needed for a full-scale operational rocket, called a single-stage-to-orbit rocket because it flies without dropping off disposable parts like fuel tanks or booster rockets.
Gary Payton, head of NASA's reusable launch vehicle program, said the Lockheed Martin proposal won because it was the most daring and innovative. The design, dubbed the Venture Star, is to use a new type of metallic thermal covering to protect the ship from the heat of re-entry and will use a radical new engine design, called the aerospike, that does not use traditional cone-shaped rocket nozzles to direct its thrust.
Mr. Payton also said the Lockheed Martin design had won because it was more similar to an eventual operational model than the other proposals.
Rockwell had proposed a winged design that resembled an enlarged space shuttle, without an external fuel tank and boosters, which would have been launched vertically and landed on a runway. McDonnell Douglas proposed a cone-shaped craft that took off vertically and landed the same way, using its rockets to brake its speed and land on its tail. The McDonnell Douglas proposal was a larger version of a small rocket, called the DC-X, that it built and has successfully flown in test programs since 1993.
The two losing companies created their designs using small teams of engineers and no layoffs were expected in their work forces.
NASA officials said the goal of the X-33 program was to produce an unmanned, operational rocket that is one-tenth as costly and less risky to fly than existing space launchers. It now costs about $10,000 to put one pound of payload, whether a satellite or an astronaut, into orbit. It should be possible to reduce this amount to $1,000 a pound, and probably less, Mr. Payton said.
The X-33 proposed by Lockheed Martin will be shaped like a fat arrowhead that measures 67 feet long and 68 feet wide at the tail. The craft, powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, will not be powerful enough to reach orbit, officials said, but will be able to fly 50 miles high at velocities greater than 15 times the speed of sound, enough to test new materials under the harshest conditions.
Lockheed Martin will design, build and conduct the first test flight of the X-33 test rocket by March 1999, and conduct at least 15 flights by December 1999, NASA said. The craft is to take off vertically and land horizontally on a runway.
In addition to rocket designs, NASA asked each industry group to submit business plans on how it would finance a full-scale rocket and operate it at a profit. The plan calls for industry to raise the capital to develop and build operational rockets. The companies estimated that they could probably build an operational re-usable rocket for $5 billion to $8 billion, and eventually pay it off by flying 30 to 40 payloads a year.
Mr. Payton said Lockheed Martin had submitted a plan that called for building a three-ship operational fleet that it felt it could operate profitably.
Industry analysts said that while the financial benefit to Lockheed Martin will be small in the next few years, the company does gain an advantage with its contract to develop technology that will most likely help it win a greater share of the rocket-launching market in the future.
"It gives them a leg up," said Roger R. Threlfall, an aerospace industry analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. "If you can solve the technology issues, you're talking about having a substantial competitive advantage."
Lockheed Martin's shares rose $1.625 on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $87, in expectation of NASA's decision, which was announced after the stock market closed. Rockwell's shares ended down $1.25, at $55.50, while McDonnell Douglas shares showed little change, ending up 12.5 cents, at $50.
The Boeing Company, which had been a partner with McDonnell Douglas in the early stages of the X-33 competition, dropped out of the project because of questions about the ability of industry to develop and finance such an expensive undertaking without substantial government help. However, others said the X-33 program would provide answers to both technical and economic issues, and that a final decision on whether to pursue the larger rocket would have to wait for those results.

Faced with a lawsuit that charges his administration with violating the city's own recycling law, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday denounced the goals contained in the law as "absurd" and "irresponsible" and vowed he would work to scale them back.
"It is impossible to reach a mandated recycling level," Mr. Giuliani said, "unless you take all the people in New York City, put them in prison, and force them to recycle." 
 5 The Mayor was careful to say that recycling should remain a part of the city's program for dealing with the 30,000 tons of commercial and residential trash generated by New Yorkers every day. But he stressed, as Mayor David N. Dinkins did before him, that meeting the goals set by the 1989 law -- recycling 25 percent, or 4,250 tons a day, of the city's residential garbage -- would cost the cash-strapped city too much money.
"Recycling is a valuable alternative in a group of other alternatives to deal with waste," Mr. Giuliani said. "It is not a religion. It is not the be-all and end-all of life." He strongly implied that the city would not agree to comply with a law that the administration considers "impossible."
"There's a certain theory in the law that says if a law is impossible, you can't follow it," Mr. Giuliani said. "And this law is impossible."
But Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said: "Impossibility is an extremely narrow legal defense. It's only applicable if, for example, a hurricane wiped out the entire fleet of Department of Sanitation trucks."
The city now recycles about 14 percent, or 2,200 tons a day, of its residential garbage, and in fact has been in violation of the recycling law since 1991. Although the Dinkins and Giuliani administrations both challenged the recycling requirements in court, the goals have been upheld in four court decisions within the last five years.
In support of his position, the Mayor cited an article in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday that called recycling a waste of time and money and suggested that the national drive to increase recycling was prompted by an irrational fear that available landfill space was rapidly disappearing. It said many communities look to landfills as sources of income and economic development.
Recycling rates grew slowly but steadily from 1989, when New Yorkers first started separating out their bottles, cans and newspapers, until 1993, when the rate topped out at 15 percent.
The rate has dropped slightly since, and environmentalists and City Council members are fearful that it will drop even more later in the year when the city reduces recycling pickups from once a week to once every two weeks in most of New York. That change, which is to go into effect in September, was proposed by the Mayor and approved by the City Council last month as a budget-cutting measure, although many Council members said they would press the Mayor to restore the money.
With yesterday's comments, Mr. Giuliani laid down a direct challenge to the City Council and to the environmental groups that have fought to enforce the Council's recycling goals.
"I think the law is absurd," the Mayor said. "The City Council should negotiate a reasonable result here that the city can achieve."
In response yesterday, Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said of the recycling law that has been copied by other cities: "We're not about to give up on it."
"This law is far from absurd," Mr. Vallone said. "It's sensible and it sets benchmarks, which is how you're supposed to run government. Aim as high as you can."
Environmental groups, joined by Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, the primary sponsor of the law, filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday, asking the court to enforce the latest deadline -- July 14 -- for reaching the 25 percent recycling requirement. That deadline was set by the State Supreme Court in 1994 as it rejected one of the city's earlier efforts to wipe out the law.
Mr. Leffler asserted that the goals were reasonable, though he conceded that it was impossible for the city to nearly double recycling rates in less than two weeks.
"We don't expect miracles," Mr. Leffler said. "This is not the Ten Commandments we're following." He said he hoped that the court would uphold the goals but give the city more time to meet them. The original mandates gave the city two years to move to 25 percent from 15 percent, and he suggested that such a time span was still achievable.
The Councilman said, however, that the Giuliani administration had not put any effort into increasing recycling. Mr. Leffler and other Council members have harshly criticized the Mayor for cutting this year's recycling program by $29 million, virtually eliminating the recycling education and outreach program and cutting back residential pickups. When the cuts take effect later this year, only parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn will have weekly pickups.
Mr. Giuliani called his administration's scaled-back program a responsible one. He said recycling at the mandated volumes would actually hurt the city because the additional tons of recyclables would flood the recycling market, drive prices for recyclable goods down and thus wind up costing the city even more money.
The markets for recyclable items have always been extremely volatile. Newsprint, for example, earned the city $160 a ton last year, but this year is costing the city $5 a ton just to get rid of it. The city recycles about 300,000 tons of newspapers annually.
While his critics also assailed him for announcing plans to shut down the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Islanmd by 2001 without stepping up the city's recycling program, Mr. Giuliani again insisted that the city should turn to out-of-state landfills as an alternative for the 13,000 tons of garbage that goes to Fresh Kills every day.
"New York City should not be in the position of having to be able to take care of all the garbage that it produces," he said. "That's absolutely impossible for the most densely populated city in the United States."
He added that "landfills are much more available than people realize' and that they represent a thriving industry in other parts of the country.

HEADLINE: ATLANTA 1996: OLYMPIC PROFILE;
Tulu Is Running for Herself and Millions of Sisters

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
On a suffocating night at the 1992 Summer Olympics, Elana Meyer of South Africa drew into the lead of the women's 10,000-meter race. With 16 of 25 laps completed, only Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia remained with her. For eight laps they ran alone. Meyer dripped sweat and sponged water on her head, and the strain of setting the pace began to show in her face. Tulu ran patiently and coolly, wearing a T-shirt as if she felt a slight chill on this muggy evening.
When Meyer slowed to take water, Tulu slowed. When Meyer turned and wanted Tulu to take the lead, Tulu did not respond. 
 "I was new," said Tulu, who is 24 now, smiling as she remembered. "I was only to follow."
Then, with slightly more than one lap remaining, Tulu decided to follow no more. She pounced into the lead and won in 31 minutes 6.02 seconds, reducing her previous best time by 19 seconds and becoming the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal.
At the finish, Tulu and Meyer exchanged kisses. Each was handed a national flag, and the two runners began a poignant victory lap around the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain. Meyer, who is white, had won South Africa's first Olympic medal in her country's first Games since it was banished three decades earlier for the racial policies of apartheid. Tulu had provided visible success for a country unfailingly associated with famine, poverty and civil war.
Together, they symbolized the possibilities of an emerging Africa and the potential for African women.
"I was the happiest woman on earth," Tulu said earlier this year at the Ethiopian cross-country championships, where she was preparing for what she hoped would be a repeat victory later this month in Atlanta. "I was bringing something home for women in Ethiopia and Africa."
Upon her return to Addis Ababa, Tulu was greeted by thousands of her countrymen at the airport and serenaded with chants of "Derartu! Derartu! The charming daughter of Ethiopia."
From the airport, she was chauffeured to the palace of the prime minister. For her gold medal, she was awarded 20,000 birr (some $3,175 dollars) and was made a major in the national prison police.
"To see her carry that flag was big for the self-esteem of women," said Selome Taddesse, a political counselor at the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington. "It builds your confidence. A society that says women are not as good as men, certainly not equal, she disproved that. In a way, she broke a barrier. She is a national hero."
Her likeness was placed inside a set of Olympic rings at the National Stadium, alongside Ethiopia's three previous men's champions: the legendary Abebe Bikila, who won the Olympic marathon in 1960 and 1964; Mamo Walde, who won the Olympic marathon in 1968, and Miruts Yifter, who won the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in 1980.
"I wanted to do as much for Ethiopian women as Abebe Bikila did for Ethiopian men," Tulu said.
Hers was a startling accomplishment in this, one of the world's poorest countries, where women generally lead harsh, subservient lives.
Although Ethiopia has a history of assertive queens and empresses, most women are expected to assume the traditional roles of bearing children, fetching water in the arid countryside, herding goats and cattle and toiling in the peasant fields of wheat and barley and the iron-fortified grain called teff.
"Women work an average of 16 hours a day," said Taddesse, who noted that two women serve as ministers in the current democratic government and that four women serve as Ethiopian ambassadors. "They are pillars of the economy. They are just not noticed or recognized or paid for it. Even in the progressive government, where we have a women's bureau and a women's policy for the first time, women don't enjoy equal status. Any achievement by Ethiopian women is remarkable in that society."
While Ethiopian women made their first Olympic appearance at the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow, only in the past 10 years has there been a development program for distance runners. Tulu's influence has resulted in incremental but unmistakable gains. Five or six years ago, there were no Ethiopian women marathon runners, according to the national marathon coach, Yilma Berta. Now there are 10. Another 40 women runners are considered to be elite-level athletes.
The top marathoner, Fatuma Roba, finished 19th at the 1995 world championships. She will compete in Atlanta, along with Tulu and about eight other Ethiopian women. Only three Ethiopian women competed at the 1992 Summer Games.
"The problem is, we don't have many coaches in the countryside," Berta said.
This shortage makes Tulu's gold medal performance all the more remarkable.
A member of the Oromo ethnic group, she grew up in the Arsi region southeast of the capital. These are the same agricultural highlands that produced Haile Gebrselassie, the men's world record-holder at 5,000 and 10,000 meters and a double Olympic favorite in Atlanta.
The sixth of nine children, Tulu herded cattle outside the village of Bekoji. In a country where only 10 percent of girls enroll in secondary school, she was encouraged to run 800 and 1,500 meters by her teachers. Her legend is built around a story that, while competing in an intramural school competition, she defeated a boy in a race over 400 meters.
In 1988, as a 16-year-old, Tulu came to Addis to compete in the national cross-country championships, where she placed third. At the time, Ethiopia was controlled by the brutal Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam that was overthrown five years ago. Tens of thousands of people were killed during his campaign of "red terror." In sympathy with Communist brethren in Moscow and Pyongyang, North Korea, Ethiopia boycotted the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles and the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea.
The national police recruited Tulu at those 1988 cross-country championships, and she moved to the capital to live and train. In 1991, the year Mengistu was overthrown, Tulu set a world junior record of 32:08.74 at 10,000 meters. By 1992, at age 20, she became Olympic champion. Even though she is a major in the prison police, her occupation is full-time athlete.
Last year, Tulu won the world cross-country championship in a remarkable display of resilience in the face of incompetence by officials in the Ethiopian track federation. On the way from Addis Ababa to the championships in Durham, England, the Ethiopian team was left stranded overnight in the Athens airport and was then forced to endure an eight-hour bus ride from London. Arriving only hours before the championships, Tulu won anyway.
Then she returned home and led a march through the streets of the capital to protest the treatment of the Ethiopian team. Her gold medal had brought a certain authority. Several federation officials were fired.
Her success, however, has not come without criticism. Some whisper about her Mercedes-Benz and her gold jewelry and wonder whether Tulu has grown complacent in victory. Ethiopian coaches have complained about a lapse in her concentration and about her competing too much out of the country. Perhaps they have grown frustrated in a struggle for control with a woman of unaccustomed strength and determination.
Tulu finished second in the 10,000 at the 1995 world championships. Last March, she might have won the 1996 world cross-country championships in Cape Town if she had not been spiked early in the race. She lost at least 30 seconds while running back to retrieve her shoe. Even so, she finished fourth. Then she went to the hospital to receive seven stitches in her calf.
With the Olympics just ahead, problems with the Ethiopian federation persist. In mid-May, Tulu was not given permission to leave the country to compete in a meet in Osaka, Japan. A week later, the Ethiopian Olympic Committee complained that the track schedule would not be changed to allow Tulu to run both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters without any overlap in Atlanta. The first round of the 10,000 is scheduled for the day before the final of the 5,000.
Noting a schedule alteration for the American sprinter Michael Johnson, an Ethiopian Olympic official complained that track's world governing body was exhibiting "nothing other than pure racism, an act of favoritism and double standards."
The official suggested that international track officials were unfairly aiding European distance runners by denying Tulu a chance to compete in two races. But many found the charges hollow. A schedule change was made for another African woman, Maria Mutola of Mozambique, so that she could run 800 and 1,500 meters. While the Ethiopian Olympic Committee may have legitimate concerns, Tulu's American-based agent said, officials waited much too long to request a schedule change.
"They don't realize that the applications for the other changes were made a year ago," Ray Flynn said. "They think you can do something now or yesterday."
In Atlanta, Tulu is expected to face stiff competition from Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal, Wang Junxia of China and Tegla Loroupe of Kenya as she attempts to defend her Olympic title at 10,000 meters. But she has overcome far greater odds in surmounting Ethiopia's cultural hurdles.
"I know many international athletes are coming to win," Tulu said. "I'm also preparing myself to win."

HEADLINE: New York City Investment Fund Isn't a First

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leaders of the New York City Investment Fund may say they are establishing a fund that is unique because of their focus and investment strategies (front page, June 29), but they are simply the latest participants in a trend that has been growing for 15 years. 
 The National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, which represents more than 40 community-development financial institutions, reports there are more than 300 such institutions in 45 states. They use private investors' dollars, as well as some from local and state governments, to invest in a wide variety of small businesses in economically distressed communities. They range from highly sophisticated, federally insured depository institutions and credit unions to revolving loan funds and micro-enterprise loan funds.
Most of these funds have focused on providing loans, but in recent years there has been a growing focus on equity funds, like the fund being assembled by Henry R. Kravis.
The size of the Kravis fund is impressive. But it is important to recognize the skill of people who do not rate as a "bell cow" but are finding a market-driven answer to the economic needs of urban and rural communities.

HEADLINE: Youth Crime Debate Is a Mirror to Society's Soul

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Wrong Approach to Teen-Age Crime" (editorial, June 30) adds rationality to a debate that seems to be spiraling out of control. 
 As a society, the decisions we are making on how to address youth crime will reveal the nature of our very soul. So far, we have created a recipe for disaster with the proliferation of guns, increasing income disparities, widespread availability of alcohol and budgets with money to build prisons but not to repair or support schools. And yet when crime increases as a result, our response is to blame and vilify youth.
We need to remember that the youth of America did not make the policies that allowed family incomes to deteriorate. The youth of America do not manufacture cheap, dangerous handguns; they do not sit on planning commissions that allow alcohol outlets on nearly every inner-city street corner, and they certainly were not the ones who decided that prisons should become a growth industry.
We must take responsibility for creating opportunities for prevention so we won't need to resort to punishment. The recent Rand Corporation report shows that we can invest in youth by paying for prevention programs. We can not only save money this way, but also reduce crime, help youth to realize their potential and create a more just society. We may even reclaim our national soul.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Young Ensigns of Industry Face High-Tech Realities

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
For the goofy, laid-back heroes of "Pick Up Ax," Anthony Clarvoe's engaging business manual of a comedy at the 29th Street Repertory Theater, it's still possible to be a corporate executive without having blood on your hands. Still in their 20's, Brian Weiss (Thomas Wehrle) and Keith Rienzi (Neil Necastro) run their multimillion-dollar Silicon Valley company with minds clouded by marijuana smoke and a blissful ignorance of the competitive instinct.
But as the play's program points out, this all takes place "many generations in the past," i.e., the early 1980's. An economic revolution, couched in Darwinian language and a new spirit of aggression, is afoot. And it will spell the end for the age of innocence of what the play's third character, Mick Palomar (David Mogentale), an enterprising trouble-shooter from the world of "heavy industry," speculates may be America's last growth industry. 
 Keith and Brian must either become masters of a hostile, unfamiliar universe or plummet to the bottom of the food chain. Small wonder that Keith, the company's childlike creative genius, observes anxiously, "I never should have strayed from pure programming."
"Pick Up Ax," directed by James Abar, is a formula play of financial warfare along the lines of the 1980's own Off Broadway hit, "Other People's Money." Formula plays have their own particular satisfactions, and Mr. Clarvoe doesn't cheat on them.
He adroitly sets up the requisite "High Noon"-ish standoff among three men with three very different sets of skills and sensibilities: Brian, with his limited, self-described "suburban street smarts"; Keith, for whom the material world seems less real than anything on his PC screen, and Mick, a thug in a land of brainy nerds, who nonetheless has what Keith calls "a very workable substitute for high intelligence."
But Mr. Clarvoe also finds theatrical flair in the seemingly nontheatrical language of computerese (something even high-tech movie blockbusters like "Mission: Impossible" have serious trouble with). Its title, a computer command, will have resonance for anyone familiar with the early crop of video adventure games. And it is used to sly, character-defining effect here.
The work strains a bit in introducing a computer-run "mood room" that reflects the emotions of its characters; while this allows for some funny visual moments, it also has a surreal quality that doesn't match the naturalistic chattiness of the rest of the script. But the dialogue, structured as a continuing clash of world views, has wit and bounce, and Mr. Abar and his ensemble sustain it with the appropriate blend of tension and comic irony.
"History is written by the winners," says Mick in the play's first act; "ethics is written by the losers." It's a familiar enough slice of cynicism. Mr. Clarvoe, however, understands how the terms of victory and the nature of conquerors are mutating in an industry where today's innovation is tomorrow's discard. By the work's end, the sort of scary, white-collar villains portrayed in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" already seem like dinosaurs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Rises Against the Dollar On Signs of Victory by Yeltsin

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was weaker yesterday as the German mark gained as polls indicated that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia would be re-elected.
The dollar, however, found some strength against the yen, after the Japanese central bank chief reiterated that interest rates would not be raised soon. 
 Foreign-exchange markets largely shrugged off a decision by the Federal Reserve to keep American interest rates unchanged, as expected.
"The market feels comfortable that rates will stay the same in Japan, and also that the outcome of the Russian election will be for Yeltsin," said David Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
The dollar also weakened as many investors liquidated their positions before the Fourth of July holiday weekend. Financial markets will be closed in the United States today.
"There was heavy profit taking today," said Steven Flanagan, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York. "Many players may not be in the market for the next four days, and they were securing their positions."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5206 marks, down from 1.5266 marks on Tuesday. The dollar extended its recent gains against the yen, rising to 110.40 yen from 110.35. The British pound edged up to $1.5625, from $1.5575.
The mark had slumped earlier in the week, helping the dollar and the Swiss franc, on uncertainty over the the Russian election's outcome. Political instability in Russia can hurt the mark because of the close economic ties between the two countries. Germany is Russia's largest trading partner and creditor.
But exit polls yesterday showed Mr. Yeltsin with a lead in the presidential runoff against his Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov.
The market quickly changed direction, sending the mark higher against the dollar and the Swiss franc. "Instead of mark selling, they were buying," said Randolph Donney, capital-market research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group.
The dollar did, however, rise against the yen on comments by the governor of Japanese central bank, Yasuo Matsushita, who said that the Japanese economic recovery remained only moderate and that the bank would leave interest rates at postwar lows to help the economy along. Mr. Matsushita had made similar comments on Monday.

HEADLINE: homas Burke, 57; Helped Develop A Medicare Plan

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Thomas R. Burke, a health economist and co-author of the Reagan Administration's failed effort to extend Medicare coverage to catastrophic illness, died on Monday at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. An Alexandria resident, he was 57.
The cause was blood poisoning, his family said. 
 Mr. Burke was an official of the Department of Heath and Human Services when he and Dr. Otis R. Bowen, then chairman of an advisory committee studying Medicare, devised their plan. When Dr. Bowen became Secretary of the department in 1985 he named Mr. Burke as his chief of staff, and the "Bowen-Burke plan" became a legislative proposal with the imprimatur of the Reagan Administration.
The proposal was approved by Congress in June 1988 but was repealed about a year later, after an outpouring of criticism from Medicare beneficiaries who saw their premiums increase.
The measure drew intense fire from conservatives and liberals alike.
The mild-mannered Dr. Bowen bore their criticism. But it was his gruff "enforcer," Mr. Burke, who stood in the fiercest crossfire of the assault. Some critics called him a socialist, which he deeply resented.
Conservatives complained that the plan was far too expensive and that Mr. Burke was betraying President Reagan's principles. To liberal detractors, the foreseen coverage fell far short, and the elderly would be made to pay dearly for what little coverage there was.
Mr. Burke was born in Trenton and graduated from La Salle University with a degree in economics in 1960. He earned a master's degree in economics at Boston College.
He joined the Government as director of health-policy analysis in the Pentagon but moved to Health and Human Services as executive director of its Advisory Council on Social Security and later as special assistant in the Health Care Financing Administration.
Upon leaving the department in 1989 he became a principal partner of A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consulting firm. Since 1991 he was president of the LaSalle Group, a health consulting firm in Washington.
Mr. Burke is survived by his wife, Sharon Bucs Burke; three daughters, Rosemary A., Heather M., and Kerry A. Burke, all of Alexandria; a son, Brendan T., of Kenosha, Wis.; a brother, J. George of Trenton, and two sisters, Mary B. Hazon of Trenton and Patricia Schwing of Andover, Mass.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales in June Slowed From May's Frantic Pace

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 3

 BODY:
Auto sales slowed from a frantic sprint to a slow jog in June, suggesting a slowdown in economic growth, economists said.
The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.2 million cars and light trucks last month from a torrid 15.8 million in May, a downshifting that economists and Wall Street analysts greeted as a sign that the economy was settling down to a steadier pace and was less likely to overheat. 
 The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales of cars and light trucks in June slipped 2.4 percent from the same period a year ago, while Toyota said its sales dropped 5.7 percent.
Together with other auto makers that reported their results earlier this week, today's figures added up to a 1 percent drop in overall auto sales in June from a year earlier.
"The momentum in this market is clearly behind us," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist with the First Chicago NBD Corporation in Chicago.
Ms. Swonk, who admits she is a bit of a pessimist, estimates that by the end of the year, auto makers will have sold just 14.8 million cars and trucks -- a sharp slowdown from the 15.2 million annualized pace they kept in the first six months of this year, and a sharp drop from last month's 15.8 million level.
"I expect them to taper off over the course of the summer," she said.
While other economists and Wall Street analysts think auto makers will sell closer to 15.1 million or 15.2 million vehicles this year, they agree that June marked a turning point.
"Clearly, the selling pace has cooled," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Brothers. "I think we are going to run at this level for the rest of the year."
The apparently unsustainable sales levels last month were an anomaly, analysts and economists said. Indeed, strong sales earlier this year were fueled by high levels of mortgage refinancing, early income tax refunds and relatively high rebates on many cars and trucks, they said.
June's 15.2 million annual sales pace is still quite healthy -- any level of more than 15 million annually is considered a good year for the auto industry. "When you consider that last month was off the charts, it is a very healthy sign that sales are remaining above 15 million," said Scott F. Merlis, an analyst who runs his own automotive research firm in Westport, Conn.
Mr. Merlis said, "It is right where you want sales to be" -- healthy but unspectacular. The June sales were a good sign for the auto industry and the business climate as a whole because they mean "it is steady as she goes for the economy, instead of overheated," he said.
In Ford's case, overall sales dropped 2.4 percent from levels a year earlier, with car sales falling 6.8 percent but those of light trucks -- pickups, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans -- rising 1.6 percent. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 25 selling days last month but 26 in June 1995.
Indeed, Ford's car sales dropped 4.6 percent in the first half of the year, while light-truck sales rose 2.7 percent. Ford executives explain that the poor results stem from a strategic decision to reduce low-profit sales to car rental fleets.
"While that reduced our share in the short run, it enhanced the quality of that share and is already yielding other longer-term benefits, including improved residual values and reduced substitution of used cars," said Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales.
Auto dealers said Ford sales were mixed.
Janice Ford, the leading saleswoman at Platte City Ford in Kansas, who sold 30 cars and trucks last month, said that over all, "It was a real good month." Two of Ford's most important products are selling well at her dealership. "The new F-150 is hot, real hot, and the Tauruses have picked up considerably," she said. On the other hand, she said, "The Probes are real slow."
Toyota sales dropped 5.7 percent over all in June compared with the same period last year. Sales of Toyota and Lexus cars together plummeted 17.4 percent, while truck sales jumped 35.2 percent.
"The industry took a breather in June," said Yale Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. "Although there is talk on the street about a leveling-off over the rest of the year, we remain optimistic."
Other auto makers posted mixed results this week. On Monday, the Chrysler Corporation said its sales rose 1 percent from a strong showing in June 1995. On Tuesday, the General Motors Corporation said its sales slipped 1.2 percent.
The June sales decline "is consistent with a slowdown in economic growth," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "That's what we've all been waiting for."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Up Slightly

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday on relief that Federal Reserve policy makers had left interest rates unchanged.
While the decision by the Fed was expected, recent strong economic reports had raised doubts among some market participants. Investors have now turned their attention to tomorrow's June employment data, which are expected to help determine the Fed's next move on interest rates. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , to 8812/32 , leaving its yield unchanged from Tuesday at 6.93 percent.
Prices were weaker before the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended a two day meeting without raising short-term interest rates.
Bond prices bounced off their lows on news of the Fed's inaction.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that by not raising rates the Fed was telling the market that the economy was fine and that it was willing to wait and see if growth would begin to accelerate inflation. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the Fed's decision not to raise rates gave the board another seven weeks to analyze more data. "But unless the upcoming data shows a significant weakening of the economy, the Fed is very likely to tighten by Aug. 20," he said.
"The market will now focus on the Friday employment data, which is simply the first of many important pieces of information that the Fed will receive by the next F.O.M.C. meeting."
The employment numbers, if they come in stronger than expected, could have a volatile impact on the market because trading is expected to be thin tomorrow. The Treasury market is closed today in observance of the Fourth of July and will close early tomorrow, at 2 P.M., on the recommendation of the Public Securities Association, a trade group.
Mr. Thayer of A. G. Edwards said he did not expect that the employment numbers would be a surprise.
"But traders are reluctant to risk being surprised nonetheless," he said. "We're hearing a gain of 150,000, which is far less than 348,000 gained reported last month." Employment reports earlier this year have shown unexpected strength, roiling the bond and stock markets.
Before the end of the Federal Reserve policy-making meeting yesterday, few investors were willing to do much trading. As a result, the economic reports released in the morning had only a mild impact on prices. May factory orders rose 1.9 percent, driven by a 3.4 percent increase in durables, previously reported up 3.3 percent, and from a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in nondurables. The weekly initial claims for unemployment for the period ended last Saturday fell by 4,000, to 351,000, lower than the expected 355,000. It brought the four-week moving average down slightly to 356,000, keeping the trend intact.
In another move expected by the market, the Treasury announced plans to to sell $10 billion of 10-year notes Tuesday. In when-issued trading yesterday, the notes were being offered to yield 6.77 percent.
Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc., in Chicago, said the bond market was relieved, with the yield spread between the two-year and long-dated paper increasing as some of the fear of a Fed move has been removed. He added: "However, there are some market participants who feel a move on Friday, while out of the normal pattern of Fed action, is not impossible. If for instance the nonfarm growth was above a 200,000 increase, the talk of Fed tightening would be back on the front burner." He said that looking at the previous data, and given National Association of Purchasing Managementemployment statistics on Monday, it raised that possibility.
"In the last seven years, when the employment component of the N.A.P.M. survey is above 49, nonfarm payroll gains have always been above 199,000," Mr. Thayer said. "The latest N.A.P.M. on Monday had the employment component at 49.2." The market he says, has another hoop it must jump through on Friday. It jumped through one yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: IN WASHINGTON;
Yeltsin's Health and Commitment on Economy Will Be Watched Closely by the U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Amid the palpable relief in the Clinton Administration over Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in today's Russian election is some quiet wagering, officials say, over how quickly Mr. Yeltsin will have the bypass operation on his heart he so clearly seems to need.
The last few days of tension over Mr. Yeltsin's health were exacerbated by the Americans' lack of access to the Russian President, though the Russians insisted that Mr. Yeltsin's condition was not life-threatening. There is a similar concern, the officials say, over Mr. Yeltsin's plans for a second term, though "we look to quickly engage with Yeltsin and his team over economic and security issues," a senior Administration official said today. 
 "We'll first look for a commitment to stay the course on the economy," the official said, arguing that the burst of spending in the Yeltsin campaign bent but didn't break the bank.
In the longer term, the officials said, the election may represent the last opportunity for the traditional Communist Party to regain power in Russia through the ballot box. They predicted that the party, led by Gennadi A. Zyuganov, would probably split into a left-wing social democratic party and a more backward-looking Communist remnant.
"It won't be the end of Communism or of the counter-reform movement," an official said.
"But change will continue and make it harder to go backward, and from Russia's demography it's clear that the future does not belong to the Communists."
Vice President Al Gore will go to Moscow on July 12 to meet Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and expects to see Mr. Yeltsin almost immediately, another official said.
Mr. Gore is expected to press the Yeltsin Government to make "sensible appointments" in key economic posts in order to reassure the markets and the International Monetary Fund. The Fund's $10 billion loan to Russia is dependent on monthly economic checkups, and while Administration officials admit that Mr. Yeltsin got some leeway during the campaign, the Fund will expect real signs of economic discipline again now that it is over.
At the same time, the officials note, Russia is in better economic shape than four years ago, with a gross national product of about $350 billion a year and $10 billion in hard-currency reserves, compared with $60 billion a year and no reserves. "The key people around Yeltsin don't want to change course and want to keep straight with the I.M.F.," an official said.
Over the next few months the Administration will look to engage Moscow on European security issues, from NATO expansion and its relationship with Russia to ratification of the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start-2. Also to be addressed are continuing questions about chemical and biological weapons and the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.
Since Mr. Zyuganov ran a half-hearted campaign in the last two weeks, some American officials believe that some relatively moderate Communists will be given portfolios in a new Government.
In the past Mr. Yeltsin has given Communists the Agriculture Ministry, for example, possibly setting the model for a new effort at an informal government of national unity or reconciliation.
But another official demurred, pointing to Mr. Yeltsin's hatred of the Communists. "He's going to savor the fact that he beat them back," the official said.
That official hoped Mr. Yeltsin would work quickly, "with a fairly significant new mandate" for macroeconomic stabilization and some of the legal and structural reforms necessary for a real market economy. The official said he also hoped that Mocow would move against crime and corruption "within the rule of law."
Offcials were sanguine about Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general who ran third in the first round of voting, and whom Mr. Yeltsin elevated to run the National Security Council.
Now that Mr. Lebed has served Mr. Yeltsin by helping him to electoral victory, it is by no means clear that he will survive the kind of fierce Kremlin infighting for which he is not trained. "He doesn't have the background or skills for it," an official said. "If you were to ask me whether Lebed would be a major force in the Yeltsin administration a year from now, I'd have to say I doubt it."
No one predicts a return to the optimistic days of 1992, when Mr. Yeltsin and Westernized economic reformers looked to a full partnership with the United States and the West. But this election, officials suggest, does mark another important break with the Soviet past and a vote for Russia to take a relatively cooperative place in the world community.
"There were a lot of people with nervous stomachs over the last few days," a senior State Department official said. "There wasn't really a Plan B, as such. But we were ready to react and make some strong points about American interests, but that doesn't seem necessary now."
The official was reluctant to call the election officially, saying that President Clinton will make known his reaction on Thursday.
"But I'm also mindful that Peres went to bed thinking he'd won," the official said, with a verbal shudder, referring to the Administration's embarrassment when Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, despite overt support from Mr. Clinton, lost a narrow election to Benjamin Netanyahu.

As Expected, Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged
A surprise move might have caused some early Fourth of July fireworks in the markets, but Federal Reserve policy makers stuck to the script, leaving interest rates unchanged after a two-day meeting.
Many analysts still expect the central bank to raise interest rates later this summer. But the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has proved to be reluctant to change policy without compelling evidence of a need to do so. [Page D2.]
No news was good news for bonds. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond edged up, leaving its yield unchanged at 6.93 percent. [D14.] 
 Stocks ended lower, even after greeting the Fed's inaction with relief. Technology stocks came under renewed selling pressure. [D5.]
 
Auto Sales Slowed in June
Ford Motor became the latest American auto maker to report slowing sales for June. A day after General Motors said June sales slipped 1.2 percent, Ford said its sales fell 2.6 percent. Over all, auto makers' sales declined 1 percent in June from a year earlier. [D2.]
 
G.M. Settlement Approved
A Louisiana judge gave preliminary approval to a potential $5 billion settlement of suits contending that gas tanks in 1973-78 General Motors pickup trucks were defective. [A15.]
 
Times Mirror and McGraw-Hill Swap
Times Mirror plans to trade its higher-education publishing division to McGraw-Hill for Shepard's, McGraw-Hill's legal research and annotation subsidiary. Times Mirror will also form a joint venture with Reed Elsevier, which owns the Lexis-Nexis electronic information-retrieval service, to own and operate Shepard's. [D4.]

Victory for Casino Owners
New Jersey's Governor announced a sweeping roadway and tunnel project for Atlantic City, presumably bolstering its position as one of the nation's prime gambling destinations. It was a victory for casino owners. [A1.]
 
Valujet Moves to Fly Again
Valujet filed plans with the F.A.A. to resume operations, two weeks after the agency forced the airline to shut down. [A16.]
 
Sales of Nicotine Patch Approved
The F.D.A. approved the first nicotine patch for sale without prescription, giving a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary an edge over its competitors. [D16.]
 
TCI's Satellite Plan Opposed
The Clinton Administration has asked the F.C.C. to withhold a ruling on whether Tele-Communications can beam its direct-broadcast television service from a Canadian satellite. The Administration said approval should be withheld because Canada has not yet agreed to open its skies to U.S. satellite companies. [D4.]
 
Top Japanese Banking Official Out
 
The head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's banking bureau will retire. The official angered U.S. regulators last fall, when he said the ministry waited six weeks before notifying them that Daiwa Bank had incurred $1.1 billion in unauthorized trading losses. [D15.]

Box-Office Record Smashed
The 20th Century Fox film "Independence Day" grossed $11.1 million at its box-office opening, tripling the previous record, set by "Die Hard II" in 1990. [C9.]

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, and Focus Turns to August

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting today, but analysts said the central bank might well push rates up later this summer unless there are pronounced signs that the economy is slowing.
As usual, the Fed's policy-making committee offered no explanation for its decision not to raise the short-term rates it controls. Economists said the Fed appeared to be betting that the surprisingly strong growth of the last quarter -- most estimates are that the economy expanded at a 4 percent annual rate in the second three months of the year -- would slow considerably in coming months, easing any inflationary pressures that might be building. 
 "The lack of movement by the Fed was widely expected because the economy has not been strong enough for long enough to push them into moving, and in addition there's not much sign of inflation," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at CS First Boston. "In order for them not to tighten in August, the economy has to show some signs of slowing between now and then."
The Fed decision was widely expected, and financial markets were little moved by the news. Bond prices barely budged and stocks fell as companies warned of disappointing earnings.
The first conclusive evidence of whether the economy is slowing will come on Friday, when the Government is scheduled to issue statistics on job creation in June. Figures for July, which will be issued in early August before the next Fed policy meeting, will also be closely scrutinized for clues about the economy's strength and the Fed's intentions. High levels of job growth suggest that wages could be forced upward, eventually setting off an inflationary cycle. Despite strong job growth this year, however, there are only scattered signs of rising wages.
"If payroll gains for June and July match the 220,000 per month average of the January-May period, the Fed will probably tighten in August," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "But if payroll gains slow to less than 200,000 for June-July, the Fed would probably hold policy steady."
The latest evidence suggests the economy remains buoyant. Although long-term interest rates have surged since early in the year, rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing are still remarkably strong; the Government reported on Monday that builders sold new homes in May at the fastest pace in a decade.
The Commerce Department said today that orders to factories rose 1.9 percent in May, a level largely in line with expectations but one that nonetheless was the largest since last August. Analysts said the figures suggested that companies had finished a process of reducing their inventories, and that new orders were being filled through higher production levels, a process that leads to increased demand for labor and materials, which could produce inflation pressures.
And separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time applications for state unemployment benefits fell 4,000 last week. A total of 351,000 people sought jobless pay in the week ended June 29, compared with 355,000 a week earlier.
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, favors small moves in interest rates, but has proved reluctant to change policy without compelling evidence of a need to do so. The Fed cut rates three times between last July and January, reversing an earlier series of increases, but has held its key Federal funds target rate steady at 5.25 percent since January. Raising rates this summer could prove to be a particularly sensitive decision given the importance of the economy in the Presidential campaign.
The Fed's policy-setting committee is scheduled to meet next on Aug. 20, between the Republican and Democratic conventions. Although the Fed has proved willing to raise rates during an election year -- it did so in August 1988 -- there is little doubt it would prefer to avoid injecting monetary policy into the heat of a political season if it does not have to.
"Although they still have several months until the election, August is starting to get close, and the Fed will err in the direction of doing nothing if the data give them the opportunity to do so," Ms. Cahn said.
After generally refraining from commenting publicly on monetary policy, President Clinton said at a news conference last month that he hoped the Fed would not raise rates if there were no further signs of inflation. Today the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry G. Cisneros, invited reporters to participate in a conference call to discuss how Fed policy and interest rates affect the housing market, suggesting an increased willingness on the part of the Administration to exert public pressure on the Fed.
"The decision by the Fed is, from the housing market's perspective, good news, the best news we could have," Mr. Cisneros said.
In addition to debating interest rates, the Fed's two-day meeting was also given over to formulating a general explanation of the current policy that Mr. Greenspan will deliver to Congress this month, starting with an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on July 18.
For all the signs of current strength, economists remain divided over whether the economy will slow sufficiently to avoid a rate increase by the Fed in August.
Nancy R. Lazar, an economist at International Strategy and Investment Group, said growth should slow to 2 percent in the third quarter and to 1 percent in the fourth quarter.
"We don't look for the Fed to tighten at all this year," she said.
Consumer spending, which got a temporary push in the first half from factors like high levels of mortgage refinancings and tax refunds, is already showing signs of flattening out as households confront high debt levels, she said. Employment growth should slow, she said, and inflation indicators like commodity prices are showing little or no upward pressure on prices.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Low-Altitude Campaign Frustrating Dole Aides

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 3

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton was in this pre-Democratic convention period four summers ago, he was battling not only President George Bush and Ross Perot but also a perception in his own dispirited party that he was heading for a third-place finish in November.
Mr. Clinton came to remember those early summer months of the campaign four years ago -- with their frenetic schedule of town hall meetings, talk-show interviews and policy pronouncements -- as the little-noticed turning point in his run for the White House. 
 Like Mr. Clinton then, Bob Dole today has won his party's backing but not its confidence, and he is trailing far behind in most polls. And like Mr. Clinton then, he is frustrated at what he views as his difficulty in getting a fair airing in the press.
The question for Mr. Dole is, can he make as profitable a use of the weeks running up to the Republican convention this year as Mr. Clinton did in the weeks before the Democratic convention in 1992?
It was then that Mr. Clinton set about introducing himself to the public and making clear the themes of his campaign, particularly through the release of "Putting People First," the paperback book that contained an agenda of promises for his Presidency.
For his part in this campaign, Mr. Dole has sought to pump it up, working the talk-show circuit and going on an eight-city swing after leaving the Senate last month. But so far, even his aides acknowledge that he has adopted a decidedly low-profile approach, such as presiding over a reissue of his eight-year-old book, "Unlimited Partners," which includes three short new chapters but no major policy prescriptions.
It is a strategy that is beginning to stir concern among his aides while feeding the sense of confidence at the White House.
One of Mr. Dole's associates said this morning that by his count, the candidate had made only two significant policy pronouncements over the past two months.
Another senior adviser said in a moment of frustration that Mr. Dole, in an address highlighting his first national swing after leaving the Senate, neglected to deliver what aides had viewed as some of the speech's most newsworthy attacks on Mr. Clinton. The adviser urged a reporter to make note of that in a newspaper article, so that it might nudge Mr. Dole to be more diligent about reading his speeches.
"That the candidate was not using the material that was to be used on the trip was not helpful to the campaign's interest," said this aide.
Mr. Dole's two-day trip to the West Coast this week was the latest example of his low-altitude campaign. While he has repeatedly proclaimed California to be critical to his election hopes, he scheduled no speeches and appeared only at a book signing and two fund-raising events on Tuesday, one in San Francisco and one here.
They were extremely successful by financial standards (he netted about $2.5 million). But they raised barely a blip on this state's media screen. The Los Angeles Times, for example, relegated the candidate's fund-raising event here to a brief mention in an article on page A5 that was otherwise devoted to Mr. Dole's latest pronouncements on the tobacco industry. Those remarks were made before he arrived here, in a pre-taped interview on the NBC News program "Today" that was part of a plan to introduce America to Bob Dole's life story through his reissued book.
In addition to signing copies of their co-biography at a Borders bookstore, Mr. Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, also met for 30 minutes with former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, in Mr. Reagan's 34th-floor suite of offices here.
While in other years that might have been an event of political significance, this year it was not. Mr. Dole's California advisers characterized it as a gesture of respect to Mr. Reagan, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and thus can provide Mr. Dole with little more than a shared photograph.
"We had coffee and a good visit, and it reminded me of the great things that President Reagan had done for America," Mr. Dole said. "Tax cuts. A good economy. A strong defense. It was sort of a shot in the arm."
Mr. Dole's aides are concerned by the recent drift in the campaign, though they are not at a loss to explain why it has happened. "There's been a hangover to leaving the Senate," one of Mr. Dole's associates said today. "For a while, the campaign was used to the Senate being the backbone of our policy effort. And now that's gone."
One Dole adviser said the campaign had assembled a new division in charge of policy, to help formulate positions that Mr. Dole could take to run against Mr. Clinton -- but aides said they did not expect it to begin showing fruit until later this month.
In 1992, Mr. Clinton's aggressive strategy was in direct response to what he saw as the politically ruinous mistakes of the previous Democratic Presidential candidate, former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who spent part of the summer of 1988 touring the western part of his state.
Even when Mr. Dole's appearances have not been designed to make news, the candidate has generated unwelcomed coverage with unplanned remarks about divisions in his party over abortion and his views on the addictiveness of tobacco. The comments on both subjects came out of the interviews that were meant to highlight his life story.
Still, Mr. Dole has mostly resisted the efforts of his aides to push him to move quickly to adopt a message or a theme. "We will have an agenda and it will be my agenda," Mr. Dole promised in San Francisco. "It won't be a House agenda or a Senate agenda. I'm the candidate for President. It will be my agenda."

HEADLINE: Meadville Journal;
For Russians, Holiday Spirit Is Dusted Off

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: MEADVILLE, Pa., July 3

 BODY:
Most years here in Meadville, July 4 was little more than a date on the calendar to separate July 3 and 5. Family barbecues and picnics were not uncommon, and flags waved here and there. But as Independence Day, it never generated much in the way of community celebrations or spirit.
This year, that is all changed. And it took only 135 Russians to do it. 
 After giving the world the Talon zipper, Sharon Stone and Anthony Marceca, Meadville today was wrapping up plans for its first major Fourth of July extravaganza, a day filled with festivities built around afternoon football games between teams of grade-school boys from Meadville and teams of Russian visitors from the Children's League of American Football, based in Moscow. An 80-unit parade through downtown is scheduled for Thursday morning, a fireworks display for Thursday night.
"I think it's wonderful," said Donna Zimmerman, whose family is fully involved with the Russians' five-day visit. Her husband, Mark, is Meadville's defensive coordinator. Their 11-year-old son, Colin, is a defensive end. Their daughters, Kelsey, 13, and Erica, 9, will be water girls. And two Russian players, Dima Kotlyarenko, 12, and Yuri Ignatkov, 14, are staying at their house.
Mrs. Zimmerman was so eager to have her family join dozens of others in the area who are providing room and board for the visiting youngsters that she took time off from her job as a hairdresser.
"I wouldn't have traded this week for anything," she said, dismissing the chaos of having two more boys running around her house and Rollerblading at all hours around the neighborhood. "This has been a great experience. We're learning a lot about them, and they're learning about our community. Last Fourth of July, we probably just had a picnic."
Since the Russians arrived here in northwestern Pennsylvania last week, it has been hard to wander around town and not sense a difference. Some streets have been lined with small American flags for days. The town's daily newspaper, The Meadville Tribune, is filled with articles about the visitors. A 24-hour cable station has been broadcasting lessons in Russian for weeks.
"Usually, all we get are Canadians or people from another state," said Nancy Schultz, who sells flowers on a sleepy downtown sidewalk underneath a sign that says "Welcome" in English and Russian. "You don't see Russians very often."
Meadvillagers generally agree that none of this would have happened had it not been for Ken O'Keefe and his ambitious idea to export American football to Russia. As head coach at Allegheny College, a small liberal-arts college in Meadville that produces unusually good Division III football teams, he led a group of conference all-stars to Moscow in 1992 for an exhibition game against the Moscow Bears, a team in Russia's only American-style amateur football league.
Through that trip, Mr. O'Keefe met several Bears who wanted to expand the game in Russia. But the only way they could do that, they told him, was to teach young Russians how to play the game. Within a year, the Children's League was formed.
As Meadville and Moscow coaches traded visits over the next two years, plans were made to bring two teams of Russian boys here for a tour that would include a Friendship Bowl, two games with teams from Meadville's Little Gridders League.
The efforts of the coaches from both countries have helped American-style football in Moscow grow from a ragtag playground activity to an organized sport in six city schools. "Nearly 350 kids play now," said Viktor Ivanov, a founder of the Children's League who used to play offensive and defensive line for the Moscow Bears.
The coaching trips also paid dividends for Meadville, a town of 14,000 that is 91 miles north of Pittsburgh and 40 miles south of Lake Erie. Once a thriving manufacturing and railroad center, it began suffering in the 1960's like other Rust Belt cities, with plants closing and jobs moving out.
"We got hit hard from 1965 on," said Mayor Anthony G. Petruso. After a downturn, the city's economy began rebounding only recently with Meadville's growth as a center for companies that make precision machinery. Meadville's nickname is Tool City.
Business is better in part because of Meadville's ability to attract foreign companies to the area. Through the football connection to Moscow, Mr. Petruso said, Russian business leaders have expressed interest in Meadville products.
With local McDonald's restaurants and the National Football League donating money and equipment for this year's games, efforts are already under way to raise money to send Meadville teams to Moscow for next summer's Friendship Bowl. The event is being planned to coincide with Moscow's 850th birthday, and Mr. Ivanov said the Russians could hardly wait.
After a Fourth of July here, what better way to celebrate there?

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan's Top Bureaucrat for Banking Is Out

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
The Japanese Finance Ministry said today that the head of its banking bureau, who has drawn criticism on several fronts, would retire this year, while the director general of its international finance bureau, who has helped the dollar rebound against the yen, would remain at his position.
The two officials were the focus of the ministry's annual shuffling of top bureaucrats. In Japan it is the professional bureaucrats, not the politically appointed Cabinet ministers, who make many important policy decisions. 
 The director general of the banking bureau, Yoshimasa Nishimura, will retire after a two-year term, Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said. Mr. Nishimura, 55, angered American regulators last fall, when he acknowledged that the ministry waited six weeks before notifying them that Daiwa Bank had incurred $1.1 billion in losses from unauthorized bond trading in New York.
The ministry and its banking bureau have also been criticized for the handling of the Japanese debt crisis. This country's financial institutions are burdened with at least $300 billion in bad debt.
Public anger at the ministry increased a couple of weeks ago when Parliament approved a plan to liquidate insolvent housing-loan companies, using more than $6 billion in tax money.
Mr. Nishimura will be succeeded by Kimio Yamaguchi, the head of the ministry's securities division.
At the international finance bureau, the director general, Eisuke Sakakibara, will retain his position, which he has held for about a year. Known as "Mr. Yen," the 55-year-old Mr. Sakakibara is seen as having helped increase the dollar's value to a two-year high against the Japanese currency -- talking up the dollar and orchestrating dollar purchases on the exchange markets.
A weaker yen helps the Japanese economy. As the yen's value declines, Japanese exports become less expensive in terms of other currencies and foreign sales denominated in the other currencies convert into more yen.
Traders had expected the ministry to retain Mr. Sakakibara because the Japanese economy has yet to achieve full recovery.
The concern about the economy was illustrated today when the central bank's governor, Yasuo Matsushita, reiterated that the bank would keep interest rates low for now because the recovery was continuing at only a moderate pace. Mr. Matsushita, who made similar comments on Monday, spoke at the end of a two-day meeting of the bank's branch managers.
Mr. Sakakibara of the Finance Ministry has also led Japan in talks with the United States on liberalizing the Japanese insurance market. The two sides have remained at odds and have set a July 31 deadline for an agreement to be reached.

HEADLINE: Nagasaki Journal;
Today's History Lesson: What Rape of Nanjing?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: NAGASAKI, Japan

 BODY:
The greatest danger, Mizuro Fukushima warned gravely, his eyes gleaming fiercely, is that naive schoolchildren may come to believe that the United States dropped the atomic bomb because Japan had done something wrong.
What has incensed Mr. Fukushima is one tiny exhibit in a beautiful new museum that opened on April 1 in the city of Nagasaki, near where the second atomic bomb exploded in 1945, three days after the first bomb obliterated Hiroshima. The museum is wrenching to tour, with its life-size photos of burned and screaming babies, panoramas of charred corpses, images of teen-agers with their ears melted off. 
 Yet in an out-of-the-way corner that few visitors pass through another kind of photo was displayed. Black and white and blurry, it supposedly depicts the Nanjing massacre in 1937-38, when Japanese troops are said to have killed tens of thousands of Chinese civilians.
Nagasaki has no special connection to the atrocity at Nanjing; the photo was meant to be a reminder that Japan was not entirely an innocent victim of World War II. But this suggestion has so outraged nationalists that the furor has reached the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo.
"Many students visit the museum, and they don't have much experience in life," declared Mr. Fukushima, 67, a leader of a new group called the Citizens Association to Rectify the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. "They think what they see is true. And in this museum they could think that we were bombed because we did bad things."
[The nationalists have won the first round, for the offending photo of a woman being jostled was taken down late in June on the orders of the Mayor and replaced by an even more innocuous picture from the period, with a caption noting that it shows Chinese refugees leaving Nanjing -- but not explaining why they would want to leave.]
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, bowing to nationalist demands, has agreed to instruct the Foreign Ministry and the Education Ministry to investigate whether photos of Japanese military aggression in museums around Japan are authentic or fabricated.
The battle for control over Japan's history underscores the traumas that Japan faces in trying to come to grips with its past. While Germany has repeatedly apologized for the horrors it committed in World War II, Japan has always seemed -- to some Japanese scholars as well as to foreigners -- to harbor the disconcerting conviction that it was more a victim of the war than its cause.
It is not just that Japan paid only 1 percent as much in war reparations as Germany, or that in 1957 Japan elected as Prime Minister a man who had been imprisoned as a Class A war criminal. Rather, what most galls neighboring countries is that Japan still seems unwilling to confront its wartime past, in museums or school textbooks, and that the Government, despite general apologies, denies any financial responsibility to wartime sex slaves now living their final years in poverty in South Korea and other countries.
These issues are not just of historical significance, for they explain why many Koreans and Chinese today voice deep distrust, even hatred, for Japan. What divides Asia today, as much as anything, is the past.
"Even now, after 50 years, it's as if the war isn't over," said Akiyoshi Eguchi, the curator of the new Nagasaki museum. "It's the same with the Americans, with the Smithsonian, and it's the same with us."
Mr. Eguchi was referring to the uproar last year over the Smithsonian Institution's plans for an exhibition about the atomic bombs. American veteran groups bitterly opposed anything casting doubt on the decision to use nuclear weapons, and in the end the Smithsonian canceled plans to show anything more controversial than the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
The Nagasaki museum goes to the other extreme: it is devoted almost entirely to the horror that began on 11:02 A.M. on Aug. 9, 1945, when the bomb called "fat man" exploded over a suburb of Nagasaki inhabited disproportionately by outcasts called burakumin. Because discussions of burakumin are taboo in Japan, the fact that they were victims is never mentioned in the museum.
Only about 1.5 percent of the museum's floor space is devoted to the nook that is supposed to provide some historical balance. Because the area is near the exit and is off the main path, Mr. Eguchi acknowledged that few visitors see it.
Most of the space is taken up by a time chart, noting such moments as when Japan occupied Korea or when, in its words, "Nanjing was occupied and the Nanjing massacre happened."
The passing reference to the Nanjing massacre does not mention that many more people may have died there at Japanese hands than were killed by the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. While the bomb killed about 74,000 people, the most common figure for the death toll in Nanjing is 200,000.
That may be on the high side, for some contemporary accounts by missionaries and other Westerners use much lower estimates, especially when discussing only the city of Nanjing and not the surrounding towns and villages. But historians, including those in Japan, are virtually united that an extraordinary blood bath took place at the hands of the Japanese Army in Nanjing, and several studies suggest that over all the Japanese forces may have been responsible for the deaths of more than 10 million Chinese during the war years.
Sunao Nishi, 76, the chairman of the nationalist group that opposes the museum exhibit, offers a different view. Mr. Nishi served in the imperial army in Manchuria, in northeastern China, and he insists that stories of a Nanjing massacre were fabricated, that the Imperial Army did not force foreign women to be sex slaves for its troops, and that Japan was the greatest victim of World War II.
"Japanese troops absolutely did not kill Chinese in Manchuria," Mr. Nishi said, glowering.
The nationalists note that the photo that the museum uses to depict the Rape of Nanjing first surfaced in an American wartime propaganda film, and they cite inconsistencies like a cartridge belt that Japanese troops are not believed to have worn at the time. So they insist that the picture was fabricated.
Mr. Nishi and the other nationalists do not seem anti-American, but they are wary of critical publicity. They agreed to meet a reporter for an interview at a Shinto shrine in Nagasaki -- and then arranged for the Shinto priest to conduct a ritual to purify the visitor. After the 20-minute cleansing and blessing by the Shinto gods, the nationalists cheerfully sat down to make their case.
"By showing something unrelated, the exhibit is detracting from the purpose of the atomic bomb museum," said Mr. Fukushima, sitting in a conference room at the shrine. He also makes the argument, widely felt in Japan, that regardless of what Japan did, use of nuclear weapons was unjustified. He fears the museum undercuts that argument and could lead children to conclude that Japan did bad things and thus that the atomic bombing was morally justifiable.
Shigetoshi Iwamatsu, a survivor of the bombing and a retired economics professor, disagrees passionately, saying that people now go through the museum without understanding why the United States would possibly want to bomb Japan.
"It's not as if America would have suddenly dropped an atomic bomb on us out of the blue if Japan had been peaceful and as if Japan and America had had a healthy relationship," Mr. Iwamatsu said dryly.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The photo, supposed to depict the Nanjing massacre, was part of a Nagasaki museum display reminding visitors that Japan was not wholly innocent in World War II. Nationalists were upset and the photo has been removed. "It's as if the war isn't over." said Akiyoshi Eguchi, the curator, seen with the display. (Photographs by Nicholas D.

HEADLINE: Amid Flags and Fireworks, New Meanings of Patriotism

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SYCAMORE, Ill., July 3

 BODY:
From urban high-rises and suburban cul-de-sacs, and from so many front porches in this Midwestern small town, American flags have unfurled, an enduring portrait of the nation, dressed for the Fourth of July.
Patriotism in the United States, it seems clear on its 220th birthday, remains a high civic virtue. 
 Still, judging from dozens of conversations in this old, rock-ribbed county seat 60 miles west of Chicago, Americans are grappling to define patriotism in a changing world. At one time, to be a patriot was to stand up against those who were against America.
And Sycamore is the kind of working-class town that has traditionally sacrificed more than its share of sons to the battlefields.
But since the fall of communism, the absence of a superpower enemy and the advent of an all-volunteer armed forces, Americans' feelings about their own country have little to do with battlefields and are no longer so easy to define.
They have become complicated by domestic debates about issues like race, immigration and environmentalism.
"You can't narrow it down to just our country anymore -- it's the whole planet," said Connie Ellis, a 43-year-old waitress at Marion's, a restaurant here. "Isolationism doesn't work anymore. If they cut down rain forests in South America, everybody else is affected."
To Rick Chandler, 41, who works with emotionally troubled children, patriotism "doesn't mean fireworks, and it doesn't mean the flag."
Sensible, hard-headed patriotism, he said, means making the decisions that are best for the country, like restricting immigration.
"Our economy just can't support many more immigrants," Mr. Chandler said. "There just aren't enough jobs. I don't blame the illegals; I'd do the same thing. And the hypocrisy of it is the wealthy people who are hiring them.
"And on top of everything else, we're running out of our natural resources," he continued. "When I was a kid, we had a population of a little over 200 million, and now it's heading toward 300 million."
But Kevin Mathey, a 43-year-old bricklayer and school board member, saw hypocrisies, and more than a little irony, in a nation of immigrants slamming the door shut.
"People came to this country from Europe because of religious persecution, and now the religious right wants to dictate the way people should believe," he said. "And then people want to put up gates and fences around our borders," fearing that an influx of newcomers will mean native-born Americans will be forced to do with less.
It might be, Mr. Mathey said, that people already in America will make sacrifices.
"But that's how it has always been," he said. "Look at our area. The Swedes came in and took up all this good farmland. The Irish came and took jobs away from blacks. And the Germans came in and took away jobs in bricklaying and the other trades."
In the middle of the 19th century, there must surely have been some debates about patriotism around here, when abolitionists in Sycamore helped start a link on the Underground Railroad, which helped blacks flee slavery in the South.
A farm-and-factory town, Sycamore in recent years has been slouching toward suburbia.
Fred Sibley, 58, who runs the Sycamore Veterans Home, a club for those who have served in the armed forces, said he recalled many people here refusing to buy any Japanese products after the war.
"They had been the enemy, and there were people who wanted nothing to do with them," he said. "People can't really operate like that anymore. We're in a world market now."
Gene Massey, 41, who owns Marion's, lamented that many Americans, especially the young, do not understand the significance of the words in the Declaration of Independence.
"You ask most kids about Independence Day, and they don't even know what it is," said Mr. Massey, who served in the Air Force at Rheinmain Air Base, in Frankfurt, Germany, where he watched the American hostages flown from Iran in 1981 to the safety of the Germany base. "You ask them about the Fourth of July, and they say, 'fireworks.' "
Joe Monachello, a 29-year-old excavator, said most people his age do not have a real sense of patriotism. "I'm not sure what it means, to be honest," said Mr. Monachello, who added that he flies a flag outside his farmhouse, but not out of patriotism. "I do it for esthetic reasons, it just looks good on an old farmhouse."
The percentage of young men who have served in the military has been declining. Among the majority who have never served, criticism over President Clinton's avoidance of the Vietnam War would seem unlikely to resonate. In fact, not even the veterans here said they would vote against Mr. Clinton solely because of the Vietnam issue.
Ray Byro, 75, who fought in World War II on the islands of Attu and Kiska, off the coast of Alaska, said he takes Mr. Clinton's youthful actions "with a grain of salt." In fact, he faults the press for pounding away on the subject.
"You don't have to have served in the military to be patriotic," said Mr. Byro, noting that none of his children joined the armed forces.
"Patriotism today, I think, just means treating people with respect," he said. "If you respect other people, everything falls into place. You respect your neighbors, and you end up naturally respecting your country."
But in general, it seems, people here still have a deep appreciation for battlefield valor.
This is a town, after all, that held a Victory Day last August in commemoration of triumph in World War II, with a disk jockey in the street outside the veteran's club playing war-era tunes, like "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in Her Stockin'.)" The veterans club festoons State Street downtown with American flags on all the major holidays, starting with Martin Luther King Day in January, and running through Veterans Day in November.
Just last week, the local newspaper reported proudly that Marc Thomas, the grandson of a late, prominent clergyman here, and an outstanding high school athlete in the 1970's, had served as a flight nurse on a NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
Recounting some acts of patriotism, Linda Lewis, a 47-year-old waitress at Marion's, was thinking about an army of a different sort -- the Salvation Army.
"There was a flood in the trailer park where I live, and right away, there was help -- people giving away brooms, giving away cleaning supplies, giving away something to eat," she said. "They helped keep my community together. That's patriotism."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says Recycling Law Is Already Met

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
A day after declaring the city's recycling law an impossible standard to live by, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani altered his argument yesterday and said the city already recycles enough to meet the law's mandated levels.
The Mayor reasoned that abandoned automobiles and trash from construction sites should be counted as recycled goods. By including all those old cars and crumpled pieces of wallboard, he said the city would meet the requirement for recycled materials under the law. 
 "We will, not easily, but just about meet and maybe exceed the tonnage level for recycling," the Mayor said yesterday. The law now counts only the paper, glass, plastic and aluminum recyclables put out by homeowners and apartment dwellers.
"New York City, because of an overzealous approach to this, calculated its percentage of recycling in the narrowest possible way for any jurisdiction of America," Mr. Giuliani contended during a meeting with reporters today. "There are whole areas of recycling that aren't being considered."
The Mayor said that construction debris, for example, is used at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, saving the city about $7 million a year. Sanitation officials explained that the debris is ground up into gravel to create the landfill's roads. And since it is being put to a new use, even if it is at the landfill, Mr. Giuliani said it should be considered recycled.
About 30,000 abandoned cars were towed from the city's streets last year and sold to junkyards, which in turn crushed the cars and sold them as scrap metal.
Sanitation officials have urged City Council leaders for months to reconsider their definition of recycling to include new categories, but the Mayor had seemed unaware of that tactic when he railed against the recycling law on Tuesday. His earlier comments were made in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups asking the State Supreme Court to enforce the city's recycling mandates.
The recycling law, which was passed by the City Council in 1989, requires the city to recycle 25 percent of its residential garbage, or 4,250 daily tons, by July 14. The city now recycles only about 14 percent, or about 2,200 daily tons.
Council leaders have said, however, that while they are willing to negotiate a new timetable and possibly even new levels, they will not remove the mandates or change the definition of recycling.
"This is not a new law and it's designed to address residential recycled materials," said Stanley E. Michels, the chairman of the Council's Committee on Environmental Protection. "We're not going to let the Mayor make up the residential tonnage by adding construction and demolition materials. That would be totally disingenuous."
Mr. Michels, a Democrat of Manhattan, said that the Giuliani administration had not made a serious attempt to maintain the city's recycling program, much less increase it. The Mayor cut the recycling budget this year by $29 million, wiping out its education program and cutting the number of recycling collections throughout the city.
Even as Mr. Giuliani maintained yesterday that under his interpretation of the law, the city already meets required recycling levels, he continued to condemn the law as irresponsible and harmful to the recycling industry.
"The mandated recycling targets that were established five or six years ago have turned out to be a terrible mistake because we cannot mandate the law of supply and demand," he said. The Mayor repeated his assertion that increasing the city's residential recycling to 25 percent from 14 percent would flood the recycling market and thus destroy the industry.
The Mayor again said he would urge the Council to abolish the mandates. "The city shouldn't have unrealistic recycling mandates that have to be satisfied, because the mandates destroy the recycling market," he said.
Gordon M. Boyd, a solid waste management consultant based in Albany who has been on the State Solid Waste Management Board since 1989, agreed in part, saying the city ideally should have a recycling program that can respond to a changing and sometimes volatile market.
"Declaring a 25 percent mandate is not the best way to say you're going to stay flexible," he said. "Being bound to it can be harmful. The challenge is to have a program that can grow, but grow economically."
He said, however, that the Mayor's fears of destroying the recycling market were probably unfounded because the market had responded well to the city's recycling tonnage. It grew steadily until about two years ago, when it hit 15 percent and then dropped to 14 percent.
"Industries have moved to the Northeast because of the increasing supply of recyclable materials," he said. "The supply from the city, as it became reliable, actually helped make the industry."
Mr. Michels said the Mayor's comments could prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy seriously damaging the city's recycling efforts.
"The message he is sending is the worst thing that's been done to recycling since the law was passed in 1989," he said. "By knocking recycling, he's demoralizing people. Instead of encouraging people to recycle, he's discouraging them."
The Mayor insisted, however, that he was not opposed to recycling.
"I support recycling," he said. "I think New York City should move in the direction of recycling, but it should do that sensibly, intelligently."

HEADLINE: I. D. Robbins Is Dead at 86; Pioneer in Low-Cost Homes

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
I. D. Robbins, a civic reformer and builder whose vision of low-cost single-family homes became reality for thousands of families in once-blighted areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 86 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Long a prominent figure in the life of the city, as president of the City Club, as a newspaper columnist and as a commentator on politics, housing, minimum wage and civil rights, Mr. Robbins was best known as the father of the Nehemiah housing plan. 
 The plan was named by Johnny Ray Youngblood, a popular East New York Baptist minister, for the Old Testament prophet sent by the King of Persia to Jerusalem in 420 B.C. to help rebuild the city after the Babylonian captivity.
But long before the name came the idea. Mr. Robbins, in his 70's -- an age when most people have retired -- was writing a weekly column on public affairs for The Daily News.
As a successful builder, he was convinced that good single-family homes -- the simple row houses that were the original house of Eastern big cities -- could be constructed in New York at half the prevailing cost.
"What you need to do is build new neighborhoods, and high density will never give you a neighborhood," Mr. Robbins said, referring to the customary government-subsidized housing projects. "Single-family is the way to go, because families take pride in their homes."
Mr. Robbins figured that with 25 percent of its annual income, a family earning $20,000 a year could carry a mortgage and own one of the homes he envisioned at a cost of $40,000 or so.
Mr. Robbins persuaded the editor of The Daily News to let him present his idea in the paper's Sunday magazine. When the five pages appeared, with floor plans and architectural renderings, thousands of enthusiastic letters poured in.
One letter, from the Industrial Areas Foundation, established by the Chicago housing advocate Saul Alinsky, asked if Mr. Robbins was willing to put his theory into practice. With the help of the foundation, 36 congregations banded together in an ecumenical effort called East Brooklyn Churches, and an $8 million revolving fund for construction was raised.
So without Federal assistance, on Oct. 31, 1982, ground was broken in Brownsville for the first Nehemiah home: a three-bedroom, brick town house that sold for $39,000.
"This is what people want," Mr. Robbins said as he showed off the model houses in 1983. "They come around here and they weep for these houses."
Using high-volume techniques established on Long Island at the end of World War II by the Levitt family, the Nehemiah homes rose on large tracts of cleared, city-owned land, like suburbs within the city. Foundations were poured for whole blocks at a time. The dwellings would win no architectural competitions, but they were efficient: 18 feet wide and 32 feet deep, with 1,500 square feet of living space, front and rear yards and full basements.
To cut costs further, Mr. Robbins persuaded city officials to allow him to link all his sewer connections to one pipe instead of connecting each home to the sewer line. This enabled him to make a single cut to the existing sewers, saving about $6,000 a house. He used prefabricated components, from roof trusses to window frames, to speed construction and reduce costs.
And best of all, he held what builders call the soft costs -- the legal, architectural and financing charges needed to make housing a reality -- to 6 percent of the total, instead of the usual 35 percent or so.
Roughly 40 percent of the first 1,000 buyers came from nearby public housing projects.
Other Nehemiah houses went up in East New York and the South Bronx, and eventually 2,800 families realized the dream Mr. Robbins had had for them.
But despite interest from all over the country, Mr. Robbins's plans to expand the program into the South Bronx and the Arverne section of the Rockaways encountered political opposition. Clear blocks became unavailable; communities bristled at the idea of outside developers.
In an article he wrote for the summer issue of The Real Estate Finance Journal not long before his death, Mr. Robbins said: "Why do public officials seem to favor market-cost housing over the same housing at half of market cost? There are probably as many reasons as there are political and personal motivations. Those with political power may not like the sponsors, or they prefer to pick the brokers, lawyers, developers, contractors, architect or sales staff or want to be able to designate builders who are willing to let them choose the buyers.
"Above everything else, politicians insist on their major prerogative, the absolute control of the land, what should be used, how it should be used and who gets to use it."
I. D. Robbins was born in Pittsburgh on Dec. 1, 1910. To the end, there remained some question about what the I. D. stood for. According to Mr. Robbins's son Anthony, Mr. Robbins said he was named Isaac David, but when someone said to his parents, "Why are you calling him Isaac? Call him Irving," he spent his childhood as Irving, although he said his birth certificate was never changed. In any event, he spent his adult life as I. D., and friends called him that or Robby.
Mr. Robbins studied for a time at the University of Pittsburgh and moved to New York in 1933. In the years that followed, he was, among other things, a reporter for Hearst's Evening Journal and a public relations representative.
In 1948, he joined his cousin Lester Robbins, a New Jersey builder who was putting up more than a thousand houses a year. Mr. Robbins took charge of sales, financing and mortgages before branching out into construction.
His major projects included the Big Six Towers, built for New York Typographical Union No. 6 in Woodside, Queens, and comprising housing for a thousand families and a shopping center. He also built the 37-acre refrigerated complex that became the city's principal meat, provisions and poultry distribution center at the Hunts Point Cooperative Market in the Bronx.
As president of the nonpartisan City Club of New York, Mr. Robbins, an independent Democrat, revitalized the good-government organization after World II with his writings in its monthly newsletter, City Club Comments.
In 1965, he resigned as president of the City Club and sought the Republican and Democratic nominations for Mayor, but he stepped aside in favor of John V. Lindsay, who ended the 12-year tenure of Robert F. Wagner.
Mr. Robbins is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Carolyn Marx; two sons, Anthony, of Boston, and John, of Sacramento, Calif.; two sisters, Dorothy Good and Madlynne Harris, both of Pittsburgh, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: IN THE RED BELT;
Communists Pledge to Fight On . . .

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: TAMBOV, Russia, July 3

 BODY:
In this Communist stronghold, Gennadi A. Zyuganov's supporters do not intend to gently fade away.
"We will stay in the opposition," vowed Mikhail F. Kosykh, the First Secretary of the Communist Party here and a member of the Russian Parliament, contemplating his candidate's defeat by President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 For months Yeltsin supporters have predicted that this election would sound the death knell of the Communist movement. The Communist Party, they said, might splinter under the pressure of defeat.
But the Communists said they took comfort from their victory tonight here in what Russians call the Red Belt, a zone of impoverished farm villages and decrepit defense plants stretching west of the Volga River. And they sounded a defiant note.
With most of the ballots counted tonight in the Tambov region, Mr. Zyuganov was outpolling Mr. Yeltsin by about 60 percent to 35 percent, in dramatic contrast to the national trend. Even some Yeltsin supporters worry that such disenchanted precincts as this could provide a base for obstruction to continued reforms.
Valery N. Koval, Tambov's liberal Mayor, whose pro-free-market views place him in a distinct minority, said he expects to see more strikes as the Communists try to complicate Mr. Yeltsin's second term.
As the returns spelled out their national defeat tonight, Communists here refused to accept that they had been beaten by their failure to reach beyond their traditional support -- older voters, rural residents, and workers displaced by economic changes -- to a broader base.
Mr. Kosykh and others cited Mr. Yeltsin's domination of the media and his free-spending campaign.
"If the mass media in Russia operated like the mass media in the United States, we would have heard a lot more about Yeltsin's health problems," Mr. Kosykh said.
They also said they were surprised when Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general, joined Mr. Yeltsin's team after placing third in the first round of presidential voting.
They said they had counted on collecting much of Mr. Lebed's following in today's runoff, and complained bitterly that Mr. Lebed had sold out for a place as Mr. Yeltsin's national security adviser.
Striving to put the most hopeful face on a stinging defeat, the Communists here predicted that the economy will falter in coming months, driving the electorate back to them.
In the meantime, they vowed to resist Mr. Yeltsin's capitalist reforms in the Parliament, where they still control the largest bloc of votes, and concentrate on local elections later this year to build their base for a future national challenge.
Mayor Koval, the Yeltsin enthusiast, said the President's best defense against a Communist resurgence here would be to move quickly on two fronts -- expanding agricultural reforms to put more land quickly into private hands, and strengthening the social safety net to protect those victimized by free markets.
He said Mr. Yeltsin's spurt of activity in the last few months, including a land-reform bill and expansive promises to pensioners and the poor, had prevented an even more embarrassing defeat in Tambov.
"What Yeltsin has accomplished in the last three months is fantastic," he said. "But imagine what he might have accomplished if he had started doing this one year ago instead of turning into a Kremlin hermit."
No province may pose a greater political challenge for Mr. Yeltsin than the Tambov region, some 300 miles southeast of Moscow.
Mr. Yeltsin dispatched his wife to the region in May for a tour of local hospitals and schools. But Mr. Zyuganov still beat Mr. Yeltsin in the first round on June 16 by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
Some officials attribute the Communist strength here to their superior organizational skills.
"There is really only one political party," said Nikolai I. Vorobyov, the head of the election commission for the Tambov region. "When we leave the office at 10 P.M., the Communist lights are still burning. They take elections seriously."
But the reason for the Communist gains in the countryside also include the fitful nature of agrarian reforms and the difficulty tradition-bound villagers have in making the jarring transition to a free market economy.
In some ways, Tambov and especially the farming villages that sprawl around it make an unlikely Communist stronghold.
Soon after the Russian Revolution, much of this Tambov area was also a hotbed of anti-Soviet sentiment. The Soviets brutally suppressed a peasant revolt between 1918 and 1921, when farmers fought Bolshevik attempts to requisition their food.
The cherished traditions of the region also suffered under Soviet rule.
In the farming settlement of Selezni, just outside Tambov, villagers recalled how the Russian Orthodox church, the largest in the region, was shut by Soviet authorities in 1938 and turned into a warehouse for grain and farm vehicles. Only after the collapse of the Soviet Union did the village receive permission to reopen the church and return the icons that had been stashed for decades in village homes for safekeeping.
But frightened by rising prices for fuel and food, most villagers cast their ballots for Mr. Zyuganov last month, and again today.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Some second thoughts arise on the benefits of immigration.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHILE the political system has long focused on whether heavy immigration is a burden and a threat, many economists have contended for years that foreign immigrants usually provide an overall benefit to the economy. But a new study from the Rand Corporation's Center for Research on Immigration Policy, "The Mixed Economic Progress of Immigrants," suggests that the economics profession is having some second thoughts.
The conclusions of the economists Robert Schoeni, Kevin McCarthy and George Vernez are cloaked in the cautious language of academia. Still, they confirm the fears of mainstream policy types. "The facts are clear," agrees Richard Freeman of Harvard: the economic success of immigrants varies sharply, with Mexicans and Central Americans lagging ever further behind the counterparts from Asia and Europe, as well as native-born Americans. Far less clear is what to do about it. 
 America, goes the old saw, is a nation of immigrants. It's no surprise, then, that many Americans are reluctant to close the doors to the teeming masses who could have been them. And in 1978 Barry Chiswick, an economist who now teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave them an economic rationale.
Mr. Chiswick found that new immigrants earned about 10 percent less than similarly educated native-born Americans. But after 13 years the gap had closed. And after 23 years in America, immigrants were actually earning 6 percent more than their counterparts -- testament to the view that immigrants, who tend to be more energetic than those who stay behind, enrich America economically as well as spiritually.
But these results were soon challenged by George Borjas, a Cuban-born economist now at the University of California at San Diego. He argued that Mr. Chiswick had misinterpreted the Census data, and has since amassed evidence that the economic quality of immigrants fell sharply in the 1960's with the tide of largely poor and uneducated arrivals from Latin America.
Mr. Borjas's view has now been firmly established by the Rand researchers. Average earnings of immigrant men fell from 99 percent of native-born workers in 1970 to 89 percent in 1990. More striking, the relative earnings of Chinese, Japanese and Korean immigrants have risen -- from 88 to 110 percent -- while that of Mexicans has fallen sharply, from 66 to 56 percent. Europeans and Canadians held their own with wages 10 to 20 percent higher than natives.
Education and age explain a lot here. Like those of younger and less skilled native-born Americans, the fortunes of immigrants from Mexico have been driven by the widening gap between blue and white-collar wages. But among the unskilled, immigrants are faring much worse: the earnings of foreign-born in the bottom 10th of the American work force have fallen to 63 percent from 94 percent of their counterparts'.
What's more, the wage gap between Latin American immigrants and native-born workers actually widens as both groups gain experience in the American job market. The dream of economic assimilation, a reality for most Asians, is plainly eluding a lot of Mexicans, who make up 21 percent of the immigrants counted in the 1990 Census.
Does all this mean that immigrants from Latin America are hurting the American economy? Not necessarily. They are making it cheaper to buy a wide range of goods and services -- everything from blue jeans to child care. But what's good for the middle class is not good for everyone: competition from low-skilled immigrants has exacerbated the problems of low-skilled native workers, who are already being short-changed in the labor market. Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, estimates that immigration has lowered the wages of native-born high school dropouts by roughly a third.
The other objection to immigration -- tellingly, the one that has gotten all the political mileage in tax-obsessed California -- is that immigrants are a burden on social services. Mr. Katz argues that the evidence here is very limited, but concedes there is every reason to believe that poor legal immigrants, like other poor Americans, are more likely to make use of the safety net.
The most frustrating aspect of the debate is that it is hardly a debate at all. The pro- and anti-immigration camps largely talk past each other, refusing to acknowledge that multifaceted problems demand nuanced solutions. Indeed, the one popular attack on current policy that treats the economic arguments with respect, Peter Brimelow's "Alien Nation (Harper Perennial), was denounced in The Wall Street Journal as "the natterings of a neo-nativist."
Mr. Katz, who wants a more selective immigration policy favoring highly skilled applicants, thinks the lack of informed debate and subsequent stalemate is ominous. "I worry that doing nothing will lead to harsh restrictions later on," he said.

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column on Thursday, about a debate on the economic benefits of immigration, misstated an estimate by Lawrence Katz of Harvard University on the impact of competition from immigrants on the wages of high school dropouts. He has estimated that competition accounts for a decline in their wages of roughly 3 percent, not one-third. Such a drop represents one-third of the relative decline of their wages in the last few decades.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Rising Number Of Black-White Marriages

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Marilyn Benoit, a black psychologist, recently went with her husband, who is white, to a concert in Reston, Va. Ms. Benoit was pleasantly surprised to see the number of interracial couples milling easily about the suburb, hardly drawing a curious, hostile or even a second glance.
"We were absolutely taken aback to see how interracial the scene in Reston was," said Ms. Benoit, who lives in Bethesda, Md. "There were lots of different couples, Asian and white, Indian and white, Hispanic and white, black and white -- lots of different kinds of mixtures. It was very refreshing." 
 And, a new study says, increasingly common among blacks and whites.
According to the study, the pace of marriage between blacks and whites in the United States is rapidly accelerating. The study noted that in 1993, of all new marriages by blacks, 12.1 percent were to white partners, up from 2.6 percent in 1970.
To be sure, the number of such couples remains small, amounting to, by one estimate, about 1 percent, or 500,000, of the nation's roughly 57 million married couples. And the percentage of blacks marrying outside their race remains much smaller than the proportion of Asians who do so or the number of Hispanics who wed outside their ethnic group.
But the new study indicates that at a time when many politicians, civil-rights leaders and others speak often and movingly of an American society of heightened racial polarization, intensified group solidarity and increased hostility between groups, more and more blacks and whites are doing a curious thing: falling in love with each other.
"One thing these figures show is that racism, at least in the mating game, is down," said Douglas J. Besherov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of the study along with Timothy S. Sullivan, an economics instructor at Southern Illinois University. "Notwithstanding whatever is happening in the public policy arena, when it's one-on-one, there just seems to be less racism."
The study was published this week in New Democrat magazine, a publication of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group.
Using Census Bureau figures, the authors calculated that in 1990, 5.9 percent of all married blacks were married to whites, up from 3.4 percent in 1980 and 1.7 percent in 1960. While marriages between black women and white men remain far more rare than the reverse, the number of black woman-white man couples jumped sharply in the 1980's, to 1.7 percent of all marriages with at least one black spouse in 1990, from .8 percent in 1980.
And Mr. Besherov's research indicates that the nature of interracial marriage is changing. In the past, Mr. Besherov said, interracial unions tended to occur later in life and were likely to be a second, third or later marriage. He theorizes that by waiting longer, these couples obviated the possibility of having and raising children, always the most problematic issue in an interracial marriage.
But the new study indicated that in 1990, 21.7 percent of white women married to black men were in other than their first marriage, down from 32.9 percent in 1985. In addition, the study found that 35.4 percent of white women married to black men said they planned to have children, a higher proportion than the 29 percent of white women married to white men who said they wanted chidren.
"The big thing we found is that these marriages have an equal propensity to having babies as did white-white marriages and black-black marriages," Mr. Besherov said. "It's no longer just two lonely people who just want to go on vacations to Mexico together."
The authors of the study note that the Census Bureau found in 1990 that nearly two million children live in homes where the primary adults were of different races, double the one million in 1980 and more than four times the number in 1970.
Mr. Besherov said the phenomenon was another indication that class is beginning to rival race as a major engine driving social trends in the country. As more blacks achieve higher education levels and middle-class economic status, their attractiveness to white middle-class suitors increases, he said.
"For the black middle class, things have never been better," Mr. Besherov said. "Their education levels are almost comparable to whites, their income levels are high. So the marriageability of African Americans is going up, economically and socially."
But the growing amount of black-white marriages could stem, in part, from society's failure as well. With an estimated 32 percent of black men age 20 to 29 -- the prime marrying age -- in detention or on parole or probation, and with the number of black women attending colleges greatly outpacing the number of black men, more and more black women say they feel they have little choice but to marry outside their race, if they are to find a compatible mate.
Indeed, the interracial marriage rate for black women is climbing faster than the rate for black men.
The study extrapolated trends using 1990 Census data, as well as data from the 1985, 1990 and 1995 Current Population surveys -- massive polls conducted by the Census Bureau -- and an analysis of marriage data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The report focused exclusively on black-white marriage, which Mr. Besherov said remains "the last taboo."
But, he said, when one examines the numbers for intermarriage between whites and Asians, and non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, "the numbers are just exploding."
While about 6 percent of black married men and 2 percent of black married women have spouses who are not black, according to the 1990 Census, 12 percent of married Asian men and 25 percent of married Asian women have wed a person who is not Asian.

HEADLINE: Holding Action in Hanoi

 BODY:
Vietnam's Communist Party ducked all the hard questions about its country's future this week. Instead of dealing with an aging leadership and the tensions produced by the development of a market economy in an authoritarian state, the Communists did some tinkering and left the difficult decisions for another day.
Top party and government leaders, though already well into their 70's, had their terms extended by the Party Congress. The debate between reformers who advocate further economic liberalization and conservatives who fear that will undermine party political control produced an unsatisfying and untenable commitment to more reforms and tightened controls. 
 These nondecisions may have helped preserve internal party unity. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 73, is a southerner and a strong advocate of reform. The Communist Party General Secretary, Do Muoi, 79, is a moderate, and President Le Duc Anh, 75, is a retired general and a voice for party and military traditionalists. But a prolonged failure to resolve policy and succession issues could prove costly to Vietnam's long-term economic prospects.
Just a year ago, Vietnam was among the hottest of emerging markets for American and other foreign investors. A decade of accelerating economic reforms had unleashed the energies of some 75 million people located at the heart of the booming Southeast Asian region. President Clinton had normalized diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi. Growth rates were high and government officials seemed eager to recruit new foreign investors, especially Americans.
Many of those positive factors remain, but there has been some disenchantment. Newly arriving investors have encountered frustrating licensing restrictions, uncooperative local joint-venture partners, politically motivated campaigns against foreign advertising, occasional instances of police harassment and widespread corruption.
Some of the difficulties are caused by greed. But others reflect the continuing tug-of-war between reformers and more restrictive elements of the Vietnamese regime. Foreign capital in Southeast Asia is highly mobile. Vietnam's so far impressive ability to attract and hold on to capital depends on its ability to address these problems swiftly and satisfactorily.
Instead the Party Congress emphasized unity over clarity. Unity has always been something of an obsession among Vietnamese Communists and has probably helped them survive into a post-Communist era. Nurturing the current economic boom will require something more. The issues avoided this week cannot be put off much longer.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
The market for family-size apartments on the Upper East Side is surging. Well, maybe.

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
A "HOT property" is not necessarily one that is soaring in market value.
For the last year, Manhattan real estate agents have said that the large family-size apartments on the Upper East Side and in a few other desirable locations are the hottest properties in town, complete with bidding wars and escalating prices. 
 But a new analysis by the Brown Harris Stevens real estate brokerage firm dispels at least part of that image: while seven- to eight-room apartments in the most prestigious locations -- their three bedrooms putting them in the family category in real estate brokers' language -- are selling fast, they do not always increase in price. At the same time, the study found, prices of other kinds of apartments -- including one-bedroom postwar units, which have surged ahead of their bargain-basement prices of the early 1990's -- have risen sharply in these neighborhoods.
The data in the Brown Harris report combined sales statistics from a number of prestigious areas, from Fifth Avenue to Third Avenue on the Upper East Side and parts of Beekman Place, Sutton Place, Gracie Square and Central Park West. Discussing the best-situated family-size apartments, the Brown Harris report found that "although average prices have certainly been higher than in the early 1990's, they are still lower than in 1988 and 1989, and there does not appear to be a consistent pattern of price increases since the market recovered in 1993."
Several real estate brokers did not dispute these general findings. Elizabeth Stribling, head of the Stribling & Associates brokerage firm, called the market for seven- and eight-room apartments "extra active and strong."
"There's not a great disparity between what the seller is asking and what the buyer is willing to pay," she said.
But she added: "There's not a spiraling leapfrogging. The great activity and quickness make the market feel like it's rising, but buyers are still quite conservative. The wildly overpriced apartments simply do not sell."
Part of the Brown Harris study, written by Hall F. Willkie, Brown Harris's executive vice president, and Lawrence Sicular, who heads appraisals for the firm, zeroed in on the Carnegie Hill neighborhood, an area they defined as being around Park Avenue from 86th to 96th Streets.
Mr. Sicular said Carnegie Hill was chosen as a focus of the report, part of a three-times-yearly newsletter just released, because it was thought to be "one of the most desirable, family-driven neighborhoods in the city." And it is one that brokers have heralded as one of Manhattan's fastest-moving residential neighborhoods, in terms of sales. But Mr. Sicular said he had been surprised by the more recent patterns he had found in the area.
In 1990, when homes were still selling well, the average seven- to eight-room apartment in Carnegie Hill sold for $1.17 million; by 1991, that figure had plummeted to $872,806. The next year it rose to $965,145, and in 1993, it squeaked by $1 million; the steady rise, despite a sluggish economy, probably gave birth to the industry's optimism for the neighborhood.
In 1994, prices rose a bit more, to $1.16 million, but in 1995 -- otherwise a strong year for residential real estate -- the average price eased to $1.1 million. For the first three months of 1996, the average was $972,500, but Mr. Sicular cautioned that there was not a significant enough sample for this year to make a judgment that prices had declined. Several brokers said the prices merely indicated the dwindling supply of good apartments of this size, explaining that the best apartments were snapped up last year and that few had come onto the market this year.
Still, the figures did not quite match the expectations generated by talk of bidding wars and price increases.
"From what we were hearing, we would have expected a significant increase -- 10 percent is a significant increase," Mr. Sicular said.
The statistics were gathered from sales in which Brown Harris represented buyers or sellers; from buildings operated by the managing-agent divisions of Brown Harris, Douglas Elliman, Gumley-Haft and American Landmark, and from sales figures gathered by Brown Harris's separate appraisal division. The number of apartments in the sample varied from 15 to 36 a year.
Though statistics seem to show that prices have, at the least, stabilized for seven- to eight-room apartments in Carnegie Hill, brokers caution that the market may only be pausing for air.
"Actually, our own statistics show prices going down for Carnegie Hill," said Barbara Corcoran of the Corcoran Group. "But that's because now the more luxurious three-bedroom apartments are in short supply, and that makes it appear prices have gone down.
"I think we've only covered 5 yards of the 50-yard dash," she said, predicting that prices would begin to rise again as more apartments came onto the market.
But Clark Halstead, head of the Halstead Property Company, which acquired the Carnegie Hill Properties brokerage firm several years ago, said that the big Carnegie Hill apartments might have reached their price limit.
"Carnegie Hill is the longtime primo family neighborhood," he said, "and prices may have risen too far, too fast; the neighborhood may be experiencing some price compression.
"After all, young families may not be the ones who are paying the most expensive prices."
Mr. Halstead said that while Carnegie Hill might have reached its natural price level for seven- and eight-room apartments, prices were still rising elsewhere on the Upper East Side.

HEADLINE: A Move to Hospitals-for-Profit Gaining Support in New York

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
With hospitals laying off record numbers of employees and falling behind in paying their bills, officials in New York's health care industry are contemplating something once considered unthinkable here: allowing public, profit-making companies to own hospitals in the state.
New York is the only state in the nation that bars such companies from owning and operating hospitals, and even mention of the possibility was once regarded as taboo. 
 But now at conferences and in boardrooms, in the Legislature and within the Governor's office, the topic is emerging as the next great battle in the effort to make New York's health care market more competitive.
"This issue has definitely moved from the back burner to the front," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group representing 172 not-for-profit hospitals and nursing homes in the metropolitan area and an opponent of allowing publicly traded hospital companies into the state. "Right now I would put the odds of this happening at the 50-50 range and climbing. It's the highest probability it's ever had."
Opponents have long contended that companies responsible to shareholders are bound to consider profits before patients. They fear that carpetbaggers will make decisions without knowing or caring about the communities in which the hospitals are situated. And they worry that if profits slacken, companies motivated by the bottom line will close hospitals swiftly and ruthlessly.
Supporters of change in the state's law say that experienced, for-profit companies will reinvigorate New York's financially troubled health-care market. By injecting much-needed capital and a sense of competition, proponents say, these companies, which have reshaped medical care across the country, will force hospitals here to deliver better care more efficiently.
Representatives of some of the largest publicly traded health care companies say they are waiting in the wings, reluctant to get caught up in what promises to be a bitter political fracas but ready to step in if the laws change.
Officials in the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki say he is eager to open the doors to publicly traded hospital companies, and that at the least he wants to see full debate on the issue. Now that legislators in Albany seem resolved to end regulation of hospital fees and to turn the system over to market forces, people in the health industry said they expect the discussion to heat up.
In addition, the plans for two significant mergers among hospitals in the city -- Mount Sinai Medical Center with New York University Medical Center, and Beth Israel Medical Center with Long Island Jewish Medical Center -- signal a streamlining of the market that experts say makes it prime for speculation by hospital chains.
Health care in New York is already dominated by publicly traded companies -- insurers, managed-care plans and consulting companies paid to manage struggling not-for-profit institutions -- and some in the industry question whether there is any longer a compelling reason to keep hospital chains at bay.
Mr. Raske says he understands why the issue has moved to the fore: cash-starved New York hospitals, facing revenue loss along with a drop in reimbursements from insurance companies, government programs and managed-care plans, need to seek out the capital that publicly traded companies can offer.
"I don't want to pre-empt my own lobbying," he said, "but we are clearly heading toward a more restrictive set of options. I'm not sure how much longer this state will hold out."
Of the country's roughly 6,500 hospitals, about 1,326 are owned by publicly traded companies, and the numbers are increasing as hospitals are bought, merged, closed, networked and consolidated.
 
Seeking Ways To Insure T.L.C.
There are 263 hospitals in New York state, most of them public and not-for-profit institutions scrambling to find ways to streamline and stay afloat during this tumultuous time in the industry.
Eight hospitals in the state -- all but one in the New York metropolitan area -- are private, for-profit institutions. They are owned, as stipulated by state law, by a group of known partners who were certified for good character and competence by the state Public Health Council. This system was intended to allow small, profit-making ventures whose owners were upright and had ties to the community that would encourage them to balance business ambitions with local concerns.
The law does not specifically prohibit publicly traded companies from owning and operating hospitals here. But by requiring that all owners be identified and screened, it is, in fact, impossible for such companies to own hospitals in New York; companies that trade on the stock market are technically owned by scores of thousands of people who buy and sell the stock and thus could not be vetted.
The law does, however, allow publicly traded companies to manage hospitals in New York (there are dozens) and it allows them to operate insurance companies and health maintenance organizations as well.
"The financing side has gained ascendancy and power over the delivery side," said James R. Tallon, president of United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropy group. "We are not the island of not-for-profit that some would like to portray us as being."
Instead of succumbing to the for-profit trend, said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Health Committee, the state should try to reverse it. "The rise of corporate H.M.O.'s needs to be answered," he said. "But not by turning hospitals into publicly traded commodities. I would do anything imaginable to avoid that route. I think we'd regret it. Health care in New York is better off because we have held off against this trend, and it scares me because I hear the tide of opinion beginning to turn."
Each year for the last 10 years, State Senator James J. Lack has introduced a bill that would allow investor-owned companies to buy hospitals in New York. By and large his efforts have been met with a sneer or dismissed as a pipe dream. This year for the first time, he said, he has found a flurry of interest that makes him think a real debate on the subject is about to begin.
"The dynamics in New York are changing," said Senator Lack, a Republican from Long Island. "It is hypocritical to say, on the one hand, it's O.K. for profit-making managed-care companies to operate here, but no, not hospitals. I see cash-starved hospitals in my district scratching around for capital. Why shouldn't they be able to turn to these chains if they want to? Do all these opponents really think that New York is the only place in the country where there is good research and good health care? Do they really believe that if they open this gate, every hospital will be gobbled up by a chain? That's ridiculous."
Resistance to a change in the law is formidable. Opposition includes the New York State Catholic Conference, hospital trade associations, much of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly and unions representing hospital workers, many of whom fear that the rising number of layoffs will soar if investor-owned hospitals are sanctioned.
"It's a possibility, but it's wrong," said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents 400 not-for-profit hospitals and nursing homes. "With all these cuts in Washington and Albany, it's time to reinforce our commitment to charitable, not profitable, purposes. Institutions need to be more businesslike, not business-driven."
He said there was an important distinction between hospitals run with a profit in mind and those that are not: "For-profit hospitals are economic institutions with social implications. Not-for-profit hospitals are social institutions with economic implications."
 
Pataki Is Expected To Move for Change
State officials and some analysts of New York's health care market said that Governor Pataki would be championing the case of publicly traded hospitals more vocally but was loath to antagonize the Roman Catholic Church -- a staunch ally -- by spearheading a move it vigorously opposes as antithetical to the mission of ministering to the sick. But they said that when the issue is taken up more forcefully by the Legislature, he is expected to support a change.
In fact, said several people who helped formulate the administration's plan, when the Governor submitted his health care reform legislation earlier this year, he had wanted to include a provision enabling publicly traded companies to buy and operate hospitals. He agreed to drop the point when advisers warned him that the matter was so contentious it would hold up the rest of the package.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani stoked the debate two weeks ago when he announced plans to let a private, profit-making company from Delaware take over Coney Island Hospital, a tactic he said he hoped to repeat with other public hospitals.
And while that company, Primary Health Systems, does not sell its shares in the stock market, health care experts said that by bringing in an out-of-town, for-profit company, the Mayor was clearly urging a change in the law.
The State Health Commissioner, Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, who recently attended a daylong conference in Manhattan on the subject, said: "I don't think there is anything different or unique in New York that should make us stay this way forever. Given the opposition, I don't think a change in the law is imminent. But a serious discussion should occur imminently, or when the time comes we won't be able to shepherd the change through in an orderly and thoughtful manner."
And with the new deregulated system, Dr. DeBuono said, "I believe we'll end up with hospitals that might be more attractive to the capital market."
For the time being, most of the large national hospital companies have said they are staying out of the debate in New York and waiting to see what happens. There are plenty of opportunities to pursue in other states, they said, without becoming embroiled in local politics. But if a change does come, representatives of several companies said, they're ready to take a look. "We don't like to get too far ahead of ourselves," said Jeff Prescott, a spokesman for Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest for-profit hospital company, with 360 hospitals across the country. "But if the possibility comes up then away we'll go."
 
Seeing a Tide That Won't Stop
Some hospital administrators said that the change in New York is inevitable
The head of one New York hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "I know it's sacrilegious to say, but when I look at all the red ink in my books I can't help but wonder, would it be so terrible if one of the chains came in here, bailed us out and ran a tighter ship? People get stuck in a rut about the way they do things and can't always come up with new plans or convince others around them to go along with something different."
Besides, he added, the for-profit, publicly traded, out-of-town managed-care companies already determine to an increasing degree what kind of care people get and where they get it. "They call the shots by approving and disapproving treatments," he said, "and by demanding lower charges. So, why is one kind of for-profit health care acceptable and the other not?"
Dr. William T. Speck, the president and chief executive of Presbyterian Hospital of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, said that he expected the New York City health care market to be divided eventually into five systems: Catholic, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, university, not-for-profit and for-profit.
"I'm not certain how four of them will break down," he said, "but I am sure that one will be run by publicly traded companies. Which is not to advocate it. It's just to acknowledge the obvious."

HEADLINE: Hotels Are Showing the Job Vacancy Sign

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
In the face of high turnover in a rapidly expanding industry, the nation's hotels are experiencing the worst employment shortage since they began to recover from the recession that hit their market in 1988.
The shortage is especially acute in jobs like housekeeper, kitchen helper and laundry worker. 
 But in contrast to previous recoveries, when hotels recruited workers by advertising in newspapers or just spreading the word that they were hiring, today there is heavy competition in the job market from cruise ships, fast-food outlets, theme parks, casinos and shopping malls -- as well as from the increasing number of hotels.
Thus, hotels in many cities have been forced to hire full-time recruiting managers and to offer an unprecedented array of blandishments and benefits.
These include profit-sharing programs, medical and dental insurance, child care centers, 401(k)'s with matching funds, paid holidays and vacations, company-provided transportation and bonuses based on attendance. Many hotels also offer employees finder's fees, up to $100, for recruiting friends or relatives.
Most fringe benefits are reserved for full-time employees, who make up 70 percent of the work force, but some hotels, including the Radisson Penn Harris in Camp Hill, Pa., even offer paid vacation to part-time workers.
The demand for hotel workers can clearly be seen at the Marriott Corporation, which must fill more than 50,000 jobs a year. As a result, the company recently opened a toll-free telephone line for job seekers who want to work in New York, St. Louis, Dallas and eight other cities.
"We're constantly looking for good people who want an opportunity to participate in our growth," said J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman of the company, which has more than 1,000 hotels and expects to have 2,000 by the end of the decade. On any day, he said, Marriott has more than 1,000 jobs to fill in its hotel division and elsewhere throughout the corporation.
Behind this demand are rising hotel occupancy rates, requiring more services at existing hotels and a jump in hotel construction in the last several years.
Despite the increased benefits, hotels have trouble attracting workers in part because many entry-level jobs do not pay well. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track hotel workers, its statistics do show that the median earnings of "maids and housemen" not employed in private households was just $247 a week last year, compared with $220 a week in 1990.
Outside of some big cities, nonunion entry-level housekeepers typically earn $6 to $7 a hour, while waiters and waitress can make as much as $15 an hour, including tips.
Nor is entry-level hotel work glamorous or particularly enjoyable, as is suggested by an estimated turnover rate of almost 100 percent a year in higher priced hotels and at least 150 percent in economy hotels -- the fastest-growing sector.
But many entry-level workers not only lack basic skills initially, often they can neither read nor write. "Forty-eight percent of hotel workers right up to the supervisory level are illiterate, and we predict by the year 2000 it could rise as high as 60 percent," said Bob T. Foley, head of the education arm of the American Hotel and Motel Association.
Marriott has been particularly successful training inner-city drop-outs, welfare recipients and the long-term unemployed. Its 180-hour program (including 120 hours on the job) has successfully taught some 500 beginners essentials like work ethic, proper attitude, responsibility, self-esteem and teamwork. The program, currently operating in Washington, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Richmond and New York, will soon be established at Job Corps and Jewish Vocational Services sites.
With the industry's unskilled labor force made up heavily with immigrants, language classes are not uncommon. While such classes are usually attended by Spanish-speaking employees, the 30-hour language program at the Radisson Hotel South in Bloomington, Minn., is primarily for Vietnamese and Hmong, the tribal people from Laos.
"We tried offering classes after hours but attendance falls off after a long day's work," said Mike Brunkow, the hotel's general manager. "So now we offer the lessons on company time."
To demonstrate how to make a bed properly, Marriott uses a training film in which language is no barrier -- it has no audio.
The 2,900-room Opryland Hotel in Nashville, a city where unemployment is minuscule, has not only a seven-day-a-week child care center (currently used by 250 children, with another 150 expected soon) but a fleet of buses to transport workers each day from as far as Fort Campbell, Ky., 45 miles away. And with the help of Puerto Rico, the Opryland Hotel, owned by Gaylord Entertainment, hired some 200 Puerto Ricans, including some with hotel experience as supervisors and managers.
Opryland also has a jobs telephone line, complete with a list of benefits and guidelines about appearance. And as its work force has expanded -- it will soon reach 4,200 workers -- the company bought a 150-room hotel in Nashville and converted it to temporary housing for new employees.
For all the criticism of entry-level jobs, often by politicians arguing about the economy, the hotel industry insists they can lead to promotions or better-paying jobs elsewhere.
Mr. Brunkow of Radisson South, for example, started his career at age 15 as a bus boy at a Holiday Inn in Galesburg, Ill., while the president of Radisson Hotels, John Norlander, began at age 17 as an assistant to the receiving clerk at Chicago's Morrison Hotel.
Valerie Ferguson, general manager at the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta, began in 1977 as an hourly night audit clerk at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
As for better-paying jobs elsewhere, the small Mississippi Delta town of Tunica has systematically siphoned away hotel workers and other service employees from Memphis, about 35 miles away.
"It's not hard to explain," said Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County Chamber of Commerce. "The wages are higher here than in Memphis because there are only about 8,700 people in the whole county and in the past couple of years our 10 casinos and hotels have created about 15,000 jobs."

Unlikely Credits for a Korean Movie Mogul

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
Miky Lee sees nothing odd in her family company jumping from making sugar, shampoo and swine feed to making movies with Steven Spielberg.
"We're pleasing their mouths and their bodies," she said of consumers. "And now they want to be pleased with their eyes and ears." 
 Thin as that rationale may be, Ms. Lee, with almost no corporate experience, has at 38 become South Korea's first Hollywood mogul.
Miky Lee (pronounced Mickey and derived from her Korean name, Mie Kyung) arranged for Cheil Foods and Chemicals Inc., the stodgy sugar and flour maker controlled by her family, to invest $300 million for 11 percent of Dreamworks SKG, the entertainment company established last year by Mr. Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
Cheil is the second-largest outside investor in Dreamworks, behind Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, and has exclusive rights to distribute its films in Asia, outside of Japan.
Now Ms. Lee, a rare example of a successful businesswoman in Korea's male-oriented business world, hopes to turn the company, recently renamed the Cheil Jedang Corporation, into a major producer and distributor of movies in South Korea and the rest of the booming Asian market.
The Dreamworks investment shocked people on both sides of the Pacific, with many predictions that Cheil would face the same losses and embarrassing culture clashes suffered by Sony and Matsushita in Hollywood.
"They've decided to diversify into an area in which they have no experience," said Jonathan Dutton, an analyst with SBC Warburg Securities in Seoul. Cheil wanted to diversify out of the low-margin food business, but doing so by investing in a Hollywood company, he said, is "a risky business."
But Ms. Lee is confident, saying, "We don't have any doubt that we will get the money back."
And while Sony and Matsushita bought existing studios, she noted, Cheil and Dreamworks have been partners from the beginning. "We believe in each other," she said, adding that Mr. Spielberg "has the innocence of a child."
She said Cheil wants to learn from Dreamworks, not tell it what to do. She speaks on the phone with Mr. Katzenberg often, and she and her brother, Jay, will be attending Dreamworks board meetings four times a year.
"I understand Hollywood culture to the extent I need to understand," she said in an interview in her office, where "Entertainment Industry Economics," a book by Hal Vogel, a Wall Street analyst, lay on the coffee table.
While Cheil's move was the most dramatic, other Korean companies are also courting Hollywood. Earlier this year, the Samsung Group paid $60 million for 7.4 percent of New Regency Productions of Burbank, Calif., an independent company that made "JFK" and "Pretty Woman."
The Hyundai Group's Diamond Ad Ltd. unit recently formed an alliance with Canal Plus of France involving joint film production. Kolon Industries says it is negotiating with the Walt Disney Company in the areas of cartoons and character licensing. And Daewoo is making a big push into movie-making and theaters.
The companies are, among other things, seeking films and other material to distribute in the theaters, video stores and cable systems that are sprouting in South Korea now that people here can finally afford more leisure.
Multiplexes are going up throughout Asia, which should mean growing markets for the movies made by Dreamworks and distributed by Cheil. Pay television, home video and movie revenues rose 7 percent in Korea and 27 percent in Asia as a whole last year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.
Korea's family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, have no qualms about diversifying, and perhaps Ms. Lee's daring is in her genes.
Her grandfather, Lee Byung Chull, a commodities trader, set up Cheil, a sugar refinery, in 1953. He kept on diversifying, building today's Samsung Group, South Korea's largest chaebol, with revenues of more than $80 billion and businesses ranging from ship building to semiconductors.
Ms. Lee's father, Lee Maeng Hee, the founder's eldest son, was expected to inherit control, but he was passed over in favor of his younger brother, Lee Kun Hee. Ms. Lee's branch of the family was given control of Cheil, once the core of the empire but until recently an unglamorous outpost. Ms. Lee's younger brother, Lee Jai Hyun, 36, called Jay, effectively runs the company.
Cheil had revenues of $1.8 billion in 1995 but recurring profits of only $12.5 million. Its real wealth, which allowed it to borrow to invest in Dreamworks, is its more than $2 billion in assets, much of it in stock it owns in other Samsung companies.
Relations between the branches of the family are said to be strained, and Cheil has been trying to break free of Samsung, but disagreements with Samsung have slowed the divorce process.
Hence the latest investment was all the more satisfying: Samsung itself had the first shot at Dreamworks, but its deal fell apart.
Ms. Lee grew up in Korea watching Disney shows on television in black and white. In 1983, after getting her undergraduate degree from a university in Seoul, she earned a master's degree in East Asian languages at Harvard. From there she went to Taiwan and then Hong Kong, where she worked on a doctoral thesis.
"I always wanted to be a professor," she said. "I really didn't even imagine that I would be working in the company."
But Ms. Lee never quite finished her Ph.D., in 1994 going to work for a Samsung subsidiary in America. She helped set up the Samsung Art and Design Institute in Korea, a joint venture with the Parsons School of Design in New York. Then one day an American lawyer friend called to ask if Samsung would be interested in investing in Dreamworks.
A $900 million investment was discussed at a dinner at Mr. Spielberg's house. But Samsung officials, led by the president, Lee Kun Hee, spent a bit too much time talking about semiconductors to please the Dreamworks founders. "I kept on saying to them," Mr. Geffen recalled, that "if we were only interested in making money we'd also build semiconductor plants."
Dreamworks' founders were also uncomfortable with Samsung's insistence that it be the only outside investor and have effective control.
For whatever reason, the two groups parted ways. Then Paul Allen invested $500 million, reducing the amount Dreamworks needed. Ms. Lee asked her brother, and the two won the deal for Cheil.
"They were enthusiastic about what we were doing," Mr. Geffen said. "Their determination was particularly impressive to Steven, who responds well to enthusiasm."
But enthusiasm can go only so far.
The Cheil multimedia division, headed by Ms. Lee, consists of 33 people, 23 of them recruited from within Cheil.
Ms. Lee, diminutive but energetic, runs things informally. "She is not like Korean men, giving orders and expecting them to be followed," said Steven J. Searle, Ms. Lee's high school English teacher, who now works for the multimedia division. "To do anything creative, you have to have a soft touch."
To get help in distribution, Cheil turned to Raymond Chow, the founder of Hong Kong's Golden Harvest Entertainment Ltd., a big movie producer and distributor known for bringing the world Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, not to mention the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Cheil and Golden Harvest have a joint venture to distribute movies throughout Asia, and another venture, with an Australian company, to build multiplexes in Korea.
Cheil has also set up a division to make movies in partnership with the director Kim Jong Hak and the screenwriter Song Ji Na, who collaborated on a searing television drama about the 1980 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in the Korean city of Kwangju.
In making movies, Cheil is supposed to get help from Dreamworks. Miky Lee organized a field trip to watch Dreamworks work on "The Prince of Egypt," its first animated film. And Cheil hopes to send interns to work in California.
But Mr. Kim said the gap between Cheil and Dreamworks was so huge that it might be difficult for Cheil to apply what it learned. "It's like talking about a relationship between a kindergarten child and a university student," he said. "We don't know what we need, and they don't know what to give."
Mr. Kim said Mr. Spielberg would have been frustrated trying to make movies in Korea. At a reception, Mr. Kim once shocked Mr. Spielberg by telling him: "If you had been born in Korea, you would have ended up in a mental hospital."
But Ms. Lee said Cheil's work would help Korea's poorly developed movie industry. "Our investment in Dreamworks is not a destination," she said. "It's the departing point."

HEADLINE: European Stocks Post Big Gains After Yeltsin Victory in Russia

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
European stock markets posted solid gains yesterday in relief over President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election victory in Russia and over the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in the United States.
Japanese stocks, however, closed lower in a quiet session. 
 Trading on many overseas markets was subdued, with United States financial markets closed in observance of the Fourth of July.
In Asian and European currency trading, the dollar was little changed after a slight decline against the German mark following Mr. Yeltsin's victory, traders said. Because of Germany's close economic ties to Russia, the mark was weaker earlier in the week before the election results.
"Uncertainty over Yeltsin's health should insure that the dollar does not reverse too far," Barry Vanderlaan, senior trader at Ifexco in Geneva, said.
Japanese stocks were higher this morning as the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 55.96, to 22,348.87, for an increase of nearly three-tenths of a percent. On Thursday, the Nikkei dropped 86.11 points on profit taking.
In Hong Kong, stocks ended with strong gains. The Hang Seng index of 33 leading stocks rose 118.54 points, or just more than 1 percent, to 11,181.82.
London stocks posted their best performance in nearly six months. The Fed's inaction on Wednesday bolstered hopes that the Bank of England might reduce interest rates this year.
The Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares rose 46.5 points, or 1.25 percent, to 3,760.6, its biggest gain since Jan. 15.
French stocks closed somewhat higher. Stocks surged after the Bank of France surprised the Paris market with a cut in the rate that acts as a floor for the nation's money market rates, to 3.55 percent from 3.60 percent. But stock prices later retreated. The CAC index of 40 issues ended up 12.83, or six-tenths of 1 percent, at 2,126.81,
German stocks ended a lackluster floor session just off record highs. In Frankfurt, the DAX index of 30 stocks closed up 8.44, or three-tenths of 1 percent, at 2,577.39
The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 issues closed up 12.48 points, or nearly three-tenths of 1 percent, at 5,086.39.
Mexican stocks, however, ended lower in extremely light trading. More than half of the session's volume came in one trade. The market's index of 37 leading stocks fell 6.92 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 3,174.88.
In London, European gold trading closed at $381.10, down about $1.10 from Wednesday in quiet trading.

A Hard-Liner's Ballot Victory Doesn't Panic Israeli Markets

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu's electoral victory in May wasn't the outcome investors in Israel had been hoping for. But little more than a month later, a consensus is growing that his ascension to power isn't anywhere near the setback they had feared.
Most investors had backed Prime Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party as the man most likely to keep peace with the Arabs and enable the nation to concentrate on economic growth rather than military matters. 
 Now, with Mr. Netanyahu declaring the Golan Heights, Jerusalem and a Palestinian state off the negotiating table, they must consider the risks of a collapse of the peace process against the benefits that the governing Likud Party promises Israel's economy by reducing public spending, lowering interest rates and speeding privatization.
And some investors are concluding that Mr. Netanyahu's victory might be an overall plus. His Cabinet this week agreed on a $1.5 billion cut in public spending.
And despite his relatively hard line, much of Israel's economy now seems to be insulated against a breakdown in relations with the Arab world. At the same time, the economic changes he is proposing stand a reasonable chance of rooting out the last vestiges of London School of Economics socialism from Israel's economy.
Indeed, some analysts say that the success or failure of his free-market initiatives will have a larger impact on economic growth than his dealings with the Arabs.
"The risk Netanyahu will damage the economy is greater than the risk political developments will damage it," said Howard Rosen of the Competitiveness Policy Council in Washington, who has worked at the Israeli central bank.
Market reaction to the election result has so far been negative, with sentiment not helped by an increase in interest rates last month to combat a 15 percent inflation rate -- well above the Government's target of 8 to 10 percent. Since May 28, the day before voting began, the Maof index of 25 of the largest-capitalization stocks on the Tel Aviv exchange has fallen more than 6 percent, to 210.27 yesterday, from 223.84.
American investors can choose among several funds made up of Israeli securities, including the closed-end First Israel Fund on the New York Stock Exchange.
In addition, about 70 individual Israeli companies are traded in the United States. Roughly 20 of those sell exclusively in New York -- for the most part, high-tech companies that have led a remarkable surge in Israeli exports since the Oslo and White House diplomatic accords of 1993 ended the secondary boycott against Israeli goods in many Asian and other emerging economies.
But they, too, took a hit last month; the Morgan Stanley Capital International index of 20-plus companies on New York exchanges fell 10.3 percent in June. Much of that decline was attributed to the weakness of the overall market in small technology stocks.
Still, for all the recent sluggishness of Israeli stocks, the prospects for business there are generally positive. From 1992 to 1995, exports to Asia soared 187 percent -- 154 percent to Japan alone. However sour its relations might become with the Arab world, Israel is loath to risk losing these markets.
At the same time, the outlook for corporate earnings seems robust, with a 10 to 12 percent gain expected this year. And with the stock market trading at 12 times earnings, Israel looks cheap compared with Latin American and Asian markets.
This, of course, does not mean that Israeli stocks can only move higher. As Barbara Insel of Salomon Brothers says in a new study, "The peace process has only had a peripheral impact on equities" while foreign investment "represents no more than 10-15 percent of average trading volume."
More important is the flow of Israel's roughly $4 billion a year in private savings. When interest rates are high, this cash goes into bonds. When they fall, equities benefit. "A revival of the equity market will only happen with lower deficits and interest rates," Ms. Insel says.
And the stock market is not totally protected against political shocks. Ms. Insel thinks that a surge in Arab violence could weaken corporate investment, which has grown by 50 percent in the last five years, damage tourism and encourage a flight into dollars -- "all of which would hurt equities," she noted.
Yet many analysts seem to shrug off such risks, and assume that Mr. Netanyahu will somehow reach an accommodation with the Arab world. Like R. Robert Goodman of the brokerage firm Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, they comfort themselves with the thought that "what politicians promise is not always what they do in office."
That thought cuts both ways. To be successful, Mr. Netanyahu must also make good on his promise to strengthen the Israeli economy by reducing spending and speeding privatization.
Analysts have generally applauded his economic team. The new Finance Minister, Dan Meridor, is a pragmatist. Jakob Frenkel remains Israel's respected central bank governor. And Natan Sharansky, a world-class mathematician, heads the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
But can they cut spending enough to get inflation and interest rates down when the Government depends for its majority on religious parties that demand higher spending on education and settlements?
"Netanyahu's biggest dilemma will be reining in budget growth while placating coalition partners," Mr. Goldman predicted.
The new Government's plan to privatize state companies should help, though Mr. Rosen warns that "there is not a lot left to privatize except the banks, which won't fetch much."
But austerity could also yield a useful political dividend if it forestalls new settlements in the occupied territories.

Drug Companies Step Up Promotion of AIDS Drugs
Pharmaceutical companies are becoming more aggressive in marketing drugs for the treatment of the virus that causes AIDS. The promotions resemble the selling of ulcer treatments and cholesterol-lowering medications. The push comes as more AIDS drugs enter the marketplace. At least a dozen new drugs have just reached the market, are awaiting Government approval or are in the late stages of clinical trials. [Page A1.]
 
Push for Hospitals-for-Profit
A movement is afoot to allow publicly held, profit-making companies to own hospitals in New York, the only state that bars such companies. Supporters of a change in the state's law say that experienced, for-profit companies will reinvigorate New York's financially troubled health care market. [A1.]

Hotels Scramble for Workers
Amid a rapid expansion, the hotel industry is experiencing the worst employment shortage since it emerged from a recession in the late 1980's. The shortage is especially acute in jobs like housekeeper, kitchen helper and laundry worker. The need for help has prompted hotels in many cities to hire full-time recruiting managers and to offer an array of blandishments and benefits. [D2.]

A new ruling by a Federal appeals court has raised concerns among savings institutions, which are studying it to see whether it undercuts a Supreme Court decision enabling them to pursue damage claims against the Government for breach of contract. The appeals court limited the amount of damages that Wells Fargo could collect for breach of promise, in a case involving a Government loan-guarantee program. [D3.]
 
Air France Moves to Consolidate
Air France outlined a plan to merge its international and regional carriers. The state-owned company is trying to cut costs sharply ahead of the opening of the European market. Unions denounced the plan and staged a 24-hour strike against Air France Europe.[D2.]
 
Radio's David and Goliath
A St. Louis radio station, KMOX-AM, has long enjoyed dominance in the Midwest, benefiting from its 50,000-watt clear-channel signal that reaches at least eight states and from the programming power and financial muscle of its owner, CBS Radio. But now, a small, copycat competitor is steadily chipping away at the larger station's ratings. [D5.]
 
Change at Top of Olivetti
Carlo De Benedetti, at the helm of the Italian computer and communications giant Olivetti since 1978, has stepped down, as expected. Mr. De Benedetti, left, has been replaced as chief executive by Francesco Caio, head of the telecommunications unit. The company has been struggling in recent years to staunch losses from its personal computer operations. [D4.]
 
New York Lender Draws Fire
Greenpoint Bank of Queens has come under fire from housing advocates for some of its mortgage lending policies. [B1.]

European Stocks Advance
European stock markets posted solid gains in relief over President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election victory in Russia and over the Federal Reserve's decision to leave American interest rates unchanged. But trading on many overseas exchanges was light, with United States market participants absent. [D5.]

Madison Avenue Mysteries
Why does an advertisement for station wagons invoke Hitchcock? Who is Clarence? What does k.o.b. stand for? And will copywriters ever capture the vernacular of New York City? Fuhgeddaboutit, some things will always be a mystery in advertising, marketing and the media. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: THE PRIME MINISTER;
Premier Is Savoring Comeback Of His Own

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 4

 BODY:
Russia's usually stolid and unemotional Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said today he was "all choked up," over President Boris N. Yeltsin's momentous election victory and could barely speak.
But it did not take him long to find his voice. The man who lay low throughout the Presidential election and studiously kept himself removed from campaign infighting resurfaced triumphantly today to flaunt his renewed authority. 
 The cocky self-confidence and sheer gusto displayed by Mr. Chernomyrdin, 58, at his news conference today were the clearest signs yet that the Prime Minister's political fortunes are back on the rise.
Less than a year ago, journalists and many of his own colleagues within the Yeltsin Administration were predicting that the Prime Minister would be dumped shortly before the presidential elections -- a sacrifice to the Communist opposition. Few suspected Mr. Yeltsin would reappoint him, and even fewer imagined that Communist leaders in Parliament would assert, as they did today, that they would not block his nomination.
Suddenly, Mr. Yeltsin's aides are talking openly about Mr. Chernomyrdin's prospects as a presidential candidate in the next elections. Representatives of the centrist political movement that Mr. Chernomyrdin leads are gleefully promising to pump "Our Home Is Russia" into a full-fledged political party.
And today, Mr. Chernomyrdin carefully aimed his fire at two of the other leading contenders. Aleksandr I. Lebed, the new national security adviser who repeatedly criticized the Prime Minister's policies during the campaign, and has suggested himself as a Vice President, was first to receive the lash.
"We've already had a Vice President, and we're still crying about it," Mr. Chernomyrdin replied acidly when asked to comment on the subject. He was referring to Gen. Aleksandr Rutskoi, who as Vice President ended up leading Parliament's armed insurrection against the Yeltsin Government in 1993.
Mr. Chernomyrdin was even more scornful about Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the young liberal economist and politician who has been an unceasing critic of Mr. Chernomyrdin's slow approach to free market reform. "Government will never become a club, never," he growled when asked whether he would invite Mr. Yavlinsky into a new government. "We have work to do. We need trained and knowledgeable people, we need people who know how to work, and not just talk."
Mr. Chernomyrdin, Prime Minister since December 1992 and a Minister for Natural Gas under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has survived a string of Cabinet and Kremlin shake-ups. By renouncing early on any intention of running against Mr. Yeltsin in the 1996 election, he convinced his often suspicious boss of his loyalty.
Warily viewed by Washington as a Soviet-era reactionary when he was first appointed to replace the radical pro-market reformer Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Chernomyrdin has won the respect of the West for his steady approach to the Russian economy and his commitment to economic change.
Later this month, he will be on prominent display in meetings with Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Chernomyrdin, who headed the state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, before entering government, never severed his ties to his old company. He exemplifies the coziness and blatant favoritism between privatized industry and the Government.
But Mr. Chernomyrdin won a great deal of respect when he forcefully intervened to save the lives of hundreds of Russians taken hostage by Chechen militants in Budyonnovsk. Mr. Yeltsin authorized and defended a military storming of the Budyonnovsk hospital, an endeavor that failed, even as Mr. Chernomyrdin was moving, on nationwide television, to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis.
It remains to be seen how smoothly Mr. Chernomyrdin will weather the huge economic and social problems that lie ahead -- problems he described today as "breathtaking."

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: THE PROSPECTS;
Yeltsin's Moment: Can the President Build on His Victory?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 4

 BODY:
For the last six months Russia has been a country seemingly at war with itself. There has been no fighting in the streets, but not one of the many candidates for the presidency could avoid mentioning the ominous possibility that the new Russia's first presidential election might end in civil war.
And yet today this half-year-long epic of political tension and Kremlin intrigue suddenly gave way to what is known in Russian history as a peredishka, a time-out. 
 Hours after it became clear that President Boris N. Yeltsin had defeated his Communist rival for the presidency, the prevailing mood was not national discord but reconciliation, good will, and a trace of self-congratulation.
Mr. Yeltsin proposed that his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin retain his position. The Communist leader of the Parliament readily agreed. Mr. Chernomyrdin stated -- as he has in the past -- that he is not opposed to bringing Communists into his Government. Even Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the wayward democrat who has so often seemed at odds with Mr. Yeltsin, said he would be willing to join the Government.
There was more. Foreign observers said Russia's first presidential election since it was severed from the Soviet Union was conducted largely without signs of fraud. Mr. Yeltsin begged the nation to forget the divisiveness of the past, and Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the defeated Communist leader, grumbled and warned of unhappiness to come, but he also sent the President an official telegram of congratulations and promised to abide by the "will of the people."
"This is an incredible moment no matter what happens after it," said Igor Klyamkin, a leading liberal sociologist and pollster here. "We all know there will be many bumps on the road. But does America have elections that go more smoothly than this?"
America, of course, does not customarily face a choice between two such profoundly divergent visions of its future as Communism and a free market. The market clearly won in Russia on Wednesday, but more than 30 million people still voted for the man -- and the system -- that lost. It is a system Mr. Yeltsin denigrated and ridiculed in every speech he gave this year.
"Democracy won," says the headline on the main article in Friday's editions of the newspaper Izvestia, "Now what?"
The answer is, in the main, Mr. Yeltsin's to provide. In the past, after winning office in 1991, and after the Constitution he so vigorously supported was adopted in 1993, Mr. Yeltsin has let slip away rare opportunities to consolidate his power and build on his mandate.
He has a habit of disappearing after great triumphs. In 1991 when advisers begged him to act decisively to form a political party as an organizational and ideological base for the future, he did nothing. Aides and supporters also suggested that he dissolve the Parliament, if only to elect a new one in "modern," post-Soviet Russia.
He did not act, and the results were painful for him and the country. Mr. Yeltsin has no real political party, even today. In the election campaign, he used the institutions of Government and the mass media as if they were his personal fiefs. The Communists, even after suffering the defeats of 1991 and now 1996, remain the biggest political party in the country with 600,000 members and maintain the strongest single bloc in Parliament.
The essential question remains: will Mr. Yeltsin, exhausted by the campaign, failing in health, and faced with an imminent financial crisis, have the reserves to create a political organization that he can leave to younger successors?
"Now he can do something great for the nation," said Boris Nemtsov, the young liberal governor of Nizhny Novgorod. "But he must start with his own people."
That may prove as tricky as winning re-election. It was a bold and successful act to bring Aleksandr I. Lebed into the inner circle of the Kremlin less than 24 hours after the frank, nationalistic military man received 15 million votes in the first round of the election. But now people are wondering if the bill for Mr. Lebed's services might be higher than Mr. Yeltsin's Government can afford.
Now that Mr. Yeltsin has won re-election he will have to deal with the unruly Mr. Lebed, who has in the past week commented, often offensively, on everything from religion and economic reform in Russia to whether the country needs a Vice President. (He thinks so and he has a good idea who it ought to be.)
This is a time when the President can reach out to millions in Russia who crave leadership. But often in the past Mr. Yeltsin has immersed himself in the Byzantine world of Kremlin infighting, and many advisers in the campaign now fear that Mr. Lebed, who is brimming with confidence, will come into conflict with the President or push him to take an even more conservative position in domestic politics and a more nationalist stance in foreign policy.
Advisers fear that Mr. Lebed's appearance in the Kremlin may lead to a repeat of 1993, when another charismatic general and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Aleksandr Rutskoi, turned on Mr. Yeltsin, leading to an uprising that Mr. Yeltsin ultimately put down with tanks.
Mr. Chernomyrdin doesn't like Mr. Lebed, as he made clear today, and if Mr. Yeltsin hopes to bring the remarkably disparate strands of his country together soon, he will clearly have to start with his senior staff.
"This duet, this tandem, of Yeltsin and Lebed is very dangerous," said Sergei Kovalyov, a former adviser on human rights who fell out with Mr. Yeltsin over the war in Chechnya. "The idea of shooting criminals on the spot has never been closer to reality than now. Also, I think control over society as a whole will increase, as will the non-transparency of politics."

HEADLINE: Volatile Mix in Viper Militia: Hatred Plus a Love for Guns

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, July 3

 BODY:
On West Shangri-La Road, a quiet street where children pedal bicycles past ornamental cactuses and yellow desert blooms, the two men living at number 6748 led a suburban life that was, well, different.
Dean C. Pleasant used to paint camouflage patterns on hand grenades and leave them in his backyard to dry. 
 His housemate, Randy L. Nelson, a house painter who called himself the Captain of the Viper Militia, slept with his beloved "Shirley," a Browning machine gun mounted on the headboard of his bed.
Searching the trim white-and-blue bungalow in the suburb of Peoria on Monday, Federal agents, according to court papers, found a small armory tucked into dressers and stacked in closets: grenades, fuses, blasting caps, 2 pistols, 2 machine guns, 6 rifles and 56 boxes crammed with 11,463 rounds of ammunition. On the living room coffee table was a how-to manual called "Domestic Disturbances."
Today, the 2 roommates, along with 10 other members of the Vipers paramilitary group, are in jail here, facing charges that include illegal possession of a machine gun and conspiracy to teach bombing techniques to provoke civil disorder. [A newspaper has described how an undercover state officer helped in the case. Article, page A16.]
A largely blue-collar mix of high school graduates and dropouts, all the Vipers are white, have no significant criminal records and are stuck in low-paying jobs.
They include two janitors, a used-furniture salesman, an AT&T billing representative, an air conditioner repairman, a doughnut baker, an engineer and the doorman for Tiffany Cabaret, a Phoenix topless bar. Experts say they roughly reflect the demographics of the anti-government paramilitary movement. Their defenders say the Vipers are merely Walter Mitty types -- weekend warriors who conducted harmless war games in the desert. In this vein, they say, the Government will have a hard time winning any conspiracy convictions.
"Where the heck is the conspiracy?" asked Scott Grainger, a longtime friend of Mr. Pleasant. "I thought you had to have a plan. It's not illegal to go out and blow up rocks in the desert."
Noting that the arrests came barely a week after the deadly bombing at an American military base in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Grainger, who is the county chairman here of the Libertarian Party, said he suspected political motives behind the highly publicized crackdown on a group that Federal agents had been monitoring for seven months. Questioning the timing, Mr. Grainger asked, "These guys have been around for a while. Why pick on them now?"
In contrast, prosecutors paint the Vipers as an urban terror cell that was ready, and able, to cause havoc as great as that caused in the Oklahoma City bombing last year. To bolster this view, they plan to show a videotape in court here on Friday during bail hearings for the group's members.
The videotape was shot two years ago by Mr. Pleasant, the indictment says, and takes viewers on a walking tour of seven local, state and Federal buildings and a television station in the Phoenix area. With Mr. Pleasant providing some of the narration, the tape instructs viewers on how to place charges by support columns to "collapse" the government buildings.
In addition to editing an urban guerrilla tape, Mr. Pleasant, 27, has left the longest paper trail of the dozen detainees. Through letters to the editor, political campaign statements and a gun lovers newsletter that he edited, an ideological portrait emerges of Mr. Pleasant, who, until last week, regularly served as the host for Viper meetings in the living room of his rented house here.
Viscerally opposed to government controls, Mr. Pleasant once told The Phoenix Gazette, a local newspaper, that he had carried a concealed pistol without a permit since he was 16.
In 1992, when Paul Johnson, then Mayor of Phoenix, proposed an ordinance banning minors from owning or carrying firearms, Mr. Pleasant wrote to the Gazette, saying: "Mayor Johnson is looking down the big bore of Arizona law, with gun enthusiasts, their finger on the trigger, saying, 'Go ahead. Make my day!' "
Treasuring his "Tommy" gun, a Thompson machine gun capable of firing 500 rounds a minute, Mr. Pleasant waged a constant battle against advocates of gun control.
"If one's aim is to lessen violent crime, what makes the editor think that a murderer will be any less vicious with a machete?" he said in another letter to the Gazette, in 1992. "To blame objects for the evil that people do to each other is socially irresponsible."
In 1994, Mr. Pleasant was living at his parents' house here and studying at a local community college when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms knocked on the door, wanting to ask questions about his recent gun trades.
Furious, Mr. Pleasant refused to cooperate, recalled a friend, Ernest Hancock. A few days later, around May 30, 1994, he and a married couple, Ellen and David W. Belliveau, started filming Government buildings in Phoenix, including the firearms bureau's office. Later, the three friends formed the nucleus of a paramilitary group they called the Viper Militia.
The Viper name, a rallying symbol for the paramilitary movement, is believed to be a salute to the Revolutionary War-era rattlesnake flag, which carried the warning, "Don't Tread on Me!"
In a parallel protest strategy, Mr. Pleasant, already an officer in the local Libertarian Party chapter, decided to fight big government by running for a seat in the Arizona State Senate.
Describing taxes as "legalized theft," the Libertarian candidate called for an end to firearms controls and mandatory auto insurance.
"The No. 1 thing I want to see done is the repeal of state-mandated auto insurance," he told The Arizona Republic newspaper. In 1991, he spent 31 days in jail for driving without insurance and without license plates.
To his opponent, John Kaites, Mr. Pleasant, a college student who moonlighted as a doughnut baker, seemed "a bit immature -- a 25-year-old kid that got satisfaction out of carrying a concealed weapon," Mr. Kaites said. "He never seemed to have grown out of the G.I. Joe phase," he added.
"He told me that the government should not be in the business of regulating schools, building roads, outlawing narcotic substances or controlling weapons," Mr. Kaites recalled today.
When Kaites campaign signs started to disappear, only to reappear as Pleasant campaign signs, Mr. Kaites called the candidate's mother, Gloria, to complain. The expensive plywood signs stopped vanishing.
Mr. Kaites, a Republican, won the two-man race -- with 24,780 votes to 7,013 for the Libertarian.
When reached by telephone today, Mrs. Pleasant declined to talk about her son, saying only, "We love Dean and know he's a good guy and would not hurt anybody."
After losing the election, Mr. Pleasant left home, dropped out of college and got a low-paying job as a sales clerk in an Army surplus store. Two months ago, he was dismissed for poor performance, which included petty theft, said Scott Peterson, the store's owner.
Until Mr. Pleasant's arrest, his real passion was his after-hours life, which largely revolved around guns, explosives and paramilitary training. In his bedroom on Monday, A.T.F. agents found a booby-trap device, camouflage clothing, a pistol, three rifles, 4,000 rounds of ammunition and his machine gun.
"He had a very dim view of what the government was doing to people's rights," recalled Alan Trabilcy, owner of Outpost Firearms and Ammunition, a store where Mr. Pleasant was a frequent customer this year.
Not particularly discreet about his paramilitary activities, Mr. Pleasant sometimes wore Viper insignia patches outside his home. Last March, he was listed on an Internet page called Restoring America as a paramilitary contact for newcomers moving to the Phoenix area.
When guns were involved, his comrade in arms was his 32-year-old housemate, Mr. Nelson. The rowdier of the pair, Mr. Nelson often appeared at gun events wearing camouflage pants and obscene T-shirts.
"He was just a youngster who dressed outrageously and acted that way sometimes," said Terry Allison, president of the Arizona Rifle and Pistol Association, a club that counted Mr. Nelson and his housemate among its 2,000 members. "But he wasn't subversive in any way."
Last September, Mr. Nelson and Mr. Pleasant were kicked out of a shooting competition sponsored in Las Vegas, Nev., by Soldier of Fortune magazine.
"We were too rowdy for Soldier of Fortune," Mr. Pleasant wrote later in a gun enthusiast's bulletin that he edited, SHF Shooting Sports Newsletter. "Aren't those the guys who frag Serbs for giggles? The same guys who went to Rhodesia to shoot black folk because their Vietnam playground wasn't available any more?"
Mr. Nelson, who styles himself as Captain of the Vipers, seethed over his rejection by the competition's organizer, Michael Horne.
"Next year, I'm not gonna shoot just so I can get a chance to catch you alone and smash your face," he wrote about Mr. Horne in the semimonthly bulletin.
This paramilitary leader, a bachelor who slept with his gun Shirley, wrote of trying "to satisfy that primal urge that makes you want to kill."
"You low crawl into the bedroom of one of your roommates and sneak right up to his bed," he wrote. "You press your .45 to his temple and . . . damn! Not again, waited too long and now the urge is gone!"

HEADLINE: Critics of Watershed Plan See Tilt Toward Upstate Evolving

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Last November, Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and representatives of communities around New York City's 19 upstate reservoirs announced a $1.5 billion plan to protect the city's drinking water without the city's having to build a budget-busting $7 billion water filtration plant.
The 10-year plan, albeit a rough draft, was widely hailed as a breakthrough after decades of battles between the city and watershed communities over how to control pollution and development in the hills and valleys draining into the system. 
 Eight months later, with the final document still several weeks away at best, some city officials and environmental groups say that the emerging plan leans too far toward satisfying Mr. Pataki's upstate constituency, while posing a threat to water quality for nine million people in New York City and Westchester County. And the way things are going, they say, it may still be necessary to spend the money to build the plant.
Among other problems, critics say, the agreement would not sufficiently limit future construction of sewage plants in the watersheds, and it contains loopholes that could allow industrial activity near streams that drain into the reservoirs.
They say that environmental protection has slipped because the talks, orchestrated by Governor Pataki's counsel, Michael C. Finnegan, have been closed to public view for too long. As a result, the fine print -- worked out by lawyers for upstate towns, the city and the state -- favors development over the environment, said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group.
City and state officials involved in the talks strongly defended the evolving deal. Marilyn Gelber, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said that some of the things environmental groups are describing as weaknesses are actually the agreement's greatest strengths. "We're not about to make investments that end up dirtying the system," she said.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, said that the first goal of the plan was protecting public health, adding that details were still being worked out. "There will be plenty of time for people to review the plan and make their comments," Mr. McKeon said.
Put off repeatedly in recent weeks, in part because of distractions like the ongoing state budget debate, announcement of the final watershed accord is not expected before the end of July.
One of the most persistent critics of the agreement is Alan G. Hevesi, New York City's Comptroller and a political goad to the Mayor who successfully challenged Mr. Giuliani's plan to sell the water system to a state authority. Mr. Hevesi said he was worried that if the final accord was not sharply focused on protecting water, it would ultimately fail.
"We may end up paying for this agreement and then end up having to build a $7 billion filtration plant anyway," Mr. Hevesi said. "The announcement last November was a wonderful political move. There was no public debate, everyone applauded, and the issue disappeared."
Mr. Hevesi was not invited to participate in the talks, but he may have some influence on the final document because his office, in theory, must approve the deal, which would amount to a settlement of litigation against the city. In nearly a dozen lawsuits over the years, upstate communities have challenged New York City's right to control some activities around the watershed.
Along with exacerbating rifts in city government, the closing weeks of the watershed talks have also exposed an apparent rift in the environmental community. Groups whose primary focus is water quality and land preservation in the Catskills and Hudson Valley have generally been enthusiastic about the emerging deal. Those focused mainly on New York City's water quality have expressed increasing alarm.
Chief among the latter is the Natural Resources Defense Council, whose staff prepared a detailed critique of the watershed deal. The critique was published in the July issue of a journal called "Environmental Law in New York."
The biggest problem, according to Mr. Goldstein, is that the agreement still contains no cap on building or expanding sewage treatment plants in the watersheds of the system's cleanest reservoirs, in the Catskills and Delaware River valley. New York City's water supply is the only unfiltered supply in the country allowing treated wastewater to flow into reservoirs, he said. About 11 million gallons a day of such water now flows into the system.
Most of the time, filters in the sewage plants and subsequent treatment of the water eliminate hazardous contaminants. But nutrients like phosphorus from such plants encourage algae growth and cloudiness, reducing water quality, said Mr. Goldstein. He added that without long-term limits on the capacity for sewage treatment, there is no incentive for watershed communities to develop long-term environmental plans.
Another weakness in the plan, he said, is a loophole in rules forbidding construction in a 100-foot strip along each bank of streams leading into the city reservoirs west of the Hudson. Under some circumstances, land that lies within hamlets or that is zoned for industrial or commercial development would be exempt from the rule, he said, even if the land is not yet developed.
Such exemptions would directly counteract the intent of a buffer zone, he said, which is to prevent harmful runoff from buildings and parking lots. "These are the kinds of details that will make the difference between water protection and slow deterioration," he said.
Ms. Gelber, at the City Department of Environmental Protection, rebutted Mr. Goldstein's criticisms, saying that the deal would allow the city to double or triple its land holdings in the watersheds, would help focus future economic development in existing towns and hamlets, and would not weaken the city's ability to safeguard its water supply.
She said the exemptions allowing some construction on commercially zoned land or in hamlets and towns were not a giveaway, but a sensible inducement for communities to focus development in areas where it can be controlled. "It's all part of trying to encourage sensible land-use planning," Ms. Gelber said. "There is nothing wrong with a healthy small town. "
It is far more important, she said, to avoid the spread of suburban-style development, in which businesses and homes are scattered, creating diffuse sources of pollution or sewage and eating up open space. Although some growth is allowed along existing commercial zones, she said, "in the meantime, we'll be out there acquiring surrounding wetlands, flood plains and open land around the hamlets."
Another aspect of the emerging deal that has rankled some environmental groups is the apparent lack of city control over a $75 million fund that the city would establish to help spur environmentally sound development in watershed towns.
But two representatives of upstate environmental groups who are close to the negotiations say that changes in the language of the agreement in the last two weeks will insure that projects paid for under the fund will not harm the water. The changes were made after participants from environmental groups threatened to walk out on the talks, said the environmental representatives, who declined to be identified.
Overall, according to a variety of participants in the final drafting of the deal, the recent talks have mirrored the process that led to the general agreement in November, with the most strident debate reserved for the final days.
"No matter how much progress we make, there always seem to be 15 issues left," a negotiator representing Westchester County said. "And every time we answer one, at the end of the day somehow 10 new ones sneak onto the list."

HEADLINE: Celebrating July 4 Spirit, Undaunted But Damp

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Some Fourth of July.
A spasmodic sun, narcissistic gray clouds and a thoughtlessly headstrong wind teased and tormented people's holiday plans. Rain flashed its own independent streak, spitting, dousing, drying up, then drenching again. 
 But throughout the New York region yesterday, plenty of people refused to succumb to the meteorological neurosis.
"If we ignore it, maybe it will go away," said Judy Woodhall, who drove up from Maryland for a rain-sopped family reunion in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.
The somber skies and intermittent sprinkles didn't deter people from their backyard celebrations, of course. Nor did they prevent tens of thousands of New Yorkers and tourists from staking out space along the East Side of Manhattan last night to view the annual fireworks display.
Starting around 7:30 P.M., spectators began laying blankets on sidewalks along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive while others sat on stoops or garbage Dumpsters. Many simply stood outside, or watched from apartment windows, waiting for the flaming chrysanthemums and spider-leg sparks to dance across a slightly hazy, slightly foggy, night sky. They were lucky, too, as the light rain that had been falling for much of the evening stopped shortly after the fireworks began around 9:30 P.M.
The city had four barges in the East River to lob a half-hour's worth of fiery comets, a twinkling red apple and a final 56-pound shell destined to explode in a rocket shower 200 feet in diameter.
"I like the excitement of all the people, the mob, the energy," said Andrew Stevens from Long Island. "It pumps you up. The best part is the fireworks, how it illuminates the sky. It's fantastic."
While the crowds ashore were enjoying the spectacle, there were crowds on the river too, which led to at least one boating accident. A chartered NY Waterway boat carrying fireworks-watchers collided with a tugboat on the East River, witnesses said. More than a dozen people on the chartered boat were injured, mostly with bumps and bruises. The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
Throughout the day, the weather was on people's minds more than they would have liked.
In the South Bronx, Carolyn Carter had to move a celebration with 40 people and a whole roast pig into her husband's auto repair garage.
But the hamlet of Travis, S.I., so isolated that its motto is "New York's last frontier," was undauntedly flooded with marching bands, blaring fire engines, veterans' contingents and politicians waving at thousands of people sitting at curbside or rocking on front porches.
Miss New York National Preteen Petite, Toni Scheidt, promenaded prettily.
An Elvis impersonator gyrated on a flatbed truck. And children monkeying with Silly String nearly hit one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's security guards.
With the Mayor threatening jail time for anyone caught with an illegal incendiary device, many managed their merrymaking without sparklers and bottle rockets. Some weren't too happy about it, though.
"It's illegal to use fireworks, so I'm bored," said Wilkin Garcia, 15, one of only 26 people shivering the cool, wet afternoon away at the Astoria Pool in Queens, the city's largest, usually drawing 2,000 to 3,000 people on the Fourth. Temperatures reached a high of 71 in Central Park.
"I heard on the news it's a $100 summons this year," he said. "We went down to Canal Street, but there were cops everywhere and no one was selling. I guess this is safer, but it's boring."
The puritanical spirit gripped several small New Jersey towns this Fourth of July, inspiring them to kill their fireworks displays, citing economic and safety concerns.
Paterson, N.J., went cold turkey four years ago. So Frank Castronuovo, an electronic technician, was hunkered down for the holiday in a club called Roma, where 100 or so Italian-American men were flipping cards and hoisting cappuccino.
It was a similarly subdued birthday for Croton Point Park, where the Hudson River was open for swimming for the first time in nearly a decade. Early reviews sounded notes of tepid acclaim.
"Once you get past the twigs and stuff, it's nice and clean," said Frankie Casdia, 10, who waded out of the water under a pecking rain, one of the two children and three adults who filtered in on opening day.
Naturally, not everybody had their freedom on Independence Day.
"It's not healthy," groaned Ray McCaskill, 37, a bus driver. "We're taking people to meet their loved ones while we have have to work."
But some saw it as exercising a different kind of liberty, the right to earn time and a half.
"If it was Christmas, I'd be upset," said Officer Ed Kehoe, Jr. of the postal inspection service, who got up at 5 A.M. to watch for drunks and firecracker fiends on the steps of the main post office. "I'd be miserable because I'd miss opening presents. But Fourth of July, you can be home by 5 and still make the barbecue."
In Coney Island, Edward Krachie, most of the year just a mechanical engineer from Maspeth, Queens, broke what one can only hope is a world record by scarfing 22 hot dogs in just 12 minutes.
"When you're 290 pounds, you've been training all your life," Mr. Krachie explained modestly at the 70th annual Independence Day Nathan's Famous hot dog eating contest.
At Jones Beach, would-be sun worshipers crowded the sand, tugging beach towels around their shoulders and legs to shield them from the gusty winds and whirling sand.
Brittani Pruitt, 17, on a vacation Bible school excursion out of Henderson, Tex., perambulated over the sand with a large silver tray lined with hamburger and hot-dog buns.
Nearby, "Baking Sue, the Cookie Princess," otherwise known as Sue Annunziato, sported a lime-green swimsuit as she hovered over a folding table laden with dozens of cakes, including her favorite, chocolate Kahlua.
They were the gift of some 30 friends who had come from Queens to surprise Mrs. Annunziato and her husband in what they thought would be a quiet celebration of their 25th anniversary.
At Central Park's northern end, about 20 people huddled in Lasker Pool, spiting the rain. Marcus Sears, 14, had only one complaint: "There weren't enough girls around."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Soars in Thin Trading As Higher U.S. Rates Are Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as a surprisingly strong United States employment report buoyed hopes for higher United States interest rates.
The dollar initially fell in New York trading, dragged down by tumbles in the United States bond and stock markets, after the Labor Department reported that 239,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month. But the same interpretation of the data that drove down stocks and bonds -- that robust economic growth would compel the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates -- eventually bolstered the dollar. 
 "This news strengthens the view that the Fed will tighten, probably in August," said Marc Chandler, a trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "It keeps the dollar going higher."
A rise in interest rates typically helps the dollar by making bank deposits in the United States more attractive.
The dollar climbed as high as 111.0 Japanese yen, its highest since Jan. 26, 1994. In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 110.85 yen, up from 110.40 yen on Thursday. The dollar traded at 1.5298 German marks, up from 1.5206. The British pound fell to $1.5525 from $1.5625.
Trading was light, however, with many traders in the United States on a long holiday weekend. American financial markets were closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July.
The dollar's rise yesterday was tempered by the sharp declines in stocks and bonds. When foreign investors sell American assets, they are converting the proceeds into other currencies.
"There's a tug-of-war for the dollar," said John McCarthy, foreign- exchange manager at ING Capital Markets. "Certainly from a yield standpoint this is positive for the dollar. But falling asset prices are not."
John Rothfield, currency strategist at Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago, predicted that the strong economy would help push the dollar to 1.60 marks and 115 yen in the next three months.
"Over all we think the data will be good for the dollar," he said. "A continuation of the dollar's rise is dependent on a firm response from the Fed, and we do expect a rate hike in August."

HEADLINE: More Work or Less Work Can Equal No Time Off;
A Vacation This Year Is Out of the Question For a Growing Number of American Families

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
To the millions of Americans fighting traffic this holiday weekend, it may seem as if just about everybody is going on vacation right now. And more than three-fifths of all families intend to take a chunk of time off this year. But Fred and Joanne Andres, who had hoped to go on a cruise, will not be among them.
Instead, the Andreses, who live in Yorktown, N.Y., are beginning a new life in Warren, Mich., where Mr. Andres is being transferred later this month. After 20 years in the personnel department of the General Motors factory in North Tarrytown, N.Y., Mr. Andres accepted the transfer after G.M. shut down the 96-year-old plant a week ago. Some 2,100 employees were transferred, laid off, discharged or chose to retire. 
 "It means having to leave the area where I've lived all my life, and we won't have time for a vacation," said the 47-year-old Mr. Andres. "But at my age and with the economy the way it is, it would be silly not to relocate."
They will not be the only ones without a vacation this year. Even in what is shaping up as a strong year for the travel industry, with many airlines, hotels and vacation resorts reporting robust business, many Americans are finding themselves without the time, flexibility or money to take an extended vacation. A substantial 38 percent of families say they have no plans to take a vacation in 1996, up from last year's 34 percent, according to Wesley Peters, whose Dimension Research company in Lombard, Ill., conducted the poll. And 14 percent of Americans who had traveled in the last year said earlier this year that they did not plan to travel on vacation this summer, up from 10 percent in 1993, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
Some of the people forgoing vacations are among the millions who lost their jobs because of corporate reorganizations and found other full-time or part-time jobs with less job security, fewer vacation days, lower pay and fewer other benefits. Others, some of them downsized workers, are now running their own businesses and feel they cannot afford or spare the time off.
Between 1991 and 1995, the number of part-time workers increased to 23.2 million from 20.1 million, and the number of self-employed rose by 322,000, to almost 10.5 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Jeff Werkheiser is one who just does not have time for a vacation. For 13 years he worked at Bethlehem Steel in Pennsylvania, just like his mother, father, grandfather and two brothers, but he foresaw hard times for the company and its workers. So he enrolled in school part time to learn to become an electrician, and four years ago -- well before Bethlehem Steel shut down its last blast furnace in the city -- he struck out on his own. Today he has four employees and two vehicles on the road.
"We're doing so well I can't take a vacation," Mr. Werkheiser said. The lesson he draws from his experience, he said, is simple: "When something happens in your life, or is about to happen, don't just stand around and accept it. You have to move on."
John Budriss of Flat Top, W. Va., a longtime banker who quit after a dispute with his boss, also will not get away on vacation -- not even for one of the long weekends that have substituted as vacations in prior years. Mr. Budriss, an expert witness who testifies at trials on bank-related matters, said it has been impossible to plan very far ahead this year, "because trials are always getting postponed." And if he could carve out a few free days, his wife, Cela Berge, cannot just pick up and take off from her job as the director of Tamarack, the West Virginia Turnpike Authority's $16.2 million arts and crafts center in Beckley.
"Many professional couples have trouble finding time to go on vacation, even for a few days, " Mr. Budriss said, "because they can't coordinate their schedules to be able to get away together."
After working in and managing bookstores for 16 years, Amy Thomas of Berkeley, Calif., bought four stores of her own in the San Francisco Bay Area last year. Now, between running the business and trying to stave off competition from nearby mega-bookstores, a vacation amounts to wishful thinking.
"When my family came here from Ohio and Oklahoma at Christmas, I had to work the whole time," Ms. Thomas said. "If I can get away next year, my dream vacations are to take my three boys to Disneyland and to meet my family in the spring, when I don't have to worry about buying gifts."
Business is so good at many temporary employment agencies that Jim Holland of Murfreesboro, Tenn., has twice had to cancel a scheduled vacation this year. "With the economy picking up," said Mr. Holland, whose Holland Group Inc. has 21 offices in six states, "I guess I just won't be able to get in a vacation this year."
Marvin Murray of Lexington Park, Md., is eager to go on a cruise to Australia, but it will not be this year, and likely not next year either. A civilian employee of the Navy, Mr. Murray puts in at least 10 hours a day, six days a week, at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St. Louis as the leader of an eight-man team that is helping to upgrade the old F/ A-18 Hornet, the twin-engine fighter-attack plane that is the mainstay of the Navy and Marine Corps.
Mr. Murray said his team had to maintain "a very aggressive schedule" in order to meet a series of deadlines, and "everybody's overworked, because the Navy has been downsizing like everybody else," But, he added, "It doesn't seem to have hurt our efficiency -- only our vacation plans."
While sweeping changes in the job market are contributing to the situation, the biggest reason people do not go on vacation in any given year is the sheer lack of money. And this year is no different. Thirty-seven percent of those who are not going on vacation this year told Dimension Research that they simply could not afford it.
Among them is Eunice Johnson, a single mother, with an 8-year-old son, who lives with her mother and works six days a week as a cook at a seafood restaurant in Litchfield Beach, S.C., "I'd like to take Aaron to Sea World" in Orlando, Fla., she said, "but I'd have to work a double shift for two weeks just to pay for tickets to get there."
Money -- the lack of it, that is -- is also keeping Marianne Jones at home in Watsonville, Calif., this year, even though she is a travel agent and therefore eligible for attractive travel discounts. But with her daughter Diane soon to start her junior year at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, after having attended a community college for two years, the bill for room, board and tuition will total almost $10,000.
"If you earn a reasonable salary," Ms. Jones said, "you don't get any college financial aid."
Dennis Adams and Carl Newton will also not be taking vacations this year, along with many other members of the six unions that struck The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News a year ago over a number of salary and contract issues.
Mr. Newton, a pressman at The Free Press since 1981, said that his wife recently started working in a department store and that he had to cancel a planned hunting trip in Montana. "I also had to sell my camper," he said, "and now my truck is up for sale."
Mr. Adams, who worked 26 years as a pressman, the last five with The Detroit News, said that since the strike he had worked a couple of weeks on another newspaper, but spends most days on the picket line while his family subsists on his wife's salary plus $150 a week from the union.
"My wife and I love to travel," Mr. Adams said, "but I have a feeling I may never get to vacation again."

Corn and Soybean Prices Fall On Better Weather Outlook

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Corn and soybean prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday following forecasts that called for ideal Midwest growing weather, easing concern that extreme heat would harm fledgling crops.
On other Chicago markets, lumber prices dropped while hogs and pork bellies surged. 
 Nearly all New York commodity markets were closed yesterday. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange closed early yesterday. All United States commodity exchanges were closed on Thursday in observance of the Fourth of July. Normal trading will resume on Monday.
Daily weather forecasts have roiled corn and soybean prices in recent weeks. Heavy rains initially delayed planting of the crops, and then above-normal temperatures raised concerns that they could be damaged.
But yesterday the National Weather Service predicted normal or below-normal temperatures combined with normal or above-normal rain would prevail across the Corn Belt through next week. That is when crops should start growing tassels for pollination, a critical period that determines the quality and quantity of corn production.
"We got ideal weather," said William Biedermann, director of research at Allendale Inc., a commodities brokerage in McHenry, Ill. "It couldn't be better." Corn for December delivery tumbled 11.5 cents, to $3.535 a bushel, while November soybeans, also the fall harvest, fell to $7.27 a bushel, down 18.5 cents. The drop sent September wheat down 5.75 cents, to $4.735 a bushel.
Lumber prices fell after a Government employment report showed surprising strength, suggesting that the Federal Reserve would soon need to raise interest rates. Higher mortgage rates would crimp demand for housing and building materials.
Lumber for September delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange tumbled as much as the $10 daily trading limit before settling at $313.30 for 1,000 board feet, off $6.
Live hogs for August delivery jumped 1.45 cents, to 56.7 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. August pork bellies, which are cured for bacon, jumped the 2-cent daily trading limit to 78.3 cents a pound.

Treasuries Drop After Jobs Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices plunged in thin trading yesterday, after an employment report showed surprising strength, immediately raising concern that the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
Just two days ago, after Fed policy makers met and left rates unchanged, the bond market was confident that it had avoided a rate increase until the next Fed meeting in late August. That confidence was shattered yesterday by the employment report, which showed that 239,000 new jobs -- much more than the 157,000 expected -- were added to the nation's payrolls in June. 
 "It's very likely the Fed will need to raise interest rates to curtail future economic growth and keep inflation from accelerating," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Rickel & Associates, a financial market research firm.
While the bond market had anticipated a rate increase this year, possibly as soon as August, the fear now is that the increase will be sooner and sharper than had been expected, Mr. Dwyer said.
With the market closing early yesterday, at 2 P.M., trading volume was light and the damage came swiftly.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond tumbled 225/32 , to 8519/32 , The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, surged to 7.18 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. The yield, a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer rates, is at its highest level since June 12, when it was 7.19 percent and expectations of a rate increase at the Fed's July policy meeting were running high.
For bondholders, yesterday's decline represented a loss of about $28 for every $1,000 invested in bonds. The Treasury market was closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July.
With many money managers taking an extended holiday weekend, the plunge in prices might have been exaggerated, analysts said.
"Gauging by the strong reaction," said Charles Roden, managing director at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, "there will likely be some stabilization in the market on Monday and some slight reduction to the downward pressure in bonds. But I think now you have established an upward yield trend in bonds."
Mr. Roden said he believed that the the short end of the market was already near a high, so even if the Fed raised rates quickly, most of the impact would be on the longer maturities.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market research and analysis firm, said yesterday's employment data indeed showed that the economy heated up in the second quarter. Employment growth was the strongest in June since the fourth quarter of 1994, setting the stage for continuing healthy economic growth in the second half.
But Mr. McCarthy also said that the economy was showing that it could grow at a healthy clip without raising inflationary pressures.
"This is exactly what the Fed wants," he said. "So, unless the economy heats up even more and there are signs that inflation is about to accelerate, we expect the Fed to stand pat."
Employment growth today is not as rapid as it was in early 1994, he said, when the Fed last began to tighten credit.

HEADLINE: Religion Journal;
Presbyterians Choose a Leader Favoring Diversity

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
This week, the Rev. John M. Buchanan stepped into a religious job that bears more than a little resemblance to top-flight diplomatic service. As the new moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), he has joined the world of the high-profile frequent flier, holding a position devoid of administrative power, but requiring detailed knowledge of church policy, as well as no small amount of tact.
In his one-year term, Mr. Buchanan is expected to appear in many places where the denomination's 2.7 million members gather to speak from pulpits, in seminary classrooms and over dinners, offering information, insight and hope about the church's worldwide work, as well as his thoughts about just what it means to be a Presbyterian in pluralistic America. 
 His predecessor, Marj Carpenter, logged 340 days on the road, said Jerry Van Marter, the church's news director. "Typically, a moderator will travel 250 days," he said. "It's basically a year off from your life."
Last Saturday, the General Assembly, the Presbyterians' legislative body, meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., elected Mr. Buchanan, 58, on the second ballot. In so doing, they chose a man perceived as a centrist on the denomination's most contentious issue, the question of whether to allow the ordination of noncelibate homosexuals. Of two other candidates, one favored changing the church's current policy to permit ordination of gay men and lesbians, while the other strongly opposed doing so.
Mr. Buchanan, by contrast, would like to see the church leave the matter to Presbyterians at the local level. "My personal preference is a church that can respect diversity," he said, in a telephone interview from Albuquerque. "The church should be big enough to allow churches to make up their minds and presbyteries to make up their minds." Presbyteries are the church's regional governing bodies.
But Mr. Buchanan is also frustrated that this controversy, which has so long dominated news about the church, threatens to make the denomination appear as a sort of single-issue debating society. "My concern," he said, "is that people think that's all Presbyterians are or all we talk about."
To counter that, Mr. Buchanan, already stepping into his role as moderator, volunteered that the General Assembly this week held a ceremony recognizing about 100 Presbyterian churches with American Indian congregations, while also honoring the work of the denomination's missionaries.
Mr. Buchanan, pastor of the 4,100-member Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. is a native of Altoona, Pa., and a graduate of the University of Chicago Divinity School. He has five children and four grandchildren.
He would like, he said, to see Presbyterians and members of other mainline Protestant churches be more upbeat about their place in the American religious culture. "We continue to lose members, and then spend an inordinate amount of our energy trying to find somebody to blame for that," he said.
Instead, the mid-1990's should offer a cultural opportunity for Protestant churches to reach out to a large number of Americans who are, he said, "asking questions of meaning and purpose and value."
Many others, from academic sociologists to clergy members of many faiths, have discerned a high tide of "seekers," people looking for a mooring for their spiritual longings and guidance in dealing with the ethical questions of daily life.
To Mr. Buchanan, the mainline Protestant churches, with their emphasis on Scripture, their tradition of teaching and their attention to social and economic issues, should be a natural destination for many of these people. "It just seems to me," he said, "that mainline religion is particularly positioned to respond to all of that faithfully, if we can just get going on it again."
From his own pulpit, he said, he has tried to preach "biblical sermons" that carry practical messages for daily living. His church offers opportunities for community service, allowing people to act as tutors to neighborhood children, visit prisoners in local jails and join in Habitat for Humanity programs building housing.
That work, he said, is open to non-members, and it draws people into the church. "We don't do that to get them to join the church, but an amazing amount of them do," he said.
As Mr. Buchanan spoke, one had the impression that he was looking over his shoulder, expecting to be summoned to duty at any moment. The General Assembly was meeting and he, as moderator, could be called back to the floor. After a few minutes, that time came.
"There's a guy out there knocking on my door," Mr. Buchanan said. "Got to go." A year from now, he should get a break.

HEADLINE: Fed Unanimous in May For Holding Rates Steady

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
The policy makers at the Federal Reserve were unanimous in their decision to hold interest rates steady at a May 21 meeting, even as they began laying the groundwork for future rate increases, according to minutes of the meeting, which were released today.
"A number of members indicated that they perceived an appreciable risk of rising labor costs and related inflation, even though there was little evidence," the minutes said. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10 to 0 at the May meeting to leave the target for the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans at 5.25 percent.
The committee met again this week and left rates unchanged.
Minutes of the May meeting suggested the central bankers found little need for immediate action.
"The members agreed that the balance of risks on inflation has shifted substantially since early in the year," the minutes said. "More recent developments indicated that the economy was stronger and rising inflation down the road could not be ruled out."
Still, Fed officials at the May policy meeting were operating under the assumption that economic growth was somewhat subdued. Employment figures, for example, "didn't look as strong as they do now," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Market Data Corporation in Rye Brook, N.Y.
Initial April employment figures showed an increase of just 2,000 nonfarm jobs; that number was later revised higher, to almost 200,000.
That helps explain why in the period between the May 21 meeting and this week's session, the policy makers did not give Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, automatic authority to increase interest rates.
However, the minutes noted that Mr. Greenspan "could call for a committee consultation" should economic indicators suggest inflation was accelerating. The Fed's goal is to maintain a steady growth rate for the economy of about 2 percent a year, a pace the policy makers regard as noninflationary.
In the first quarter, the economy grew at a faster-than-expected 2.2 percent annual rate and seems to have jumped to a 3 percent to 4 percent pace in the second quarter. Official figures for the quarter will be released on Aug. 1 by the Commerce Department.
For the first five months of the year, overall consumer prices rose at a 4.1 percent annual rate, up from 3.2 percent in the first five months of 1995 and 2.5 percent for all of last year. However, when the volatile food and energy categories are excluded, consumer prices rose at just a 3 percent pace in this year's first five months.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Koreans Begin a Wary Dialogue

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 4

 BODY:
After more than four decades of exchanging little more than threats, the United States and North Korea are beginning to engage in a dialogue aimed at enabling the North to end its isolation and become a debutante in international society.
North Korea is nobody's idea of a dance partner, and the emerging relationship with the United States resembles less a slow waltz than two gunslingers warily circling each other. But while their guns remain drawn, they are talking. 
 American officials say this reflects a changing policy as well as changing times. They warn that North Korea is in such catastrophic economic circumstances that it risks lashing out in a desperate attack on South Korea, a war that the North would lose but that could kill hundreds of thousands of people, including many of the 37,000 American troops based in South Korea.
"There's cause, it seems to me, for another risk-management approach," said the American Ambassador, James T. Laney, who is a key force behind the new push for engagement. "This in no sense is naive, nor is it an attempt to assess their behavior and see if they deserve it. They don't."
"It is simply a cold-blooded assessment of the present situation," Mr. Laney added. Engagement, he urged, can "help stave off a worst-case scenario" of a second Korean war.
The results of this emerging policy of engagement are already visible. The United States agreed last month to provide $6.2 million in emergency food aid to North Korea, American officials are expected to search in North Korea later this month for remains of Americans missing since the Korean War, and North Koreans and Americans are periodically sitting down for talks about a growing range of subjects.
In the past, South Korea has been deeply anxious about being left out whenever the United States and Japan have talked to North Korea. But these days South Korean officials seem fairly understanding of the American efforts, and Seoul itself has been taking steps to improve relations with the North.
"We feel it is imperative to bring North Korea into dialogue," said a senior South Korean Government official who asked not to be identified. He insisted that there were only "shades of differences" between Washington and Seoul about how to achieve a dialogue.
South Korea is permitting some trade with the North, and in Seoul it is possible to buy televisions and hand towels made in North Korea. The Government in South Korea has even agreed in principle to help pay North Korean athletes' way to the Olympic Games in Atlanta, officials said.
Underlying this apparent generosity is in part a recognition that North Koreans seem to be close to famine. An anchorwoman on the North's national television network recently began her show in this way: "Today, I will introduce you to tasty and healthy ways to eat wild grass."
Yet, paradoxically, another factor is a fear of suddenly winning the competition that South Korea has fought for half a century with its northern neighbor.
The worry is that if North Korea suddenly collapses or convulses, artillery shells carrying nerve gas could come hurtling toward Seoul -- or that, at the very least, South Korea would have to accommodate millions of refugees and pay to rebuild the North. Some estimates of the cost to South Korea of national reunification run to more than $200 billion.
"We don't want to see North Korean society collapse at this point," said Moon Moo Hong, the Assistant Minister for Unification. "Our major concern is to see how North Korea can stabilize itself."
The attempt to engage North Korea has been encouraged by warnings since last winter by some American intelligence analysts that a North Korean invasion of the South is becoming highly possible, perhaps even probable. These analysts, who are only a minority but include some with long experience, warn that North Korean leaders find themselves on an unsustainable course and may decide that they have no choice but to risk everything on an invasion.
The majority of North Korea-watchers in American intelligence agencies, as well as senior State Department officials, scoff at this analysis. They note that North Korean military training has fallen off sharply, and they sometimes dismiss the worriers as die-hard cold war hands who cannot see that the world has changed.
The worriers, for their part, complain that the United States and South Korean Governments are risking a catastrophic intelligence failure that could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
"I just hope I'm wrong," said one of the worriers, who compares the present situation to the American failure to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. "Because if I'm right, an awful lot of people will be killed."
While senior American and South Korean policy-makers discount the likelihood of a North Korean attack soon, they acknowledge that it was one reason for the joint offer in April for peace talks with North Korea. In its latest response to the offer, North Korean officials dropped by the State Department last week to say they are still considering the idea and asked for more financial aid to sweeten the deal, officials here said.
If North Korea does formally agree to the peace talks, then the United States is likely to lift trade restrictions on North Korea, and South Korea will probably agree to encourage businesses to invest more in North Korea.
"If they will enter the North-South dialogue, we can solve many of the problems that North Korea faces," said Kim Sook, a Foreign Ministry official.
In theory, the American warming to North Korea is supposed to run parallel to an improvement in relations between the two Koreas. But North Korea has shown no willingness to engage the South. This week a North Korean radio broadcast described the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, in typically undiplomatic terms:
"It seems as though the time has come for Kim Young Sam to be beaten to death, since even the children in South Korea are damning him as a harmful vermin."
Still, the South says it accepts the growing American effort to engage North Korea and welcomes the idea of an exchange of liaison offices by North Korea and the United States. Officials say liaison offices could open soon, except that North Korea has refused an American demand to send supplies to its mission in North Korea across the demilitarized zone. Some experts wonder if the North is simply getting cold feet about an American presence in its capital.
"The question is, do they really want to be engaged, at least in the way we have in mind?" asked a longtime Western analyst who is critical of the engagement approach. "I don't think so."
Another concern about the engagement approach in some quarters is that it may be leading the Clinton Administration to ignore intelligence that portrays North Korea in a bad light -- including indications that American prisoners of war may still be held in North Korea, or that North Korea may be counterfeiting $100 bills and peddling them abroad. Some experts also note that food sent to North Korea could perhaps help not only hungry citizens but also the North Korean Army.

HEADLINE: Private Eyes and Government Files

 BODY:
Checking the background and reliability of Government workers seeking security clearances is a sensitive job that can easily be mishandled, as the White House abuse of F.B.I. files shows. But the way to keep the system clean and efficient is not to turn it over to private business. The potential for misuse of privileged information is too great.
But turn it over is just what the Clinton Administration is doing. Under a misguided reform proposed by Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing Government" program, the Federal Government is getting ready to transfer 40 percent of its employee security checking to private hands. 
 The plan terminates the Government jobs of 700 workers in the Office of Federal Investigations, part of the Office of Personnel Management. On Monday morning, those same workers will be the employee-owners of the private United States Investigation Service, under contract to continue checking backgrounds for the Energy and Treasury Departments, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other Federal agencies. The Administration boasts this is the first employee-owned company to be spun off from the Federal Government.
The F.B.I. now contracts out some security checks on its own employees, but the number is small, the bureau uses its own retired agents and it maintains tight control over the outside work. The economies promised under the Gore plan, presented as one of its main selling points, are not certain. The Government predicts a five-year saving of $20 million. While the plan does shrink the Federal payroll by 700 people and their benefit packages, the Government will still handle some of the work, creating the potential for duplication. The initial contract is a three-year, sole-source, non-competitive agreement with a work force that is experienced but untested in the private sector.
But the decisive issue here should not be saving money but preserving privacy and the security of sensitive information. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Representative Thomas Davis, Republican of Virginia, unsuccessfully tried to block the transfer of responsibility. They rightly questioned whether the new company would enjoy the confidence of state and local authorities and wondered how the private entity will be policed for compliance with Federal privacy laws. Mixing profits and privacy is a bad idea.
Congress, having approved the transfer, had better be vigilant to see that it works, and quick to reverse it if problems develop.

HEADLINE: A New Dominican President

 BODY:
Save for the risky political debts incurred by their candidate, voters in the Dominican Republic who backed Leonel Fernandez Reyna for President are right to be jubilant. In Sunday's runoff, the cleanest election in memory, the victor by a narrow margin was a 42-year-old street-smart lawyer who grew up in New York City. A Knicks fan who can sink a basketball from the three-point line, Mr. Fernandez offers a zestful contrast to the 89-year-old incumbent, Joaquin Balaguer, the republic's iron-willed and crafty President who has served seven terms over the last 35 years.
A candidate of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the President-elect made promises much like those of his rival, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the once leftist but now likewise centrist Dominican Revolutionary Party. Both parties pledged to root out corruption and poverty. This consensus is not surprising since both parties at different times were led by Juan Bosch, whose anti-imperialist jeremiads once caused shudders in Washington. Mr. Bosch, now 87, has sponsored the rise of Mr. Fernandez, who favors market economics and speaks affectionately about his ties with New York, where most Dominican immigrants, legal and illegal, have chosen to live. 
 For the most part, this evolution is encouraging. Washington has an obvious interest in the political stability of Hispaniola, the island that the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti. Two good candidates squared off in an election whose fairness impressed qualified monitors, notably Jimmy Carter, and it promises an orderly transition after decades under a capricious strong man. Clouding this prospect is Mr. Balaguer's reluctance to let go.
After Mr. Fernandez lost the first round, the old President formed a pact with Mr. Bosch, his lifelong foe, to defeat a front-runner whom both bitterly opposed. Advertising by Mr. Balaguer's supporters claimed that Mr. Pena Gomez was not a Dominican but a Haitian who planned to unite the two countries. The Balaguer machine not only assured Mr. Fernandez his winning majority but can exert powerful legislative leverage, since the President-elect's party won a single seat in the Senate and only 12 out of 120 in the lower house.
It now appears that in return for votes from Mr. Balaguer's party in the National Congress, the President-elect has promised to consult the outgoing President on policies and jobs, "sharing the bread" in local parlance. Fortunately, there is still time for Mr. Fernandez to dispel doubts and show he has not mortgaged himself and his principles to his predecessor.

HEADLINE: Recycle More and Spend Less

BYLINE: By Barry Commoner; Barry Commoner is director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College.

 BODY:
In his recent assault on New York City's recycling law, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani contended that the program was irresponsible and harmful to the recycling industry.
But there is ample evidence that recycling will do two things the Mayor says he wants: reduce the city's trash disposal costs and increase manufacturing jobs. 
 In February 1991, in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, the Sanitation Department began an intensified recycling program. The pilot program required 6,000 households to recycle waste from a wide range of materials, including junk mail, clothing, drapery and yogurt containers.
In half the households, residents were also asked to do something that people might find rather unpleasant: recycle food waste and soiled paper, which would be later converted into compost at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
Since participation was voluntary, this was a rigorous test of New Yorkers' willingness to recycle.
For three years, the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College monitored the program. We found that, overall, 85 percent of the households recycled. We also found that, at the start of the program, only 18 percent of the trash was recycled. Three years later, 40 percent was recycled (30 percent in the part of Park Slope where food and soiled paper was not included).
These results might be dismissed, because the residents of Park Slope are largely middle-class and civic-minded. (In 1990, the neighborhood's median household income was $44,000, compared with $30,000 citywide.)
But in a test conducted for a year in Starrett at Spring Creek, a large low-income apartment complex in Brooklyn where the median household income is only $16,000, the recycling rate improved 63 percent, as much as it did in the first year in Park Slope.
This success makes recycling a cost-effective program. In the rest of New York City, at the present low rate of recycling, garbage trucks must make many stops to pick up little or no material at each stop. (Separate trucks pick up separate materials.) Collection, which accounts for the largest part of the trash-disposal budget, is thus much more costly than necessary.
If the recycling program had been allowed to expand, as mandated by law, to 4,250 tons daily -- 25 percent of the residential garbage collected -- each truck would collect more material, and annual collection costs would be about $10 million a year lower than they are now.
The recycling rate can be increased citywide by including additional trash in the program and by improving participation through outreach and education.
In June 1995, a citywide pickup of junk mail was supposed to start, but didn't. The Mayor's 1996 budget eliminated it, together with most of the outreach and education program. The budget also reduces recycling pickups in most parts of the city from once every week to once every two weeks. This will make participation harder and further reduce the recycling rate.
Recycling can help reverse the drastic decline in manufacturing in New York City by providing cost-effective raw materials for local manufacturers.
The Queens College study suggests that if all recyclable materials were put into the city's program, and if participation rose to the level achieved in Park Slope, enough material would be made available at competitive prices to support 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing.
This would add perhaps $1 billion annually to the city's economy, generating possibly $50 million in tax revenues.
Mayor Giuliani is right when he says recycling is "not a religion." But he is wrong in underestimating its value to the environment and the economy.

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Says Qaddafi Violated Air Curbs

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 5

 BODY:
A United Nations sanctions committee said today that flights by Libyan aircraft taking Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, to and from an Arab summit meeting in Cairo last month violated sanctions imposed in 1992. The committee said it would consider seeking tougher curbs if the violation was repeated.
Libya has been the target of United Nations sanctions -- including an air flight ban -- for failing to surrender for trial two men indicted in Britain and the United States on charges of bombing a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people. 
 The Libya sanctions committee of the Security Council, in a statement after a closed meeting, said it had "considered the fact that Libyan-registered aircraft flew from Tripoli to Cairo on June 22 and back to Tripoli on June 23, 1996."
It also said it took note of an interview Colonel Qaddafi gave to an Arabic-language television network in which he said he intended to fly from Tripoli to Algiers in the near future.
The United States first raised the issue of the flights on June 24 when its chief United Nations delegate, Madeleine K. Albright, asked for a report about why the Libyan leader was able to flout the air embargo.
Egyptian officials said at the time that Colonel Qaddafi's arrival came as a surprise and that allowing him to fly home was a political decision linked to his attending a summit meeting.

HEADLINE: Building Lives on Brooklyn's Scaffolds

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
There are no brownstones in Bangladesh.
But in the brownstone corridors of Brooklyn, the men who wipe grime off the aging stone buildings, restore their cracking stoops and spruce up their cornices are increasingly immigrants from Bangladesh.
"Sometimes, people ask, 'Where did you learn to do this?' " said Mostafizur Rahman, a construction worker who splits his time between Bangladesh and Borough Park. "Some of us say, 'Oh, we did this at home.' That's not really true. There is nothing like this at home." 
 Over the last two decades, Bangladeshi immigrants have gained a foothold in the city's construction industry, particularly in home renovations and brownstone work. They did not bring with them a particular penchant for this trade. But after a handful of Bangladeshis entered the field, others followed, many of them undocumented or hobbled in English, relying on compatriot connections to find work.
So in a field that requires little capital or credit, small Bangladeshi contractors proliferated, buoyed by a steady stream of low-wage workers from back home and an exclusive ethnic network through which skills and resources are passed on. A new wave of immigrants -- Bangladeshis and other South Asians, as well as Caribbean and Hispanic workers -- began to replace the Italian and other European immigrants who once dominated the field. Contractors do acknowledge, however, that the high end of the restoration business still belongs to white companies.
According to the Planning Department, New York City is home to 20,000 Bangladeshis, though Bangladeshis say that is a vast underestimate. About 1,900 Bangladeshis land in the city every year, according to Frank Vardy, a department demographer.
No one knows exactly how many Bangladeshis are in the construction business, though most Bangladeshi newcomers probably earn a living in low-paying service jobs traditionally held by new immigrants: selling apples on the street, flipping burgers, driving cabs. But the Bangladeshi presence in the construction trade provides one more clue how immigrants create niches for themselves in the city's economy.
Roger Waldinger, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies immigrants in New York, said that all ethnic niches -- whether Greek diners or Korean greengroceries -- emerge in response to barriers that newcomers face in the mainstream economy.
Luck can be crucial, Dr. Waldinger said -- "just being there at a time when there is opportunity and when, for whatever reasons, there isn't a lot of competition." Dr. Waldinger wrote the forthcoming book "Still the Promised City? New Immigrants and African-Americans in Post-Industrial New York" (Harvard University Press).
Immigrants' ethnic contacts are also important, he added. "The great advantage for Bangladeshi entrepreneurs is that all of a sudden, there are all these workers available who have relatively few opportunities."
Noorl Hoq, 77, who now spends his days on his favorite recliner in the kitchen of the Windsor Terrace home he shares with his children and grandchildren, is said to have been one of the first Bangladeshis who broke into construction.
Mr. Hoq, a native of a swampy Bangladeshi region known as Sandwip, had been a sailor on a British ship. In 1962, he went ashore in New York Harbor and decided to stay. Back then, a South Asian face was rare. "New York was black and white," he said.
For two years, Mr. Hoq worked for a West Indian contractor. He then branched out on his own. Ten years later, Shafiqul Alam arrived from Sandwip with Mr. Hoq's telephone number in hand. Mr. Alam, trained as a pharmacist, entered the construction business through Mr. Hoq. "We all learned to hold a paintbrush and trowel from him," said Mr. Alam, who now runs a general contracting company.
Dozens of construction workers today can trace their roots to Mr. Hoq. But there is also Abdul Malek of Bedford-Stuyvesant, who apprenticed with an African-American contractor 20 years ago before venturing out on his own.
Last week, Mr. Malek's brother, Abdul Wahab, put the finishing touches on a brick apartment house on Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn Heights. For three months, he dangled from the scaffolds, creating faux-brownstone lintels to frame the windows, applying a fresh coat of rust red to the four-story apartment house and coating its first floor with layers of fresh cement. He and his helpers also laid oak beams in an aging brownstone mansion down the block and put new flooring in the basement of a third house.
For men who grew up in stucco houses surrounded by coconut palms, the construction business is a new world. But Mr. Wahab said his compatriots from the Indian subcontinent were swift learners. "We built the Taj Mahal, didn't we?" he said. "So we can build another one here."
Like many Bangladeshi contractors, Mr. Wahab prefers to hire Bangladeshis. "It's easier to communicate," he said. "You can trust them." Another contractor, Abdul Baten, claimed that Bangladeshis work harder. "One man," he said, "can work for two men."
A boast, perhaps, but the stereotype of diligence and reliability underscores a truism about immigrant niches: few jobs go to outsiders.
Dr. Waldinger added that a Bangladeshi immigrant may be willing to work long hours for low wages because he is likely to enjoy long-term payoffs that a non-Bangladeshi would not. He is vested with more trust and responsibility; with a slew of contacts among Bangladeshi contractors, he can peddle skills elsewhere. As Dr. Waldinger put it, "The nature of ethnic ties between the employer and employee and the connections that span the industry provide a certain motivation to members of that ethnic group to work harder."
Most workers, Mr. Alam said, have the resources to do only small, residential jobs, though some veterans have acquired licenses and bonds that allow them to bid on larger commercial projects. For instance, Mr. Alam, who is a licensed general contractor, has just finished renovating a school in Flatbush.
Still, he said, Bangladeshis have not been able to break into larger public projects because they lack political connections. "Our cousins aren't senators."
Moreover, Bangladeshis encounter prejudice from customers, Mr. Alam complained, adding that some white homeowners choose white contractors even if their rates are higher. "We get a lot of work from black people and from Hispanics," he said, during a break in a recent meeting of the Sandwip Association, a civic group whose community center is in the back of a bodega in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. Kensington, where most of the workers live, has become a center of Bangladeshi life in New York. Many of the workers, who are single or here without their families, go home for the winter and return to the scaffolds every spring.
Their intervention in the construction trade has not gone unnoticed by old-timers. "I've definitely seen the Italians go out of business and the Bangladeshis taking over many of the jobs that we used to do," said Jim Buscarella, a third-generation owner of Jabus Building Corporation in Brooklyn, which specializes in building renovations. "They work cheaper, harder, longer."
Mr. Buscarella said many Bangladeshis charged half his rates. But their skill, he added, often matches their prices. "It's like comparing a Mercedes to a Chevy," he said.
Perched on his scaffold on Eighth Avenue in Park Slope, Antonio Costas, who was born into a family of stone specialists in La Coruna, Spain, shook his head at the mention of Bangladeshi construction workers. Even though they charge less, he said, they pose no threat to him.
Mr. Costas, whose employees are mostly from Mexico, maintained that the renovations trade belongs to natives of countries that specialize in stone architecture, like Spain and Italy. "This is a job for the Europeans," he said.
Mr. Alam dismisses such claims, although he agrees that prices have dropped as more Bangladeshis have entered the trade. Ten years ago, he recalled, "there wasn't one block on Fort Greene or Park Slope where I didn't erect a scaffold." Today, the market is flooded. And while it squeezes his profit margin, he is sympathetic. "We can't tell them not to come," he said. "We did it. They will do it, too."

HEADLINE: Dole's Military Card

BYLINE: By Doug Bandow; Doug Bandow, a fellow at the Cato Institute, is the author of "Tripwire: Korea and U. S. Foreign Policy in a Changed World."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So far, the Presidential campaign is being waged largely over domestic issues. Yet the difference between the parties is much wider when it comes to military matters.
If leading Republican strategists have their way, the United States will commit American lives and wealth to enforcing a new form of imperial order. 
 As he campaigns, Bob Dole has said little more than that America must spend more on the military. The Clinton Administration has "eroded American power and purpose," he said recently. "Our defense budget has been cut too far and too fast."
So military outlays must rise above the current $260 billion per year. How far, he doesn't say. But the conservative Heritage Foundation has started the bidding at $20 billion more annually. Baker Spring, a Heritage defense analyst, wrote in a recent policy paper that "the time is rapidly approaching when the U.S. will have to decide between remaining a global power capable of preventing wars, or becoming a mere regional military power, condemned to fight and possibly lose them."
He writes this at a time when America is a military colossus. The United States accounts for almost 40 percent of all military spending on earth. It spends at least three times as much as Russia -- and twice as much as Britain, France, Germany and Japan combined.
America's allies can stand up to every conceivable security threat on their own. Western Europe's gross domestic product and population are greater than our own. South Korea has about 18 times the gross domestic product and twice the population of North Korea. In such a world we risk losing a war? To whom?
Some Republican analysts want to increase military outlays by far more than $20 billion. In the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, and Robert Kagan, a former policy analyst for the Bush Administration, called for an extra $60 billion to $80 billion. This would come on top of defense spending that is already, in real terms, higher than in 1980, when America still faced the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact nations and the threat of global Communism.
Mr. Kristol and Mr. Kagan, however, may be pikers compared to Haley Barbour, the Republican National Party chairman. In his new book, "Agenda for America," Mr. Barbour argues that we must "rejuvenate our military capability." He advocates improving military readiness, expanding procurement and strengthening the private military supply sector. Like Mr. Dole, he supplies no price tag, but Jonathan Clarke, a Cato Institute associate, figures the Barbour program could add up to an astounding annual increase of $140 billion.
What is the United States to do with all this additional military might? It faces no serious security threat. And current spending is already far greater than necessary to defend the country or backstop our prosperous allies in an emergency.
Such an enormous military buildup is necessary only to police the globe: to meddle in civil wars in distant continents, to restore order in chaotic societies and to extend American security guarantees, through NATO, right up to Russia's borders. The idea, in the words of Mr. Kristol and Mr. Kagan, is to establish a "benevolent hegemony" and to "preserve that hegemony as far into the future as possible."
They argue that this "is not a radical proposal," but it is. In effect, it would mean, as the historian Francis Fukuyama wrote approvingly in a letter to Commentary, that "Americans should be prepared, when the time comes, to have their people die for Poland."
Similarly, Edward Luttwak, a former Reagan policy adviser, waxed nostalgic in Foreign Affairs about large families. When they predominated, he wrote, "a death in combat was not the extraordinary and fundamentally unacceptable event that it is now."
So what is Bob Dole's proposed military policy? The American people should not accept vague proposals about spending more on defense. And if he becomes President, Mr. Dole should create a foreign policy and military fit for the Republic America purports to be, not the empire some wish it to become.

HEADLINE: Hourly Wage Jumps for 2d Straight Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A big jump last month in hourly earnings, reported yesterday by the Labor Department, suggests that the wage stagnation plaguing so many Americans may be lifting, at least temporarily.
The June number by itself does not make that case, although the rise of 9 cents, to $11.82, in the average hourly pay of 83 million nonmanagement production workers is the biggest one-month cash increase on record, and the biggest percentage increase since September 1983. As any labor economist will say, this monthly number jumps around a lot. What is striking, however, is the trend. 
 What happened in June, and also in May, brought the average annual hourly wage increase for the nation's front-line workers to a level noticeably above the inflation rate. For a year, the hourly wage increase, measured over a 12-month period, had hovered around 3 percent, rising very gradually and keeping a bit above the annual inflation rate. Then in May, the hourly wage jumped, coming in at 3.3 percent above its level a year earlier, and in June the increase was 3.4 percent. The inflation rate, meanwhile, has not moved.
Similar breakthroughs occurred for short periods in the 1980's, and the current one may also be short-lived, even if it persists for as long as a year. But the possibility, in a Presidential election year, that the wages of millions of Americans may have finally embarked on a long-term upward trend is giving voice to an increasingly heated debate.
Most of Wall Street's stock and bond dealers want the process stopped. They see in the wage increases evidence that a persistently strong economy will soon raise the inflation rate, eroding the value of securities in the process. They point not only to yesterday's jump in hourly wages, but also to a similar jump in the wages and salaries of the entire work force, reported earlier. The wage component of the employment cost index, covering management as well as nonmanagement workers, jumped to an annual increase of 3.3 percent in the first quarter after having remained at 2.9 percent through all of last year, the Labor Department announced in April. The second-quarter number will be released later this month.
"The data portray an imminent danger of accelerating wage and price pressures in the U.S. economy," John R. Williams, an economist with Bankers Trust, advised clients yesterday. Echoing a widely held view on Wall Street, he said that "the Federal Reserve has no choice" but to raise interest rates, thus slowing the economy by discouraging purchases on credit. A slower economy, according to this reasoning, would reduce wage increases and keep inflation from accelerating.
Many economists, particularly on Wall Street, insist that even mildly rising wages will eventually force businesses to raise prices, thus pushing up the inflation rate to unacceptable levels. They insist that a spurt in economic growth in the second quarter will not die out during the summer and fall, as many forecasters had predicted. Without this relief, they say, wages will continue to rise, providing the wherewithal for people to buy more and pay more for each item they buy.
Such reasoning angers many corporate executives, who insist that they are facing unusually rough competition today and this prevents them from raising prices. The gradual rise in the hourly wages of their production workers that began in the summer of 1993, they say, hardly constitutes enough pressure on them to force up prices.
What's more, says Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, the June unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, while low, is not low enough to force companies to compete for workers, who are still sufficiently plentiful. "The competition among workers for good jobs today," he said, "indicates that we can go to a 5.2 percent unemployment rate for a while without inflation accelerating."
The Clinton Administration takes a similar stand. "The second quarter was very strong," said Martin Bailey, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, "but our forecast is for the economy to return to its potential, noninflationary growth pattern in the second half of the year. We are also discovering that the economy can operate with somewhat lower unemployment rates than we had realized without accelerating inflation."
More to the point, Mr. Bailey said, the productivity of American workers is improving enough to keep unit labor costs -- the amount spent on labor to make a pair of shoes or a car or a computer -- from rising at more than the inflation rate. "So the wage increases we are seeing," he said, "are perfectly consistent with maintaining a mild inflation rate."
Putting the issue in an election context, Peter Gottschalk, a Boston University economist, said: "If you were a low-wage worker and someone asked if you were willing to risk a little higher inflation to get a higher wage, you would probably say yes, viewing the issue differently than a highly paid person with a secure job whose downside risk is inflation."
The service sector, rather than manufacturing and construction, accounted for most of the increase in the hourly wage in June. The service sector includes store clerks, real estate and insurance industry employees, office workers, health service employees, and those employed by hotels, restaurants and entertainment companies. The average wage in this broad category rose to $11.28 an hour in June from $11.18 in May. That is $23,460 annually for those working 40 hours a week, all year.
For all production workers, in all sectors, the $11.82 an hour in June -- up 9 cents, or nearly eight-tenths of a percent, from May's level -- represented $24,585 annually for those working full time.

HEADLINE: Paul Alpert, 89; Economist and U.N. Aide

 BODY:
Paul Alpert, an economist, author and retired senior United Nations official, died on Wednesday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 89.
Mr. Alpert's books, which he wrote in both English and French, dealt with economic history and development. They included "Partnership or Confrontation: Poor Lands and Rich" (Free Press, 1973), and "Twentieth Century Economic History of Europe" (Henry Schuman, 1951). 
 In "Partnership or Cooperation," he warned that the cold war would be superseded by a growing conflict between rich and poor nations. It argued for improving economic and social conditions in the third world.
Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, he studied at the University of Paris, where he earned a doctorate in law and economics. He served in the French Navy in World War II and was captured and imprisoned by the Germans. After the war he covered the Nuremberg trials as a press attache of the French Foreign Ministry and was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his wartime service.
He joined the staff of the United Nations in 1947 and retired in 1971 as chief of training programs for technical cooperation. Concurrently, he was an adjunct professor of economics at New York University.
Mr. Alpert is survived by a son, Laurent, and a daughter, Sylvie Bryant, both of New York City.

HEADLINE: Signs of Unexpected Growth Send Markets Tumbling

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Most of Wall Street took the day off, but those who came to work yesterday reacted with alarm to the disclosure that a lot more Americans were working than had been anticipated. The report renewed concern that the Federal Reserve would soon tighten credit, despite the fact it took no such action at a meeting that ended on Wednesday.
Bond traders began selling as soon as the Labor Department reported that 229,000 Americans found work in June, many more than expected. Trading was thin, mild rally attempts failed, and the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.18 percent, up a quarter of a percentage point from Wednesday. 
 In the stock market, prices plunged on the opening, then rallied a bit in midmorning before falling again just after noon. The stock market closed at 1 P.M., with the Dow Jones industrial average down 2 percent, or 114.88, and the bond market an hour later, on a day when few traders were at their desks. The markets had been closed on Thursday for the Fourth of July, and many traders decided to enjoy a four-day weekend.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 5,588.14, down 66.49 for the week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had an even worse day, plunging 14.96 points, or 2.2 percent, to 657.44. It was the worst day for both indexes since March 8, another Friday when a strong employment report stunned traders.
The Federal Reserve apparently had little if any of the information from the employment report when it met, econmists said, and many said they expected the Fed's Open Market Committee to act to bolster short-term interest rates at its next meeting on Aug. 20, if not before.
"There is an increasing risk that the Fed is not going to want to wait, if it continues to see numbers like we saw today," said Gary Thayer, a senior economist at A. G. Edwards, a brokerage firm.
While some people joked that the selloff in stocks indicated that bulls were on vacation, while bears were too poor to afford even a long weekend, there was concern that the selling would continue next week.
"The market is voting, saying it looks like rates will be raised, which does not bode well for the bond market or the stock market," said Robert Froehlich, the chief investment strategist for Van Kampen American Capital, a money management firm.
For the first time in a few years, the Labor Department figures indicate that workers' paychecks are rising faster than inflation. That is good news for the workers, but it prompts inflation fears and could cause the Fed to take action.
There had been hopes that the Fed would not act in August, and then would delay any action after that until after the election because it has been traditionally hesitant to act in the final months of a Presidential campaign. "The hope was that if we could just get past this number, it would get us past the August meeting," Mr. Froehlich said.
While the bond market has been weak for much of 1996, stocks have generally done well, bouncing back from setbacks like that of March 8, in which the Dow gave up 171 points, only to recover all of them in less than two weeks. Last month, in fact, when a strong jobs report came out, the Dow fell 85 points in early trading but then recovered all of it that same day, winding up with a gain of 29 points.
A strong economy benefits stocks by aiding corporate earnings. But rising interest rates can put a damper on stock prices.
The economy had been slow in late 1995, but took off this year, to the surprise of many forecasters. Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Capital Investments International, a New York brokerage firm, said the economy was acting normally -- assuming it was just coming out of a recession. He noted that the recovery from the 1990 recession, in fact, began gently and that it appeared that it had taken until now for consumers to get the confidence to spend enough to really spur the economy.
The prospect of higher interest rates was viewed as a mild positive for the dollar, which has been rising in any case, and the American currency edged up in slow trading against most currencies.
While the Nasdaq composite fell almost as much as the Dow, dipping 23.25 points, or 1.97 percent, to 1,158.35, other indexes of small stocks did a bit better. The S.& P. index of mid-cap stocks fell 1.6 percent and the S.& P. index of small-cap stocks declined by 1.3 percent.
All 30 of the stocks in the Dow industrial average dropped, as did more than 2,000 other stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Among the Dow stocks, the largest losers, each shedding $2 or more, were Philip Morris, Eastman Kodak, General Motors and J. P. Morgan. Financial stocks were seen as suffering from anticipated higher interest rates, while Philip Morris was reacting in part to an inquiry by the Italian Government into possible tax fraud.
Yesterday's dip left the bond market near its 1996 lows, set last month when the yield on 30-year Treasuries hit 7.19 percent, up from less than 6 percent when the year began.
But the Dow is still up 9.2 percent in 1996 while down just 3.3 percent from the peak it reached on May 22. The Nasdaq composite is up 10.1 percent this year, but its recent fall has been greater because it contains more weak technology issues. It is off 7.3 percent from the peak it hit on June 5.
The prospect of higher interest rates dragged down the stocks of banking companies and brokerage firms. Citicorp fell 2 7/8, to 79 7/8; Nationsbank declined 2 5/8, to 82, and Merrill Lynch fell 2 7/8, to 62 3/4. And J. P. Morgan, which led the decline in the Dow, fell 2 7/8, to 84 1/8.
Computer stocks also slumped. Hewlett-Packard slid 2, to 92 1/8, after Goldman, Sachs & Company removed the stock from its recommended list. Digital, which announced further cutbacks and warned of weaker earnings on Tuesday, fell 1/2, to 38 1/2. For the week, the stock fell 15 percent. I.B.M. declined 5/8, to 97 7/8.
Shares of auto makers were weaker after reports this week of slowing auto sales. Ford Motor slipped 1/2, to 31 3/8; Chrysler dropped 2, to 57 7/8, and General Motors fell 2, to 50 1/8.
American depository receipts of the News Corporation bucked the market slump, rising 1/4, to 23 3/8. "Independence Day," a film released by the company's 20th Century Fox unit, shattered box-office records, grossing more than $46 million in one premiere and two full days of distribution. Each A.D.R. represents four ordinary shares of the Australian company.
On overseas markets, stocks were generally lower. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues slipped 60.49 points, or nearly three-tenths of 1 percent, at 22,232.42. For the week, the Nikkei was down 298.33 points.
After a sharp gain on Thursday, London stocks fell sharply in the afternoon on news of the surge in United States employment, which could drive interest rates higher worldwide. The Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares erased an early 30-point gain and closed down 17.4 points at 3,743.2. The index was up 32 points on the week.

HEADLINE: Russian Vote Sets Off Battle, This Time in Yeltsin's Camp

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 5

 BODY:
Two days after President Boris N. Yeltsin scored a resounding re-election victory, his top aides are involved in a bruising and very public struggle for power.
Tension between the new security chief, Aleksandr I. Lebed, and the reappointed Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, has simmered for weeks as Mr. Lebed boldly outlined his outsized ambitions, including shaping economic policy and positioning himself as Mr. Yeltsin's successor. 
 Mr. Lebed, a former general who was brought into the Yeltsin camp only after he took third place in the first round of presidential voting on June 16, seemed at first to have bullied his way to the top.
But Mr. Chernomyrdin has regained the upper hand, and his allies are sternly lecturing Mr. Lebed to restrain his push for power and curb his tongue.
Anatoly B. Chubais, a former Deputy Prime Minister and a key Yeltsin campaign official, rebuked Mr. Lebed today, casting him as a hungry young politician who is in too much of a hurry. "This demand of Aleksandr Ivanovich Lebed for broader powers is a serious mistake of a novice state leader," Mr. Chubais said.
Compounding the insult, Mr. Chubais mocked nationalist blasts by Mr. Lebed against Mormons and other religious groups that he has complained are proselytizing in Russia.
"There are some shortcomings regarding the balance and profundity of his statements," Mr. Chubais said, adding sarcastically: "It is quite possible, though, that he confused Mormons and Masons. Such things happen."
The official position notwithstanding, Mr. Lebed's supporters have made it clear that they want their standard-bearer to bring to the Government the same uncompromising attitude he exhibited on the campaign trail.
"Lebed is not inclined to play the political games according to the rules established in the Kremlin," said Aleksei Golovkov, a campaign aide to Mr. Lebed and the deputy chairman of Parliament's budget committee. "Either he will be squeezed out of these games and will be compelled to leave, or the rules of the game will be changed."
American officials have been following the Kremlin intrigue closely, especially in light of reports that Mr. Yeltsin's health may be faltering.
They said Mr. Yeltsin was clearly boosting Mr. Chernomyrdin over Mr. Lebed by picking the Prime Minister to oversee the formation of the new Cabinet. Mr. Yeltsin also mentioned Mr. Chernomyrdin favorably in a 25-minute phone conversation with President Clinton today, American officials said.
"The Lebed phenomenon is by no means over," an American official said. "But Chernomyrdin is much more the man of the hour. Yeltsin needed Lebed up to but not much beyond the poll."
But some specialists said Mr. Yeltsin could not afford to alienate his popular aide totally for fear that he might resign and stage a crusade against the Government.
From the start, Mr. Lebed has been outspoken and stubbornly determined.
A paratrooper by training, Mr. Lebed headed the 14th Army in Moldova, a former Soviet republic, where he vigorously defended the interests of ethnic Russians.
Forced into retirement by the Defense Minister at the time, Pavel S. Grachev, Mr. Lebed turned politician, appealing to Russians longing for a strong hand to bring order.
His campaign headquarters, situated incongruously in an art school across the street from the Tretryakov Gallery, was run, in part, by former military aides. They included Gennadi G. Tupikin, a retired colonel and the Lebed campaign spokesman, and Vladimir A. Krivilev, a retired major general and head of a policy analysis team.
In a recent interview, Mr. Tupikin recalled approvingly how General Lebed had asked Moldovan forces to stop harassing Russian positions, before taking matters into his own hands and ordering an artillery barrage.
Before the presidential runoff on Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin invited Mr. Lebed to serve as his national security adviser and head of his Security Council, calculating that Mr. Lebed's anti-crime image could insulate the Government from charges that it had been soft on corruption.
Mr. Lebed raised concerns among Yeltsin aides when, addressing supporters in Moscow, he acted more like a czar than a security adviser, liberally dispensing favors and promises of action.
And even after he joined the Yeltsin team, his campaign headquarters had an anti-Yeltsin flavor. "Yeltsin -- freedom without order," one poster at his headquarters said. "Lebed -- freedom and order."
Mr. Lebed did nothing to hide his ambition to replace his new political mentor, even suggesting the creation of a new post of Vice President, to which he might be appointed.
Asked by a German magazine if thought he might become President after Mr. Yeltsin's term ends in 2000, he gruffly replied, "Possibly sooner," an impolitic reference to the President's uncertain health.
Significantly, Mr. Lebed also served notice that he planned to use his national security post to delve into economic policy, a strange move for a former general but an understandable one for a populist-minded politician. "National security issues today also include such things as our growing dependence on food imports," he told reporters.
But he also gave the impression that he was out of his depth on economics. He defended the right to private property and called Communism a failed ideology. But beyond that, his economic thinking has been a somewhat amorphous mix of protectionism, populism and capitalist themes.
Underscoring the impression that his economic views are still in flux, he sought advice from a left-leaning economist, Sergei Y. Glazyev, and from a staunch free-market proponent, Vitaly A. Naishul.
Today, at least, the blunt Mr. Lebed kept a relatively low profile, meeting with law enforcement officials to develop plans to crack down on crime in the Moscow area.
Some Yeltsin aides said it was possible that Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Lebed could forge an alliance, in which the Prime Minister would shoulder broad responsibilities for political and economic policy while Mr. Lebed would concentrate on fighting crime and corruption.
Tempering his criticism of Mr. Lebed with a conciliatory gesture, Mr. Chubais said there was a chance that the Prime Minister and the national security adviser "will find a common tongue."
But some Lebed supporters were skeptical.
Asked if he foresaw friction between the two men, Mr. Golovkov issued a blunt reply: "Absolutely."

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE FOR JUNE AT 5.3%; LOWEST IN 6 YEARS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in June, its lowest point in six years, as signs of inflation appeared suddenly to mount, Labor Department figures showed today.
The fall in the unemployment rate was three-tenths of a percentage point, from 5.6 percent in May. The stunningly strong report, the first broad gauge of the economy's performance for the month, touched off sharp declines in the securities markets, where fears have been building of over-rapid growth that would produce rising wage demands and higher prices and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit to keep inflation in check. 
 Interest rates surged across the board, with the yield on long-term Treasury bonds rocketing one-quarter point, to 7.18 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average skidding 114.88 points, or slightly more than 2 percent, in a session shortened by the holiday weekend. [Page 31.]
The Clinton Administration pounced on the news to proclaim the success of its economic policies and to seek to convince voters that Americans have rarely enjoyed such a favorable combination of strong economic growth, low unemployment and inflation that has run at less than 3 percent for four years.
"We have the most solid American economy in a generation," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference.
Today's report came just after the Federal Reserve, in a two-day session that ended Wednesday, passed up a chance to raise the short-term interest rates over which it exerts considerable control. The Federal Reserve seemingly had enough cause to believe that the economy would be slowing on its own in response to this year's rise in market interest rates, high consumer debt and continued fears about jobs.
But in its deliberations, the Federal Reserve had only a very small amount of the information contained in today's report, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the data available to the policy makers related to the industrial part of the economy, which, as it turned out, was perhaps the least buoyant sector.
Many analysts contended today that even though the central bank, whose policy making panel is not scheduled to meet again until Aug. 20, sought to avoid responding to any particular set of figures, it would probably have moved to raise interest rates had all of the jobs report been available. Today's figures included a 9-cent leap in average hourly earnings, to $11.82, and an expansion of 239,000 jobs on employer payrolls, to 119.53 million.
"The economy's job machine is fully cranked up," said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist in Philadelphia for the First Union National Bank.
In his appearance at the White House briefing room, President Clinton contrasted the current situation with what prevailed in June 1992, when he was the challenger to President George Bush. Unemployment then was 7.8 percent, the budget deficit was at a record, and wages, he said, were "stagnant."
Now, the President boasted, the deficit has been more than halved and wages are "finally on the rise again."
The jump in average hourly earnings was indeed eye-catching: there has never been a monthly advance as big as 9 cents since the department began keeping a tally at the beginning of 1964. Even in percentage terms, the increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent for June was the largest in more than a decade.
But the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics sought to play down this leap, not because the number reflected any identifiable quirk, like a shift in occupational or skill mix, but because of the notorious volatility of this statistical series.
Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham said that she strongly suspected that the increase would ultimately be "squashed down" upon revision and that she preferred to focus on the 3.4 percent rise in hourly earnings over the last 12 months. While this is "a somewhat faster pace" than has prevailed of late -- it was 2.8 percent from January 1995 to January 1996 -- the acceleration has so far been less than worrisome, she said.
Some private analysts, perhaps straining for an explanation, suggested that the June leap in earnings might be an effect of the severe winter that caused a later-than-usual end to the school year, which in turn delayed the entry of low-wage students into the job market.
Unlike so many recent labor market reports that disclosed hefty job growth but little change in the unemployment rate, today's release was robust in nearly all respects.
The addition of 239,000 payroll jobs meant that the second quarter averaged a monthly gain of 265,000, one-third more than the first quarter and half again as many as in the final six months of last year. Increases for April and May were revised upward by a total of 45,000 and June would have had 14,000 more jobs had it not been for a grocery strike in Colorado.
Retail trade added 75,000 jobs in June, the third consecutive month of especially big gains, with almost half the increase in restaurants and bars, where growth had been skimpy this year. Workers at temporary-help agencies increased by 35,000 and there were 23,000 more construction jobs; factory employment, however, edged down 7,000.
Further evidence of economic vigor was a half-hour lengthening of the workweek that helped drive the index of aggregate weekly hours -- a proxy for industrial production -- up a sharp 1.8 percent, to 137.7. The figure is derived from the number of people at work and the hours they spent on the job.
The department's survey of households, meanwhile, registered 148,000 new jobs, enough when combined with a 241,000 contraction of the labor force to cut the joblessrate three-tenths of a point, to 5.3 percent.
The June drop can be considered "catch-up," suggested James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. At this rate, he said, the jobless rate should be down to about 5 percent by the end of the year. The last time there was a 5 percent rate was in March 1989, although it should be noted that the calculation method was revised in January 1994 and the revision has tended to make the monthly rate slightly higher.
"Is this the kind of economy we want going into an election?" Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview today. "You bet."
Much of the June improvement was among adult women, whose jobless rate fell to 4.6 percent, matching that for adult men.
Regionally, the Northeast posted the biggest improvement last month, with unemployment falling five-tenths of a point, to 5.5 percent. The rate fell four-tenths, to 6.2 percent, in the West, and three-tenths, to 5.1 percent, in the South. In the Midwest, the jobless rate edged up one-tenth of a point, to 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Court Removes an Obstacle To a New Stadium in Detroit

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 5

 BODY:
A court decision today moved America's oldest baseball stadium closer to retirement.
The Detroit Tigers organization wants to build a modern ball park to take the place of venerable Tiger Stadium here, but it has been delayed by the tenacious Tiger Stadium Fan Club, a 10,000-strong group that would prefer to see the beloved stadium renovated, not replaced. Today, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled against the fan club, which opposes using state money to help pay for a replacement stadium, saying the Legislature never voted on allocating the money. The appeals court upheld an earlier decision that said the Governor had the authority to make that decision on his own. 
 To Detroiters, the fight was bigger than baseball. For many sports fans, Tiger Stadium is filled with decades of memories. But for many city residents and politicians, a brand-new stadium symbolizes decades of promise for downtrodden Detroit.
For Detroit's Mayor, Dennis W. Archer, the decision was like a successful slide into home plate. "In my view, this case is over," he said. "I would hope the Tiger Stadium Fan Club would call it a day and recognize they have lost." He said the Michigan Supreme Court would be unlikely to agree to hear an appeal of a case that does not raise constitutional issues.
Mr. Archer, a Democrat, argues that the stadium's construction would bring about $285 million to the Detroit economy. He said fans would spend an additional $118 million annually in nearby shops, restaurants and bars.
Supporters of the new baseball stadium say it would help rejuvenate an aging city, much as Camden Yards and Jacobs Field have done for Baltimore and Cleveland.
To build the ball park -- tentatively dubbed New Tiger Stadium -- the Detroit Tigers would spend $145 million, the state would spend $55 million, and a portion of special commercial property taxes in Detroit would be diverted to pay back bonds worth $40 million. When the fan club forced a city referendum in March, Detroiters overwhelmingly favored the city financing package.
But the prospect of public financing has riled many members of the fan club, who also admit to a hint of nostalgia for Tiger Stadium.
Frank D. Rashid, a founding member of the fan club, said the club would consider whether to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court. Mr. Rashid was 8 years old when he first came to Tiger Stadium, where he watched the Tigers beat the Washington Senators. "Certainly, I have a lot of feelings for Tiger Stadium, but to me, this is highway robbery," he said. "This is taking money that should be used for other purposes."
For a century, baseball has been played at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull, where Tiger Stadium stands. Plans call for its replacement to be built eight blocks to the east. The city has not yet decided what it would do with the old ball park if a new one was built.
To be sure, there are still obstacles. The Detroit Tigers organization has not yet lined up its part of the financing package, said John J. McHale, the Tigers president. At best, it could break ground in early 1997 and play the 1999 season in New Tiger Stadium, he said.
Still, today's court decision was a rare victory for the baseball club. So far this season, the Tigers have lost more than twice as many games as they have won. That gives them the worst record in Major League Baseball and puts them in contention to break a record set by the New York Mets in 1962 for the worst season in modern baseball history.
Back in 1962, the Mets had the excuse of being an expansion team.

 BODY:

Jobless Rate Falls To 5.3%, a Six-Year Low
 The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent last month -- its lowest point in six years -- as 239,000 new jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in June. The unexpected strength in jobs suggested that the economy was picking up speed. The Clinton Administration hailed the employment data as evidence that its economic policies were working.
But economic growth plays a little differently on Wall Street these days. Yesterday's report fed fears that rapid growth would produce rising wage demands and higher prices -- and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. [Page 1.] 
 Treasury prices plunged following the jobs report. Investors grew concerned that the Fed would push up interest rates before its next policy meeting in late August. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer and corporate rates -- jumped to 7.18 percent from 6.93 percent. [42.]
The dollar surged against other leading currencies in global trading on the prospect for higher United States interest rates. [30]
 
America Online to Settle Suits
America Online has agreed to give away millions of hours of on-line time to some subscribers to settle 11 class-action lawsuits that had accused the company of improper billing practices. It will mainly be customers who were heavy users of the service between July 15, 1991, and March 31, 1996, who will benefit, according to a lawyer representing customers. [33.]
 
Large Fines for Prudential Seen
A report from state insurance regulators is expected to recommend that fines of as much as $35 million be levied against the Prudential Insurance. The company has been accused of sales abuses from 1982 until last year. [33.]
 
Mirage's Silence Raises Questions
Silence from Mirage Resorts since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey announced a new $405 million road and tunnel project for Atlantic City has raised questions on the casino company's commitment to the Governor's plan. [24.]
 
Sumitomo Officials Linked to Trades
Sumitomo executives approved accounts handled by the company's former chief copper trader, Credit Lyonnais Rouse officials said. The trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, has been accused by Sumitomo of losing an estimated $1.8 billion in unauthorized copper trades. [32.]
 
A. R. Baron Files for Chapter 11
A. R. Baron & Company, a New York brokerage firm, and two of its principals, have filed for bankruptcy protection following Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they defrauded customers. [30.]
 
Fed United in May Decision on Rates
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in their decision to hold interest rates steady in May, minutes of the meeting showed yesterday. The minutes suggested that the central bankers found little need for immediate action. [43.]

French Rail Chief Jailed
The head of the deficit-ridden French national railway system was jailed in an investigation of possible corruption while he was chairman of Elf Aquitaine, the oil giant, from 1989 to 1993. The executive, Loik Le Floch-Prigent, was widely credited with turning around Elf Aquitaine, France's largest company. [32.]
 
Trouble for Philip Morris
Philip Morris is under investigation by Italian prosecutors in Naples for possible evasion of taxes on the earnings from $6.4 billion in revenue over the last decade. The prosecutors have frozen $35 million in royalty payments to the United States tobacco giant and ordered the confiscation of a senior Philip Morris executive's passport. [32.]
 
Corn and Soybeans Gain
Corn and soybean futures prices fell sharply following forecasts for ideal Midwest growing weather, easing concern that extreme heat would harm fledgling crops. [30.]
 
Cantor, Fitzgerald Co-Founder Dies
 
B. Gerald Cantor, the guiding spirit of what is now Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., died on Wednesday at the age of 79. Cantor Fitzgerald is among the nation's biggest institutional brokers of Government securities. [9.]

SEMITOOL TUMBLES AFTER ANNOUNCING LOWER EARNINGS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The shares of Semitool Inc. fell 15 percent yesterday after the company, a maker of semiconductor equipment, said it did not expect its earnings for the quarter ended Sunday to meet expectations. Stock in Semitool fell $1.875, to $11, in Nasdaq trading. Semitool said four tool orders valued at $5.4 million would be shipped in the fourth quarter, instead of the third. The higher cost of making new product lines will also narrow its margins, the company said. Semitool, based in Kalispell, Mont., said that orders for its tool product lines had increased its backlog by $20 million since March and predicted that its performance would improve in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: THE CYBER-MAXIMS OF ESTHER DYSON

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer for the Magazine. Her most recent article was about Senator Alan Simpson.

 BODY:
ONE MORNING RECENTLY AT A POSH DESERT RESORT IN TUCSON, ARIZ., HUNDREDS OF THE computer industry's elite huddled in small groups, swapping shop talk, making deals. In one corner, Michael Kinsley, editor of Microsoft's new on-line magazine, Slate, chatted with Bernard Vergnes, head of Microsoft's European operations. In another, Jim Barksdale, president of Netscape, talked sotto voce with Steve Case, chairman of America Online.
What brought together the 500 cybernauts was the annual PC Forum, spearheaded by Esther Dyson, a 44-year-old writer, futurist, philanthropist and venture capitalist who has become one of the most influential figures and certainly the most influential woman in all the computer world. 
 How Dyson makes her living is hard to classify. She is the editor and publisher of the widely respected newsletter Release 1.0 (and of its Eastern European cousin, named with the double pun Rel-East). She is chairwoman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an industry-financed civilliberties watchdog group. She runs EDventure Ventures, an investment fund that plugs Western dollars into Eastern European technology startups. And she manages this conference, which is to the computer world something like what the Cannes Festival is to film.
Dyson comes from a famously brilliant clan. Her father is the physicist and author Freeman Dyson. Her mother, Verena Huber-Dyson, is a mathematician who graduated from the Swiss institute where Albert Einstein studied. Her brother, George, is the world's leading expert on the kayak. At 14, Esther began studying Russian; at 16, she was at Harvard; at 25, she was reporting for Forbes, and by 30, she was analyzing technology stocks for Wall Street. In 1982, Ben Rosen, now chairman of the Compaq Computer Corporation, asked her to help him put out his Rosen Electronics Letter, a pioneering publication about new technology, which the following year he sold to Dyson, along with PC Forum. Now, 13 years later, Release 1.0 circulates to 1,600 computer industry leaders attracted by its thoughtful inquiries into thorny issues like intellectual property. "What I try to do," Dyson says, "is find worthy ideas and people and get attention for them. I meet a lot of people, read a lot of stuff and try to promote new ideas."
 
Q: Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, is rumored to have once denounced you as a "socialist." Why?
DYSON: There was some misunderstanding. He thought I was going around saying that intellectual property should be free. Actually, as the Web expands, the big effect will be that intellectual property is likely to lose a lot of its market value.
Let me explain. In the past, there was a relative shortage of creative work. There was a limited amount of content and people had a limited amount of time, and both were pretty much matched at current price levels. Now [since the Net became popular], there's much less cost associated with the distribution of content. If you put a book or a magazine up, all the costs attributable to paper, printing, inventory, holding publications in stores go away. The other thing that is happening is that everybody can get up on the Net, sing their own songs, write their own poetry. You no longer need a publishing house to get a book published. So economics would say that since the supply of content is increasing, the costs of duplication and distribution are diminishing and people have the same amount of time or less, we are all going to pay less.
The idea of copyright will still be important because it is the law and it is moral. Second, a content producer will still want to control the integrity of a work. Even if I get no royalties, I want to make sure that my work isn't dumbed down and sold under someone else's name.
Whenever I talk about this, content producers go nuts. All I'm saying is that you need to figure out how to be paid for producing content because the business models are going to change.

Q: If intellectual property is to have little monetary value, how will writers, artists, composers make a living?
A: They'll get money for performances, readings, for going on line and interacting with their audiences. The free copies of content are going to be what you use to establish your fame. Then you go out and milk it. Also, a lot of creators will get paid by audience gatherers rather than the public. Content will be sponsored somewhat in the way network television programming is today.
In this new situation, I see content as having to stand on its own merits because it is advertising for something else rather than something that is advertised for. The good writers will get sponsored. The bad ones, maybe they'll be more useful in some other line of work. I see this trend manifesting itself in my own life. Like everyone else, I get lots of free information on the Net. I also get offers to subscribe to stuff and my attitude often is, "Why should I pay to get more when I have too much already?" Now, I do pay for really special stuff. I also pay when I want to support work of a particular creator. Future scenarios on this are obvious. A consultant will write a book, hand it out for free and then charge higher fees for his services.

Q: But a consultant isn't an artist. What will happen to the producers of literature?
A: Some of them will write highly successful works and then go out and make speeches.

Q: What if they are shy?
A: Then they won't make any money.

Q: You are currently working on a book tentatively titled "Release 2.0: Second Thoughts on the Digital Revolution." Will you be getting an advance from a publisher or will you just post the whole thing up on the Net where anyone can take it for free?
A: I certainly want the book to make money. Content may have declining value, but it hasn't hit zero yet. It may be free on the Net, but people will still pay for it in a convenient form, which is a book with a cover and photographs. On the other hand, I do intend to post chunks of it on the Net. Whoever my publisher is, they'll have to feel comfortable with that, because my purpose is to get ideas out.
In many ways, I see the example of how I work as representative of the way things are going for creators. The newsletter I publish, Release 1.0 -- which costs $595 times 1,600 subscribers -- breaks even. But the PC Forum, which is a kind of one-time performance each year, generates about $1.5 million in revenue, and participation is open only to newsletter subscribers. So the money-making part of my business is really an offshoot of the content production. Also, I do other things: consulting, speeches, which come to me because of my writing. In other words, I get paid for my activity rather than my products.

Q: Why is your conference, the PC Forum, such a motive power in the computer world?
A: Why do we have sexual reproduction? Because you get better offspring when you mix genes. And this conference is the greatest gene-pool mixer. The critical mass of the industry comes together and looks at the future. I try to take the core of the industry and put new viruses into it. I try to provoke people to think, to meet new ideas and new people. The result is that parts of deals often start there, trends are previewed. At the 1989 PC Forum, I got Lotus to announce Notes nine months before it was actually released. That really helped launch the product and the idea of groupware. Three years ago, we held a conference called "Content Is Key," with the idea that content and not just tools moves the world. It didn't single-handedly create the situation where people are now paying billions for content companies, but it helped the truth become recognized. I'm always considered a crackpot because I'm early with ideas. But that's O.K.

Q: Do you use Windows 95?
A: No, I use Xywrite for a word processor, Eudora for E-mail and Netscape as my Internet browser. As for Windows 95, I gave my review copy to my stepmother and father. There's no compelling reason for me to make the switch over. My old stuff works. If I were starting over with a new computer, I'd get it loaded with Windows 95, and I do suppose in the long run, I'll move over to it. Right now, a switch would be complicated. Besides, it's not that easy to install, which reminds me of a joke: Why did God need six days to create the world? Because he had no installed base.

Q: Give me your prophesies on what the newspaper of the future will look like.
A: If you're looking 20 to 30 years from now, they will probably be printed out on local printers by whomever wants one. People will still want their news, but a lot of the traditional newspaper will disappear. With electronic distribution, there's no real reason for recipes and foreign coverage to be stuck together in one big wad of paper. Instead, the newspaper of the future will be customized to a consumer's needs. Stock prices and classifieds will probably drop off first -- and this should happen in a very few years. After that, data-intensive items will go -- like local movie listings. These are sections that are so much more valuable when they can be electronically searched, filtered and graphed.
It's really stupid to print out thousands of apartment listings for thousands of people. Just put them on line and let people select what they want by neighborhood and price range. As for investments, I want all the stock prices covered and filtered. I want to be able to call up all the securities that went up 10 percent in the last two months.

Q: Tell me about growing up in 1950's Princeton.
A: Two of our neighbors were Nobel Prize winners. A third developed color television. As children, my brother, George, and I played on the derelict remains of one of the first computers, which was on the grounds of the Institute for Advanced Studies, where my father worked. Mrs. Hans Bethe [wife of a key architect of the A-bomb] was my godmother. Edward Teller [father of the H-bomb] came to the house often. I have these memories of him pouring excessive amounts of chocolate sauce over his ice cream while declaring, "My doctor says I shouldn't do this, but I never pretended to be an honorable man."

Q: Were there any traumas in this idyll?
A: When I was 5, my mother ran off with a mathematician, though my father says I was quite philosophic about it. He claims I said, "Oh, who needs a mother once the milk is gone."
I had a huge amount of diverse experiences because my parents were divorced. Two years after my mother left, my father remarried and we settled into a traditional two-parent-family situation. My mother moved to Berkeley, where she had bohemian friends. She had a lover named Goodwin, who was a computer programmer, and he was our favorite. The second computer I played on was his. He'd let my brother and me play with his punch cards. We'd tried to read them based on the codes, which you could figure out.
Incidentally, my mother taught mathematics at the University of California in Berkeley at the same time as Ted Kaczynski [under Federal indictment as the Unabomber]. For all I know, my brother and I ran into him when we played tag in the math department elevators. I'm fascinated by the Unabomber, whoever it was. No. 1, he's a maniac. No. 2, he's asking valid questions: is technology bad? On the other hand, his manifesto is an example of a freelance writer who wasn't very good, but then, his writings are what got him caught. Interestingly, he could have put his manifesto on the Internet without going to The New York Times or The Washington Post. It was broadly distributed on the Internet anyway. I keep thinking that if he were even remotely plugged in, he could have been spouting all his stuff on the Net and that might have kept him from getting all bottled up inside.

Q: Various legislators have proposed a number of new laws aimed at keeping criminals and terrorists from using the Net. Will these help?
A: They didn't catch the suspected Unabomber by tapping any lines. As head of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, I am troubled by most of these new laws, ostensibly aimed at criminals and pornographers but restrictive of everyone's freedom.
There are two specific items here -- encryption and freedom of speech. Last year, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, after very little debate. It was censorship, pure and simple. Fortunately, last month a Federal appeals court ruled the law unconstitutional. God bless those judges. They came in knowing little about the Net, but they opened their minds and said that the Internet was more like a soapbox than television and much more democratic.
As for encryption, the Government keeps trying to do what governments naturally do: control people. They would like to ban encryption [which scrambles and unscrambles information on computers] to make it easier for law enforcement to listen in on people. In principle, all they want to do is stop crime. But the fact is encryption is defensive technology against big government, big business, big crime. I'd rather have defensive technology than leave the power to snoop in the hands of people I might not trust. Basically, the intelligence community wants this.

Q: A couple of years ago, you visited the C.I.A. headquarters in McLean, Va., and found people there to be quite uninformed about the new technologies. Were you surprised?
A: Mitch Kapor [founder of Lotus] and John Barlow [a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation] and I went down there. Barlow said they wanted to re-engineer and change their act. It was like talking to a bunch of middle-level managers who knew what the Net was but had no concept of how decentralizing it was. They said, "Do you think if we put our C.I.A. information on the Net, people will appreciate us?" We said: "Your content isn't good enough to survive on the Web. You're the people who didn't understand what was happening in the Soviet Union."

Q: What did they want to do -- have a C.I.A. home page?
A: Sort of. They were well meaning. But they had no sense of what they were trying to do. They wanted to be part of the Internet community and be on line, without having a sense of what that is.
 
Q: It's no secret that you're high tech's most obsessive Slavophile. How did Russia and Eastern Europe become your personal passion?
A: I studied Russian at high school and at home. My father had always taught us Soviets were bad but Russians were good. So I didn't grow up with the typical American thing of "those Red commies." Twenty-five years later, I visited Russia for the first time during perestroika. The minute I landed, I felt this "separated at birth" thing for the place. It was chaotic. Nothing worked. I wanted to help.
And I think I've been able to. I get to Russia nearly every month and I do a lot of free consulting, teaching Russians in high tech how business in the West works. I give talks on business strategy, try to help people connect with their counterparts in the West. It's exhilarating work. The companies are not privatized state industries but start-ups. The people who staff them are not Soviet apparatchiks but programmers and physicists.
I also have a small venture capital fund that invests in Eastern European high tech. For years, I was urging my Silicon Valley friends to invest in Russia and Eastern Europe. Eventually, several friends raised a million and a half dollars for me to invest for them. This is a for-profit fund. Its goal is to make a profit by doing good things.

Q: Has it been an advantage for you to be female in the mostly male world of high tech?
A: I'd say so. From the beginning, I was noticeable. I also had a psychological advantage because the thing that happens to most men in this business is that they start to compare themselves with Bill Gates and they feel inadequate. Obviously, I never had that problem. Also, in the computer world, I find, being a woman, you are not so pressed to conform. There's a broader range of character traits that are acceptable.

Q: Are you sure? People in the computer business are always buzzing about your private life -- or the fact that you don't seem to have one. Do you think they'd bother if you were male?
A: No. They'd say, "He's a bachelor," and move on. Or if he were gay, they'd move on even faster. But I feel this comes with the territory. When I was having this relationship with [the publishing magnate] Bill Ziff, it was a relief to me when a magazine printed news of it -- once something is in Business Week, it loses its magic.

Q: What's your advice for the millions out there who are Internet-phobic?
A: If you're over 40, unless you're looking for a job, you are not going to die as a failure if you haven't used the Internet. People should not be made to feel socially inadequate if they are not wired. The important thing to remember is that this is not a new form of life. It is just a new activity.

HEADLINE: ART;
A Print Show by 12 Workshop Members

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: THE BRONX

 BODY:
MIMICKING a twig is the way some caterpillars elude predators. But the print that would be a painting or sculpture -- anything but a print -- is this camouflage or is it a symptom of romantic discontent, the same that prompts individuals to change their sex?
Raising the same question but, alas, not answering it is the show in the gallery at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture here. "The Power of Prints: New Formats by Bronx Print Makers" features works by 12 members of the Printmaking Workshop and, the second of its kind, was assembled by the workshop's artistic director, Betty Wilde. Though it includes many of the same artists, this production differs from its 1995 predecessor in that it begins with a "Print Salon," the informality of which represents an attempt to convert print viewers into print buyers. 
 Defying convention has become a convention in itself, and not a few of these artists abide by it. Thus, Bobbe Perry presents an installation in which four bundles are suspended over a "pool" of mirror shards surrounded by tree branches. Bundles include black-and-white lithographs and, while they are laminated to strips of copper sheeting, viewers with eyes peeled should have no trouble disentangling them from the other ingredients, which range from feathers to fan coral and screening.
Michele Godwin's contributions are equally deceiving. At a cursory glance, they resemble ceramic tiles, but on closer inspection prove to be linocuts of figures, faces and hands printed on black paper and enhanced by rows of stitching in colored silks.
Lisa Mackie's works, on the other hand, are merely confusing. In her solo show of 1995 at the Sound Shore Gallery in Cross River, Ms. Mackie proved to be an artist working in the medium of sheer complexity.
So it is no surprise to find Ms. Mackie in the present lineup with five monoprints achieved by the Xerox process that seem closer to relief assemblages. This is especially true of the composition in which a circular mirror is attached to a horizontal shape with ragged ends, and the mix of colors poured overall has congealed, forming a veined, lumpy surface.
Still, the climax of inventiveness comes in Hilary Lorenz's "print cabin," which measures 10 by 6 feet by 9 1/2 feet and has a pitched roof. The exterior is faced by what appears to be paper brick but is actually the artist's own color woodcut simulation. Silkscreened on the white paper walls inside are decorative medallions in a blend of orange, red and purple. Windows are external apertures filled with transparencies, one of which features a laboratory beaker relating to the work's title, "Biological Structure," but hardly explains it.
Photography takes a bow by way of Ed Fausty's collotypes and the digital prints of Stefan Umaerus. Mr. Fausty's best efforts are the roughly two-inch-square pictures in the Print Salon, which suggest rocks and sand and look as if they were taken under water.
Though equally mysterious, the photographer's blurred interiors with figures making up the "Going Back" series are less impressive, perhaps because they are larger and some are printed in a color other than black. Mr. Umaerus's variations on the theme of a dragonfly fascinate with the delicacy of their details and total range. Too bad the photographer felt impelled to display them fussily on small piled panels embellished with bronze and aluminum leaf.
Also unusual is Tomei Arai's silkscreen reproductions of photographs. One group features the artist's relatives, the other a steamship of the kind that presumably brought them to the United States. Evidently, Ms. Arai has mixed feeling about the move, for the picture of two-masted craft bobbing on a choppy sea is applied to a wood panel and covered with shattered glass on which are painted red flames.
Aaron Olshan and Ms. Wilde are among the more conservative contributors, but that is not to say they are without idiosyncracies. For instance, a characteristic Olshan image is the sum of many small etchings butted together in an irregular "brick course." The results range from an abstract melange of gray tones and black lines to a vision of skeletal figures emerging from darkness. "Amelia's Garden" by Ms. Wilde is the same black-and-white woodcut repeated nine times, but that it is not the way it looks because the images are tinted different colors and some are printed upside down.
Moses Ros, an alumnus of the late, lamented alternative space, Fashion Moda, offers light relief in the form of small, brightly patterned angels with four legs. These silograph prints-turned-constructions swing from the ceiling. Mr. Ros's antithesis is Juan Sanchez, whose subject is half the political and economic plight of Puerto Rico and half his own anger, and in the present show he conveys it in fiery lithographs modified by devices like the American eagle canceled by a cross. Marking a change of pace is the photographic image of two little girls who, having rendered their faces grotesque with lipstick, sit giggling with their dolls on a discarded mattress.
The show is full of life and well installed. But there is no estimating the new formats without first understanding the sense in which the words are used, "format" in particular.
The show continues through July 25. The number to call for information is (718) 518-4242.

HEADLINE: Proceedings At State Agency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a Q&A column [June 9], representatives of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal replied to an inquiry regarding the processing of proceedings before that agency that generally take a number of years to be decided. While the agency's representatives noted that under limited circumstances, a party may request that a case be given expedited processing, they did not mention another important and widely available method of accelerating a determination before the agency. 
 An owner or tenant may commence an Article 78 proceeding in State Supreme Court seeking an order compelling D.H.C.R. to determine an application or appeal that has been pending for an unreasonable period of time. Unlike a request to the agency, the petitioner in an Article 78 proceeding need not show any particular prejudice. The petitioner must show that D.H.C.R. has failed to determine the proceeding before it within a reasonable time.
I have brought many Article 78 proceedings against D.H.C.R. since it acquired jurisdiction over rent-regulated apartments in New York City 12 years ago. I have found that in most cases where D.H.C.R. has delayed making a determination, an Article 78 proceeding has resulted in a settlement with the agency or an order of the court directing D.H.C.R. to determine the matter by a certain date. This often significantly reduces the time that D.H.C.R. takes to render a decision.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Recycling;
A New Factory and New Jobs? For New York? Yes

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
ALMOST in the shadow of the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, a new factory is being built to process part of the city's trash into paper that will be used to make cardboard boxes. The $250 million factory, on 35 acres facing the Arthur Kill, is one the largest industrial investments in the city in recent decades and a small reversal of the exodus of factory jobs from New York.
Persuading the company, Visy Paper Inc., to build there, rather than at an alternative site in South Amboy, N.J., required $42 million in city and state tax abatements and a construction labor agreement that may help other investors decide that New York is not a prohibitively expensive place to build. 
 The decision was all the more remarkable because Visy is a subsidiary of Pratt Industries, a family-owned company based in Melbourne, Australia. "This company came halfway around the world to invest in New York," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "That is a big deal."
Pratt is an example of how recycling can work if the supplies of recovered material are processed properly and there is a demand for the product. The company is Australia's largest producer of corrugated cardboard boxes using 100 percent recycled paper.
The labor agreement could have an impact on a $465 million recycling mill planned for the South Bronx. The mill, which would produce newsprint from waste paper, has received an important environmental approval but is still arranging financing.
The two plants would account for almost three-quarters of a billion dollars of industrial investment in the city and provide over 1,000 permanent jobs and thousands more temporary construction jobs. But a decision to choose the city is not easy for company officials who have heard stories about New York's complicated and contentious labor relations.
"The client was very nervous about coming to New York," said Dennis J. Prude, a vice president of York Hunter, the Manhattan-based construction manager for Visy. "New York has a reputation as being a tough union town."
Edward J. Molloy, the president of the Building Trades Council, depicted the contract as the price needed to get the company to build in New York. "The paper company had the option of a site in New Jersey, elsewhere in New York or not in the Northeast at all," he said. "This is the first industrial plant built in New York City in 50 years and I think we were instrumental in making it happen."
In addition to the immediate lure of jobs at a time when construction projects have been few and far between, Visy had another carrot to dangle before the unions, a proposed second phase of about the same size as the current project.
Both paper-mill projects are based on their proximity to an abundant resource: the huge amounts of paper products discarded every day by offices and residences in New York. By building in the city, the factories stand to benefit from lower transportation costs compared with paper companies in distant, rural areas.
Indeed, waste paper will arrive at the Visy plant on Staten Island in much the same way garbage is transported to Fresh Kills -- by barge from the city's pier at 59th Street and 12th Avenue to an enclosed unloading dock to be built over part of the waterway. The dock is enclosed to minimize windblown paper, a complaint often directed at Fresh Kills.
The Staten Island and South Bronx projects will also benefit from using waste paper as their raw material. Because they do not have to wrest the fiber from trees in complicated grinding and cooking stages, the processes are simple and nonpolluting.
Visy officials said they liked the location on western Staten Island, the proximity to highways and Newark Airport and plans to improve rail links.
But before they would commit to the project, they wanted a labor agreement specific to their site and not linked to the larger talks between builders and contractors and the trade unions.
"This is a fast-track project," said Stephen Deane, Visy's project manager. "We drove our first production pile on March 1 of this year and we expect to go into operation in the first quarter of 1997."
AS a result, one of the key provisions of the contract with the Building and Construction Trades Council is an agreement not to strike, picket or take job actions at the site, regardless of what happens in citywide bargaining.
The unions agreed to a one-time check for substance abuse and, more important, according to some experts, all the crafts agreed to start work at 7 A.M. In the past, different crafts had different start and stop times, which forced the developer to pay overtime to have the right collection of skills on the job at the same time.
"Staggered start-stop times are costly and complicated to manage," said Richard Schrader, a former city consumer commissioner and a consultant to trade unions. "This way all the moving parts are moving in sync. That is good for the developer and safer for the work force."
Two of the unions, the Millwrights and Steamfitters, also compromised on overtime, so the plant can be built using two shifts. Normally a night crew would have to have been paid time and a half or double time with double benefits, inflating the project's cost.
But with the new agreement, the night shift will work for standard pay plus about 15 percent, Mr. Prude said. That means more work for union members, since the builder can afford a second shift. At the peak of building this fall, Visy expects to have as many as 500 construction workers on site.
Other parts of the contract call for all jurisdictional disputes between unions to be solved within 48 hours, by arbitration if necessary. "This is really important on this kind of project where you could have steamfitters and millwrights arguing over which pipe belongs to them," Mr. Prude said. "Those kind of arguments could stretch out forever."
And in a city replete with stories of workers disassembling finished machinery and putting it back together again because it is "their" work, Visy will be allowed to bring parts of its big paper-making machine pre-assembled.
"This is not a completely new event for them," said Ronald G. Peterson, Visy's construction manager. "But we wanted to make sure we both understood the details, which we did through the use of trips to our plant in Georgia and pictures of the machinery." The paper machine is being prefabricated and tested in Brazil and some of its piping will be installed there, rather than at the job site.
In addition, the millwrights, who move and set up large pieces of machinery, have agreed to permit technicians from Visy to work with them on the plant floor as the huge papermaking machine is installed and fine-tuned. "They will be giving advice, not working with tools," Mr. Prude said. "They will be there to answer technical questions on how to balance the machine. They are not taking the place of any workers."
THE new plant will do more than just provide jobs, directly and indirectly. Since it is taking paper from city trash, each ton it processes into container board is one less ton that gets dumped at Fresh Kills. And Visy's agreement with the Department of Sanitation calls for the company to pay the city a minimum of $10 a ton, regardless of how low the market price drops.
As a commodity, the price of waste paper varies wildly. About a year ago, it was commanding $150 a ton. Currently, the city is paying $5 a ton to have it processed, according to a Sanitation Department spokesman. the company expects to take 150,000 tons a year of paper from the city once operations commence.
The project also puts a brownfield -- an unused, environmentally contaminated industrial site -- back into productive use. On the Visy site was an old Consolidated Edison plant, adjacent to the current Arthur Kill Con Ed plant.
Under an agreement with the state Department of Environmental Conservation, Con Ed and Liquid Carbonic Industries, which owned part of the site, agreed to clean up the lightly contaminated site before turning the land over to Visy. Many companies have been reluctant to build on brownfields out of fear that they would be held liable for old contamination.
The agreement with the state reduces that likelihood. The site is the first in New York City to be cleaned under the state's voluntary cleanup program.

HEADLINE: Balancing Conservation and Economic Growth

BYLINE: By STEVE BERGSMAN 

 BODY:
ALMOST 100 years ago, International Paper, then a small company in Glens Falls, N.Y., acquired for logging thousands of acres along the Raquette River in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains. The Adirondack Park eventually surrounded this land and in the 1980's the State of New York considered buying some of it to include in the park. Budget shortfalls and voter rejection of a $2 billion bond act in 1990 prevented the state from acquiring the land.
International Paper could have donated the land directly to the state, but although the tract coveted by New York was small, the total amount of land in question was more than 20,000 acres. Once land is deeded to the state as parkland it can no longer be used for commercial purposes. Such a gift would have affected the job base in an area close to the park. International Paper decided not to keep the 20,000 acres because it would support only low-level timbering operations. 
 The company sought another solution, donating the land to the Conservation Fund, an environmental group in Arlington, Va. In February, a gift of 1,600 acres along the east bank of the Raquette River and an easement of 13,700 acres was given by the fund to New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation. The easement will allow timber cutting while protecting the land from development. The gift essentially completes a transfer begun in 1992 of 20,200 acres of former International Paper land, valued at $5.34 million, to the Conservation Fund and New York -- the largest gift of land in the history of the century-old Adirondack Park.
"We made the donation because the land was important to the state," said James Melican, executive vice president at International Paper, which gets a tax deduction for its donation. "Governor Cuomo attempted to get access to it for a number of years, but was unable to get legislation passed to buy it. So it really turned out to be a tripartite arrangement between the Conservation Fund, State of New York and International Paper."
While the state will now be able to protect 14 miles of the Raquette River and much of the remaining acres will be opened to canoeing, hiking and fishing, other parts of the tract will remain working forest, with the proceeds used for upkeep and taxes. "We get to keep the river corridor ecologically and scenically intact, and we keep some of the property on the tax rolls and contributing to the local economy," says Henry Little, director of corporate programs at the Conservation Fund.
Lumber and scenic rivers might seem incompatible, but the charter of the Conservation Fund suggests otherwise. It not only refers to land and water conservation but also mentions economic development and job creation. Beyond conserving individual tracts of land, the fund helps companies dispose of developed land and buildings no longer needed for their operations.
The fund was founded in 1985 by Patrick Noonan, the former president of the Nature Conservancy and founding chairman of the American Farmland Trust, a group that works to prevent the loss of farmland. The idea behind the new environmental organization is that economic growth can be balanced against community needs and the conservation of natural resources. The fund attempts to bring about this balance by working with corporations, government, academia and other nonprofit organizations to pioneer new approaches to what the fund calls sustainable development.
UNLIKE most environmental organizations, the fund boasts a property disposition service that can sell or develop land donated by corporations. It has helped landowners, largely corporations, dispose of more than $22 million in surplus properties in the last two years and more than 25,000 acres valued at more than $100 million since 1985.
A company gives industrial parkland to the fund, taking a charitable contribution deduction equal to the gift's fair market value on the date of the donation. The fund develops and sells the land, using the proceeds to acquire conservation properties around the country, generally for state and Federal agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management that lack the money to make big acquisitions. "We go out and negotiate those transactions, hopefully at bargain rates, hold the property, then subsequently sell to the government -- when there is an appropriation -- for a price that does not exceed fair market value," Mr. Little said.
In the 1920's, the Stanley Works, a tool company in New Britain, Conn., acquired land along the Housatonic River in western Connecticut for a hydroelectric plant that was never built. Years later, Stanley unsuccessfully tried developing residential properties on the site. In December 1994, the company gave the 700 acres, appraised at $2.5 million, to the fund.
"We looked at a sale of the property and a gift of the property and decided for all practical purposes giving it to the Conservation Fund made good sense for the corporation," says Frank Harvey, director of real estate for Stanley Works. "There was a possibility that we could have found a developer, but we probably would have had to provide some financing and there was always the chance of getting the property back. It was really not our mainstream activity."
A company can write off its charitable contribution deduction against 10 percent of its taxable income in the year of the gift, with a five year carry-forward of any unused portion. If a property is valued at $1 million and a company is taxed at a 40 percent rate, its income tax obligation would be reduced by $400,000. On the other hand, a property valued at $1 million on a company's books and put up for sale may sell for only $700,000 in a depressed market. In addition, there are holding, transaction and other costs that reduce the advantages of selling over donating.
The Stanley Works liked how the gift worked out so well that a year later it gave the fund 15 more acres it was developing next to its corporate headquarters, valued at $2.6 million.
THE fund is developing residential units at the first Stanley Works site, and will soon start work on the latest gift, a corporate park.
Another company with long-held land on its books that recently donated to the fund is Lukens Inc., a Coatesville, Pa., specialty steel company. In 1918, it bought 3,500 acres in the Virginia counties of Page and Rockingham for an iron ore operation. By 1920, the mine was closed, and the land was held by the company until 1995, when it made the donation.
"The land wasn't making a contribution to us and more and more it had the potential of becoming a major problem," said John van Roden, Lukens's senior vice president and chief financial officer. "I personally visited the site once a year for 12 years, and people were dumping garbage on it. There were numerous stills on the property. The possibility of someone getting hurt or an environmental problem because of people dumping old refrigerators was getting serious."
The property's value of $1.6 million meant a deduction of only 3 or 4 cents a share, Mr. van Roden said. "If we could have sold it for appraised value right away, we might have gotten another penny or two a share of value. But, frankly, we had been following that path for many years and nothing happened. We got value by turning the land over to a professional organization that is focused on selling. It was a win-win for both sides."

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Taking the High Road Through Ballet's Rush Hour

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff 

 BODY:
HAVING BATTLED UPHILL for half a century to become an establishment company, New York City Ballet now performs 23 weeks a year at the New York State Theater. But a dance troupe that appears in its home city more frequently than any other troupe in the world can also be taken for granted.
Hence, the relatively greater news value this spring of rarely seen foreign visitors like the Paris Opera Ballet or of American Ballet Theater, which has had only one regular New York season but recently announced that it would add a second in 1997. City Ballet has had two seasons for many years, in the winter and the spring. 
 In an economic crunch, dance companies playing opposite each other at Lincoln Center can act too much like rivals. High ticket prices can oblige even the most ecumenical ballet fan to choose one troupe over another. In this situation, City Ballet has just reminded us that a great company can hold its own through a distinctive style of dancing and its approach to repertory. Unlike Ballet Theater and the Paris Opera Ballet, City Ballet rarely borrows a work from another organization and presents it as a company premiere. Instead, as it just did with three new works by different choreographers, it operates as a creative troupe, even at the risk of failure.
City Ballet is unsurpassed in its extension of the classical idiom, in making a 400-year-old vocabulary look contemporary. That style may not be to everyone's taste. It never was. But especially in its use of concert music, the company continues on the high road that was mapped out by its founders, George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein.
Neither of those founding fathers maintained that his view of ballet should be a universal one. In fact, both relished a context in which their company could stand out in relief against foreign and domestic troupes. City Ballet was traditionally defined by a no-star policy and the creation of its own repertory to distinguished music, while most other ballet troupes relied on a stock repertory as well as their own choreographers.
There was a time, even 20 years ago, when the ballet world generously embraced a variety of companies. It was completely natural to compare the sleek thoroughbreds in Balanchine's company with the more flamboyant dancers in the Bolshoi -- to the detriment of neither. Starting in 1949, the impresario Sol Hurok made the Royal Ballet from Britain a virtual staple of American seasons. Activity of this kind fed interest in the art form as a whole. The more the merrier.
Not so today, when ballet companies act like besieged armies, warily surveying one another's box-office receipts. It is not surprising that City Ballet has adjusted its advertising, aiming for greater exposure and more striking pictorial appeal.
Fine. Marketing can be changed as long as what is being marketed is not. And what City Ballet must always sell is its essence.
That quality is not hard to define. The neo-romantic style that Ballet Theater gave Antony Tudor's "Leaves Are Fading" was admired recently by a City Ballet loyalist who noted nonetheless that her favorite company's dancing was "crisper." True. But City Ballet was never at home in the works that Tudor staged for the company in the 1950's.
It takes a senior ballerina like Kyra Nichols to exemplify how the company's signature style can remain true to its essence and yet make familiar ballets look fresh. Her career had already reached a peak under Balanchine, but this season she danced with new daring.
The energetic, expansive phrasing typical of the company at its most contemporary was given further light and shade. In Balanchine's "Mozartiana," Ms. Nichols's variations sharpened the difference between playfulness and complexity. It was common to see her move from a difficult turn with no preparation (a City Ballet hallmark) into a brazen swagger on toe. Here, as in Balanchine's "Chaconne," she was partnered excellently by Philip Neal while remaining the epitome of the independent Balanchine ballerina, secure in her autonomy onstage.
Peter Martins, as the company's artistic director, has encouraged this kind of controlled abandon in his emerging young stars as well. One could see a similar impetuousness in the leggy allure of Maria Kowroski, who was increasingly moved into more major roles.
But it was again Ms. Nichols who embodied the depth that can be brought to the style when she made her debut in the final section of Balanchine's "Vienna Waltzes." She was, of course, a lonely figure in an empty ballroom. But she had the advantage of being pursued by a grandly passionate phantom in Igor Zelensky, to whom she seemed in ecstatic thrall.
Perhaps because Ms. Nichols heard the dissonance in Richard Strauss's music and made her role a study in the disintegration of a personality, she gave the role a new perspective. With her angular back arches and sharp exits, she appeared traumatized. Like the music, her dancing alluded to a metaphoric breakdown, the end of an empire.
All three premieres were solid minor works. Mr. Martins used music from the 1877 production of "Swan Lake" for his "Tchaikovsky Pas de Quatre." As a classical divertissement, it has little of the showpiece impact of Balanchine's "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux," which uses music from the same score. One may have to wait for bolder dancing to bring out properly the sophisticated detail in the choreography. The cast this spring (three women and one man) did not.
MR. MARTINS'S MASTERY of the classical idiom is foreign to Kevin O'Day. But in "Badchonim," Mr. O'Day used Prokofiev's "Overture on Hebrew Themes" and an orchestrated version of the composer's Quintet in G to display new confidence in a plotless neo-classical work. Created for two couples and an ensemble, it looks wiry and full of verve.
The third premiere, "Twilight," was a mellow farewell from Ulysses Dove, who died on June 11, shortly after the first performance. Danced to a vibrant commissioned score for four saxophones by Michael Torke, the work was the counterpart of "Red Angels," a more explosive piece created by Mr. Dove in 1994. Helene Alexopoulos, Albert Evans, Wendy Whelan and Peter Boal gave the choreography's shifts of weight, forceful turns and strong attack a visible power. Feeling dominated form.
One suspects that all three new works will grow on the viewer. In the City Ballet tradition, their real subject is dance itself.

Western Deserts And Their Myths

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

 BODY:
Renault: "And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?"
Rick: "My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters."
Renault: "Waters? What waters? We're in the desert."
Rick: "I was misinformed."
INFORMATION ABOUT DESERTS can be tailored to suit the fashion and adjusted to meet perceptions. The deserts and semideserts of the American West looked useless to the first explorers but seemed like an opportunity to those who followed. Anyway, we fought a war with Mexico for certain dry stretches of land, called the West, our frontier; just about destroyed an indigenous people to control it, then built an American mythology around it. We kept on rearranging the information and the land to accommodate changing ambitions and realities. 
 In 1893, after the Census Bureau had announced that the Western frontier was officially closed, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner wrote that with the nation complete from coast to coast, national characteristics and identity would become clear and magnified. Teddy Roosevelt, on the other hand, feared that Americans were in danger of losing their national singularity without frontier or wilderness as a backdrop. We couldn't make up our minds whether we were informed or misinformed.
"Perpetual Mirage: Photographic Narratives of the Desert West," at the Whitney Museum of American Art through Sept. 22, surveys the ways that photography has recorded the Western deserts: severe obstacles, historic monuments, tourist attractions, damaged goods. This exhibition of more than 300 albums, books and original photographs sets out to explain the patronage, social context and implicit messages behind photographic campaigns in that area from the mid-19th century to the present. It covers a lot of territory in space and time, from Timothy O'Sullivan's haunting revelations of nature's appalling inventiveness to the poisoned lunar beauty of Richard Misrach's Navy bomb-test sites.
Historians have spilled copious amounts of ink about the West and Western myth as bases for such American ideas as progress, individualism and the acceptability of violence. Museums in recent years have followed suit with sociohistorical shows that deconstruct the meanings hidden in what used to be merely art. "Perpetual Mirage," basically didactic, applies a certain even-handedness to the current mandate to illuminate, inform and debunk. The catalogue sometimes accomplishes all three, if also appending an array of specifics that only a scholar could love.
The bonus is an abundance of visual delights. Much of the early material is in glorious condition. Some of the images, like Gustaf Nordenskiold's vigorously abstract views of Mesa Verde in 1892, are little known. Ansel Adams is on his best behavior and Eliot Porter at his apogee. And contemporaries like Len Jenshel, Linda Connor and Jungin Lee could almost renew one's faith in beauty as a criterion for photographs.
Best of all, the show has a twist: it's really about books. May Castleberry, the curator, is librarian and associate curator for special collections at the Whitney, and she attempts to tell the tale of how information about the Western deserts was disseminated through books. "Perpetual Mirage" is yet another show about the media, in this case the printed and illustrated page, an old-fashioned voice calling from the wilderness.
This exhibition tells us that Americans first learned about the parched gulches and gaunt monuments of the West chiefly through photographic albums. (There are some limitations to this view, as albums were too expensive to print or sell in large numbers.) Around the turn of the century, once Indians were no longer feared, a romantic view of the native heritage was created in books like Edward Curtis's multivolume work.
By 1930, the dry marvels of the West had become so familiar through photography and so accessible via the automobile that photographers like Laura Gilpin and Ansel Adams could turn the landscape into the stuff of art books. Then, in the 60's, attitudes toward the land and what had become of it shifted. The Sierra Club published Eliot Porter's "Place No One Knew," about Glen Canyon, in 1963, just as the canyon disappeared beneath the waters of a Government dam; the book became a landmark in the development of ecological consciousness.
Photographers began to record the intrusions and depredations in the West, then proposed that landscape itself had been redefined and that we might just as well accept it as it was. Lewis Baltz saw bleak housing developments as the ultimate reorganization and unwinding of wilderness. Robert Adams hinted that the insignificant, scrubby landscapes we pass through, landscapes that refuse to accommodate standard ideas of art, encode a new kind of esthetic message and deserve attention.
Books have great weight in this show. Photographic albums do turn up in exhibitions, and printed books do, too, but "Perpetual Mirage" has case after case of illustrated books. They make exceptionally laconic exhibition objects; open to only one page, they keep mum about connections, narrative, interrelations.
"PERPETUAL MIRAGE" opens up the discourse as best it can, using several copies of one book at times, plus a number of original photographic prints on the wall. When the framed print is reproduced on an open page, the print wins by a mile, and the comparison is instructive. Edward Weston's prints, for instance, famous for their rich blacks, get brightened up and relieved of a certain amount of nuance by the printing press every time.
An outline history of publishing and its response to technological and social change is touched on here, as is a a sketchy history of techniques of image reproduction. (A fuller history of mechanical reproduction was on view at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Rutherford, N.J. in May and can be sampled in a book -- of course -- that accompanied that show: David A. Hanson and Sidney Tillim's "Photographs in Ink.")
The biggest patrons in the 19th century were the Government and corporations, especially the railroads, all intensely interested in exploring, developing and exploiting the unknown half of the country. The show traces the railroad companies' immense influence on public perception of the West; they commissioned pictures by photographers like A. J. Russell and made selections that served their economic and propaganda purposes. The Government went them one better. A catalogue footnote reveals that the Government produced something like 24 million prints of the West between 1843 and 1863, at a cost estimated to have equaled one-quarter to one-third of the entire Federal budget in each of those 20 years.
The biggest publishing shift occurred in the 1890's, when the halftone transformed reproduction. This coincided almost exactly with the invention of the motion picture, creating an explosion of visual imagery combined with written narrative. The number of books about the West increased during this period partly because the halftone made it possible to combine text and pictures and partly because the frontier closed, easier travel boosted tourism and an influx of immigrants spurred the search for national identity.
That books should have been a primary means of information in the era before television is not so surprising, though novel enough as a hook to hang a show on. Shows about illustrated books and the course of knowledge could surely center on other regions, too. With the possible exception of exhibitions at world's fairs, photographic shows never measured up to the audience for books before the 1955 "Family of Man" show traveled around the world.
THE WHITNEY RATHER scants stereographs, which were enormously popular in the last century; magazines; Hollywood movies that made Monument Valley seem like nothing more than a passing lane for horses, and the wide reach of these media.
Well, no show can do everything, and this one tackles a beleaguered topic. Books, especially illustrated books, are not an endangered species but are ecologically challenged. Paper is short-lived, microfilm too, reproduction rights are soaring out of scholarly reach, and there is some possibility that bound volumes will eventually seem quaint in the face of the Internet, CD-ROM and the darkly chronicled decline in literacy.
Books, though more fun to curl up with than a computer and less likely to cause carpal tunnel syndrome, do suffer by some comparisons, chiefly the number of pictures that can be crowded into a digital space. The question is, How will information about the land, our identity and history be conveyed in the near future? Of making many books there is no end, the Bible says. Perhaps it was misinformed.

Hyperactive Justice

BYLINE: By CLINT BOLICK; Clint Bolick is litigation director at the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Robert N. Wilentz retired last week after a record-setting 17 years as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, he was lionized for his substantial influence on American jurisprudence. A renowned judicial activist who wrote landmark decisions on education, property rights, capital punishment and child surrogacy, he carved out a legacy that reaches far beyond New Jersey.
But his reputation begs an important question: Is a justice whose impact is great necessarily a great justice? As with many activist judges, Chief Justice Wilentz's jurisprudence was grounded more in social conscience than in the rule of law, producing far-reaching decisions that often strayed beyond the proper bounds of judicial power. 
 Governor Whitman's tribute was especially revealing. "The Wilentz-led court broke new ground in many areas of life," she remarked, "always with a deep sense of social justice as the underpinnings."
One should always be alert to mischief any time a modifier is appended to the word justice -- even more so when something other than the rule of law is offered as the basis for judicial decisions.
Many of Justice Wilentz's opinions demonstrate why. The role of courts in a democracy is to protect individual rights against majoritarian tyranny, and this he did. But he often went much further, allowing the court to take unto itself the very legislative powers that the judiciary is supposed to constrain -- a danger against which our Constitution's framers urgently warned.
Steven J. Eagle, a leading expert on property law, has called Chief Justice Wilentz's view of his court's prerogatives "extensive." That is an understatement. Consider his opinion in the 1983 Mount Laurel case: instead of merely invalidating local zoning restrictions against low-cost housing, it required communities to provide "affirmative inducements," subject to constant judicial oversight, to achieve economic integration in conformity to the court's ideal of a just society. The edict was sweeping: "The state controls the use of land," he declared, "all of the land."
So it was no stretch in another case for Justice Wilentz to extend the State Constitution's guarantee of free speech to encompass a right for protesters to pass out leaflets in privately owned shopping malls -- the opposite result reached by the United States Supreme Court under the First Amendment -- by reasoning that malls had taken the place of downtown business districts as centers of commerce and the exchange of ideas. In dissent, Justice Marie Garibaldi rejoined that people "do not visit the mall to be informed . . . of social or political causes; they go to shop." Yet on this basis Justice Wilentz sanctioned a wholesale expropriation of private property for public purposes.
In his 1990 ruling in Abbott v. Burke, he extended the court's tentacles into school governance. Despite massive judicial involvement in the 1970's that had raised taxes but failed to improve educational quality, the court again found the state's financing system discriminatory against students in poor districts and ordered additional spending "to be guaranteed and mandated by the state." New Jersey taxpayers are considerably poorer as a result, yet the urban school districts are in greater shambles than ever.
In other cases, Chief Justice Wilentz held party hosts liable for the drunken accidents of their guests and ruled that surrogate-motherhood contracts were unenforceable. The theme central to each of these cases is the use of judicial power to rearrange political, property or contractual relationships to adhere to a particular social philosophy, in ways unknown to the Constitution. Put differently, the Wilentz rulings are moored not in justice but in "social" justice.
The Chief Justice's tenure is reminiscent of activist Federal courts that in the 1960's and 70's created all manner of new entitlements and sweeping new judicial powers. After 12 years of appointments by Ronald Reagan and George Bush, that propensity has cooled in the Federal judiciary, and the courts are back to the business of adjudicating disputes between people and protecting individual rights.
Not so in many state courts, New Jersey's prominent among them. The Wilentz legacy is like a roller-coaster ride: some ups, some downs, but always wild.
That may be fitting for amusement parks, but not so apt for the judiciary. When courts stick to their proper role, they are sometimes boring institutions. But after 17 years of unbridled activism, some calm may be just what we need.

HEADLINE: Responding to a Shortage of EMT's

BYLINE: By SUSAN STERN 

 BODY:
PROVIDING speedy medical care to the sick and injured during weekday daytime hours has become so difficult because of a shortage of qualified workers that four neighboring fire districts -- Yaphank, Ridge, Gordon Heights and Middle Island -- have formed a group with paid emergency medical technicians, the first of its kind in New York State.
While most fire and rescue departments on Long Island have been traditionally staffed by volunteers, the recent economic crunch has taken a toll on the availability of its medically trained men and women. Because of the strict time-consuming state certification requirements and high rate of job burnout, emergency medical technicians make up the smallest numbers in most volunteer fire departments. There are 94 volunteer ambulance companies on Long Island, 65 run through fire departments and 29, like Sayville, Port Jefferson, Commack and Huntington, with independently run squads. 
 "A few years ago we started having some problems because of a lack of personnel to get the ambulance out," said Herbert Davis, chief of the Yaphank Fire Department. "I suggested that four or five of us work together during the day, Monday to Friday. We discussed it and met for six months to work it out."
For the last year and a half, the four districts have pooled money, equipment and vehicles and hired three daytime emergency medical technicians who work two at a time and carry pagers while they drive separately around the four towns from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M.
"On the average, we have about 1,300 emergency calls each year between the four of us," Mr. Davis said. A certified emergency medical ambulance can be at the scene of an accident or illness within four minutes of receiving the call, Mr. Davis said.
The cost of running the four-district ambulance service is from $156,000 to $160,000 a year for salaries, benefits, taxes and equipment. Each district contributes based on their population and number of calls they receive. Ridge, with a large elderly population, has the highest number. Next is Middle Island, then Yaphank and Gordon Heights.
It is easier to send an emergency medical technician, or First Responder, to the scene of an injury than to send the whole ambulance. The technician can evaluate the situation and see if an ambulance is necessary. In order to get an ambulance on the road, at least two people, one an emergency medical technician and the other a driver, are necessary. A third person, who can be an assistant, is considered desirable. A lack of volunteers can affect the length of time it takes to arrive at an emergency scene.
"There were times when it took 20 to 30 minutes to get the ambulance out, and that's unacceptable," Mr. Davis said.
The shortage of daytime help has worsened over recent years.
"Everybody has to work," said Vicki Robinson of Middle Island, who is the manager of the Combined Fire District Emergency Service.
In Yaphank, only 12 of the 90 fire department volunteers are emergency medical technicians.
"There is a large turnover of EMT's because of the strict training and job burnout," Mr. Davis said. "They have to deal with life and death on every call."
In Ridge, 14 of the 113 volunteers are certified emergency medical technicians.
"Most our people work out of the area and many of them work two jobs, said Pat Pirozzi, chief of the Ridge Fire Department.
Smithtown Fire Department's chief, Antonio Cruz, said they were one of the lucky companies. "We're fortunate to have enough shift workers and are able to get the ambulance out," he said. Smithtown has a six- to seven-minute ambulance response time, but there is a First Responder at the scene within three minutes, he added.
When someone calls 911 or the operator for emergency help in Suffolk County, the call is automatically transferred to the Suffolk County dispatcher, who patches it through to the nearest fire department. The fire department dispatcher puts the call out to volunteers over their radios, and those who are available rush to the fire house. If there are enough volunteers and a necessary emergency medical technician to staff an ambulance, they tell the Suffolk County dispatcher that they are on the way. If there is no response within seven minutes, the dispatcher puts out another call asking for mutual aid from neighboring fire departments.
"But that wastes valuable time," Mr. Davis said.
The Division of Emergency Services is part of the Suffolk County Department of Health.
"Our job is to provide training to EMT's and run the dispatch services," said William Larkin, ambulance service consultant for Suffolk County. The county contracts with Stony Brook University Hospital to provide telephone contact with emergency medical technicians while they are providing initial care and transporting an injured person to the hospital.
The county pays the hospital $300,000 a year to provide that service. The county also equips ambulance services and the Suffolk County Marine Bureau with cardiac defibrilators.
Riverhead, Southold and East Hampton operate their own police departments and dispatch their own emergency calls. The county also operates a Medevac helicopter.
By the end of this year, the county expects to have an enhanced 911 system in which the address and telephone number of the person making the emergency call will automatically be displayed on a screen. Mr. Larkin explained that often a person making an emergency call gets excited and hangs up before giving the necessary information, and it will also cut down on crank calls.
In Suffolk County, the average time for an ambulance to arrive at a medical emergency is 8 to 10 minutes. But, in areas where there are emergency medical technicians or trained First Responders available, they arrive within three to four minutes.
"The First Responder diverts the ambulance to the more urgent calls first," Mr. Larkin said. "We've suggested another look at the combined four district service. We support them every step of the way."
Nassau County operates its emergency services differently.
"In Nassau, 50 percent of the ambulance calls are handled by the County Ambulance Bureau with paid emergency technicians," said Alan Cooper, executive director of the Nassau Regional Emergency Medical Services Council. "The other 50 percent of the calls are answered by volunteers, mostly from the fire departments." There are 6 independent ambulance companies and 71 fire department ambulance services in Nassau County.
In an emergency, Nassau residents have been instructed to call either 911, the police operator or an ambulance company. The call is entered into the emergency system and goes out to the nearest police, county, fire department or ambulance company, which is automatically identified.
"The call is then transferred to the designated primary responder," Dr. Cooper said. "This is all done instantaneously."
Nassau County officials oversee emergency medical technician training. Nassau County Medical Center in Mineola acts as the medial liaison with the ambulances en route to the hospitals.
"We have an excellent system," Dr. Cooper said. "The one benefit is that a police ambulance is always available." But there is a charge for using a county ambulance. Volunteer ambulance services are free.
The Village of Garden City has both paid and volunteer fire fighters but uses the Nassau County ambulances for their medical emergencies. The City of Glen Cove operates a volunteer emergency service responsible for its ambulance calls.
"We have a part-time EMT on duty three days a week from 7 A.M. to 3 P.M.; we're strictly volunteer," said Kathy Jimenez, spokeswoman for the squad.
During the summer, Glen Cove hires two emergency medical technicians to work part time because it is such a busy season there. The City of Long Beach has 17 paid firefighters and 175 volunteers. Four salaried firefighters who are also emergency medical technicians are on duty at a time.
"We're the busiest department on Long Island with about 4,800 calls a year," said Scott Kemins, chief of the Long Beach Fire Department. "Three thousand of them are emergency service calls. We have double the people here in the summer."
Summers also brings hordes of tourists and residents to Long Island's parks and beaches. Ambulance service for small town beaches are usually provided by the local fire departments or ambulance companies. George Gorman, spokesman for the New York States Park, Recreation and Historical Preservation Commission, said emergency medical technicians were available at Bethpage State Park and use county or local fire department ambulances for emergency transport. At Jones Beach, however, there are emergency medical technicians at the central mall, the East and West bath houses and the West End II bath station, as well as a first-aid vehicle. Ambulance and helicopter rescue are coordinated with Nassau County.
"If we have a major event, we ask a local fire department to come with an ambulance," Mr. Gorman said.
The results of quick emergency response has been evident already in the four district combined group. A smoke bomb in the Longwood High School last winter required emergency treatment to more than 40 people, said the Gordon Heights Fire Commissioner, Chesley Ruffin.
"Two EMT's went right up and established a triage unit and called in the others," he said. "Around the same time, there was a multi-vehicle accident in Selden. Our EMT was the first responder."
Anthony DiCara, president of the Homeowners Association in Leisure Glenn, a 421-unit adult community in Ridge, had an allergic reaction to a bee sting.
"I was going into cardiac arrest," he said. "They came within minutes. Any longer and I would have been gone."

A Tale of Two Cities And the Deficit

BYLINE: By AMITAI ETZIONI; Amitai Etzioni, author of "The Spirit of Community" (Simon & Schuster, 1994), is a professor at George Washington University in Washington.

 BODY:
I UNDERSTAND that Lehman Brothers has an analyst who specializes in the Government's effects on business. From where I sit, this is a smart move.
I lived in New York City for 20 years and am completing my 15th year in Washington. I continue to be amazed by how different the world looks from these two vantage points. A telling example is the different way many people in each city view the recent increases in long-term interest rates -- a divergence that has great significance not only for the financial markets but also for the future economic growth rate and the outcome of the Presidential election. 
 Most New York-based analysis (reflected in newspapers' financial pages, television commentaries and brokerage house reports) focuses on economic factors. By far the most common reasons given for the trend toward higher rates are the strengthening economy, the increase in commodity prices and the reawakening of some labor unions -- in short, a fear of rekindling inflation. As close as this analysis gets to "Washington" factors is to note that, as a result of these economic developments, there is less chance that the Fed will cut interest rates; indeed, it may even move to increase them.
As seen from Washington, a main reason that rates have risen, and may well keep climbing, is a loss of momentum to balance the budget, and, as a result, an expected increase in Government demand for capital. This will cause interest rates to swell.
When I mention this to colleagues in New York, they are skeptical. They seem reassured that Washington is concerned about spending, noting that both President Clinton and Bob Dole have reiterated their commitment to balancing the budget in seven years.
But Washington's commitment to fighting red ink has always been somewhat less than it has seemed. The painful decisions about cutting expenditures are supposed to occur in the last two years of the seven-year plan, after Mr. Clinton or Mr. Dole will likely be retired. And while the deficit has been declining, the Congressional Budget Office expects it to balloon again in a few years, as soon as 1997 by some accounts.
What is new is the subtle shift in the political winds, the new signs that people are less concerned about a balanced budget (the issue Ross Perot championed in 1992) and more concerned about downsizing, job security and threats to benefits (the nerves that Pat Buchanan touched this year).
While no one should make too much of polls, they do influence Washington's agenda. In January, a CBS News poll showed that the deficit was the top concern of Americans, with 20 percent seeing it as the most important problem. But by March, that figure was down to 11 percent, the same as for unemployment and the overall economy. (Crime was No. 1, at 12 percent.)
It wasn't surprising, then, to see so little furor this year when the tax on airline tickets was allowed to lapse, thus adding to the red ink. This emboldened the politicians, who then called for the repeal of a gasoline tax that had been introduced in 1993 explicitly to cut the deficit. And both parties keep talking about other tax cuts, but with precious little indication of how to pay for them.
While most of Wall Street is believed to favor the Republicans, the majority of New York City voters typically support Democrats. But from where I sit, neither party appears to have the stomach to continue the struggle to roll back the tide of federally produced red ink. Only if we hear much more vehement voices, from New York and elsewhere, will the challenging project to dam the deficit have a prayer.

CALL TO HOME
African Americans Reclaim the Rural South.
By Carol Stack.
Basic Books, $21.
Between 1970 and 1990, a growing number of blacks who had migrated from the rural South to the urban North in search of a more promising life had a change of heart. Fed up with high housing costs, crime and an unstable urban economy, many went home again, carrying their hopes, aspirations and acquired city ways with them. Some returned to care for aging family members. Others longed for the wide open spaces and a simpler way of life. In "Call to Home," Carol Stack, who teaches women's studies and education at the University of California, Berkeley, chronicles this migration through the words of people who made these round-trip journeys. Ms. Stack spent eight years during the 1980's talking to people who had left hometowns in the rural eastern reaches of North and South Carolina for life in cities like New York, Newark, Washington and Philadelphia. Many fled segregation, Jim Crow and poverty, only to find more subtle forms of discrimination and de facto segregation up North. But they returned home to a South that had changed little: minimum-wage manufacturing jobs, whites in charge, blacks in apathy and despair. Although these personal accounts are at times compelling, they don't convey the social, historical and political forces driving a trend of such national significance. Without richer details of specific places and people, the book lacks authenticity. And while Ms. Stack lets her subjects do the talking, one longs for her expert opinion to put the stories in context. Lena Williams

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
Bograd's, Paterson's Stylish Survivor, Moves On

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: PATERSON

 BODY:
Joseph Bograd was two days old when his father and uncle moved their growing furniture business into a larger building on Main Street in Paterson 61 years ago. Over the years, Bograd's grew in prestige and became a landmark in the old industrial city's landscape.
It was the kind of store that might sell its best dining set for $20,000 or a crotch-mahogany railroad-baron bed for $8,000. 
 Unlike three dozen other furniture stores that did not survive here, Bograd's stuck it out with Paterson through the Great Depression, the shift of the middle class to the suburbs, the rise of the shopping centers that sapped Paterson's strength as a regional retailing center, the riots, the low points for the economy and the vagaries of retailing.
But now after 40 years in the business, Mr. Bograd says it is time to change his life. And that involves moving his store to the outer suburbs and keeping only a warehouse in downtown Paterson.
He says his decision has less to do with Paterson's problems than with the availability of a building near Exit 53 of Interstate 287 in the Morris County hamlet of Riverdale, within walking distance of his home.
"The building was tailor-made for our business at our stage of life," said Mr. Bograd.
But while Bograd's move by itself will not have a lasting impact on the city's economy, people here say that in terms of symbols and perception, it is a serious blow.
"Regardless of what spin you want to put on it, they will be missed," said Mayor William J. Pascrell Jr., who was counting on Bograd's to be the anchor for development of a hotel, a movie theater and retail stores nearby."
Deborah Hoffman, executive director of the Paterson Economic Development Corporation, an agency that supports businesses, called Mr. Bograd's plans "very disappointing," adding, "He's very much an institution in the city of Paterson."
Still, she played down the impact of the move on other retailers. His customers never spent time in neighboring stores, she said, and people looking for discount furniture have other choices in Paterson.
"Main Street is a strong street," she said, "And I think it will remain so."
Vincent Cortese, president of the Paterson Chamber of Commerce, said that although other major Paterson stores, like the Jacobs Department Store and Meyer Brothers, were no longer in business, smaller new stores have helped Paterson's economy.
Bograd's was started in 1930 by Mr. Bograd's father, Samuel, and uncle, David, who immigrated from Belarus, which was part of the Soviet Union in the early 1920's. On Aug. 1, 1935, two days after Joseph was born, the brothers moved from a store on Market Street to its present site, a four-story building at 288 Main Street.
In 1948, the store expanded into a one-story building behind one that had been the Paterson Opera house, and in 1980 moved to a six-story building next door, giving Bograd's 104,000 square feet in which to offer one of the largest selections of high-quality furniture in the country.
But in January 1995, Mr. Bograd, who lives in Pompton Lakes, was about to get on the new stretch of Interstate 287, when he saw that a former bus garage was for sale. The building, 38,000 square feet, was within sight of a major highway, guaranteeing a drop-in trade he never saw in Paterson.
None of his children is interested in continuing the business when he and his wife, Marcia, retire. Their son, Louis, is a banker; another son, Mark, is a museum curator, and their daughter, Stephanie, is a banker.
And since the stock market crash of 1987, the quality furniture business has been struggling, he said, with many stores going under. Although Bograd's is respected in the industry, he wonders whether a buyer would be interested in "104,000 square feet, with all the inventory that we have, located in downtown Paterson," he said, adding, "Any one of those three factors would be enough to create questions in a potential buyer's mind."
Susan Greenbaum, operations manager for Greenbaum Interiors of Paterson and Morristown, the only other higher-quality furniture store in Paterson and one that also specializes in custom manufacturing, said she understood Mr. Bograd's decision.
"In this business," she said, "it's efficiency or die."
But his departure may hurt the image of Paterson, whose major problem, she said, continues to be the perception that it is a decaying, dangerous place -- a theory with which she disagrees. "We're staying," she said.
Renovation of Mr. Bograd's new store is expected to be finished in August, and a grand opening is scheduled for October. He plans to keep his 30 employees, about half of whom live in Paterson. He plans to use the Paterson building as a warehouse and clearance center and rent space to other businesses.
"I'm certainly not doing this in any fashion that would reflect ill on Paterson," he said. "Our business has been good here."

HEADLINE: TRIBUTES;
One Tough Governor: Remembering Bill Cahill

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When conditions warranted, former Gov. William T. Cahill, who died last week at 84, was a bulldog. Raymond H. Bateman, who was Senate President through most of his term, called him "the best inside governor I ever saw."
Mr. Cahill, a Republican who served from 1970 to 1974, was best known for bringing the New York Giants to the Meadowlands, and for his failed attempt to win enactment of a progressive state income tax, a plan his successor, Brendan T. Byrne, a Democrat, has called the best income tax proposal ever to go before the Legislature. 
 Scandals involving the fund-raising activities of some of his closest allies undercut his effectiveness and he was defeated in the 1973 primary. Probably no other administration had come to Trenton with such high expectations and left with as much promise unfulfilled.
But along the way, some of Mr. Cahill's lesser-known battles had the widest impact. His first emergency surfaced a few days after he took office, when New York tugboat owners went on strike and Mr. Cahill became convinced that the strike posed a health hazard, since the tugs pulled barges loaded with sewage sludge out to sea.
He decided he had to become a strikebreaker, a decision that went against his moderate-to-liberal Republican philosophy. He called President Richard M. Nixon and asked him to dispatch Coast Guard tugs to haul the sludge, painting a grim picture of the toxic material being dumped in New Jersey's rivers and bays. He called on a Sunday, and by Monday the first tug hauled a barge down the Passaic River and out to sea. The New York tug owners soon ended their strike.
Until that time, few New Jersey residents had realized that sludge was being dumped off the state's beaches. The ensuing outcry spawned an environmental revolution, including the Legislature's decision to create the Department of Environmental Protection.
Being an aide to the Governor was no picnic. One day he arrived by helicopter at a community college to address students, and alighted as an army of students ran toward him. "Are you the Governor?" several asked. "No," Mr. Cahill said, jabbing a thumb over his shoulder at a staff member. "He is." The Governor walked untouched into the school while his aide was being mobbed.
His penchant for picking his fights surfaced during his first campaign, in 1969, when he was a guest at a backyard champagne party in Glen Ridge, a Newark suburb. Gloved waiters carried trays of drinks and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a strolling violinist. A few minutes into his talk, Mr. Cahill told a story about some princes living on a hill and the poor townsfolk who lived below. In time, the princes were overthrown because they ignored the plight of their subjects.
Mr. Cahill made it clear that if those in the suburbs did not try to help with the social and economic problems of Newark, the ills could eventually surface close to their affluent homes. His talk did not go down well with the guests; one man said, "Who does he think he is, talking to us like that?"
When a reporter told Mr. Cahill that what he had just done took a lot of nerve, the future governor looked surprised and said, "That just happens to be the way I feel."

HEADLINE: Ocean County's Grayer Pastures

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER

 BODY:
WHEN their lives still stretched before them like a winding road, Jane and John Cameron would come to Ocean County for brief, blissful holidays. As newlyweds in the 1950's, they would dance past midnight at glittery seaside resorts. On summer afternoons, they would lie on the white-sand beaches and listen to the waves break.
Years later, they came back here to grow old. 
 The Camerons were among thousands of couples who finished rearing their children and moved to Ocean County in the 1970's, when the first retirement communities were sprouting among the scrub pines. With names like Holiday City and Leisure Village, they offered inexpensive homes in brand-new, child-free neighborhoods. Every development had at least one clubhouse, where friendships blossomed over cocktails and card games. They were age-restricted havens in a part of New Jersey that was still spacious and lovely, where tired souls could find some peace.
Two decades later, retirees are still flocking down the Garden State Parkway to this sleepy town and a cluster of others, settling into established communities like Leisure Knoll, where the Camerons moved in 1977, or newer, posher developments nearby. Although the demand has ebbed in in recent years, Ocean County still holds claim to the highest concentration of retirement communities in the Northeast. People as young as 50 are coming these days, eager to simplify their lives without straying far from their families.
"Your kids grow up, your house is suddenly too big," said Mrs. Cameron, 72, who has been a widow for three years and the mayor of Manchester for six. "You can come down here, live fairly cheaply and still enjoy life."
These days, Ocean County has 75 retirement communities with 56,148 units, by far the most in the state, according to the county's Office of Senior Services. They include active-adult communities, typically for people older than 54, as well as mobile home parks and apartment complexes. Twenty-nine percent of the county's 438,315 residents were 65 or older in 1992, compared to 18 percent statewide. Altogether, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services has licensed about 100 active-adult communities, and about a dozen others are in the works.
Unlike nursing homes, adult communities do not provide medical services or supervised activities. Residents live in single-family homes, duplexes or condominiums, and they pay a monthly fee for snow removal, lawn work and building maintenance. Private vans shuttle them to hospitals, malls and libraries, and they can sign up for dances, dinners, sporting events and dozens of clubs.
"I'm making up for all the fun I never had before," said Gino Rosa, 72, who moved to Lake Ridge in Dover after 32 years in Bridgewater and is captain of the community's boccie team.
In part, the steady popularity of Ocean County's retirement villages can be attributed to demographics. New Jersey's population of elderly has been growing since the 60's, and the demand for age-restricted housing has dwindled only during recessions. More than a million of the state's 7.9 million residents were 65 or older in 1994, and the number is expected to grow to 1.2 million by 2010. But people who have studied Ocean County's retirement communities say the area's geography has been equally important in attracting retirees.
"If you look at the hot spots for these communities, whether it's Ocean County or Sun City, Ariz., they all have some well-known attraction," said William Becker, a Teaneck-based consultant who specializes in housing for the elderly. "The big thing that makes Ocean County attractive to people from surrounding states is the shoreline."
The beaches are indeed a draw, residents say, but economics come into play, too. Taxes in Manchester and several other Ocean County towns are considerably less than those in North Jersey, mainly because there are fewer children and less money is needed to support public schools. Mr. Becker says the average tax bill in Ocean County is 15 percent less than in North Jersey, and sometimes the saving is much greater. In Manchester's Crestwood Village, the state's largest retirement community, residents pay $700 in property taxes each year, on average.
In exchange for all these benefits, residents of retirement communities submit to a long list of rules. Children younger than 18 can stay only for several weeks at a time, and residents must warn the management that they are coming. Many communities have strict rules governing the appearance of houses and lawns -- at Lake Ridge, for example, outdoor clotheslines are forbidden, everyone's garbage cans are identical and residents can fly only American flags.
What results is a strange breed of suburbia: immaculate houses that look more or less alike, cul-de-sacs devoid of children on bicycles, and a silence that soothes some and bewilders others. In Manchester, where 75 percent of the population lives in retirement villages, Lincoln Town Cars and Buick Centurys amble down two-lane highways that lead nowhere in particular. Buses line up in the shopping plazas to transport townspeople to Atlantic City casinos and Broadway musicals. Banks, travel agencies and doctors' offices thrive, and the post office does a brisk business in commemorative stamps.
"Living here is like living back in the 40's and the 50's," said Carmine Testa, a Lake Ridge resident who was honing his boccie skills under a cloudless sky last month. "Everyone's got the same interests, the same memories, and now we're all going to grow old together."
IN the 1950's, when Mr. Testa was still a young man in Brooklyn, Ocean County was almost entirely rural, populated by fishermen and farmers. Families ventured down the new Garden State Parkway from New York City, looking to start over in a region that was mostly fields and pinelands.
That is how Miroslav Kokes, an immigrant from Czechoslovakia, ended up Lakewood in 1952. With his wife and two sons, he moved down from Queens and bought a 10-acre chicken farm with some money he had saved. But the farm started losing money, and Mr. Kokes began working with his hands, renovating homes and offices and then helping build prefabricated houses in nearby Jackson. He went to visit the Levittown development on Long Island, and was fascinated.
"When I saw it, I was drooling," Mr. Kokes, now 74 and known as Mike, said recently. "The model homes were mobbed with people. It became my dream."
Around that time, he attended a Rutgers University seminar on housing for the elderly. The seminar warned of an imminent housing shortage for retired people, and Mr. Kokes glimpsed his future.
"Only because that seminar was free, I went," he recalled. "What I learned changed my life."
With $20,000 in savings, he bought some land in Manchester and started building Crestwood Village, one of the first retirement communities in New Jersey and the entire Northeast. The first homes, finished in 1965, were simple "quads," four separate units attached at the roof, that each sold for about $7,000, he said. They had one or two bedrooms, a bathroom, living and dining rooms and a crawl space for storage. The development had a modest clubhouse, but no other frills.
Mr. Kokes advertised Crestwood Village in the Trenton and South Jersey newspapers, and the houses sold steadily. Although a few other developers were already building retirement communities in Ocean County, he outdid them all. During the 60's, 70's and early 80's, he built six more Crestwood Villages, with close to 8,000 units, far more than any other development.
When he broadened his advertising base, retirees started coming from North Jersey, New York City and Connecticut. By 1985, when the last village was completed, the combined Crestwoods were the size of a small town, with more than 14,000 people.
"When Crestwood was new, people liked the idea of retiring out in the country," said Jan Kokes, Mr. Kokes's oldest son, who is in charge of the Lake Ridge project in Dover. "They wanted a simpler life style than the one they were leaving behind."
Hearing the wind in the pines may not be a priority for retirees anymore, but the Kokes family keeps careful track of their changing desires. The family has built more than two dozen retirement communities, shopping centers, trailer parks, regular residential developments and congregate-care centers in New Jersey and beyond. Their newest project, Lake Ridge, shows how the market has changed since the first homes went up at Crestwood.
LAKE RIDGE is smaller, with a total of 926 units planned, but far more glamorous. There is a lake with a gazebo, a 15,000 square-foot clubhouse, a health club and two pools. People as young as 52 can move in (as long as one spouse is that old, the other can be younger), and so far, about 25 percent of the buyers are in their 50's. Thirty percent are still working, Jan Kokes said.
Mr. Becker, the housing consultant, says retirement communities are offering more amenities and financial incentives as the market grows more competitive. As younger people move in, recreation is becoming more important, he went on, and opulent homes in gated communities are all the rage. Houses at Lake Ridge are selling for $133,000 to $192,000, compared to an average $80,000 in Crestwood, and many buyers are paying up to $60,000 extra for whirlpool baths, recessed lighting and the like.
Whether the demand will continue past the millennium depends largely on the economy, he said, because most people cannot buy into a retirement community unless they can sell their old house. Developers are also concerned that the next generation of retirees -- the baby boomers -- will not have squirreled away as much savings as their parents did.
"They've got to have equity in their homes and have their mortgages paid off before they go into something like this," Jan Kokes said. "It's hard to guess how many will."
DEVELOPERS and politicians are fond of pointing out the economic benefits Ocean County has reaped from retirement communities.
Older people are model citizens, they say, patronizing restaurants, shops and hospitals. Their savings pile up in local banks, and because their social security and pension checks keep on coming, they do not stop spending during recessions.
"They shop, they buy cars, they go out for dinner and their money is steady," said Jim Mancini, an Ocean County Freeholder, adding that the county's retirees receive $82 million a month in Social Security checks. "That money keeps coming regardless of how the economy is doing."
On the other hand, elderly people are "oriented toward a different generation," as Mr. Mancini put it, and they are more sensitive than others to proposals for economic development that would create traffic and noise.
 They are also not likely to accept tax increases without a fight. In Manchester, where most of the voters are older than 60, school budgets fail year after year. The protest votes do not faze Mrs. Cameron, the Mayor.
"Certainly I don't object to the teachers, but there are too many administrators and aides," she said. "They didn't have these things when I was in school."
If retirees in Manchester are especially wary of tax increases, they have good reason to be. In 1991, seven former town officials were indicted on charges of embezzling at least $2 million from the town coffers over seven years. Among other things, they had gambled away hundreds of thousands of tax dollars in Atlantic City. All the while, taxes had kept rising.
Mrs. Cameron was part of a group called Stop Tax Oppression Promptly, which helped her win election in 1990, just as the thievery was uncovered. She took charge of a town that was almost insolvent, and many residents paid their tax bills early that year to help cover the losses.
"The senior citizens came out in full force to help us," she said. Nonetheless, she added, tax increases have remained unpopular during her term. But it is difficult to avoid them in a town like Manchester, she said, which has a hard time attracting ratables because it has no work force.
"I would love to have a corporate center here, but who would work in it?" she said. "We don't even have a gas station."
Economics aside, some Ocean County residents lament that retirement villages are separate entities whose residents do not care to mix with the larger community. Instead of joining local clubs and organizations, they form their own, they say. Their social networks rarely extend beyond their community, they say, and even when they die, many choose cemeteries in their hometowns.
"Those places are so self-contained, they don't have much reason to be part of the larger community," said Corinne Lill, who works at the Ocean County Historical Museum in Toms River. "It's not that we don't welcome them, but they don't contribute much except their money."
Some residents of the retirement communities acknowledge that this is true, saying they have no desire to involve themselves in the workings of a town or county this late in life. Seclusion, after all, was one of the reasons they moved in. Joe and Marie Hughes, residents of Lake Ridge since 1994, say part of the joy of living in a retirement community is the permanent escape from the hustle-bustle of life in a regular town -- in their case, North Arlington, in Bergen County.
Both Mr. Hughes, 58, and his wife, 54, were public employees in North Arlington, he a police detective and she a court clerk. Now they are immersed in the smaller-scale operations of Lake Ridge. Recently, they organized a square dance.
"You'll take a walk and end up standing on a corner with 30 people, talking for hours," Mr. Hughes said, peering out his living room window at the immaculate lawns and the empty, silent street. "Everything we need is right here."

A Manhattan Apartment on Wheels

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
WE were oozing -- no, floating -- down the parkway, vanning to Kennedy International Airport. Hunter, my 2-year-old grandson, was in a safety seat behind me. Jay, my son, was riding shotgun and reminding me of another van, the '67 Ford Econoline that I had bought from a farmer in Pennsylvania a long time ago.
"I won't forget that place," Jay said. "Remember the goose that jumped on the hood?" 
 The goose had been skewered with a hunter's arrow, and the farm family was nursing it back to health. And that day -- or, more likely, all days -- the goose was grumpy. It attacked my wife's car.
"I was a kid," Jay said. "I was scared."
"The main thing I remember about that day," I said, "was on the way home, when I discovered how hard it is to drive a van. You run over curbs. You can't see."
"Not like this one, huh?" Jay said. My son is nothing if not wry.
Yes, this one is hard to drive, too. It is a 1996 Chevrolet 1500, the first redesign of Chevrolet's full-size van since 1971 -- coincidentally, the year of our angry goose -- but like my old Econoline, it is still the size of a New York apartment. And 25 years have not made it any easier to push a condo through traffic.
Still, the quarter-century has made differences. While mini-vans are all the rage, the full-size models now account for only 7 percent of the truck market. But Chevrolet expects demand to increase by 30 percent over the next five years, spurred by maturing baby boomers and their growing families. With seating for 8 to 15 occupants, the big vans are also naturals for ride-sharing commuters and for "conversions," like the one we were in.
This one was comfortable and slick, with a standard automatic transmission getting its power from a 245-horsepower V8. It had been extensively massaged by Sherrod Vans, a company in Jacksonville, Fla., that also works with Ford and Chrysler, turning out specialty vehicles that are then sold through the manufacturers' dealers.
Outside, the conversion had transformed our "summit white" but plain-vanilla van into a butterscotch sundae, using generous swaths of metallic brown tape and fiberglass add-ons. Chevrolet had added to the mix, too, with its new "aerodynamic" body, chrome bumpers and grille, spoked aluminum wheels with whitewall tires and wider side and rear doors for easier entry. But it was the Sherrod interior that really got everybody's attention.
Hunter noticed right off, and strapping him into the safety seat created more than the usual melee. The remote-control videocassette recorder and 13-inch television set built into the rear of the center console are impossible to miss, and he was waving and yelling "Teevee! teevee!" and "Bert!" and "Ernie!" until we convinced him that "Sesame Street" was not available just then.
What truly impressed the older generation -- me, mainly -- was the power sofa behind the captain's chairs, controllable with buttons in the wooden overhead console or with knobs inside the rear doors. The sofa trundles forward, moves up and down and sort of automatically turns into a bed for two. And then there are the rack-mounted stereo components, the indirect lighting, the screened back windows, the -- yes, that's a vacuum cleaner on the left rear wall.
There is, of course, wood everywhere. Wood on the doors, wood on the dash, wood on the ceiling, all of it polished and gleaming. And where there isn't wood, there is leather, all of it richly and neatly done, shouting, "major luxury here." All of it, in fact, makes one wonder about the high sticker prices of the usual luxury cars, because the price of this van is the most pleasant surprise of all.
Chevrolet's sticker, including niceties like the 5.7-liter engine, full power and fancy wheels, is $22,540. Sherrod's conversion adds another $10,260, and the whole house-sized package comes to just $32,800. That puts the house into a fairly nice neighborhood, it's true, but you'd pay as much for far fewer amenities in a fully equipped Nissan Pathfinder.
 While it takes some learning to drive, the van is actually easy to maneuver, with a tight turning radius and wide, buslike steering. On the road, the engine's hefty torque offers plenty of go, but the same towering stance that lets you be smug about smaller vehicles in traffic also makes high speeds intimidating.
The biggest problem, though, is visibility. It is bad in most vans and all but nonexistent in a conversion with high-back captain's chairs and curtains on the darkly tinted windows. Lane changes are an exercise in faith.
Fortunately, the Sherrod van comes with a driver's seat that incorporates a thing called the Relaxor, for such nerve-jangling moments. It is, according to its owner's manual, a scientifically designed electro-mechanical system with "pulsating transducers strategically located to give you a cyclical motion over your entire body."
The manual says that even one massage a week will improve the quality of your life. And there is, of course, a remote control.

INSIDE TRACK: No picnic at the wheel, but a delectable family bargain all the same.

HEADLINE: Conversion Van's Converts: Pickups and Sport Utilities

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

 BODY:
THE conversion van emerged in Southern California in the early 1960's when crusty beach bohemians modified their Volkswagen and Ford Econoline vans, adding beds in the back, gluing shag carpet to the floors, the walls and sometimes even the steering wheel and building in wooden consoles and tables.
Naturally, it being California, the inevitable exterior treatments included alloy wheels, wooden bumpers and murals of, say, the Malibu Pipeline. 
 Van conversion remained largely a goofy cottage industry in California until the oil crisis of 1973. Buyers of recreational vehicles then began looking for smaller, more fuel-efficient alternatives that could take up the traveling and towing duties of their gas-hungry Winnebagos. Some makers of recreational vehicles, with supplier relationships in place, took the leap to van conversion.
But recently, the conversion industry itself has been shrinking. Sales of conversion vans fell 17 percent last year, and the industry has lost about three-quarters of its capacity in the last 10 years as many small, boutique operators have gone out of business, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, a trade group.
So, unlike the vehicles they make, van conversion companies have had to stay light on their feet.
While conversions were traditionally done on midsize and full-size vans, the most popular conversion items these days are mini-vans, as well as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Virtually no conversion pickups or sport utilities were sold 10 years ago; last year, they accounted for one-third of the sales of conversion vehicles, or about 76,000.
"The van conversion industry has not had any exciting growth in the past 10 years," said Charles Craig, the chairman and chief executive of the Tiara Motorcoach Corporation, a conversion company in Canton, Ohio. "That's why converters are looking to diversify."
This year, the Chrysler Corporation is letting the Glaval Corporation of Elkhart, Ind., convert Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles, Chrysler's most popular vehicle. Glaval will raise the roofs of the Grand Cherokees, creating space for a television, a videocassette player, a Nintendo machine, a high-end stereo, indirect lighting, a cabinet and other trimmings of the conversion trade. The converted Grand Cherokees will join the Ford Explorer and the Chevrolet Suburban and Blazer in the ranks of the sport utilities turned limousines.
But what can a converter add to a pickup truck? How about polished steel running boards, bed rails, bed liners, tonneau covers, bug shields, sliding windows, pearl-finish paint and fancy wheels?
Unfortunately for converters, when it comes to doling out popular vehicles like the Grand Cherokee or the Suburban, the manufacturers generally satisfy the dealers first.
"The rule is, if it's hot at the retail level, the converters have trouble getting them," Mr. Craig said. "Take Suburbans. They are almost impossible to get. I'd be surprised if we get 150. We could sell 10 times that.
"The uncertainty of what you're going to get controls this industry," he added.
The Big Three auto makers are squeezing the conversion industry in other ways. Factory-installed options now include many features once available only through a converter: heated leather seats, rear stereo systems with headphone jacks, wiring for cellular telephones, running boards and a slew of cup holders.
Also, sport utility vehicles, trucks and even some mini-vans can handle the towing tasks that once drew people to conversion vans. And as the abilities and varieties of vehicles straight from the factory increase, dealers tend to take more of their showroom stock directly from the Big Three, bypassing converters.
And yet, some industry executives are upbeat.
"We will remain a key ingredient in the full-size van market," said Larry Lincoln, the chief executive of Mark III Industries of Ocala, Fla. "We offer a unique, upscale image and content beyond what the factory can create."
Besides, said Steve Kesler, vice president of the Explorer Van Corporation in Warsaw, Ind., the buyer base remains relatively constant: middle-class consumers, most of them parents or grandparents, who have many children and who travel often.
"Mother Nature is one of our best marketing tools," Mr. Kesler said. "As long as people have kids, we'll have customers."

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
Party Spot, Tickertape Galore

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
WHEN the movie "Multiplicity," opening this month, had its premiere party at the New York Stock Exchange on June 25, the frenzy on the floor was over Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell, who star in it, not stock prices. It was their second visit to the exchange that day, which started at 9:30 A.M. with their ringing the bell to begin trading.
"It was exciting to set off the pulse of the American economy," said Mr. Keaton, who hopes "Multiplicity," a comedy by Harold Ramis about a man who gets cloned, will set off something similar at the box office. "When I was looking down over the floor, I was actually thinking that this is the heartbeat of America." Trading had been strong enough to keep Mr. Keaton from being blamed for the ruin of the free market. 
 "Thank goodness," Mr. Keaton said.
Ms. MacDowell intentionally left Mr. Keaton in charge of pushing the button to ring the trading bell.
"I put my thumb next to his thumb," she said, her porcelain-pale face reflecting overhead banks of screens and tickers with numbers dancing across them. "But I let him push the button because I didn't want the responsibility."
Later, Buck Henry, the comic screenwriter who adapted "The Graduate" and "Catch-22" and whose father, a stockbroker, always advised him not to invest in any entertainment stock, was getting some dessert. "The stock exchange is a great place for this," Mr. Henry said about the event, which was a benefit for the United States Olympic team. "If capitalism collapses, this would make a great full-time party room."
The party in the Pierpont Morgan Library's Garden Court earlier that evening for "Ghost of a Chance" (Random House), the new memoir by Peter Duchin, was filled with the conspicuously social.
"I just drove in from Connecticut to be here," said Pat Buckley, who remembered first dancing to the music of Mr. Duchin's society orchestra "about 80 years" ago. "I wouldn't have missed this for anything."
Neither would nearly 250 other well-watered convivials, including George Plimpton (who used to crash on Mr. Duchin's barge in Paris in the 1950's), Bill Blass, William Bratton, Dominick Dunne and Arnold Scaasi, who had all rallied for what had to be one of the final parties of an overextended social season.
Even the affable Mr. Duchin, who has socialized with everyone from Salvador Dali to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, was looking as if he had had enough. Chewing on ice cubes between sips of whisky, he received guests with as much spirit as one could expect from someone returning from a 13-city book tour packed around a schedule of his usual musical merrymaking.
"Great book," Charlie Rose told him.
"I'll have to read it sometime," Mr. Duchin replied.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Saying Yes to Small Stocks, Even After a Nail-Biting Ride

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE small-capitalization stock market has been on a roller-coaster, exploding higher at the start of the second quarter this year and then falling just as hard toward the quarter's end before recovering just a bit. So it is not surprising if investors feel a little dizzy.
Does all the activity mean investors should make equally frenetic moves? For long-term holdings, like retirement money, a little fine-tuning is as far as investment advisers seem willing to go. 
 Only two of the five advisers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times three years ago are making any changes for the third quarter. And even they are sitting tight on their allocations to smaller stocks.
"The Nasdaq's June retreat may seem like an appropriate time to sell small-cap stocks," said Eric Kobren, president of Insight Management ofWellesley, Mass. The index of more than 6,000 stocks fell 5 percent-plus since its record high close on June 5 (a drop that would have deepened to 7.6 percent but for the end-of-quarter uptick). "Our view is that the small-cap cycle is still intact and that many exciting opportunities lie in wait."
AMONG the five advisers, the top performer in the latest quarter is Harold Evensky, of Coral Gables, Fla. His portfolio rose 4.42 percent as a result of diversified holdings that performed well.
Like Mr. Kobren, he likes small stocks, which, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, rose more than 13 percent in the quarter until starting to slide in June. "We don't expect these returns to continue," Mr. Evensky said, "but we do expect them to outperform big-capitalization stock funds over the next economic cycle."
But he is shifting part of his small-stock allocation from Pennsylvania Mutual into the company's Royce Low-Priced Stock fund. He said he was intrigued by the fund's strategy, buying value stocks with share prices of $15 or less.
Over all, a mix of large- and small-cap stocks is best for good long-term performance, the advisers say. "You probably should have both because they switch back and forth," said Sheldon Jacobs of The No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y.
That is not to say that if small stocks are pounded enough, investors shouldn't look for bargains. But even a loss of 10 percent or so wouldn't be sufficient, said John Rekenthaler, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago, who is making no changes in his portfolio. Given the recent small-cap run-up, he would wait for losses of about 25 percent before buying.
The managers distinguish between small-cap growth stocks and small-cap value stocks when discussing them. Small-cap growth funds, which typically invest in volatile technology stocks and initial public offerings, were the highfliers this year until they began retreating in June. But small-cap value funds, which tend to own low-priced stocks, have held their ground better.
A balanced long-term portfolio should keep about 15 percent in small-cap growth stocks and 15 percent in the more staid small-cap value arena, Mr. Rekenthaler said.
Since the contest began on July 7, 1993, the portfolios have risen an average of 46.9 percent, compared with 63.2 percent for the Vanguard S.& P. 500 Index fund, which mimics the Standard & Poor's 500. Mr. Jacobs's portfolio retains the three-year lead, with a 61 percent gain.
ALL five portfolios made money in the quarter. And they ran neck and neck with the S.& P. 500 index fund; none trailed its gain of 4.45 percent by more than one-half of one percentage point.
Over all, the advisers are recovering handily from their struggles to beat the index last year, which only 15 percent of United States diversified equity funds managed in 1995.
The portfolio performance, tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. of Summit, N.J., excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five experts can choose funds that are open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
Mr. Jacobs is making three changes to his portfolio, two to upgrade into better-performing funds, he said. He is substituting the Janus Olympus fund, with $368 million in assets, for the $2 billion Janus Mercury, which has lagged behind its sibling so far this year.
Similarly, he is leaving the Oakmark fund, which, he said, has ballooned to $4 billion and hasn't kept up with its peers this year, for the $150 million Baron Growth and Income, which "has had a banner year without any technology or biotechnology stocks." It capitalized on gains in real estate investment trusts, health care and financial services.
Mr. Jacobs's final move is out of Invesco Balanced and into Heartland Value and Income, because the manager of the Invesco fund left the firm recently.
Mr. Evensky is slightly increasing his international exposure. "We recognize that it may take many years for our international exposure to pay off," he said, "but we feel that with the continuing globalization of the world economy, it is an appropriate shift."
Jack A. Brill, a San Diego financial adviser who specializes in "socially responsible" investments, is making no changes to his portfolio. Recent adjustments to increase its risk level began paying off this quarter.
Similarly, Mr. Kobren is standing pat. While he remains "reasonably bullish" about the domestic economy, he said there was "no denying that valuations in certain areas of the United States stock market are harder to justify." That is why he is holding a position in Fidelity Pacific Basin, which is 70 percent invested in Japan, a country he says looks attractive based on historical valuations and current economic growth.
Does the stumble in small-caps last quarter make the advisers nervous about the overall United States market? Not really.
"While it is easy to listen to market prognosticators and 'run for the hills,' this market-timing strategy has time and again proved to be unwise," Mr. Kobren said. "Retirement investors must not forget their long-term growth objectives, which, in all likelihood, will be best served by maintaining a substantial portion in equity funds in all but the most dire circumstances."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
For Teachers, It's a Breathless Summer

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
BARBARA BERMAN thinks of herself as a summer beach bum -- she swims half a mile five days a week at the Jersey Shore. But this summer, she is also squeezing in just as much work as she does teaching instrumental music during the school year at the John Adams Middle School in Edison, N.J.
Last week, Ms. Berman flew back from a professional development workshop at Disney University in Florida, took a breather in a lounge chair and promptly plunged into a list of jobs. They include running an entertainment marketing business, freelancing in public relations and serving as a motivational speaker for Weight Watchers twice a week. She also plans to use her Disney notes in writing three papers for graduate school credit. 
 For millions of Americans, summer may be a time to wear casual clothes to work on Fridays -- and to try to slough off on the job the rest of the week.
But not for many teachers. The days when America's educators spent their summers driving leisurely across the country, or strolling through Europe's museums, have turned into chalk dust. Instead, many teachers are busier than ever, using their summers not only to hold down second -- and even third -- jobs but also to focus on the kind of intense professional development for which they simply have no time during the rest of the year.
That kind of development is becoming increasingly important as licensing requirements tighten and as teachers are given greater say in how schools are run.
"Summer used to be a time for teachers to reconnect with their families and augment their incomes," said Sylvia Seidel, assistant director of the Teacher Education Institute, a professional development partnership that is part of the National Education Association. "But now we just don't have the luxury of looking at summer as a time to stop professionally."
Joanne Vasquez, a science resource teacher in Mesa, Ariz., and president of the National Science Teachers Association, estimates that the demand for professional development help for teachers -- especially science teachers -- has tripled over the last four years.
What is in demand? Diversity training and cooperative learning. "These are the kinds of things we're emphasizing in schools," Ms. Berman said. Computer training, she added, is passe: "Everyone's already got a home computer, so they're already into all that."
Of course, some teachers are making full use of more traditional summer programs, even if in special environments. This summer, more than 200 will study with space researchers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, while thousands of others will study everything from the ecology of south-central Alaska to spider populations in Mexico, in efforts to rev up their classrooms.
Some teachers are spending this summer pursuing the kind of professional development that is, well, a sign of just how loyal many of them continue to be to their calling. At an annual institute sponsored by the National Archives in Washington, 16 teachers will spend part of the summer eagerly chasing down historical documents on everything from Japanese-American internment during World War II to the 1980 Land Claims Settlement Act.
The institute works to help teachers select historical documents for use in the classroom. "Instead of getting boxes and boxes of material, we try to get the teachers to focus on just a cartload," said Wynell Schamel, the institute's director.
"There's so much here -- it's like a big candy store," said Tom Gray, a social studies teacher from Auburn, N.Y.
Ms. Berman suggested that her stay at Disney University -- a Walt Disney Company program that has a focus on professional development -- was just as tantalizing.
While she was at Disney University, for example, she took a marketing workshop --one of three dozen workshops being offered to more than 1,000 teachers this summer.
"It was pretty phenomenal," Ms. Berman said of her trip. She and her classmates were set loose in the Walt Disney World Resort to look for clues about the company's marketing plan. Among other things, she said Disney taught her the need to focus on the four M's of marketing: modus, message, market and method.
DISNEY is not the only company sprinkling pixie dust over teachers' summer plans.
Bryan Yager, an industrial technology teacher at a middle school in Belmont, Calif., has worked the last 25 summers, often as a general contractor on renovation jobs. This summer, however, he is developing mechanical engineering tools and processes for computer design engineers at Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Yager credits a Bay Area nonprofit organization for vastly raising the quality of his summer job. The organization is called Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education, and, like 100 similar programs across the country, it is helping teachers not only hold down more interesting summer jobs but also update knowledge in their subject areas.
"Most teachers have to work during the summer, but they'd much rather work at something that will pay off professionally, rather than driving a bread truck or something similar," said Kaye Storm, the organization's director of special projects.
Driving a bread truck is certainly not on the agenda for two Bay Area high school science teachers, Tom Saults and Paul Muhl. Thanks to the organization, they are spending the summer at the Palo Alto research unit of Canon Inc., developing a consumer-training manual for a new computer-based scanner that Canon hopes to wheel out in the fall.
"Students see teachers as competent in their fields, but not that in touch with the real world," Mr. Muhl said. "This kind of experience helps us bring a fresh perspective to the classroom."
Mr. Muhl, who hopes to spend his weekends surfing this summer, is also finishing a computer programming textbook.
In other words, Mr. Muhl is as busy this summer as he is the rest of the year, when he teaches physics and computer science and takes computer programming courses.
Nannette Lieblein, a teacher in Flushing, Queens, is no summer slouch either. During the school year, Ms. Lieblein teaches elementary school students by day and adults by night. This summer, she is teaching English as a second language to 15 children in her school district. After that, however, she will be on the prowl for some serious, if brief, recreation -- like the Cezanne exhibit in Philadelphia.
Mr. Gray, the social studies teacher, is also looking forward to a breather. After a stint assisting fellow teachers with documents at the National Archives, Mr. Gray will teach four college courses this summer, in addition to driving to Cooperstown, N.Y., to help the New York State Historical Association present teacher seminars on American culture.
And after that? "I'm taking my wife to Las Vegas," Mr. Gray said.

WITH stocks at lofty levels, the economy in the mature stages of expansion and an election ahead, many American investors think this might be a profitable time to look abroad.
But despite handsome -- and in some cases fabulous -- returns in recent years, success with international funds can be elusive, even when you pick the right companies. This is because buying foreign securities means converting your investment dollars into another currency, a process that very likely will magnify or nullify your gains or losses. 
 The challenge is to pick not just a winning portfolio, but also to do so in countries whose currencies are climbing against the dollar, increasing the value of an American investor's profits, or are at least holding their own so those profits will not be reduced. This seems a particularly formidable task now because the dollar, which like most currencies tends to benefit from rising interest rates, is looking fairly muscular.
"My own view is that the dollar is more likely to be flat or up than down over the next five years," said Jonathan H. Francis, chief global strategist for Putnam Investments in Boston.
How, then, does the mutual fund investor -- and funds are seen as the best way for most people to operate in overseas markets -- appraise the currency factor, one of the main determinants of total return?
First, specialists say, realize that the news isn't all bad if the dollar rises against, say, the yen. While an investor in a Japanese-oriented fund would probably suffer from this, at least in the short term, a declining yen means that Japanese companies that export to the United States would find their products relatively cheaper. So the drag from unfavorable currency translation will tend to be offset by the enhanced competitiveness of Japanese business.
"A lot of countries are export-led economies, and currency devaluation can thus greatly help corporate earnings" there, said William F. Wendler 2d of Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore.
But while this implicit hedge is a welcome offset in a stock fund, an investor in a foreign bond fund, which generally requires more hedging than a stock fund, would probably see any such benefit as trivial.
Ideally, of course, investors would like their funds to achieve double-barreled profits by being on the right side of both the stock and currency markets. And except for a sharp upward spike in the first half of the 1980's, the dollar has been in a gradual downward trend for the last 20 years or more, adding a percentage point or two each year to the typical international portfolio.
Against the mark, the dollar has dropped some 55 percent from its peak in early 1985, producing an extra gain of that amount for American investors in Germany.
But even if you can count on such long-term wind at your back, the short run can be unpleasant if you remain highly exposed to the swings of foreign currency, especially if your fund concentrates on a particular part of the world.
As a result, most international and global funds -- the latter can invest in the United States as well as abroad -- hedge their currency risk with forward or options contracts, though very few seek to eliminate all currency exposure.
Although some risks, like those in Latin America, can be too costly or virtually impossible to hedge, most managers aim to do enough hedging to keep currency swings from spoiling returns but without trying to enhance them, either.
"I use hedging as an insurance policy to protect the underlying stock from a potential devaluation," said Helen Young Hayes, portfolio manager for the Janus Worldwide and Janus Overseas funds, based in Denver. Both have posted gains of about 20 percent so far this year.
"I do not speculate in currencies," she added. "I am a stock picker, not a currency trader."
About 70 percent of Ms. Hayes's yen exposure is currently hedged back to the dollar compared with 40 percent to 50 percent for her European holdings.
Although fund prospectuses mention their approaches to currency risk, the discussions tend to be fairly vague, typically on the order of, "Hedging techniques are used from time to time." It is a good idea to inquire further.
Investors probably would be wise to avoid funds that are fully hedged and those, like index funds, that never hedge, said Richard C. Pell, chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer in New York, sponsor of the BJB International Equity fund, up about 12 percent this year.
An especially bad idea, added Denise Downey, a portfolio strategist for Julius Baer's individual clients, is for an American to buy into a foreign money-market fund. "A short-term fund denominated in a nondollar currency is really nothing more than a foreign-exchange trading vehicle," Ms. Downey said.
She also cautioned against what she called the widespread belief that there is no currency risk in buying American depository receipts, which represent foreign shares trading in this country and are found in various equity fund portfolios.
She and other specialists also said investors should avoid the psychological trap of thinking that the currencies of major European countries or Japan, for which trading markets are highly liquid, do not require much attention.
"People get wooed into situations like Germany and France, thinking they're safe," Ms. Downey said. "But they can still lose money."

Gone Before It Ever Really Arrived: The Quotron

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The residents of TriBeCa can breathe easy. The city's Economic Development Corporation will not be building a tall, obelisk-shaped tower capped by a stainless steel American flag and flashing the latest stock prices on a lonely stretch of lower Washington Street after all.
The planned tower -- part of a million-dollar project to fix up a one-block cul-de-sac on Washington -- had enraged many TriBeCans, whose budget for a long-discussed project to fix up eight blocks of Greenwich Street, one of the neighborhood's most vital thoroughfares, was recently scaled back from more than $8 million to $2.8 million. 
 The argument over the projects, which are being administrated by the Economic Development Corporation, highlighted the struggles of a growing neighborhood that combines the residential, the commercial, the industrial and the financial.
"They're spending a lot of money on Washington Street while we have such a bare budget for Greenwich Street," complained Nancy Owens, a member of the community board.
The tower, known locally as the Quotron for the Times-Square-like zipper that would run stock prices, seemed to symbolize the divide between the business district and the residential neighborhood. It would have cost more than $200,000.
"This is a mitigation project," said Charles Millard, the E.D.C.'s president, explaining why the tower was scuttled. "The point is to make up for the inconveniences the community suffered from economic development. There was a lot of objection to this and we don't have any pro-zipper agenda." Any money not used on Washington will be used on Greenwich, he said.
The Greenwich Street money was set aside in the 1980's, when Shearson Lehman Brothers built two new buildings there and created an $8 million fund for community projects . The community board thought the money would be used to plant trees, narrow the roadbed and widen the sidewalk. But last year they learned that the bulk of it is being used to create a new elementary school and intermediate school in Battery Park City.
Then in April, a local monthly paper called the Tribeca Trib reported the million-dollar plan for Washington Street. The board was furious.
When they saw a drawing of the Quotron, the board, which has many architects and artists on it , grew angrier. David Hupert said it resembles Vladimir Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, recasting the constructivist Soviet work with a capitalist American bent.
And the board's district manager, Paul Goldstein, said, "During times when money is so tight, why spend money on a project that no one seems particularly interested in?" MICHAEL COOPER

Putting 'Sweet' Back in Sweet Peas

BYLINE: By Tovah Martin 

 BODY:
Peter Grayson has promised to name a sweet pea for me. I've been glowing ever since he phoned to tell me, but I'm mystified about how I qualified for the honor. Granted, I spend an embarrassing quantity of time fussing over sweet peas when the appropriate season draws nigh, but the hours devoted to those brittle, pale green, tendriled vines with fragrant winged flowers are nothing compared with his involvement.
Mr. Grayson has dedicated his life to the lathyrus genus. I don't have the faintest idea what his position might be on matters social, political or economic. But I know exactly where he stands on sweet pea pruning practices and proper cultivation. 
 "Cool and moist, that's what they crave," he said. "In America, where the temperatures climb in July, they are primarily a spring and summer crop."
In conversation, he waxes poetic about his newest acquisition. "It's got sulfur-yellow wings, while the standard petals are veined in scarlet," he'll coo, so soft-spoken that he might be reading a Winnie-the-Pooh bedtime story.
Phone calls from Mr. Grayson, who is 56, aren't frequent, because he lives in Derbyshire, England. His letters arrive in an envelope emblazoned "Peter Grayson -- Sweet Pea Seedsman." Apparently, he was struck by the pangs of sweet pea fever as a teen-ager; he planted peas as a hobby for quite some time until he decided to embrace the business. Since 1988, an acre of his backyard has been devoted to them. And he is among the most active of the 1,300 members of the National Sweet Pea Society in England.
Mr. Grayson has a predilection for any sweet pea dating from 1900 or earlier. When he isn't planting, pruning, staking or hybridizing sweet peas, or collecting their seeds, he patiently researches the history of Lathyrus odoratus. Grown for the flowers, it looks very much like any other potted pea. But the blossoms are more colorful and fragrant, while the seeds are poisonous.
Sweet peas were first cultivated by the Moors in 1450, but Mr. Grayson needed to delve back only as far as 1695, when a Franciscan monk named Cuprani found an oversize sweet pea with dark blue lower petals (the "standard") contrasted with purple upper petals (the "wings") growing in a monastery garden in Sicily and shared the seeds with friends in Britain and Amsterdam.
That initial introduction whetted everyone's appetite, and the subsequent breeding frenzy lasted several centuries. By 1900, no fewer than 300 named sweet peas were in circulation. They all claimed handsome flowers, of course. But the primary attraction was the scent.
Before I actually caught a whiff of an heirloom sweet pea's perfume, I had no notion of what Mr. Grayson was making such a fuss about. The 20th-century sweet peas available from modern catalogues have a slight aroma, to be sure, but the smell certainly isn't a driving force.
It wasn't until my first packets of heirloom types sprouted, sent tendriled vines roaming three or four feet and opened buds that I really understood Mr. Grayson's motivation. I liken the scent to the perfume from a freshly opened beehive. It is a divine brew of clover honey, toasty beeswax and something else very sweet and high-pitched. One inhalation, and I was converted.
Not everyone had the same impetus toward sweet pea interaction. It was in 1900 that things went awry, in Mr. Grayson's opinion. In that year, a sweet pea flower with wavy-edged petals was discovered at Althorp in the garden of Earl and Countess Spencer, the Princess of Wales's grandparents.
Granted, the flower was physically impressive, but it lacked the signature fragrance. Nonetheless, the 20th century was devoted to expanding the flower size and increasing the number of buds on what became known as the Spencer sweet peas. The old guard -- the pre-Spencer grandifloras -- was forgotten. Until Peter Grayson came along, that is.
In 1986, he caught wind of the fact that old-fashioned ultrafragrant sweet peas had virtually perished. "So I decided to rescue them all," he said simply. It was not an easy feat. So far, he has found more than 50 heirloom sweet peas, having sent letters all over the world seeking headily scented varieties like the original "Painted Lady" (circa 1737), obtained from an Australian family who kept it in continual cultivation over several generations. (All peas lose viability after a year, so they must be planted annually to keep a seed strain intact.)
Determined to spread the wealth, he offers more than 30 pre-Spencer grandifloras in his seed catalogue, with the world's largest list of heirloom varieties. (His agent in the United States is Select Seeds, 180 Stickney Hill Road, Union, Conn. 06076; (203) 684-5655.)
Not content merely with the crusade to find lost varieties, Mr. Grayson is now breeding his own line of heavily perfumed types, which is where my namesake comes in. So what will my sweet pea look like? Heaven only knows. Mr. Grayson and I have never met in person, so he is probably unaware that a dwarf version with curly tendrils would be appropriate. But one thing is certain: my sweet pea will be fragrant.

THIS WEEK
Die, Japanese Beetles and Potato Bugs
Japanese beetles are eating the rosebuds, so go out every morning and evening with a can of soapy water and have some fun drowning them. Be as vigilant in the potato patch with potato bugs.
Pick peas and string beans before they get tough. Plant more beans and another crop of summer squash. Roly Poly zucchinis are still my favorites (W. Atlee Burpee, Warminster, Pa. 18974; (800) 888-1447).
Pull up bitter lettuce, and plant heat-resistant varieties like Royal Oak, Black Seeded Simpson, Apollo, Buttercrunch and Sierra. Great selection from Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148; (802) 824-3400.
Plant seeds of a few perennials you've never tried before, like tritoma (Kniphofia uvaria), that raucous yellow-red hot poker that blooms in midsummer. I used to hate it, but now I like its sense of humor. Just plant a few new varieties in a seedbed, and watch them carefully. Don't let them dry out, and thin seedlings when they form their first true leaves. By late summer, you can plant them in more permanent places. ANNE RAVER

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
The Invisible Hand Meets the Helping One

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
I KNOW what you're thinking: It's the Fourth of July weekend! Can't we hold the column outside today? Exactly my plan. Let's imagine the authors of our two books -- David Friedman and Fred Block -- at the same backyard barbecue in Northern California, where in real life both are university professors.
Over the mesquite-grilled salmon and baby field greens in this fantasy, the two start to argue about what independence really means. Mr. Friedman, who teaches economics and law at Santa Clara University, invokes Adam Smith. Mr. Block, a sociologist at the University of California at Davis, quotes John Maynard Keynes. They don't, however, come to blows: scribbling equations on the driveway with a charcoal briquette, Mr. Friedman concludes that the "cost" of delivering a punch in the nose isn't worth it. (Besides, humor, not violence, is his weapon of choice.) Mr. Block, meanwhile, is frantically trying to reach Washington on his cellular phone to get a Government mediator to come to the scene. 
 Just another Fourth of July debate. Is liberty defined as freedom from interference, or from want? Is it synonymous with the "invisible hand," or a helping one?
In "Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life" (Harperbusiness, $25), David Friedman provides a lively look at how a free-marketer thinks. The author, a physicist by training, learned economics at his father's knee -- a detail that loses its folksiness once you know that dad is Milton Friedman, whose presence dominated the University of Chicago economics department for a half-century. No doubt, as he wandered those hallowed halls, taking care not to trip over everbody's Nobel Prizes, young David absorbed a principle or two -- the concept of rationality, for instance, which is at the core of "Hidden Order."
According to the book, the job of economics is to describe behavior that arises from the pursuit of mostly logical objectives. The market is nothing more -- and should be nothing more -- than a reflection of people's choices.
From this vantage point, the book explains, among other things, why selling popcorn at cost would maximize profits at movie theaters, how plea-bargaining actually keeps lots of criminals behind bars and why lane-switching is futile on a crowded highway.
The author is a talented teacher, and he moves effortlessly from the traffic jams and grocery stores to the efficient-market hypothesis, price theory and backward-bending labor curves. He fine-tunes his approach along the way -- starting with what he calls a "static" set of circumstances and tackling the real world, with its change and uncertainty, later in the book. Economics, he acknowledges, involves a "continual balancing act between unrealistic simplification and unworkable complication."
Unworkable, too, of course, is a market gummed up by an activist Government. Mr. Friedman grants a few concessions -- patent and copyright regulations are deemed useful "monopoly" rights sold to people who "pay" with the time and effort it takes to invent or write something (this book, for instance). But charts are charted and stories spun to argue against regulation: of labor markets, air pollution, most mergers, the money supply, immigration, foreign trade or even illegal drugs. It's market efficiency, the author says, that "improves mankind."
In "The Vampire State and Other Myths and Fallacies About the U.S. Economy" (The New Press, $20), Fred Block takes on the anti-statist views associated with the Chicago Boys.
Why the vampire metaphor? The author says the image is one of the "subterranean economic ideas" about the state that we have lurking in our imaginations. It's also been seen hanging around in politicians' speeches. Our misguided notion: Money is the lifeblood of the economy, which the Government is sucking dry.
The author argues first that unused capacity, not money, is the lifeblood of the economy. And he says Government activism is crucial to a functioning market. The market already fails to live up to its own image as a place where only the fittest survive: consider Detroit, which stalled for decades before responding to Japanese auto competition.
"The Vampire State" sets out to hold up our subterranean images to the light of reason, and, less successfully, to promote the idea of adopting new metaphors that promote an active Government and a market that can move toward socially conscious action. With this partnership, progress -- the eradication of poverty and oppression -- is not inevitable, but it's possible.
The author describes a "practical" utopia to shoot for, one that's rich in technology, filled with leisure time and marked by a flexible and fair income distribution system. But it's, well, utopian.
For now, he'd like to see Government initiatives in three areas: labor-management mediation, telecommunications improvements and financing for the citizenry's "productive consumption" -- education and therapy, for example.
As for that new imagery we need, he suggests we think about the economy as the Starship Enterprise, with the Government as its flight crew. No one aboard that ship, he says, would consent to being steered by an "invisible hand."

'Virtual Doormen' Who Accept Real Packages

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
MAYBE it was all the birthday presents from his parents that had to be delivered to his office, or the Eddie Bauer lamp he had to drag home on the subway. Or maybe it was those trips to Federal Express, mailing apartment keys overnight to friends who would be arriving in town while he was at work. Somehow, Mike Rataczak thought, he had to get around the problem of not having a doorman.
It's an affliction for many New Yorkers who work long hours and live alone. Chances are, when the U.P.S. delivery person rings or the Airborne Express van pulls up, no one is home. 
 "It's just an incredible hassle," said Mr. Rataczak, who works in Jersey City as a human-resources consultant, far from his charming but unattended apartment in a town house on West 105th Street. "There's a doorman at the end of my block, but I don't think he likes taking anybody else's stuff. I tried leaving keys with him once, but he wouldn't do it."
So Mr. Rataczak paid a $15 startup fee and a monthly charge of $30, to obtain a "Virtual Doorman" last month at a branch of Mail Boxes Etc., a national chain of mailbox-rental companies, that opened recently on Broadway near 96th Street. It lets him direct his deliveries there, and the small ones can go into the locked mailbox.
"It's very convenient to have a place near my house where I can pick up packages and leave things for people who are trying to get into my apartment," Mr. Rataczak said, "rather than having to strategize for hours about how I'm going to do it."
But who could really replicate the doorman, who is a peculiar cog in the urban dynamic -- a few parts convenience, a few parts annoyance? Doormen stand sentry and open the door. They are also privy to your life and become integral parts of it. They know births, deaths, events in between. Like family, on the 3-to-11 shift.
They exist in many other cities, but New Yorkers at a certain socio-economic level seem to be particularly reliant on them -- whether or not they live in doorman buildings. They solicit other people's doormen to help them with U.P.S. They fashion doormen from local shop owners.
In "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," published in 1961, Jane Jacobs told of how people in her Greenwich Village neighborhood left keys with a deli owner named Joe Cornacchia. (She also called doormen part of a "hired neighborhood" along otherwise desolate Park Avenue. Without them, she wrote, "it would undoubtedly become a woefully dangerous street.")
Though lacking some of the cachet of a flesh-and-blood doorman, the Virtual Doorman, dreamed up by Greg Hund, owner of the Mail Boxes Etc. branch at 96th and Broadway, fulfills many of the functions. The services are essentially those offered to anyone renting a mailbox at the store but aimed at people -- experiencing a void in their lives -- who might not have thought they needed a mailbox service.
"We're marketing to people who are painfully aware that they don't have a doorman," says Tripp Singer, the company's manager of development for Manhattan. Mail Boxes Etc., which was originally aimed at suburbanites who were dissatisfied with the United States Postal Service, has 28 other branches.
The charge of $30 a month is the basic price for renting a mailbox. For either a mailbox or Virtual Doorman, there is a one-time $15 fee that covers changing the locks on the mailbox, Mr. Hund said. His store is open from 8:30 A.M. till 7 P.M., Monday through Friday, and from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday. It is closed on Sunday. It has a plethora of ancillary offerings -- fax machine, photocopier, packing and mailing, padded envelope sales. Some of its sister branches in the city have expanded to include birthday cards and computer rooms.
In its first few weeks of service, the Virtual Doorman has attracted half a dozen people like David Roth, an editor of travel guides at Random House, who grew weary of the routine with U.P.S. at his small building on the Upper West Side. He would get not the package, but a series of little yellow stickers telling him that U.P.S. had tried to deliver a package, but no one was home.
"I'm just ridiculous in my need for convenience," said Mr. Roth, who signed up for the Virtual Doorman last month. "My job is really demanding, and the amount of time I spend here takes up most of the day. I don't want to have to worry about calling up and saying, 'Please re-deliver this package.'
"I never would have thought to go to a place like that," he said of the Mail Boxes Etc. store. "It always seemed to me to be a place for people who worked out of their homes, who didn't want to have their own address on stuff."
The delivery routine can be frustrating for those who bring the packages as well.
"It's hard for us to bring the package back to the hub and keep coming back day after day," said Jesus Cortorreal, a U.P.S. man.
That had been Mr. Hund's feeling, too. A financial-data salesman for Knight-Ridder until three months ago, he used to live in a brownstone on West 105th Street, he said, where there was no doorman, no resident super, and a continual sense of frustration as he tried to get merchandise delivered from J. Crew.
"It was a nightmare," Mr. Hund said, adding that he has since moved to a doorman building in Chelsea. "It never dawned on me that a mailbox rental could solve the problem." He hopes to start a delivery service as well, he said, that would run until 8 P.M., bringing people their J. Crew fixes and other essentials.
Delivery does seem to be a key issue. "If they don't bring it to your house," said Sylvie Anapol, who lives in a doormanless brownstone on West 75th Street, "what's the difference? It's not the heaviness of the package that's the problem. It's arranging your time to go pick it up."
Unlike most doormen, who have to wear uniforms with ties, Mr. Hund runs a casual-looking operation. He is often found behind the counter in a tank top. Also unlike most doormen, he isn't actually in one's building, gathering intelligence. It could be a relief.
Some tenants tell of doormen monitoring their social lives, examining their mail, inquiring about their weight, talking too long while holding the elevator door open. Still, the relationship seems mostly affectionate. Doormen develop distinct on-the-job personalities -- one may be a font of political wisdom, another of sports trivia. Sometimes they serenade tenants dragging themselves home after another long workday.
Can a virtual doorman ever keep up? Here's Patrick Clarke, a doorman at the Columbia, a condominium tower at 275 West 96th Street, on the subject. "Whatever the virtual does," he said, "I'd like to see it come after a taxi."

What a "Virtual Doorman" will do:
Sign for a U.P.S. package.
Hand over keys to friends visiting from New Jersey.
Provide easy access to a fax machine.
Collect the dry cleaning when it's delivered.
Call to say a package has arrived.
 
What "Virtual Doorman" will not do:
Provide an umbrella in the rain.
Provide surveillance reports on your teen-age children.
Disappear as the car is being unloaded after vacation.
Enhance building security simply by standing there.
Hail a taxi.

Suspicion, Part 2: The Landlord's Story

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THE landlord is fighting a cold and an eye infection, and perhaps the betrayal of a dream. Landlords can be idealists, too, although tenants rarely think so. Thirty-five years ago, Richard Ravitch, who is 63, envisioned four architecturally handsome towers of rental apartments on the East River in a racially and economically integrated enclave that would throb with a sense of community. It would be a monument to the liberal imagination, and eventually would turn a liberal profit.
It took him 10 years to get his plan approved, he said. It was called Waterside Plaza, and was built under the Mitchell-Lama laws, with limited profit for limited risk and affordable housing if tenants agreed to certain restrictions and were within minimum and maximum income levels. 
 For a long time, Waterside Plaza was a seemingly placid island in the city off First Avenue, around 25th Street, a village of 1,500 families, secure, self-contained. But now many tenants speak ill of Mr. Ravitch, organize against him and, in the ultimate modern expression of ingratitude, are suing him (and the city) to overturn a rent increase.
Last week, in this corner, Rafael and Mildred Blechman, an elderly couple who 12 years ago moved into a two-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the river and the skyline, took us through their Waterside Plaza. Their rent had recently risen from $1,322 per month to $1,520 (Mr. Ravitch estimates market value at more than double that), and they were concerned about future raises. Services had deteriorated, they said. At a meeting, we heard a tenants' council member, Jim Mahon, shout, "Rent strike!" in a crowded room.
Mr. Ravitch's view of Waterside Plaza is a little different.
"When these programs were created," he said, "the purpose was to give developers 20 years of limited return before the restrictions would end and the apartments would go onto the free market. That was the contract. No one thought through the problems of tenants who might still be in place after 20 years. And then, for political reasons, the laws were changed and so was the contract. Something went awry.
"People in Waterside had not had a rent increase in 10 years. If rent stabilization had been in effect they would have been paying much more than they are now."
Rent subsidies are, of course, a very touchy issue in a city that went co-op and condo crazy. There is no shortage of stories about greedy landlords evicting tenants illegally and warehousing empty apartments. On the other hand, who hasn't heard about illegal sublets, and millionaires still snug in rent-controlled apartments?
Both sides at Waterside have suspicions. The Blechmans told me that Mr. Ravitch's plan was to turn Waterside into a co-op and sell it, turning a $3 million investment into more than $300 million. Mr. Ravitch says that the original investment was indeed somewhere around $3 million (his investment group gets a $190,000 annual return, he says, and his management group gets $850,000), and that he would love to co-op and sell, but how could he do that and who would buy it? "I tried, but the legislation never passed," he said. "And it would cost me millions in real-estate taxes to take it out of Mitchell-Lama. Yes, I'm stuck."
Meanwhile, Mr. Ravitch, says the tenants' real fear is that if their lawsuit fails, they will be subject to "certification," a new look at their qualifying incomes. He says he knows of at least one "middle-income" tenant who qualified 20 years ago but now earns $750,000 a year. He also thinks that Mr. Mahon, a Republican district leader, is stirring up tenants for political reasons, a theory that occurred to me listening to his entertaining rants two weeks ago.
Tenants are also concerned because Mr. Ravitch, an energetic, thoughtful and well-connected man, now has time on his hands to be a landlord (he also developed Manhattan Plaza). His mayoral aspirations seem long past, and his recent interest in becoming baseball commissioner was not returned. Once a Brooklyn Dodger fan, he does not go to baseball games anymore, because "as Bismarck said, if you make sausages you don't want to eat them."
He was feeling just a little sorry for himself last week; a contagious viral eye infection was threatening a long-planned trip to London to see his grandchildren. The medical compromise was that he could go, but that he could not hug them.
Urged to make a pronouncement, he said: "The best thing for New York is for the existing housing stock to go to market value when it becomes vacant, with some protection for existing tenants. I happen to believe that government should subsidize people with limited means, but that's my own political view. I have investors in Waterside who believe that the city has not met the basic understanding. I don't blame tenants for wanting to pay less, but that is no more moral than my position. And I'm still proud of Waterside."

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
Seeing Red in the Rules Of the New Blue Cross

BYLINE: By GARY S. MENDOZA and NANCY M. KANE; Gary S. Mendoza, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development in Los Angeles, was California Commissioner of Corporations from August 1993 until March. Nancy M. Kane teaches management at the Harvard University School of Public Health.

 BODY:
UNTIL 1993, the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association required that local Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans be nonprofit if they wanted to use the "Blue" trademarks. In 1994, the association -- which is governed by the chief executives of the 60-plus Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans -- decided to allow plans to go "for profit" if they deemed it necessary for business reasons; in return, the for-profit plans had to meet certain new requirements to retain use of the trademark.
These new rules, however, are shortchanging the very public that the Blue plans have aimed to help for more than 60 years. The public may hold the majority of shares in the new for-profit operations, but the new rules insulate the for-profit management from full accountability to the shareholders. The restrictions also significantly undermine the marketability of the converted Blue plans to potential acquirers. It is not clear how any of this "protects" the Blue trademark. 
 Since the Depression, Blue Cross plans have sold health insurance to the public as part of a charitable mission to make health care accessible and affordable. Hospitalization coverage with no deductible, minimal costs for in-patient care, community-rated premiums and open enrollment periods for individuals denied commercial coverage were unique Blue Cross features that gave plans a national reputation for producing social good.
In return, hospitals gave Blue Cross plans special discounts, and states exempted them from premium and income taxes. These financial benefits, coupled with their nonprofit reputations, gave Blue Cross plans an advantage over commercial insurers, and they came to dominate the hospitalization insurance markets in many states. The Blue trademark remains one of the most respected and valuable in the health care field.
But the practices associated with the nonprofit nature of Blue Cross were gradually eroded by commercial competition. Increasingly, commercial insurers attracted the healthiest customers, leaving the less healthy in the Blue Cross pool and thereby driving up the cost of the plans.
In response, most Blue Cross plans changed their practices to the point where they were indistinguishable from commercial insurers. This led Congress in 1986 to eliminate the Federal tax-exempt status of Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans.
BUT in many states, the Blue plans kept a dominant market share because of their historical nonprofit reputation and their strong relationships with the hospital industry. Recently, some plans have become increasingly concerned about losing market share, especially to health maintenance organizations that converted to for-profit status to have access to outside capital.
In reaction to these worries, the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association modified its rules. The conversion of Blue Cross of California illustrates some unfortunate results of these rule changes.
California state law requires that when a nonprofit organization converts to for-profit status, the full value of its charitable assets must remain devoted to a similar charitable purpose. In the case of Blue Cross of California, after several years of negotiation with the state's Department of Corporations, the agency responsible for approving health-plan conversions, it was finally agreed that the full value of the Blue Cross charitable assets would be used to endow two charitable foundations. One of them now holds 80 percent of the newly converted for-profit organization and the other is endowed by cash from the former nonprofit and by the proceeds of cashing in the first foundation's shares in the for-profit plan.
The foundations are required to give more than $150 million a year in charitable grants and contributions to improve the health of Californians.
While the assets held by the charitable foundations were valued at more than $3 billion, the new association rules may have significantly undermined the conversion's total value to the foundation -- that is, the public. In essence, the rules made it impossible for the foundation to capture a valuable asset: the premium associated with ownership of a controlling interest in a particular company.
THE rules, as adapted for Blue Cross of California, include these:
* For five years, a majority of the board of the foundation holding the company's stock must be former board members of Blue Cross of California.
* The foundation cannot vote more than 49 percent of the for-profit company's stock, even though the foundation holds close to 80 percent of the voting stock.
* The foundation must reduce its voting interest to 20 percent after three years and to 5 percent after five years.
* The Blue Cross trademark cannot be used if any entity other than the initial foundation acquires more than 5 percent of the company's stock (even if the acquiring company has no shareholder owning more than 5 percent of the acquirer's own stock).
One effect of these rules was to assure managers of the for-profit plan, which include the former chief executive of Blue Cross of California, that they would not have to be fully accountable to their largest shareholder, the charitable foundation representing the public interest. Perhaps the association was not comfortable with the notion that a charitable foundation should hold the new for-profit Blues accountable for maximizing shareholder value and fully protecting the public interest.
The Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association has been reconsidering the rules, but its reasons for changing them may not include concern for the public interest. We believe that the rules need to be changed so that the charity that still tends to the public interest has greater freedom to vote and trade the stock that stokes that charity.
Is the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association capable of curing its own ills, given that its rules entrench the people who govern it? An analogy might be drawn to the world of campaign finance reform, where the rules are written by incumbents whose campaigns the rules would affect. In the case of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield rules, the public cost is potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. At a time of shrinking resources for public health, that is a price the public cannot afford to pay.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Where the Education Is Built on Principal

BYLINE: By CAROLE MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
TINY Berea College, nestled at the edge of Kentucky's Appalachian foothills, has bucked convention since its birth in 1855. Its founders were run out of the state for planning to educate blacks alongside whites. Today, the collision is not so dramatic. As other schools chase tuition-paying students to cover the bills, Berea chooses to play investment banker instead.
The private school charges no tuition to its 1,500 students, who are mostly from the Appalachian region. Those who can pay, it turns away. With tuition equaling about 66 percent of operating costs at similar schools, this policy could mean a big shortfall. Berea fills the gap with earnings from its $425 million endowment. 
 Berea also turns to well-to-do nonalumni (Berea graduates, by definition, don't come from wealth), and gets some government money. And it puts students to work. They wait on tables at the Boone Tavern, an 87-year-old inn run by the college. They make brooms to sell in the school's craft shop. They wash dishes in the college cafeteria and clean dorms.
All this student labor shaves thousands off the cost of running the school. And it has the important benefit, according to Larry D. Shinn, Berea's president, of giving students the sense they are not handed an education, but work for it.
The value of the student labor, however, is dwarfed by the $32 million Berea expects to earn from its endowment this school year. Almost $16.3 million of that will go to run the school -- providing more than 70 percent of Berea's operating budget of $23.2 million for 1996-97.
The rest of the earnings will be plowed back into the endowment to keep its purchasing power from shrinking from inflation. "Our objective is to let our endowment grow by at least inflation," said Leigh Jones, vice president for business and finance at Berea. "So our investment goal each year is to earn inflation plus the amount we spend." Berea's $425 million endowment grew from about $153 million in original gifts, even as operating money was withdrawn each year, Mr. Jones said.
Berea's endowment is overseen by Mr. Jones and Jim Bartlett, chairman of the Berea board's investment committee and a venture capitalist with Primus Venture Partners in Cleveland. They, with the rest of the investment panel, make recommendations to the full board on how to allocate the portfolio. Cambridge Associates, the overall investment consultant, helps the school devise strategy and choose money managers, who then do the investing.
The endowment is important at Berea not just because it pays so many of the bills, but because it is also very big, relatively speaking. Other schools have larger endowments -- Harvard has a $7 billion kitty, and the University of Texas, in second place, has $5 billion -- but Berea has about $283,000 in endowment per student. By that measure, the school ranks 14th among 308 private schools, according to a study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
Even with a big endowment, the Kentucky school faces a difficult task in dependably earning inflation-beating returns without risking principal. "It's a little scary," acknowledged Mr. Shinn, a former farm boy with a doctorate from Princeton University who was once the kind of poor but promising student Berea seeks.
Mr. Bartlett agreed. "Harvard, with an endowment in the $7 billion range, really isn't worried about cash flow to cover its operations," he said. "Hey, if we blow this, the lights go out, and the kids go home."
In some ways, such stakes have made Berea's board more conservative than the typical college. The board has been a bit leery of the highflying United States stock market, Mr. Bartlett said -- a timidity reflected in lower returns.
Berea bet only 40.7 percent of its endowment on domestic stocks in the 1994-95 school year, compared with a median of 49.2 percent, according to a study of 402 schools by the association of business officers.
Of course, American stocks performed well in 1994-95, leaving Berea with a 13 percent return while the median college or university earned 15.5 percent. (Berea's portfolio earned a 16 percent return for the year ended May 31, but data on other schools are not yet available.)
Berea also held slightly more of its endowment in cash in 1994-95 than did other schools -- 7.8 percent versus 6.5 percent. Then too, the school was slow to wade into emerging foreign markets, another shyness that cost Berea, Mr. Bartlett said.
He said, however, that Berea's caution had served it well in the long run. Its average annual return over 10 years beats that of the median college or university, 12.1 percent to 11.7 percent.
In the 1995-96 academic year, Berea's trustees did not let up on their skittishness over domestic stocks, Mr. Bartlett said. They increased those holdings just 1.3 percentage points, to 42 percent of assets, with most held in institutional mutual funds and some in individual stocks, like Amoco and General Electric.
The modest stock allocation may change, however. "I think it's pretty clear that something's going to happen in terms of an adjustment," he said, referring to the bull market. If the market gets more reasonable, Berea will probably raise its stake.
In the meantime, he said, the school will focus more on what he calls alternative assets -- things like real estate and venture capital funds. This year, Berea has 7 percent of its endowment in real estate limited partnerships and another 1 percent invested with venture capital firms. That will probably grow to around 15 to 18 percent over the next five to seven years, Mr. Bartlett said.
"We just think over a long period of time that we have an opportunity in some of these alternative asset classes to outperform the market in the next five-plus years," he said. "Take my industry for example. Venture capital has really grown up. There are a lot of strong professional managers who turn in excellent returns year after year."
As the venture-capital stake suggests, Berea is not conservative in all investments. While it may have been tardy going into foreign stocks, for example, in 1994-95 it had greater exposure to them than did the average school -- 13.2 percent versus 7.8 percent. This academic year, it raised the allotment to 19 percent.
"We've got a global economy," Mr. Bartlett said. "There are a lot of good companies around the world in growth markets -- markets that are going to have growth far, far higher than our domestic economy over the next 10 years."
The key to Berea's investing strategy is diversification, he said. "You would not find us going very, very heavily into emerging-market foreign equities. We will always have balance. We can't go out to Las Vegas and put the whole darn thing on black and hope the wheel lands on the right number."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Fund Investing on the Net: Beyond Window Shopping

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
MIX Internet hype with mutual-fund frenzy and what do you get? Junk mail -- lots and lots of junk mail.
Fancy cyber junk mail, to be sure, posted on the World Wide Web by scads of mutual fund companies as well as entrepreneurs trying to tap into both crazes. But for the most part, the contents of these electronic Web pages have not differed much from the multicolored marketing materials that fund companies send through the (non-E) mail. 
 So while there has been plenty for mutual fund investors to read on the Net, there has been very little for them to do -- until now.
This summer, financial Web sites are blossoming with interactive activities ranging from the practical, like on-line trading, to the educational, like work sheets, to the amusing, like trading contests.
And while "brochure-ware" remains the norm, technology gurus predict fund investors will increasingly be able to act on the Internet. Companies that sponsor Web sites "realize there has to be more than information; you have to be able to do something with it," said David E. Weisman, director for money and technology strategies at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
Fund investors have long been active on the Net, first by trading information in news groups. But since 1994, fund companies have been jumping in. Many started by providing marketing material through Galt Technologies' Networth, a sort of virtual financial mall (http://www.galt.com). Today, more than 70 concerns post material through Networth, and some bigger companies that sell directly to the public -- including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price -- now have elaborate Web sites (http://www.fid-inv.com; http://www.vanguard.com; http://www.troweprice.com).
Downloading prospectuses used to be the most exciting Net activity, and it remains a popular feature at Networth, where investors retrieve several thousand a day, said Robert O. Frasca, a founder of Galt, which has been bought by Intuit, the financial software company. But Galt has steadily improved its interactive features, including a program to help users pick funds.
Tracking funds' performance is also a hot activity on the Web, both at Networth and on individual companies' pages. And a new company, Fundscape, offers investors free software that allows them to track and analyze their fund investments (http:// www.fundscape.com).
Tracking is one thing; trading, another. The biggest hurdle for Internet trading has been security, of both information and money. Until fund companies and brokerage firms are satisfied the problem has been solved, you may be able to move money around on the Net but you will probably not be able to cash out of your funds altogether.
Investors have been able to trade stocks over the Internet for months, but setting up a service to do the same for mutual funds has proved more complicated, said Barry Boyte, vice president of Jack White & Company, the San Diego discount brokerage firm. The hurdles, he said, included different regulations, different settlement systems and quirks like multiple classes of shares in the same fund.
Nevertheless, Jack White is now opening its mutual-fund trading service to new customers (http://pawws.com/jwc). (Though the firm began the service in March, it originally promoted fund trading only to a small group of existing clients.) The bad news, for Internet addicts, is that they must send paper copies of their account applications to the firm; Federal regulators require it. The good news is that Internet traders get a 10 percent discount on the commission White charges.
And within a week or two, the Charles Schwab Corporation will also start trading funds on the Net through its e.Schwab service (http://www.eschwab.com). About 550 funds can be traded without a transaction fee; the costs of trading the 600 other funds carried by Schwab will be the same whether customers place orders electronically or by phone. Fidelity hopes to start a fund-trading service later this year.
Fund companies that sell directly to investors are also trying to give their customers account information on line, and even to allow them to move money among funds. For example, T. Rowe Price already has such a system available over a modem and plans to move it to the Net once it is comfortable that investor information is secure.
In the meantime, the big no-load sites are trying to "go interactive" by sponsoring work sheets, contests and quizzes. Scudder's new site, for example, has work sheets on asset allocation, retirement planning and tuition planning, while Vanguard offers a retirement calculator and a quiz intended to test your fund knowledge.
Contests are popular with investors, and sometimes educational. For example, a group of chatters on the mutual funds bulletin board sponsored by Brill Editorial Services (http://www.brill.com) started a contest in May to see whose mock portfolio performs best over three months. The winner will get bragging rights, but most contests have more tangible prizes.
Gabelli Funds is sponsoring a stock-picking contest (http://www.gabelli.com) whose winner will get shares in Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust. But to enter, users are asked to fill out a questionnaire, as are entrants in Fidelity's trivia and "Guess the Dow" contests.
Which brings up an important point: these folks are not adding interactive features just for the fun of it. Sometimes the information you give the companies can be used to generate leads for their sales forces. And it turns out that, without some activity to engage in, Internet users seldom return to a Web site. (Who reads a promotional flyer more than once -- if that?)
That fact lies behind what its sponsor hopes will be the splashiest new fund site on the Web: the Fantasy Funds Challenge. Beginning later this month, a tiny brokerage firm in Dallas called 1-800-Mutuals plans to sponsor a trading contest in which participants will create a hypothetical portfolio from a selected group of funds; after 10 months, the monthly winners from each state will compete for a $1 million jackpot.
The brokerage firm hopes that the contest (on http://www.1800mutuals.com) will be so successful that funds will pay to be included on the select list, though so far it has been a hard sell, said Richard Sapio, president and founder of the firm. But he is confident that the contest will generate positive publicity for his company, which basically sells a wrap account. (It selects certain funds for you and charges you 1 percent a year on top of the funds' fees.)
Mr. Sapio's contestants will, in fact, be betting on his firm's success: He plans to pay the jackpot in installments over 20 years from the cash he hopes his company will generate. Whether investors will still be as crazy about mutual funds or the Internet in two decades is anybody's guess.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Downsizing Comes to Employee-Owned America

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
FOR months now, the nation's employee-owned companies have been held up as one way to reduce layoffs and save jobs. The Clinton Administration has embraced the concept and the logic: surely worker owners don't want to fire themselves. But downsizing among employee-owned companies is turning out to be much more common than anyone realized.
Like other corporations, the 2,000 companies in which the employees own a majority stake almost always put corporate survival ahead of saving everyone's job. Chief executives of big, ordinary corporations who have resorted to layoffs as a quick way to cut costs and push up profits have been lambasted for doing so. 
 But among the largest of the worker-owned companies, layoffs have also been fairly commonplace. Nearly 16 percent have experienced them in just the past year, demonstrating that basic market forces can sometimes dictate downsizing -- even when the owners must agree, in effect, to abolish their own jobs or those of co-workers.
Take Cranston Print Works, a Rhode Island textile company wholly owned by its 1,400 employees. Cranston closed a fabric printing plant in April and laid off the 100 workers there because low-wage competitors in the Far East have lured away Cranston customers, says George Shuster, the company president.
Or take Kiwi Airlines, founded in 1992 by former Eastern Airlines pilots. It is 57 percent owned today by its 1,200 employees. But to cut costs, 60 owner-workers were laid off in January, many of them clerks whose jobs had been automated. "If we had done these layoffs earlier, there would have been revolution," said Robert Kulat, a Kiwi spokesman. "We still had this concept of a happy family and of employees being bigger than the company. But big losses changed that. And people realized that to remain alive, to keep their own jobs, they had to change too."
Some of these companies, reflecting the concerns of their worker shareholders do try to economize by every method but layoffs. United Airlines in Chicago and Republic Engineered Steel in Canton, Ohio, are notable examples of employee-owned companies that have cut costs without layoffs.
But almost always in those cases, a strong union is present -- the Airline Pilots Association and the Machinists at United and the United Steelworkers at Republic -- to represent the workers and help them influence management. For it is managers at employee-owned companies who make the decisions, acting independently of their worker owners, just as managers do elsewhere.
 
No Guaranteed Paychecks
"Control, or a role in management, is the key, not simple ownership," said Seymour Melman, an engineer and economist at Columbia University, who has studied Republic Engineered Steel. "When workers have some control, an effort is made to move heaven and earth to forestall firings."
United's workers purchased a majority of the stock in 1994, agreeing then to take pay cuts but getting no-furlough clauses in their union contracts -- an agreement the Administration holds up as a model.
"There is some evidence that employee-owned companies are less likely to engage in radical downsizing," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview last week. "The evidence is still not overwhelming, but it seems to be pointing in that direction."
Actually, the direction is not clear at all. Neither the Government nor the private sector tracks layoffs at these companies, although they are multiplying. But scattered information strongly suggests that labor practices at employee-owned companies are similar to those at other corporations. Some even caution workers in company booklets "that being a part owner does not guarantee employment," said Douglas Kruse, a Rutgers University economist and specialist in employee ownership.
Employees own chunks of stock in nearly 10,000 companies at which they work, including the 2,000 where they have majority stakes. Most of this stock ownership has arisen in the past 15 years, usually through the formation of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOP's. But the fastest growth has been among the majority owned companies, the National Center for Employee Ownership reports.
Here, the workers have enough stock, in theory, to set policy. But at the 57 largest of these companies, those with 1,000 employees or more, nine of them -- 15.8 percent -- engaged in "mass layoffs," involving 50 employees or more, during the 12-month period ended in April, according to the Labor Department and the companies themselves.
That's surprisingly high, some experts say, although comparative statistics for other corporations of similar size are not available. Separately, surveys of ESOP's in Ohio and Washington State, while not asking specifically about layoffs, found them mimicking, in employment practices, other companies in their industries, although the Washington study found ESOP's "somewhat slower to downsize."
 
 
 
Creative Solutions
 Most employee-ownership plans aren't set up with job security as the goal. They are set up to give workers pension benefits through stock ownership, or profit sharing, or they offer tax breaks to the company and the former owner under a 1974 law governing ESOP's. Very often the stock is held in trust, voted by trustees or committees dominated by managers, and distributed to workers when they retire or leave a company.
Rarely are workers represented on their companies' boards of directors; United and Republic Engineered Steel are two major exceptions. When employees do vote, they are like any shareholders: restricted to voting for a slate of directors or some special resolution. Most policy, including employment policy, is made in the executive suite.
"It is very easy to lay off workers of employee-owned companies when they don't have much of a role in corporate governance," Mr. Kruse said.
Nor is that role likely to grow. Employee ownership almost always means borrowing money to purchase the stock on behalf of the employees. And lenders are often loath to lend to worker-owned companies where the rank and file has too big a say.
Republic Engineered Steel, with 58 percent of the stock held by 4,300 workers, is as good as an ESOP gets from the viewpoint of job preservation. Formed in 1990 as a castoff of another steel company, Republic had to cut annual expenses by $40 million. But rather than resort automatically to layoffs, the workers and their union got the opportunity to save the money in other ways, and they did through small steps, like working faster, wasting less raw material and using less water to cool the steel bars Republic makes.
Still, Republic doesn't forswear layoffs, although four of its 13 directors are from the workers' ranks. Ninety people were eliminated in 1991, a recession year. Automation and new technology has allowed Republic to shed 700 other jobs, all so far through attrition.
"No one can suspend the laws of economics, and sometimes they dictate fewer workers," Harold Kelly, Republic's executive vice president, said. "We have strived to do this through attrition and other methods. That has been our past. Whether it will be our future, I can't predict."

HEADLINE: You Saved, but They Didn't. So Now What?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
HERE'S the nightmare. You've socked away every stray penny in retirement accounts, resisting the temptation to live it up, in order to accumulate a comfy nest egg. Now it's payoff time: Hawaii beckons. But all the aging spendthrifts -- the folks who bought fishing boats instead of mutual funds -- persuade Congress to tax your savings and slash your Social Security checks in order to spread the wealth.
A far-fetched prospect in the home of the free and the land of the 401(k)? Don't be so sure. For while the baby boom generation's slowly building retirement crisis could be resolved in a variety of ways, punishing the thrifty will always be a tempting option in a world of too many old people chasing too few condos in the sun. 
 At one extreme, Washington might resolve the conflict between the boomers' expectations and the nation's fiscal realities by reneging on the promises of retirement benefits that it cannot easily underwrite. If it does, it might start by limiting benefits or raising taxes and financial penalties on those who have saved significant amounts. At the other extreme, the baby boomers may gang up on the next generation of workers, heavily increasing taxes to sustain Social Security and Medicare. Conceivably, though, a middle ground could be found that encourages or forces most Americans to save more and thereby softens the blow to both generations.
The truly affluent will always be able to fend for themselves, and poor retirees will probably be protected -- few people, after all, are prepared to let granny eat Gravy Train. "It's the retirees in the middle who are most vulnerable" to falling short of their expectations, argues Sylvester Schieber, an economist at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a pension consulting firm, "the people with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000."
Practically everybody has an inkling that the retirement of the big generation born in the first two decades after World War II will strain the nation's resources. But the magnitude of the problem has yet to sink in. Between 1990 and 2030 the number of Americans over 65 will double, while the working-age population will grow by just 25 percent. Hence just 2.8 workers will be around to produce the goods and services consumed by each 65-plus retiree, compared with 4.8 workers today.
Gilding this poisonous lily, the elderly population will be, on average, considerably older than it is today, and a greater percentage will need custodial care.
Not every analyst paints the boomers' retirement prospects in shades of black. Three years ago a Congressional Budget Office study concluded that the baby boomers were actually a bit ahead of their parents' generation in accumulating assets for retirement. But for William Beeman, director of economic studies at the Committee for Economic Development, a policy group financed by business, any sense of relief disappeared after a look at the fine print.
For one thing, he said, the boomers have a higher living standard -- and, presumably, higher expectations for retirement -- than their parents did in midlife. So merely saving on their parents' track will not take the boomers as far as they want to go. For another, the study assumed that today's workers would enjoy the Social Security and Medicare benefits provided under the current law. But that is hardly likely: projecting current tax and spending policies into the future, another, more recent C.B.O. study estimates that the budget deficit will rise from 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1995 to an astonishing 37 percent in 2030.
Douglas Bernheim, an economist at Stanford University and consultant to Merrill Lynch, offers sobering confirmation. Each year he constructs an index of retirement-savings adequacy based on Merrill Lynch's survey of 2,000 baby-boom households. The latest, based on the November 1995 survey, puts the index at just 36, where 100 would be sufficient to sustain the living standard the boomers are expected to enjoy in their last working years.
Wait -- it gets worse. The figure assumes that taxes will not go up and Social Security benefits will not go down. But if income taxes were raised by 63 percent in 2009 -- and that is what it would take to balance the Federal budget through raising taxes alone from then on, according to an estimate by Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley -- the retirement index slips to 27. Alternatively, if the fiscal accounts were balanced exclusively through a 70 percent across-the-board cut in Social Security benefits, the index would fall to just 15.
These numbers are averages, reflecting the inadequacy of the entire generation's savings. Those who are prudent or lucky can expect to do much better. Using data from Watson Wyatt's own survey of corporate pension plans, Mr. Schieber calculated that workers covered for 30 years by both traditional "defined benefit" pension plans of average generosity and 401(k)-style "defined contribution" plans can expect to retire with incomes equal to about 60 percent of their preretirement wage. That, plus Medicare, Social Security and modest personal savings, should be sufficient to sustain their preretirement living standard.
The catch, apart from the problematic nature of Government entitlements and the risk of higher taxes down the road, is that relatively few workers can boast of such belt-and-suspenders security. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only about half of all private-sector employees aged 30 to 50 participated in any sort of retirement plan in 1993. What is more, while the percentage of the work force with some retirement coverage has remained roughly the same, there has been a sharp shift in the last decade from traditional-pension to 401(k)-style plans.
In theory, there is nothing wrong with retirement accounts that give workers discretion to invest their own assets instead of having their employers do it. In practice, though, they tend to invest far too conservatively to take advantage of the gains from investing in the stock market over the long haul.
And a variety of rules, imposed by Congress in recent years in the scramble to limit revenue loss so that tax rates would not have to be raised, limit the amounts that can be socked away. Worse, many workers in 401(k)-style plans give in to temptation and spend the money before they need it in retirement.
While the laws of politics suggest that Washington will duck Social Security and Medicare finance issues as long as possible, the laws of arithmetic guarantee a day of reckoning. Just how the chips will fall from this multitrillion-dollar collision between expectations and reality is anyone's guess. But a handful of possibilities are now being debated, some of them in Washington and some only in ivory towers.
 
You Did Well, So You Lose!
The trustees of the Social Security System estimate that revenues will fall short of scheduled outlays by about 30 percent between 2019 and 2043. Mr. Schieber argues that this projection is optimistic; he reckons that it will take a 40 percent across-the-board cut in outlays to balance the books without tax increases.
Cuts would not necessarily be across the board. More likely, retirees who had saved more would take a bigger hit in order to keep those near the bottom out of poverty. This could be done directly by limiting or eliminating Social Security benefits for those with more than a certain income. Or it could be done indirectly by taxing more heavily the nonwage income, like interest and dividends, of affluent retirees. Or it could be done by lowering the amount that can be withdrawn annually from retirement-plan savings without financial penalty. Even today, people who have accumulated large amounts in their retirement accounts and who make excessive withdrawals (currently $155,000 a year) pay penalties to the Government. The levels that constitute an excess amount could be reduced, or at least not allowed to rise with inflation, punishing the people who have saved to help those who have not.
Those who expect this soak-the-prudent strategy could presumably sustain their living standards by redoubling their savings effort. But to make up for a 60 percent cut in Social Security, Mr. Schieber calculates, middle-income workers would have to save an extra 4 percent of their income over 30 years -- an astoundingly high figure, given that the average family saves less than 5 percent of its income today.
So Washington will likely seek other ways to cut the system's liabilities. Of these, Mr. Beeman reckons that raising the age of eligibility for full pension benefits is "the least unpalatable." After all, the life expectancy of 65-year-olds has risen by five years in the last 50 years, and the number of extra years Americans can expect to enjoy in good health has risen at least in proportion.
But under the 1983 amendments to the Social Security law that promised to guarantee the system's solvency for three-quarters of a century, many boomers already face an increase in the age of eligibility for full benefits, to 66 in the year 2020 and 67 in the year 2030. In any case, the very idea bucks the trend toward ever-earlier retirement in wealthy industrialized countries.
Mr. Bernheim points to a less noticed but more important obstacle: Keeping older workers on the job for the extra years needed to ease the retirement squeeze would increase workplace tensions. It is customary to increase pay as workers' tenure rises, he notes, even though their productivity typically begins to fall in their 50's. That explains why many employers are eager to ease out employees by their early 60's, and why they would resist efforts to solve the retirement-finance problem by keeping aging workers on the job a few years more. "Just because somebody wants to work doesn't mean they will be able to," Mr. Bernheim argued.
Delaying retirement does not require a mandate from Washington. When 65-year-olds discover they cannot afford full-time leisure, they may cling to their jobs or look for others. It already seems to be happening in the Sun Belt, where 60-somethings are returning to the labor force in increasing numbers. But the free-market fix will not make everyone happy.
"Many of these 'second careers' are flipping hamburgers," Mr. Schieber noted.
The most serious objection to reducing or delaying Government benefits may be the disincentive to personal saving. Until 1991 Australia relied on a national pension system that used a stiff means test to sort retirees in need from those who could pay their own way. But the system's cost ballooned under the weight of a perverse incentive to depend on the state. "It became fashionable to spend down your personal savings to become eligible for a public pension," Mr. Schieber said, much as it has become commonplace in America for the elderly to give away their wealth in order to become eligible for nursing-home care under the means-tested Medicaid program.
 
Just Shift the Burden
The boomers are, in effect, paying for the retirement of their parents by keeping Social Security and Medicare afloat with their payroll taxes. Why not ask their children to do the same for them? For that matter, why ask? Why not just use the weight of boomers' votes to force them?
That approach has a certain realpolitik appeal, but there are problems. For starters, the tax increases needed to cover the costs would probably be enormous. Mr. Schieber estimates that it would take a 40 percent increase in payroll taxes, starting now, to square Social Security's accounts without reducing benefits. If Congress waits -- a sure bet -- the numbers would quickly become staggering.
How staggering?
Mr. Kotlikoff and Mr. Auerbach calculate the extreme case. Under current law, they estimate, Americans who are now working will pay about 34 percent of their lifetime wages in taxes. If, however, everyone alive in 1993 were exempted from the extra taxes needed to pay for currently mandated services, the hapless people born after 1993 would have to pay 84 percent of their wages in taxes.
One way to soften the blow would be to invite more young, taxpaying immigrants to join the American work force. But Mr. Beeman notes that to get much bang from an extra green card the immigration laws would have to be made more selective, admitting more working-age immigrants with lots of earning power and few dependents.
And the numbers would have to be huge to make a material difference. The Committee for Economic Development calculates that in 2030, some 110 million workers would have to be added to a projected labor force of 160 million to restore the worker-retiree ratio to 1990 levels. "Immigration could be part of the answer," Mr. Beeman concluded, "but not much of it."
 
Saved by the Savings
This is the handy-dandy, all-purpose solution for those eager to avoid a showdown between the generations.
Savings translates into bricks and mortar and productivity-enhancing machines. So if savings were higher -- everybody's savings, not just the boomers' -- national income would eventually grow faster and the sacrifice required to support the elderly in the style they see as their due would shrink. But wishing won't make it happen. "There's a lot of talk, but I don't see any basis for believing that savings is rising," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
The Committee for Economic Development offers a laundry list of regulatory changes that could made a difference. High on the list is a reduction in the cost of administering defined-benefit contribution pension plans, which according to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation now run to $455 a year per employee for small companies. If that cost were cut sharply, maybe more companies would offer such plans.
The pension consultants are also enthusiastic about the simplest of fixes, namely more aggressive efforts by employers to inform midcareer workers of the pressing need to save for retirement. "Education does work -- especially one-on-one counseling," Mr. Bernheim said.
Tax incentives to save -- in particular, liberalized retirement savings accounts -- are also perennial favorites. But Robert Litan, director of economic studies at Brookings, points to the Achilles' heel of virtually all these tax carrots. A substantial portion of the money going into tax-sheltered accounts, he argues, would have been saved anyway. And even if the incentive to save is relatively effective it still reduces tax revenue, which in turn makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit.
Mr. Litan has proposed a novel way around this problem: requiring middle- and upper-income families to save a minimum percentage of their income, with severe tax penalties for noncompliance. But he acknowledges that this is a political nonstarter.
There are subtler means, though, toward this same end. Since 1991 Australia has had a mandatory retirement-saving system, to which employers and employees will eventually be required to contribute a total of 12 percent of wages. The savings accounts, which work much the way 401(k) plans do, are portable from job to job.
Edward M. Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan who heads the Social Security system's advisory commission, wants to try something similar in the United States, supplementing the existing Social Security system with mandatory individual retirement savings accounts financed by an additional few percentage points of payroll tax. "The attraction," Mr. Litan noted, "is that workers would identify the money as their own," rather than just another tax that disappears into the black hole of Social Security.
Every proposed solution to the retirement-finance crisis would meet objections, and for good reason: someone must pay. But one way or another, the cupboard must be replenished or the next generation of retirees must learn to do without. Once this message really gets across, perhaps sweet reason will prevail. "Attitudes could change," Mr. Bernheim concluded, "as people become more desperate."

HEADLINE: First, It's Not a 'Trolley'; Second, the Route Is Wrong

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your readers should be brought up to date on some developments since the appearance of your article about the route of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Transit System through the Paulus Hook Historic District in Jersey City (News and Topics, April 21). 
 First, the route has been approved by the relevant state agencies. Second, our organization has appealed to the Federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to take action to protect this quiet, and historic, residential neighborhood from permanent disruption.
The term trolley, which you and New Jersey Transit insist on using, evokes images of streetcar bells and quaint wooden carriages less than 40 feet long. But the "light rail" cars proposed for the 20-mile route that includes Essex Street in Paulus Hook would be 90-ton, 92-foot behemoths coupled in two or three-car trains. With tracks planned for two-way traffic, that would impose two moving mechanical walls, each at least 184 feet long, on a narrow residential street, inevitably destroying its historic character.
We see no valid reason why New Jersey Transit abandoned its initial plan for a route that would have included a tunnel under Marin Boulevard -- the route it negotiated with local residents in a nine-year process that involved community participation. Aside from protecting the Paulus Hook and Van Vorst Park historic districts, this plan has a host of advantages:
* Three low-income neighborhoods, and many more passengers, would be served; so would minority and small businesses essential to the stability of the downtown economy.
* Faster service through Jersey City would be provided, saving about eight minutes on a trip from Bayonne to Manhattan.
* It would promote immediate underground improvements at the Grove Street PATH station.
The cost of a tunnel would be offset by the income from increased ridership, better access to the city center and the use of Federal funds for the project in a manner that fairly serves the entire city.

WALL STREET
 
Almost a Holiday? Stocks Still Plunge
 
Here's the scene: Most stock traders are in the Hamptons. It's a half day on Wall Street, so whatever you do you've got to do fast. News breaks that unemployment fell to 5.3 percent, the lowest in six years, and 239,000 jobs were added. A lot of jobs. Too much good news. Overheated economy. Uh-oh. Now, in the stock market, of course, buying and selling is done almost totally with an eye on what someone else will do next, so the deskbound skeleton crew scratches its collective head for a split second, decides that the Hamptons crowd would sell, and rushes to sell even faster. A result: the Dow industrials plunge 114 points, the seventh-biggest point drop ever. At least that might be the explanation. But one thing is clear: Tomorrow, stocks will rise or fall, and the logic of either move will be unimpeachable.
 
SUPREME COURT
 
S.& L. Mess: The Rerun
 
Remember the savings and loan mess? It isn't over, not by many billions. When some savings and loans got in trouble in the 80's, you'll recall, the Government at first tried to patch things up on the cheap, strong-arming the solvent to buy the weak. The buyers' reward: a bit of accounting hocus-pocus to make it all better. But in 1989, when Washington threw up its hands and authorized that huge bailout, it took back the accounting goodies. "Breach of contract!" savings and loans yelled, to no avail. Healthy ones found themselves a lot poorer, and some less-healthy ones went under. Last week, though, they got justice (though it was scant comfort to the departed), as the Supreme Court ruled that it was, indeed, breach of contract. Damages in each case -- there are more than 90 -- will be decided by lower courts, and the total could hit $10 billion. Who pays? The taxpayers, of course.
 
SECURITY CHECKS
 
Investigations 'R' Us
 
"A more market-driven Government" -- that's what one official foresees. A noble idea, surely, especially if you're talking about $2,000 hammers. But letting a private company do security checks for Federal workers? Yes, privatization, streamlining, downsizing -- they're all doggedly in the air. And last week, sure enough, U.S. Investigations Services was born, mainly staffed by former Federal workers. The F.B.I. will still run checks on White House and Cabinet appointees, but the new company will delve into a lot of other pasts. "An invitation to abuse," Senator Paul Simon said. Then again, that mess with the F.B.I. files didn't exactly leave the Administration smelling like James Bond after a shower.
 
ACQUISITIONS
 
Garbage Into Gold
 
At this point, it doesn't seem to be luck. In 1962, H. Wayne Huizenga started with a used garbage truck and helped build Waste Management; two decades later it was a $1.3 billion company. Later he bought a little outfit called Blockbuster Entertainment, selling it in 1994 for $8 billion. And now he's building Republic Industries, last year a humble garbage-hauler, into a giant. You might, in fact, be tempted to call him a modern Midas, forever turning garbage into gold, but that would be an ungenerous comment on today's video-rental fare. In any case, last week Mr. Huizenga added a hefty gold bar to his latest pile, paying $4 billion for ADT, whose little home-security signs adorn many an American homestead. That's $4 billion in Republic stock, of course; the world has great faith in Mr. Huizenga.
 
VALUJET STOCK
 
Cleverness Can Be Costly
 
Sometimes those Wall Street folks simply get too clever. Listen to this tale. Valujet, you'll agree, wouldn't be anyone's idea of a hot stock. The airline had its image battered by a May crash, and the F.A.A. grounded the carrier in June. And though it asked last week to resume flights, that's anything but certain. Would you buy the stock? Don't be silly. Yet the stock has taken a logic-defying ride lately, with the only explanation being the tireless genius of Wall Street. A lot of investors sold it short, you see -- they bet against the stock by selling borrowed shares. The catch: you've got to replace those borrowed shares on demand -- either by borrowing more or buying new ones. But those clever people suddenly found no more to borrow, so they had to buy. This cleverness was so rampant, in fact, that the shares have more than doubled since the grounding.
 
TOBACCO WARS
 
No Friend of Bob
 
Like it or not, it's the American way: Politicians survive on corporate money. But if Bob Dole, come November, clicks his heels and finds himself retired in Kansas, it might in part be because some of that corporate largess was blown back in his face -- tobacco industry largess, to be exact. He's gotten a lot of it, and has been labeled a friend of the industry -- which, these days, is not a healthy label at all. And he hasn't exactly shaken it lately, saying that tobacco isn't always addictive and that milk can be bad for you, too. All this, of course, delights Democrats, who have been deploying volunteers in seven-foot foam-rubber Butt Man costumes to heckle Mr. Dole. (George Stephanopoulos has promised a case of champagne to a Butt Man who manages to sidle into a Dole photo.) Republicans are thinking of countering with a Joint Man to follow Bill Clinton. But would the public inhale that?
 
CAPITALISM AT WORK
 
Got to Have It! Now!
 
Well, Communism is dead again in Russia, and capitalism is bubbling away here after 220 years. That's capitalism as in the power of supply and demand and advertising. Two case studies last week: Nike, as is its habit, came out with a new Air Jordan, but kept supplies tight. So buyers, naturally, tried to break sprinting records getting to the mall to snap them up. (Not, though, snapping up in the sense of getting a bargain; they cost $115 a pair.) Also, marketers had whipped up such a frenzy for "Independence Day" that people got it into their heads that the world would end if they didn't see the movie now, immediately, opening day! Some even slept on sidewalks to get in. What was opening day? Hard to say. Movie people just love setting box-office records, and they found a cute way this time: open the film in lots of theaters, but call it a preview. Presto! A "preview" record.
 
CAPITALISM AT PLAY
 
Happy 3d, 4th, 5th . . .
 
Look at it this way: The Fourth of July could have fallen on a Wednesday, and then that devious creature that gobbles up the days that stray too close to holidays would have nibbled both backward and forward. You can hear people now: "Hmm. I could come in Monday, but Tuesday will be a bust; might as well take both off. Thursday? A nonstarter, and no point just coming in Friday." Before you know it, a whole week of productive capitalism is erased. So it could have been worse: that Thursday holiday pretty much wiped out Friday and nibbled into Wednesday, but a couple of days were spared. "Companies are silly" to ask people to work on Friday, one guilt-free New Yorker who did not work said, "unless it's something major to the world economy." Dangerous criterion. A lot of days might suddenly look like beach days.

HEADLINE: Bob Dole's Centrist Foreign Policy

 BODY:
Bob Dole is finding it hard to pick a foreign policy fight with President Clinton. It is not for lack of effort. In two blistering speeches in recent weeks, Mr. Dole called Mr. Clinton and his advisers "would-be statesmen still suffering from a post-Vietnam syndrome" and faulted the White House for "weak leadership, vacillation and inconsistency." But the broad outlines of Mr. Dole's foreign policy agenda have more in common with Mr. Clinton's policies than the shrill rhetoric or tactical differences would suggest.
That assessment may disappoint Mr. Dole, who is hunting hard for issues with the power to move his becalmed campaign. He has run into similar difficulties defining a distinctive and appealing domestic economic program. But after Pat Buchanan's isolationist and protectionist fire in the early Republican primaries, it is heartening to see the two parties finding some common ground on foreign policy principles, while debating specific initiatives. 
 Mr. Dole, like Mr. Clinton, believes in strong American leadership in the world. He favors the maintenance of robust military forces but not the reckless use of them. He understands the need to integrate America's foreign economic and political interests when possible, but appreciates the importance of exercising American influence when necessary in support of democracy and human rights.
Mr. Dole's combat service in World War II and his long involvement with foreign and defense matters in the Senate command respect. To his credit, Mr. Dole has largely resisted appeals for a return to Reagan-era defense budgets and dangerously aggressive American policies advanced by William Kristol and other conservative Republicans.
But the desperation of the Dole campaign is evident in the roundhouse punches the candidate has been throwing on issues like China, Russia and the expansion of NATO into Central Europe. Two weeks ago he accused Mr. Clinton of "misguided romanticism" in his handling of Russia, and tried to make the case that the White House has been passive in the face of renewed Russian imperialism.
Mr. Dole makes a fair point in criticizing Mr. Clinton for muting his criticism of the war in Chechnya and glossing over Russia's failure to comply fully with a number of arms-control agreements. But the Dole prescription for Russia, including a warm endorsement of Boris Yeltsin, sounds much like current American policy in making cooperation contingent on continued economic and political reform.
Mr. Dole would admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO immediately. Mr. Clinton favors a more deliberate approach, but he is headed in the same mistaken direction of making a cold war military alliance the centerpiece for European unity. Both leaders sensibly support the selective use of sanctions against China when it violates trade rules or breaks arms-control agreements.
There is a clear difference on American missile defenses. Mr. Dole seeks development and construction of a dubious defense against long-range missiles that could cost as much as $60 billion over seven years. Mr. Clinton more reasonably would concentrate for now on the immediate threat of short-range missiles, while designing but not building a system to counter intercontinental missiles.
Mr. Dole would clearly like to exploit whatever differences he can with Mr. Clinton on national security issues, if only to project an impression of strength as a potential commander in chief. But while convergence on foreign and defense matters may not seem expedient to the candidates, it is good for the country and the world. America's international leadership has been most consistent when Americans and their leaders are in accord about the governing principles of their foreign policy.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Intradivision Play Beats Balance

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If the owners are watching, if they are not distracted by a plot to devise a way to create an impasse in labor negotiations and gain judicial permission to impose their own work rules on the players, they might have noticed over the past 10 days or so the excitement that intradivision games can create.
That is, they might want to consider making a long overdue change by dumping their balanced schedule and devising a schedule that would allow more games between division rivals. If the adoption of wild-card playoff teams and interleague play indicates a genuine interest in creating greater interest for fans, the owners' next move should be the unbalanced schedule. 
 The excitement is evident.
The four-team National League West, its teams already engaged in a close, seesaw race, is amid a 22-game span in which the teams play each other. Having the Los Angeles Dodgers play a wild and wacky series in Colorado, then go to San Diego to play the Padres for first place produces far greater interest than having the Dodgers play a few more games against Montreal and St. Louis.
In this same period, the top two teams in each of the American League's three divisions are in the process of playing home-and-home series. But once the Yankees and Orioles, the Indians and White Sox and the Rangers and Mariners finish these series, they will play each other in only one more series, in mid-September.
They don't have more games against each other because under the balanced schedule they have to play the same number of games against teams from other divisions as against their division rivals. Teams from the old A.L. West have been the primary opponents of an unbalanced schedule, insisting that teams such as the Yankees and the Red Sox continue to visit them twice each season for attendance purposes.
But more games against division rivals, especially when they are contending for first place, would create even greater interest than visits from those traditional teams. The Padres, for example, recently drew 25,846 for two games with Houston, then exceeded that total for each of three games with the Dodgers several days later, nearly doubling it once.
"We're certainly in favor of it," Kevin Towers, the Padres' general manager, said of the unbalanced schedule. "It stirs more interest. It's a lot different when the Expos are in town than when the Dodgers are in town."
Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said he, too, favored the unbalanced schedule. And he was speaking not long after his team staggered out of Coors Field in Denver, their pitchers' arms and psyches barely intact. Watching the Rockies score 52 runs in four games, win three of them and nearly overcome a 13-0 deficit and win the other didn't even sour Claire on the idea of playing more games there.
"It was wild," Claire said, having lived to tell about it. "If you would have taken the Sunday game and had that in post-season or September, it would have been one of the most memorable games of all time."
He referred to the finale of the series, in which the teams took turns taking the lead eight times and the Rockies won with two runs in the ninth inning.
"These were just knockout punches," he said. "The whole psychological aspect changes. Pitchers don't believe they can keep the ball in the park, and hitters don't believe the ball can stay in the park. You have to re-think your strategy about what you might do. We'll never look at it again as any normal situation because you have to be prepared for it. The next time we go in for a four-game series, we might be armed with a 12-man pitching staff."
Any team could join the Rockies in producing that kind of game and that kind of series, but when the visitor is a division rival, the events take on even greater intrigue. The games have greater impact on the division race, too, even if they produce normal events.
The Padres, for example, have used the early games of the 22-game intradivision period to halt their giant slide and reassert their presence at the top of the standings. They entered yesterday's schedule tied for first with the Dodgers. Before this stretch, the Padres had lost 19 of 23 games and turned a six-and-a-half-game lead into a two-game deficit.
"All the teams are pretty even," Towers said. "We separated ourselves for a while. I wouldn't have thought we'd come back to the pack as quickly as we did, but we had some injuries."
The Padres' plunge began the day (June 2) that Wally Joyner, perhaps their most valuable player the first two months, broke his left thumb. He is expected back within the first week after this week's break for the All-Star Game. But now Tony Gwynn, their best hitter, is out with a partial Achilles' tendon tear, at least until mid-August. And the Padres get to make the dreaded trip to Colorado immediately after the break for -- protect the pitchers! -- a four-game series.
"I imagine it will be a slugfest," Towers said. "But I'll be in Japan; it's not going to hurt me."
Towers was around on the Padres' first visit to Colorado this season. At that time, he told Bob Gebhard, the Rockies' general manager: "I don't know how you do it for 81 games. I'd get an ulcer."

 
 
Saves Streak in Perspective
 Saves statistics sometimes look better than they are, but however saves are gained or viewed, it is pretty impressive for a pitcher to get saves in 20 successive appearances. That's the major league-record streak John Wetteland has after finishing the Yankees' victory over Milwaukee last night. The last time he relieved without getting a save -- the Yankees were losing -- was May 29 against California.
To put his streak in perspective, compare it with the late-inning achievements of his predecessors in the past 25 years. In six years as the primary closer, Sparky Lyle reeled off saves in 11 consecutive appearances in 1973 and 8 in 1972 but otherwise did no better than 5 straight. Rich (Goose) Gossage did no better than nine straight (twice) in succeeding Lyle for six seasons.
Dave Righetti, who held the job for seven years, had saves in 10 straight appearances in 1986 but surpassed 7 in no other season. Steve Farr did not exceed seven in three years, and Steve Howe had three straight in his one season as the primary closer. Last season, his first with the Yankees, Wetteland had saves in seven successive appearances.

 
 
Cone Says Education Is Needed
 Few players think and articulate their thoughts as well as David Cone, the best well-traveled pitcher in the business. Asked about Darryl Strawberry's latest last chance to play in the major leagues, he mentioned the 16-year-old Venezuelan the Yankees just signed for a $1.6 million bonus and said:
"I only hope Jackson Melian and any other kids drafted out of high school will learn from Darryl and his mistakes. A guy who was drafted out of high school, taken out of the slums of Compton, throw some money at him and he's the savior in New York a year later. Quite a lot to absorb for a young man relatively naive and uneducated.
"As part of the new basic agreement, we're hopefully going to get some sort of education program for kids like Darryl and Jackson Melian. Make sure we educate these kids, let them know economically how to handle their money, keep them out of I.R.S. headlines and drugs. We can do a better job as a union in cooperation with the owners to help these kids. Not that that's an excuse. You have to be held accountable. But you see a lot of kids drafted out of high school, then five, six, seven years down the road, with no education, they're out of the game, on drugs, in trouble with the I.R.S. It's pretty sad."

 
 
The Negotiations Go On
 The day before the last All-Star Game in Philadelphia, baseball's labor negotiators reached agreement on the collective bargaining agreement that ended the anachronistic reserve system, created revolutionary free agency and ultimately spurred the escalation of player salaries into the stratosphere of the many millions. The current negotiators will not celebrate the 20th anniversary of that agreement with one of their own tomorrow.
That set of negotiators needed 13 months and an arbitrator's historic decision backed by judicial endorsement to get the agreement. This set has been at it for more than two years and has had its own judicial action, but still no agreement.
Frequent, low-profile meetings appeared to have brought the two sides closer together, but the differences that remain might be more than gaps between tax rates and payroll threshold numbers. The whole seemingly positive exercise of the past several months could turn out to be a mirage, and renewed hostility could be on the horizon.

HEADLINE: The Race For Congress '96 -- Alabama's Fourth Congressional District;
Retirements a Hurdle for Dixie's Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: JASPER, Ala., July 4

 BODY:
The main road into this northern Alabama town winds past Bevill State Community College, the Bevill Industrial Park, and, of course, the Walker County airport, Bevill Field.
At the center of town, in the Federal building in the courthouse square, sits Representative Tom Bevill himself, the pride of Jasper, a country lawyer who went to Congress 30 years ago, rose to a powerful position on the Appropriations Committee and brought home the largesse of the Federal Government to the grateful, working-class Fourth District of Alabama. It was the old style of Southern politics, one-party, Democratic politics, creating incumbents whose power and seniority seemed self-perpetuating. In 1994, when the Republicans were mounting a revolution in the rest of the country, none of them even bothered to file against Tom Bevill. 
 But the 75-year-old Mr. Bevill has decided to "come home" this year, as he puts it with a trace of sadness, joining a wave of Democratic retirements from the House that is particularly pronounced in the South. Many are well-known, senior legislators whose canny politics of traditional values and Democratic economics allowed them to survive in a region that is increasingly realigning toward the Republicans. The question is whether the Democratic Party can hold onto their seats, and it could well determine whether Democrats regain control of the House this November.
"Each party has its Achilles' heel in this election," said Charles Cook, an independent analyst of House races. "The freshmen are the weakness for the Republicans. The Southern open seats are the weakness for the Democrats."
The long-term trend is not auspicious for the Democrats: In 1960, the party held 94 percent of the House seats from the 11 states of the Southern Confederacy. By 1994, that had dropped to 49 percent. Many of those Republican gains came when longtime Democratic incumbents like Mr. Bevill retired, and Republican candidates could compete on a level playing field.
This year, retirements and other forms of attrition, such as the decision to run for other offices, have opened 28 seats now held by Democrats, 17 in the South. (The Republicans have 22 open seats, five in the South.) Adding to the Democrats' vulnerability is that some districts have only small percentages of black voters, who remain a reliable source of Democratic support.
The fundamental struggle in this region is over the votes of Southern whites, and Alabama's Fourth, which is 93 percent white, is a microcosm of it. Can the Bevill way of politics outlast Mr. Bevill? Mr. Bevill argues that it can.
"I don't think it's going to be any problem," he said, unflappably, one brutally hot afternoon this week, when all of Jasper seemed driven indoors to their air-conditioning. "In this century we have never had a Republican representing this Congressional district, with one two-year exception, one term, and that was during what we call down here the Goldwater sweep."
Republicans, though, argue that this district is sliding inexorably toward the new, suburbanized Republican South. "This district, for the past 20 years, has not supported a Democrat Presidential candidate," said Robert Aderholt, the 30-year-old Republican nominee trying to replace Mr. Bevill. "The people of the Fourth District do not identify with the Democratic Party as much today as they did 30 or 40 years ago."
Like many Southern races in recent years, it may well turn on who captures the right mix of "family values" and economic populism.
Bob Wilson Jr., the 40-year-old Democratic nominee, acknowledges that times have changed in Alabama, but argues that its voters still want a leader "in the Tom Bevill tradition," who can make sure that the district gets its share of road money and other economic development projects, while representing their conservative values. "I want to continue the tradition of strong, conservative Democratic leadership in Alabama, of looking out for the working families of the Fourth District," he says.
Though he won the Democratic nomination in something of an upset, Mr. Wilson is no political novice; he is the scion of a deeply political family here in Jasper, and grew up on the idiosyncratic brew of Alabama Democratic politics. His father, a power in the State Legislature, delivered the nominating speech for George Wallace at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. The younger Mr. Wilson was elected to the State Senate in 1990, but was defeated in 1994 after redistricting.
The new Democratic nominee touts his commitment to "family values" in his advertising and is a member of the National Rifle Association. He says he would have voted against the ban on assault weapons and for the ban on a late-term abortion procedure that President Clinton vetoed earlier this year.
Mr. Wilson's advisers say they take heart from some of the demographics of this district: It has a strong populist history, a sizable union population for a Southern state and was carried by President Bush in 1992 by just 1 percent of the vote. Moreover, it is a district that has not exactly been averse to an activist Federal Government doing big things in the region. Fred Yang, a pollster for Mr. Wilson, argues, "If Democrats can't hold a seat like this, or at least be very competitive, then the South is gone."
But the Republicans say it is just the kind of seat that changes parties when a beloved incumbent retires. Mr. Aderholt, a municipal judge and former legal adviser to Gov. Fob James Jr., pays careful tribute to Mr. Bevill -- "I think he did a lot for this district," he says -- but maintains that Bob Wilson Jr. is no Tom Bevill.
Republicans note that Mr. Bevill's power was a function of seniority and the Democrats' majority status -- neither of which a Democratic successor can count on. Moreover, Mr. Aderholt argues, American politics has simply entered a new era, which even Mr. Clinton has acknowledged. "I think the Government of big spending is probably over, to some extent," Mr. Aderholt said in an interview in his hometown of Haleyville, just up the highway from Jasper. "I think the people of this district are interested in more take-home pay and less taxes."
He quickly added, though, "I'm going to fight for what we ought to get in this district."
Mr. Aderholt, who is the son of a circuit judge, said he planned to center his campaign on values. "We want to go to Washington to deliver a message, and that is, don't mess with our traditional family values," he said, citing as examples school prayer and a constitutional ban on abortion, except to save the life of the mother. He brushes aside Mr. Wilson's efforts to present himself as a supporter of traditional values, arguing that the real measure is the stand of the national party.
Mr. Wilson says on abortion: "Depending on the particular wording of a constitutional amendment that would restrict abortion for birth control, I could support it. However, I think a woman's right to choose when her health is endangered, or in cases of rape and incest, should not be interfered with."
Neither candidate, at the moment, seems to be scrambling to distance himself from his national ticket. Mr. Wilson says he is "comfortable" running with Mr. Clinton at the top of the ticket, although he notes, in the way of Southern Democrats: "When I come across some of the things in the Democratic Party I don't like, and from time to time I do, I speak out about them."
Mr. Aderholt shows no inclination to distance himself from Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose standing has plummeted in the polls over the last eight months. "I don't know that Newt's numbers are that low down here," he said. "I'm hoping that he'll come down and do a fund-raiser." The young Republican said he thought the Speaker and the 73 Republican freshmen did "a good job" in the 104th Congress. He also said he would have voted for last year's Republican budget, including a $270 billion reduction in projected Medicare spending over seven years.
This district, at the moment, is widely considered a tossup. Both national parties are watching it and other Southern races closely, with Mr. Aderholt being invited to a meeting with Mr. Gingrich and other Republican leaders this week. Charles Cook, the Congressional analyst, said the interest revolves around the magic number of 218, a House majority. "Can you get to 218 without the South? It's very, very difficult," he said. "Can you hold it for any time without the South? No, you can't."
The only person who seemed immune to the suspense was Mr. Bevill. Toting up a lifetime of 35 campaigns, in primaries and general elections, looking back on the proud history of a district once represented by the Speaker of the House, William B. Bankhead (Tallulah's father), Mr. Bevill maintained that the weight of history was on the Democrats' side.
"We have these unusual periods from time to time, but I think things will get back to normal next year," he said with a small smile. "The Democrats will take back the House, in my judgment."
The weight of history looked very different to 30-year-old Robert Aderholt, confident and excited and just back from a meeting with Newt Gingrich.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
From Africa to Utah to World-Record Threat

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
When he left southern Africa for the first time in 1987, traveling from Namibia to Brigham Young University, Frank Fredericks believed that college would mark the finish line of his sprint career.
The Olympics meant little to him. He could not have imagined eventually running the second- and third-fastest 100 meters in history in a span of 10 days. Or defeating Michael Johnson at 200 meters a mere 12 days after Johnson set the world record. If others thought these accomplishments improbable, to Fredericks they would have seemed impossible. 
 Until it gained independence in March 1990, Namibia existed as a colony of South Africa. Like South African athletes, Namibians were banned from international sporting events because of the racial policies of apartheid. One loophole was collegiate competition. Fredericks was sent by a Namibian mining company to get his degree at Brigham Young. The plan was to complete his education and return home for a career in business, not track and field.
He did receive his degree in computer science, and later obtained a master's degree in business, but running remains his full-time profession, while his job in marketing and finance at a Namibian uranium mine remains part time. In recent days, Fredericks has strung together an extraordinary series of races. On Friday night, he broke Johnson's two-year, 21-race unbeaten streak in the 200 meters with a personal best of 19.82 seconds in Oslo.
Two days earlier, Fredericks ran the 100 in 9.86 seconds into a slight headwind in Lausanne, Switzerland. On June 25, he ran 9.87 in Helsinki, Finland. Only Leroy Burrell, the world record-holder at 9.85 seconds, and Carl Lewis, the former world record-holder at 9.86 seconds, have run as fast as Fredericks at 100 meters or faster.
At the 1992 Summer Games, Fredericks, now 28, finished second in both the 100 and 200 meters, winning the first Olympic medals for the newly independent Namibia. Suddenly, he has become the favorite for gold at 100 meters in Atlanta, if he chooses to run the event. And his chances in the 200 became inviting on Friday when he defeated Johnson, who had appeared unbeatable.
"I don't think anyone is unbeatable," Fredericks said Friday night in a telephone interview from Oslo. "No one is bigger than the sport. That's why you cannot give someone the medal before they get to the starting line."
Johnson, who set the world record of 19.66 seconds on June 23, had not lost a race at 200 meters since Fredericks defeated him in Lausanne on July 6, 1994. His best is a significant 16-hundredths of a second faster than Fredericks's best. They are old and respectful rivals from their college days, Fredericks at B.Y.U., Johnson at Baylor. Both are reserved, as economical with words as they are efficient with their strides, Johnson churning, Fredericks fluid and graceful.
There was some controversy about whether Fredericks jumped the gun on Friday. He didn't, said his coach, Willard Hirschi of Brigham Young, who added that Fredericks simply ran the 200 the way he runs the 100, with an explosive start.
"For the first time in his life, he ran the first 100 meters," Hirschi said from Oslo. "I've told him the last couple of years, 'You've got to stop spotting guys two, three, four meters off the turn. You've got to come off the turn at least even. Then no one can beat you.' That's precisely what happened. You don't see 200-meter runners coming out of the blocks like Frank did."
What Fredericks has accomplished this season at 100 meters is as rare as it is remarkable. He might have broken Burrell's record on Wednesday had he not thrown up his arms in triumph just before the finish.
"I don't really think about records," Fredericks said after the Lausanne race. "If I think about records, I might become too tight. If I'm supposed to break it, I will someday."
The 100 meters is an event of ego and emotion as well as speed, and victory is often intolerant of even the slightest mistake. The sprint is not usually given to a steady, weekly progression of personal bests. Rather, sprinters experience peaks and valleys, and, if charted, their seasons generally resemble athletic seismographs. For instance, Dennis Mitchell won the United States Olympic trials in 9.92 seconds on June 15, only to finish last on Wednesday in Lausanne in 10.15 seconds.
Entering this outdoor season, Fredericks had not run the 100 faster than 10 seconds since 1991. But he matched his previous best of 9.95 seconds on June 3, then ran 9.87 last week and 9.86 on Wednesday. He and Hirschi see three reasons for the improvement: increased concentration from training with the Olympic champion Linford Christie of Britain; increased strength from weight training, and increased endurance from adding longer distances such as 500-meter repeats to his workouts.
"I'm mentally stronger," Fredericks said. "I have confidence I can run with these people."
He has also developed a certain coyness about his Olympic intentions in the 100 and 200 meters. Will he run one or both? If he chooses one, which will it be?
"I haven't decided," Fredericks said. "Just say I'll run both."
At the Atlanta Games, stamina will matter as much as speed. The 100 and 200 will consist of four rounds apiece. The heat, humidity and intense emotion, along with the hard track at Olympic Stadium, caused massive cramping in the 100 at the Olympic trials. The climate could prove as threatening an opponent for Fredericks as the other sprinters.
"He's always indicated he had the potential to run fast," Tom Tellez, who coaches Lewis and Burrell, said of Fredericks. "Maybe he's focused and has purpose and the right training regimen. If you have desire and focus and you're locked in, you can do amazing things. He's been kind of bouncing around, wanting to do it, not really knowing how to do it. He's a good guy. I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt."
A gold medal at the Olympics would be the crowning achievement of an unlikely career. Confronted with the South African policies of racial separation and discrimination, Fredericks grew up in the black township of Katutura, adjacent to the Namibian capital of Windhoek. An only child, he lived with his mother, Ricky, a seamstress. His father left when he was young and, even now, Fredericks declines to give his name.
In a country of 1.6 million people, the story goes, there was only one synthetic running track. Fredericks preferred soccer, which he played until he went to a high school known more for academics than athletics. There, he was introduced to running.
"The soccer team used to always lose, and I was used to a winning tradition," Fredericks said. "So I switched from soccer to track."
After high school, he worked for six months in a training program for promising graduates at the Rossing Uranium Mine in Namibia. Then the mine sponsored his education at Brigham Young. A coach from B.Y.U. had spotted him at a meet in South Africa, and Fredericks chose the school sight unseen, believing he could get a solid education and compete in big-time sports in the comfortably small-time city of Provo, Utah. The culture shock, he said, was not as severe as could have been expected.
"The big difference was that white people were not racist, or if they were, they were not openly racist," Fredericks said.
In 1991, he became the first foreign-born sprinter to win both the 100 and 200 meters at the national collegiate championships. That same year, newly independent Namibia was recognized by track and field's world governing body, and Fredericks was allowed to compete on the international circuit. He asked the mining company if he could remain at B.Y.U. to continue his education and to train for Namibia's first Summer Olympics. The company agreed.
In 1992, Fredericks carried Namibia's flag at the Barcelona Games, while South Africa returned to the Olympic fold after a banishment of three decades. Fredericks brought home two silver medals. His reward was a parade and a street named in his honor.
"Growing up in apartheid, I never dreamed about the Olympics," Fredericks said. "I don't understand the big hype. But for youngsters, with the publicity I'm getting, now they can have dreams about the Olympics."
Because he can make more money as a sprinter than as a mining official, Fredericks said it would be "stupid" to give up his athletic career just yet. He has bought his mother a house and his earnings have allowed her to retire from her job as a seamstress. Her presence in Atlanta, he said, will mean more than any gold medal.
"It won't mean anything, just another medal in my closet that I don't have," Fredericks said. "It's just an ego boost. The one good thing is that my mother will be there. And if I win, people will listen to our national anthem."
One that he never thought he would hear played at a sporting event.

HEADLINE: Is the U.N. Inefficient? U.S. Critics Draw Retort

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Stung by charges of waste and mismanagement from Congress and the Clinton Administration, United Nations officials are fighting back against criticisms that they say are politically motivated and based on misinformation or no information at all.
Joseph E. Connor, who was recruited in 1994 by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to join the United Nations as an Under Secretary General for administration, took exception last week to Washington's assertion that Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General, was holding up reform. The Administration, which vows to block a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, has said that is one reason to oppose him. 
 "Concrete results on reform are already visible, and more are to come," Mr. Connor, a former chairman of Price Waterhouse, told reporters after returning from the Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyons, France. He called Mr. Boutros-Ghali the reforms' "instigator" and himself the "implementer."
Listing steps recently taken, Mr. Connor said the core staff of the United Nations Secretariat had been cut to 9,000, from 10,000, in the last year. In 1985 the Secretariat had 12,000 employees.
Working with its first no-growth, balanced budget, the United Nations can no longer make capital improvements to its aging headquarters beyond urgent repairs needed to bring the building up to New York City fire and safety standards, Mr. Connor said. Escalators, for example, stay out of service for days, and dead shrubs are not replaced.
Also, the United States is $1.5 billion in arrears on dues, a major factor in the financial problems. Peacekeeping officials say that when Washington provides equipment to United Nations forces, it demands immediate payment, forcing other nations -- among them Britain, France and a number of poor countries who send troops -- to wait for reimbursement.
Another American, Pamela Johnson -- a Clinton appointee who played a major part in Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing Government" campaign -- is executive director of an efficiency board set up last year by the Secretary General. In an interview, Ms. Johnson said that in six months the board, which draws on government management experts from around the world, had elicited 300 cost-saving or streamlining suggestions from United Nations departments.
Some have already been put into effect, she said, mentioning a decision to give some staff members beepers rather than having them remain on standby to work on weekends. Other changes will require action by member governments, which have often been the cause of added expenses because of decisions made in the General Assembly.
"The staff wants to enhance efficiency," she said. "But when you are thinking of remaking an organization of this size and complexity, you're talking about a process that takes some time."
Other United Nations officials, saying that the organization had failed to wage a public relations campaign in its own defense in the United States, have begun compiling fact sheets for reporters and making available copies of letters of support from Americans.
In Washington, Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who has defended Mr. Boutros-Ghali, said in an interview that hostility to the United Nations was "more a result of the provincialism that pervades our society today."
Not only does the United States rank at the bottom of industrial nations in foreign aid relative to its size, he said, but it also sends proportionately fewer students abroad than almost any country.
Critics of the United Nations are not convinced that significant reform is taking place or that the United Nations should remain the large and diverse organization it has become.
James Phillips, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, wrote in a position paper that the United Nations had fundamental problems that would not be solved by tinkering.
"The U.N. has long been permeated by advocates of statist economic policies that have been tried and discarded by many of its member states," he wrote. "The time has come to lift the dead hand of socialism from the U.N.'s rudder."
Mr. Phillips questions the need for the organization to be in "the foreign aid business" and calls for a much narrower role.
"The U.N. should abandon unreachable utopian goals such as 'eradicating poverty' or 'health care for all by the year 2000,' " he wrote in the paper. "Instead, its economic and social programs should concentrate on attainable goals and useful activities, such as providing disaster relief and assisting refugees in the world's poorest regions."

HEADLINE: Ailing National Parks Look to Rescue, at a Price

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.

 BODY:
Welcome to America's oldest national park, just "one step from insolvency," as a brochure from a half-smiling ranger at the entrance informs a visitor.
Inside the park, antelope bounce around meadows, bison chomp on wildflowers and moose snort at tourists. The natural world is largely intact. But the man-made world is in terrible shape. This year, two museums and a popular campground are closed. Eighty percent of the park's main roads need work on potholes that make New York City streets seem like asphalt pool tables. 
 North of here, Glacier Park has also closed some campgrounds, pleading poverty. At Yosemite in California, 3 rangers patrol the back country instead of 19. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina line has closed a fifth of its campgrounds.
The annual budget for the parks, adjusted for inflation, has declined by $202 million from 1983 to 1996 -- at a time when the number of visitors has increased to 270 million a year from 207 million.
The parks have a backlog of more than $4 billion in maintenance. Garbage is being picked up less frequently, paint is peeling and telephone lines are going virtually unanswered.
Help is on the way. But it could mean a big step into the kind of commercial territory that the National Park Service has long feared.
Congress is close to passing two major park service bills. One would allow the parks to raise their entrance fees and the other would establish official corporate sponsors of the National Park Service.
Fee increases, most park officials say, are long overdue. The entrance fee today for a carload of people to spend a week in Yellowstone is the same as when the park service was established in 1916 -- $10 a vehicle.
But the corporate sponsorship plan, while welcomed for the infusion of money it could bring the cash-strapped parks, has set off some jitters. There is a fear among park superintendents and rangers that opening the nation's natural and historical treasures to commercial sponsorship might one day lead to the Bud Lite Old Faithful or grizzly bears courtesy of Blockbuster Video.
"Hopefully, you won't have 'Bridal Veil Falls brought to you by Fuji,' " said Dave Mihalic, superintendent of Glacier National Park in Montana. "We have to ask ourselves: what are we selling? There's a value here to corporations and to us, but these are international treasures."
Supporters of the corporate sponsorship plan, which has bipartisan Congressional backing and the endorsement of the Clinton Administration, say companies would be limited in what they could do and say in advertisements and promotions. About 10 official sponsors a year would be chosen, raising about $100 million a year, or nearly 8 percent of the $1.3 billion annual budget of the National Park Service.
"A small percentage of American corporations are going to get the privilege of sponsoring America's national parks," said Jim Maddy, the director of the National Park Foundation, the private, nonprofit group that has been authorized since 1967 to raise outside money for the parks. "Over a decade, a billion dollars in additional funding could be obtained."
The park sponsorship plan has been compared to what the Olympic Games have done, selling the right to use the Olympic logo to companies that peddle everything from aspirin to home repair products. But Mr. Maddy and Congressional backers say there are many safeguards written into the park sponsorship bill to protect the parks from being cheapened or tarnished by commercialization.
This year, in desperate shape, the parks have already embraced a record amount of corporate donations. Target, the big discount department store chain based in Minneapolis, has pledged $1 million to a campaign to renovate the Washington Monument, and in turn the chain has been running advertisements showing the monument and touting its effort. Similarly, Canon USA donated $1 million for various park repairs.
But those are donations. Official sponsorships and any increase in entrance or user fees are still prohibited by law.
The National Park Service, chartered to protect and preserve national treasures that range from the Statue of Liberty to Golden Gate National Monument in California, has all but declared bankruptcy this year. This is the first summer that a decade of budget cuts and anemic financing will finally be felt by most visitors, park officials say.
Yellowstone, visited by three million people a year, considered closing a large part of the park, said Mike Finley, its superintendent. Eventually the museums and a campground were closed. "We can no longer do more with less," Mr. Finley said.
Rangers hired for the height of the tourist season, who are sometimes the only contact that visitors have with uniformed park service officials, have disappeared throughout the park system. Nearly 900 of these positions are not being filled because officials say they had to use the money for basic upkeep of the parks.
That means, for example, that the 800 miles of back country in Yosemite will be almost without ranger patrols, and that Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, which includes Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, is without nearly half the staff members usually on hand for visitors. And up to 10,000 visitors who want to tour Timpanogos Cave National Monument in Utah will be turned away this year because the parks service does not have guides to escort them, agency officials say.
Facing a Congress where some of the Republican leaders went so far as to try to establish a park closure commission, the park service turned to corporations and user fees for basic survival. The low entrance fees have long been a sore spot among park officials.
"To get into a water slide just outside the park it cost $7.50 -- that's 50 percent more than it costs for a carload to get into Glacier Park for 10 days," said Mr. Mihalic, the superintendent.
Park officials note that foreign visitors may pay up to $5,000 for a vacation from Germany or France to the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, but the cheapest part of the entire vacation is the ultimate destination.
"It's nice to be friendly to foreigners, said Dr. Robert Nelson, a former Interior Department policy analyst who is a public land expert at the University of Maryland, "but I'm not sure we need to be giving out this kind of subsidy."
Several recent polls have confirmed the longstanding love affair of Americans with their parks, and shown a their willingness to pay more to keep them in shape. Yellowstone officials said they might eventually request up to $25 a car for a seven-day visit, if the bill in Congress passes.
The House bill on raising park fees, which has passed the Resources Committee, would allow the individual parks to keep most of the money rather than return it to the Treasury, as is done now. An estimated $250 million in new money would be generated by the change over the next six years, the Congressional Budget Office says.
But some people say the fee bill may turn rangers into bottom-line tourism operators, motivated to stuff as many visitors as possible into areas that are not supposed to be mere theme parks.
"The whole vision of the national parks is that these areas are very special parts of America's national heritage," said Kathy Westra, a spokeswoman for the National Parks and Conservation Association, the largest and oldest of park advocacy groups. "We are not looking for them to be economic engines."
The bill before Congress, Ms. Westra said, would not bring any new money to wildlife conservation or natural resources like Old Faithful but would just go to services to handle tourists. A better way to raise money, Ms. Westra said, would be to return more of that generated by private concessions to the parks.
User fees are under serious consideration, for the first time, by the National Forest Service. The public forests generate more than $12 billion annually in recreational activity for commercial interests from things like boating and hiking, but the forest service takes in virtually nothing.
Here at Yellowstone, the main attractions -- alpine peaks at sunset, geysers in full-throated roar, a glimpse of a stealthy pack of wolves -- are considered a bargain by visitors. But keeping them open, through corporate sponsorship and an increase in fees, would be one of the biggest changes in the history of the national parks. The hope of park officials is that it will not be a pact with the devil.
"We're walking a fine line here and everyone knows it," said Dave Barna, spokesman for the National Park Service. "But we think it can be done right."

HEADLINE: AN AMERICAN PLACE -- Worries Over Wages;
Canton's Economic Seesaw: Managers' Fortunes Rise as Workers Get Bumpy Ride

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, July 3

 BODY:
Robert Mahoney was hired as a senior vice president for Diebold in 1983 at a salary of $150,000 and became chief executive two years later.
Under his direction, Diebold has strengthened its place as the nation's leading manufacturer of automated teller machines, posted record sales for six consecutive years and maintained the company's record of increasing cash dividends to shareholders for 43 consecutive years. 
 For all this, Mr. Mahoney has been rewarded handsomely. His annual compensation -- salary, bonuses and stock -- has increased nearly fivefold, to $2.37 million in 1995 from $464,250 in 1990. Indeed, last year, the Diebold board added a stock-option bonus for Mr. Mahoney and his top executives to insure that the earnings of the men who run Diebold would keep up with executive pay at competing companies.
But Diebold's unionized factory workers here have not been anywhere near so fortunate. Today, those plant workers make less than they did a decade ago. In 1983, Jim Ramey, an assembler at the Diebold plant here, earned $11.83 an hour, $24,596 a year. Now, he makes $9.93 an hour, $20,654 a year.
In 1983, there were 800 union workers at the Diebold plant here, while there are 58 today. Under Mr. Mahoney, the company has increasingly shifted work to outside contractors -- called outsourcing -- and shifted production from Canton to lower-paying, nonunion plants built by Diebold in the South.
That has left a mighty bitter taste among plant workers here. "I begrudge Mahoney his big salary," said Mr. Ramey, who is president of the union at Diebold. "I begrudge his bonuses when workers are hurting."
The latest census studies, surveys of corporate salaries and United States Labor Department indexes leave little doubt: the richest are getting richer, while the average working person is having trouble breaking even.
Donald Eagon, Diebold's vice president for communications, says it is simply market forces that dictate his company's salaries. Diebold has had to reduce factory workers' pay and cut its costs, he said, to stay competitive in a global market where electronics companies look to places like Southeast Asia for cheap labor.
And Diebold has had to raise its top executives' salaries so they will not be hired away by competitors, he said. Explaining the new stock-option plan for Mr. Mahoney and other Diebold executives, Mr. Eagon said, "You're talking about people who work very hard and weren't being compensated at the same level as like companies."
Here in Stark County, a place that mirrors the nation, Diebold is but one example of the growing disparities. Last month, the Hoover Company, a highly profitable division of Maytag, gave its workers, who make an average of $14.50 an hour here, an ultimatum: Either accept a $7.50 an hour wage for new hires, or the company will build its newest vacuum cleaner line in Texas. The union voted overwhelmingly against making any concessions, and the company made good on its threat.
That set off an angry community debate, often dividing people along class lines. Class conflict is usually the last thing heard around here, even from union members, who are more likely to be preoccupied with their jet skis, their Cleveland Indians or their golf. Major corporations like Diebold and the Timken Company have even tried to eliminate the traditional terminology that divides employees into "union and management" or "salaried and hourly." At Diebold and Timken, everyone from the chairman to the janitor is to be called an "associate."
But since the Hoover decision, the letters to the editorial page of The Repository, the local newspaper, have been filled by readers' debates about whether America's middle class is disappearing.
Pro-Hoover letters have argued that the company had to lower its wages to stay competitive with manufacturers like Eureka, which long ago moved most of its workers to El Paso, where it pays $7.50 an hour.
Pro-labor readers have asked what is the point of a union if people are making $7.50 an hour, and they have cheered the workers for saying no to more concessions.
 
Union and Managers See Cautionary Tale
Even The Repository's editorial board has split along management and union lines. The publisher, executive editor and editorial page editor wrote an editorial urging the union to reconsider its "no" vote.
But the editorial page writer, Susan Glaser, a member of the newspaper's union, wrote a rare dissenting editorial, siding with Hoover's union members.
Both sides point to Diebold as a cautionary tale. Until the 1970's, Diebold specialized in making bank security products like vaults and electronic surveillance systems. There were 1,200 manufacturing jobs here and 200 more at a unionized plant in Hamilton, Ohio.
At the time, the leadership of the Canton union, the boilermakers, had a contentious reputation. Tony Carpinelli, the chief steward then, now says: "I was very aggressive. If the company didn't follow the contract, I filed a grievance, and I'd say I won about 80 percent." Mr. Carpinelli said company executives had told him that they would be locating their new A.T.M. assembly plant in Newark, Ohio, because they expected a "weaker union" there.
Jobs began to leave Canton. In 1983, the Canton union signed a favorable contract for its 800 remaining members, but in 1984, the company said it needed concessions or it would move out even more jobs.
By then, unions were on the decline. President Ronald Reagan had broken the air traffic controllers' strike, and the Rust Belt collapse was in full force here: county unemployment was near 15 percent.
The union made major concessions. The salary of workers making incentive pay dropped to $12 an hour from $15, while that of hourly workers dropped to $8 from $11.83 and new hires were put on a lower pay tier, with $1 less an hour. To this day, the union workers here have not been able to match the 1983 contract.
The concessions helped Diebold post record profits in 1984, but the next several years were shaky. While sales of the new A.T.M. products grew, the savings and loan crisis made banks more cost conscious. By the late 1980's, the declining demand for bank security equipment plus outsourcing by the company had reduced the Canton plant's work force to 350.
In 1989, Mr. Mahoney completed his plan to revise Diebold's manufacturing. It called for closing most of the 100-year-old plant here, which the company termed "not suitable for today's automated technology," and opening small, nonunion factories in Lynchburg, Va., and Sumter, S.C. Diebold officials said they could find no other suitable site in Stark County, although the workers here believe that the company simply did not want to pay a union wage.
A company memo from 1989 shows the projected labor savings: the average Canton worker was making $26,154, while the average salary at the two Southern factories would be $17,340.
At Canton, the average age of workers was 49; at Lynchburg, the average age of the 73 hired in the first phase was 29.
 
Government Aid To Move Operations
It particularly galled the union workers that Diebold was awarded Federal community development block grants and state economic development funds to set up its nonunion plants. Virginia paid for advertisements to attract workers and more than $50,000 in training fees; South Carolina waived sewage and water hookup costs and $60,000 in interest on a building loan.
At the time, there was much hand-wringing here over whether the union should have accepted more concessions to keep the jobs. In retrospect, it probably made no difference. In May 1990, J. William Sekula, a lawyer for Diebold, wrote to the union leader in Hamilton, saying the company was "impressed with your willingness to work with us" and assuring him that it "has not gone unnoticed." Within months, Diebold closed the Hamilton plant.
Mr. Mahoney said at the time that while the restructuring was painful, it was necessary in the long run to "save jobs and grow shareholder value," and he has delivered on those promises. Since 1990, Diebold's national work force has risen to 5,178 from 3,814, although it is still below the 6,700 jobs when Mr. Mahoney joined Diebold. Much of the recent hiring has obtained engineers and technicians who develop computer software for A.T.M.'s.
Under Mr. Mahoney, the company enjoyed record profits in 1994 and 1995. A $100 investment in Diebold shares in 1990 would have been worth $380 by December 1995, well above the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
In an interview, Mr. Mahoney said the restructuring of manufacturing had been necessary to create new plants with cooperative work teams and interchangeable jobs. "Unionism is going down because corporations have changed their views," he said. "We empower our people now. They work in teams with shared responsibilities. It's not management versus the workers in the plants now. We're all one for our shareholders."
Of course, Mr. Mahoney is a major Diebold shareholder, and a considerable portion of his and his top executives' compensation comes in deferred-stock awards, which gives them an incentive to keep the shares' value climbing. Mr. Mahoney owns 121,511 Diebold shares, worth $5.6 million at the current trading price of $46 per share, according to the latest proxy statement.
Among the other benefits Diebold executives enjoy is protection from the vagaries of the job market. If Diebold is acquired or merges with another company, Mr. Mahoney and his top executives are guaranteed their jobs for three years at current compensation rates.
The downsized union workers who lost their jobs at the Canton plant were not so fortunate. The company made no attempt to help them get new jobs at the plants in Virginia or South Carolina. Company officials explained that anyone who wanted to apply would have to go through the same application process as any new associate, would earn a starting salary of $7 to $8 an hour and would carry over no seniority. Most Canton workers had more than 20 years with Diebold. The company offered them two weeks' salary as severance pay: typically, $800 to $1,000. Few, if any, took it because they had to sign away their job-recall rights to qualify.
 
Final Orders: 'You Can't Go Back'
While there was considerable resentment in this country over the excesses of labor unions in the 1970's and early 1980's, there is evidence as the unions have weakened, public opinion has shifted in their favor. In May, when Stark County residents were asked in a New York Times poll whom they blamed for the downsizing of jobs, 52 percent of those surveyed blamed corporations a lot, while 19 percent blamed unions a lot.
Wyona Whitehurst, a tractor driver, was 61 and had worked at Diebold for 21 years when she was laid off. "The morning they put us out, they called us into the cafeteria," she said. "They had all these guards to escort us out of the plant. They said, 'You can't go back in.' "
Mrs. Whitehurst said she had tried to find work but was too old to get anything but a minimum-wage job and was now retired. David Rusu, a 22-year Diebold veteran who was laid off, became a real estate agent. Dennis Swartz, with 21 years, got a factory job for about what he was making in 1983 at Diebold. Jack Ulrich, who had 22 years at Diebold, was found to have multiple sclerosis at the time of the layoff. He could not find steady work again and now helps at his brother's business.
All of them said they admired the Hoover workers for saying no to more concessions. But they have no illusions that it will change things. "It's just like Diebold did us," Mrs. Whitehurst said. "The big ones is going higher and higher, and the regular workers lower and lower."
 
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. As the November election approaches, this is the 17th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

Reggae Is Reclaiming Its Songs of Freedom

BYLINE: By Elena Oumano; Elena Oumano has written about world music for more than a decade.

 BODY:
JAMAICA MAY BE A PRIME destination for sun-worshiping vacationers, but to millions of reggae music lovers, the Caribbean island is the birthplace of the sultry yet rebellious sound ruled by drum and bass. When the reggae legend Bob Marley was singing in the 70's, the music's lyrics conjured up reveries of equality, unity and love, all with an underlying threat of revolutionary violence. In the 80's, the reggae world shrank to dance-hall size, transforming itself into a showcase for the sexual boasts and aggressive posturings of oversize egos. In the last two years, however, reggae has returned to its earliest themes.
Two concerts in New York today illustrate how the music is rediscovering its moral message. "Marley Magic," at Summerstage in Central Park, features members of the singer's family (Rita, Julian, Damien and Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers) who began carrying on his legacy even before his death in 1981. "Reggae Culturama '96," at Downing Stadium on Randalls Island, presents a lineup that includes Dennis Brown, Judy Mowatt and Capleton, all of whom focus on the struggles of black people for equality. Increasingly, reggae is reestablishing its ties to Rastafarian beliefs. 
 Rastafari, a socioreligious movement, looks back at Old Testament prophecy and the writings of the black nationalist Marcus Garvey as proof that the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie (who at birth was named Ras Tafari and who died in 1975) was God in human form. Rastafarians espouse a return to Africa and the redemption of its culture, and Marley remains the movement's greatest musical diplomat. He vividly articulated the asphyxia of poverty and the desire of the poor to escape it, translating the tenets of Rastafarian culture into universal truths. He also sold records.
To the American audience, no other reggae artist took Marley's place after his death. But the commercial success in the early 1980's of American gangsta rap and the reggae-rapper Yellowman, whose audacious rhymes came laced with sexual references, helped change reggae's direction. It became unabashedly market-oriented, a crude but exhilarating celebration of guns and girls set against the rat-a-tat of hip-hop-flavored drum machines. Yet for all the marketing strategies, this style failed to capture the broad American audience.
Marley's record sales, however, continued to soar, and many of his peers from the 70's, like Burning Spear and Sugar Minott, stuck to what they knew -- roots, rock and reggae. While marketing concerns were a factor in prompting reggae's switch from themes of resistance to braggadacio and back again, other influences were also at work. Eighties dance hall was reggae's answer to the self-indulgence of America's Me Decade. Today, the return of reggae's social and political identity is in part a reaction to the escalation of tribal warfare in Africa and elsewhere, along with worsening economic conditions for poor Jamaicans.
Tony Rebel and Beres Hammond were among the first to demonstrate that Rastafarian-influenced lyrics could again yield reggae hits worldwide. The mystical yet militant singer Garnet Silk drew a huge and devoted following, then died in a fire in 1994. To the reggae world, his death felt too much like Marley's, an untimely loss of a singing prophet. Into the vacuum created by those losses rushed a generation of young artists eager to take up reggae's vision of social and spiritual transformation.
NOT ALL OF TODAY'S Jamaican artists have returned to reggae's roots. Like any music, reggae expresses a range of emotions. Just as dance-hall reggae's witty vulgarity sometimes degenerated into lewdness, culturally concerned reggae can stiffen into pretentiousness. And some artists just want to make music. Two recent American pop hits by Jamaicans, Shaggy's "Boombastic" and Diana King's "Shy Guy," rely on hoary rhythm-and-blues staples: darkened bedrooms and romantic yearnings.
Marley remains reggae's most sophisticated -- and best-selling -- musician. But his continuing popularity with the mainstream American audience largely rests on its idealized yearning for interracial harmony. Hard-core reggae fans still favor the searing political indictments that infused much of his music. Recently, when the singers Luciano and Beenie Man released a new single, they did not remake Marley's call for brotherhood, "One Love." Instead, they rerecorded "Crazy Baldhead," his attack on the inequities of the class structure.
Of today's reggae singers, only Buju Banton approaches Marley's genius for reconciling political, romantic and spiritual elements in his music. The homophobia of "Boom Bye Bye," which was recorded in 1988 when Mr. Banton was 15, drew an angry response in the United States when it was released in 1992 as part of a compilation. But "Voice of Jamaica," his socially conscious 1993 album, suggested a new maturity and reflected reggae's shift in focus. His 1995 album, "Till Shiloh," is more spiritually grounded. He wrote and recorded the album during a period when he was listening intently to Marley's music; on the album, Mr. Banton's chantlike singing embodies a rough, muscular ideal that Marley often spoke of.
Luciano, another of Marley's spiritual descendants, is also making inroads with American fans with his 1995 debut album, "Where There Is Life." Unlike Mr. Banton, Luciano does not sing about romantic love; instead he speaks of moral chastisement and spiritual uplift. In live performance, he sounds like a Rastafarian gospel singer, using his remarkable baritone to whip concertgoers into a euphoric state.
"Who feels it knows it," Marley sang. Whether reggae's latest generation of artists will be as commercially successful as Marley is uncertain. What does seem certain is that in a world divided by class and race, there will continue to be an audience for reggae's dream of democracy.

HEADLINE: Down Payment Hurdle Is Getting Lower

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
A FEW months ago, Todd and Melissa Greenberg, who had moved to New York City from the Midwest, started looking for a house in Westchester County. The Greenbergs, both of whom work in the health-care industry, knew they earned enough to buy a house but were concerned about getting a mortgage without a substantial down payment.
"We were caught up in the New York City catch-22," said Mr. Greenberg, 31. "The one where you pay so much for rent that you can't save enough money for a down payment so that you can stop paying so much for rent." 
 But then they began talking to mortgage brokers. "I was astonished," Ms. Greenberg said. "There are all kinds of programs out there. You can put 5 percent down, you can put 7 percent down, you can do it this way, you can do it that way. I had no idea there were so many choices."
The Greenbergs are representative of many first-time homebuyers -- young people at the beginning of their careers who, despite good incomes, have not been able to save the traditional 20 percent down payment for a house. But what they did not know was that the traditional 20-percent-down mortgage may no longer be the mortgage of choice.
It has become increasingly common for buyers -- particularly first-time buyers -- to finance 90 percent, 95 percent or even 100 percent of their purchase. And while low-down-payment mortgages are often associated with lower-income purchasers looking for low-cost homes in urban areas, such mortgages are also being used by moderate-income purchasers financing their first home in suburbia. "It has become too difficult for most first-time buyers to save the money needed for a down payment," said Oded Ben-Ami, regional manager of Sterling National Mortgage, a mortgage broker based in Great Neck, L.I. By making low-down-payment mortgages more available to borrowers, he said, the lenders are merely adjusting to the conditions of the marketplace.
The Greenbergs found a two-bedroom condominium in the low two hundreds. The mortgage was affordable, but they didn't have the $40,000 that would be required for a traditional 20 percent down payment. And since the couple wanted to use the condominium as a stepping stone into a larger house in a few years, Mr. Ben-Ami, their mortgage broker, suggested that they apply for an adjustable-rate mortgage with a low-percentage down payment.
The mortgage they applied for, he said, requires a 5 percent down payment, will carry a lower-than-market introductory interest rate for the first seven years and will then adjust yearly thereafter. By that time, though, the Greenbergs hope they will have already moved on to their next house.
Mr. Ben-Ami said there were programs available that require as little as 3 percent down. "And even with that," he said, "there are ways to achieve effectively zero percent down." For example, he said, eager sellers can assist cash-poor buyers by contributing to the closing costs.
A recent survey by Chicago Title and Trust Company, a Chicago-based title insurance company, found that the average down payment made by first-time homebuyers has been getting lower in recent years. In 1976, for example, the average down payment for a first-time buyer was 18 percent. Last year, the average was around 13 percent. Moreover, the study revealed, in 1995 nearly 45 percent of all homebuyers put less than 10 percent down on their homes.
"And most of them are first-time buyers," said John Pfister, vice president in charge of marketing research for the company.
Residential mortgages are generally described either as conventional or insured mortgages. A conventional mortgage would typically be one in which the lender requires a 20 percent down payment to insure adequate equity in the mortgaged property in the event of a default.
An insured mortgage, on the other hand, is one in which the equity in the property is less than 20 percent. To achieve the same level of protection as there would be with a conventional mortgage, the lender requires the borrower to purchase "private mortgage insurance" to insure the difference between the actual down payment and the 20 percent typically required for lenders to feel comfortable.
Ellen Schweppe, executive director of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, a trade association in Washington, said that while rates may vary, the monthly private-mortgage-insurance premium for a borrower buying a $200,000 house with 10 percent down and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would be about $75. With five percent down the monthly premium would be about $120.
But since mortgage insurance is required only when the borrower's equity is less than 20 percent, Ms. Schweppe said, the monthly premium is not necessarily permanent. It is possible for buyers to eliminate the necessity for mortgage insurance once the equity in their home reaches 20 percent. That can happen either through appreciation of the value of the property or by the borrower paying down the balance on the loan over the years.
The most familiar "low-down-payment" programs have been those sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration). The F.H.A. program targeted low- to middle-income buyers, while the latter was available only to veterans; both were backed by the "full faith and credit" of the United States.
The application and approval processes for F.H.A. and V.A. loans, however, were often considered difficult and time-consuming, causing sellers to balk at a mortgage contingency clause that specified such a loan. As a result, the conventional-mortgage process has often been considered easier and more streamlined than government programs.
THAT has changed in the last few years, however, as secondary-market investors such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as Fannie Mae -- which package blocks of loans and sell them to private investors -- have made it easier for mortgage lenders to market low-down-payment loans.
Fannie Mae's Community Home Buyer's Program, introduced in 1990, makes it possible for buyers to obtain 95 percent financing up to a total of $207,000 for single-family homes. In 1994, Fannie Mae introduced Fannie 97 -- a 3-percent-down-payment program for home buyers with good income and credit history who have been unable to save for a down payment. Under both programs, qualified buyers in the New York region who have total household incomes of $70,950 or less are eligible.
"Buying a house should not be like climbing Mount Everest," said Julie Gould, Fannie Mae's vice president for community lending.
In addition to the low down payment, Ms. Gould said, both programs offer relaxed requirements on the ratio of incomes to mortgage payments. Under normal Fannie Mae guidelines, a borrower's monthly mortgage payment -- which includes principal, interest, real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance -- cannot exceed 28 percent of total household monthly income.
"With the Community Home Buyer's Program you can stretch the income ratio to 33 percent," Ms. Gould said, explaining that regardless of which program is used, the interest rates are the same as they would be for a conventional mortgage.
Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage-research and publishing company in Butler, N.J., said that Fannie Mae's active participation in the low-down-payment mortgage market has made it not only easier to buy a house with as little cash as possible, but smarter, too.
"The benefits of putting down as much as possible have disappeared," Mr. Gumbinger said. "People who have saved $15,000 or $20,000 are now saying, 'Why should I tie everything up in a house when I can take my cash and invest it on my own?' "
In fact, that is what Evan and Tracey Levy said when they started looking for their first house.
"We knew we wouldn't need to put 20 percent down," said Mr. Levy, a newly practicing lawyer who was moving to Greenburgh, N.Y., from Albany. "It's important for new home buyers to make sure they're not house poor. So we decided to put just 10 percent down and have money left over to buy something to sit on."
Mr. Levy, whose wife is also a lawyer, was able to persuade his lender to not only allow a 10 percent down payment on the $287,000 house they liked, but to do so without requiring private mortgage insurance.
"I told them I would pay a higher interest rate if they would eliminate the requirement for P.M.I.," Mr. Levy said, using the abbreviation for private mortgage insurance. The one-quarter of a percentage point increase in the mortgage rate he agreed to pay, he said, increased his monthly payment by roughly the same amount as the mortgage insurance payment would have.
"What we accomplished was to take the P.M.I. and make it tax deductible," he said, explaining that while private mortgage insurance payments are not deductible, mortgage interest payments are.
Another concession Mr. Levy received from his lender was the right to make his own real estate tax and insurance payments -- thereby eliminating the requirement for expensive escrows at closing.
"The bank was very flexible," he said. Their mortgage was issued under a program that the bank, Chase Manhattan, has designed specifically for borrowers, such as lawyers, who are in the early stages of what are traditionally lucrative careers.
The Levys' real estate agent, Laurie Bell, principal broker for Balch Real Estate, a buyer's broker in Mamaroneck, N.Y., said that while buyers were becoming more knowledgeable and savvy about mortgage financing, sellers were still somewhat skittish about buyers who are applying for low-down-payment mortgages.
"Some of these buyers may be earning in six figures," Ms. Bell said. "But unfortunately, many sellers are still of the mindset that if the buyer is putting down less than 20 percent, it's a risky deal."
ONE solution to that problem is to do what Mr. Levy did.
"I shopped for my mortgage first," he said. "That way, when I walked into a house, I could tell the seller I already had the cash in my pocket."
Grant Mydland, president of the American Homeowner's Association, a Washington-based consumer organization, said that another source of low-down-payment mortgages is the programs offered to residents by many states. For example, the State of New York State Mortgage Agency (commonly known as Sonyma), the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency offer low-interest, low down-payment loans on new construction to first-time buyers.
Such state-sponsored programs often carry limits on how much borrowers may earn to be eligible for a mortgage. In many cases, such limits are based on the average income in a particular area. For example, the maximum allowable income for Sonyma's Construction Incentive Program -- which provides low-interest, no-down-payment mortgages for the purchase of newly constructed homes -- ranges from $44,100 for a two-person family in all of New York City to as high as $91,560 for households of three or more in parts of Westchester County. The maximum allowable purchase price also varies, from $138,900 in upstate areas to $203,800 in New York City and Westchester. Under the program, the higher income limits and purchase prices are allowed in certain "target areas" -- Federally designated economically depressed areas.
Some private lenders have gone beyond even 97 percent mortgages -- allowing borrowers to finance 100 percent of their home -- without having to pay private mortgage insurance premiums.
Merrill Lynch, for example, offers a program called Mortgage 100 in which qualified home buyers can mortgage the entire purchase price of their house by transferring securities to a Merrill Lynch account and then agreeing to maintain the account at certain levels.
And for those who aren't so fortunate but whose parents are, the company offers Parent Power -- a 100 percent mortgage program that allows parents to provide help to their children in purchasing a first home without actually parting with any cash.
Hal Minot, senior vice president of marketing and business development for Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation in Jacksonville, Fla., said that under the Parent Power program a parent or close relative can pledge securities transferred to a Merrill Lynch account as a guarantee of a mortgage. Under both programs, in which Merrill Lynch issues the mortgages, the owner of the securities retains the right to trade them. The only caveat, he said, is that the market value of the securities at the time the mortgage is made must be at least 39 percent of the mortgage amount. If the value of the securities drops below 33 percent anytime thereafter, and the account is not replenished, the securities can be sold by Merrill Lynch and held as cash collateral.
"It's not the house that's a person's largest purchase, it's the mortgage," Mr. Minot said. "We believe that managing what you owe is as important as managing what you own."
Additional information on low-down-payment programs -- including state-sponsored programs -- can be obtained by calling Fannie Mae (800) 732-6643; the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (609) 278-7400; the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (203) 721-9501; the State of New York Mortgage Agency (800) 382-4663; HSH Associates (800) 873-2837; and the American Homeowner's Association (703) 892-4663.

The Election Shows Russia Is Russian

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
DURING the interval between the two rounds of the Russian presidential election, a somewhat morose Grigory Yavlinsky -- the reform leader who came in a weak fourth in the voting -- posed a question to an American correspondent he ran into at a party.
 "Tell me something," he asked nervously. "Have there ever been any politicians in the United States who were humiliated at some point in their careers but then came back to win the presidency?" 

 "All of them," the reporter replied, only slightly in jest. "It's a requirement."
 Mr. Yavlinsky pondered the response for a moment and then a huge smile spread across his face. "All right then," the 44-year-old economist said cheerfully, clinking glasses with everyone around him. "Not that this is America, of course."
 No, of course not. But for the last six months, as presidential candidates crisscrossed the nation, delivered speeches as they unspooled from teleprompters, held conventions and sought the support of bankers, advertisers and the press, a casual observer could be excused for confusing the Russian campaign with an American one. On campaign trips -- before President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Communist rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, simply quit taking them -- both major candidates even provided rickety old buses for the weary pack of reporters that followed them around.
 Americans tend to assume that anything even vaguely recognizable to them is essentially American. And the election that ended last week with Mr. Yeltsin's convincing victory over Mr. Zyuganov -- replete with its campaign posters, party hats and slick advertisements -- seemed on the surface about as American as they come. But the surface doesn't get you very far in Russia.
 Sophisticated the candidates' electoral tactics were not. Nobody here had any industrial heartland or Far Eastern strategy. Neither candidate even bothered to visit Vladivostok, the booming capital of Russia's Pacific coast. There was no gender gap, no female strategy, no attempt to wrest the silent majority from one camp to the next. Yes, Mr. Yeltsin sent direct mail to most of the nation's veterans, but he never even tried to work the farm districts, where he was weak, and Mr. Zyuganov mostly gave speeches to his supporters in places Mr. Yeltsin did not consider worth a visit.
 The truth is that Russia seems to have stumbled onto its own new style of democratic politics. Mixing three parts Kremlin intrigue and one part American-style electioneering, leaders here seem to be developing a whole new set of rules. In the United States, when one party wins and the other loses it is pretty easy to guess how the future relationship between the two will work. Although the situation is different in Europe, the parliamentary democracies there too follow a standard set of rules.
 
 
 
New Machinations

 
 Nothing is standard in Russia, though. Here people are talking about reconciliation while scheming behind each other's backs. It is not yet known whether the Communists will become a disruptive opposition force or a manageable part of the Government. It is not even known whether they will survive as a party. The Kremlin itself is already roiling anew with intrigue, fueled in part by questions over whether Mr. Yeltsin is healthy enough to serve out his new four-year term. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin stands solidly at odds with Mr. Yeltsin's brand new savior, Aleksandr I. Lebed, who was appointed security chief after placing third in the first round of voting last month.
 The American analogy, used often these days, never really worked, not even on the stump. Mr. Yeltsin campaigned because he needed to prove that he could. His appearances were almost a matter of physical display, an attempt to assure the public that he was both alive and solicitous of their attention. It is not even clear that most voters believed him when he promised them more money, peace in Chechnya, less regulation and a lighter tax burden. When he famously danced on stage at a rock 'n' roll rally in the Urals, he might not have won any points for style, but he did give at least a good imitation of a vivid presence.
 
 
 
'I Am Not a Communist'

 
 And at least Mr. Yeltsin had a message. "It was not that complicated," said Sarah Mendelson, an assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York in Albany, who has worked here to help develop democratic institutions. "He kept saying, I am not a Communist and Communism is worse than I am. I wouldn't say it was exactly an American campaign theme, but the bottom line is that it looked a lot more like normal politics than anything that has happened here before."
 Mr. Zyuganov might have played to the insecurities of millions of people who, as it turned out, did not vote for him, but he made an early decision to preach to the converted rather than reach out to the many who oppose Communism but hate the state of Russia today. Had he campaigned American style, which involves listening to what the voters have to say, he might have become President. For both men, the people were a dim roar in the distance, and their attitude helps explain why most voters interviewed in exit polls said they disapproved of democracy as practiced here.
 The Yeltsin campaign had some backstage help from American campaign advisers who have managed to promote themselves as major reasons he won re-election. Nothing could be further from the truth, though, and their advice was usually either self-evident or irrelevant, the President's aides said repeatedly.
 "I am not a connoisseur of the techniques that are used in the West to prepare and conduct elections," said Viktor Ilyushin, a senior aide to Mr. Yeltsin, speaking after the votes were in. "But the first meetings that I had with some specialists told me that it was unlikely we could get many useful tips from our foreign colleagues. Because this is Russia. This is not Germany, not the United States, not Italy. Here we have the Russian people, Russian traditions, Russian habits and a Russian president. Elections in Russia will always take place in the Russian way."
 Mr. Yeltsin benefited from a distinctly Russian sense of propriety and from mainly compliant (in some cases bribed) Russian media. While American journalists examined his every appearance and non-appearance for clues of ill health, for example, the boosterish Russian TV networks and newspapers gave the story short shrift.
 Many Russians also find the Western interest in Mr. Yeltsin's drinking to be bordering on the obsessive. On the stump, Mr. Zyuganov would invariably crack that he drank "more than Mikhail Gorbachev and less than Boris Yeltsin." That might have been an impolitic remark in an American campaign, but if the results last week are any indication, Russians couldn't have cared less.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Said to Raise Vote Hurdles for Ex-Rebels

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
Nearly 300,000 Nicaraguan peasants rode on mules, trudged down mountain trails and forded rivers in recent weeks to register to vote.
They were farmers from Nicaragua's most inhospitable regions, signing up to cast ballots in the presidential election scheduled for Oct. 20 even though many found the registration drive so confusing that they suspected it was intended to discourage them. 
 The special campaign, conducted over two weekends recently, covered 26 counties along the country's mountainous spine. Election officials said the counties were too hard to reach or too troubled by bandits to permit the longer registration period scheduled in the rest of the country.
When the leftist Sandinistas were in power in the 1980's, the same counties were strongholds of the contra guerrillas who fought against them. The region is still home to thousands of demobilized contras, who are suspicious of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro because, they say, her Government is still influenced by the Sandinistas.
Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republicans and chairmen of the foreign affairs committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, echoed the former contras' fears in a recent letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher: they charged that election officials had set up the registration to "disenfranchise and relegate to second-class citizenship" thousands of the former rebels.
Some former contras kidnapped an American working for the United States Agency for International Development to dramatize their demands for more accessible registration. The American, Cynthia Gerzony, 41, an election specialist from New York City, was seized on May 31 and released unharmed two days later.
Despite the problems, people registered in record numbers. Election authorities said nearly 300,000 people registered in the 26 counties, about 85 percent of the adult population.
If the election runs smoothly, it will be the first transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another in the country's history, and also the close of a chapter in the United States' role in Nicaragua. After backing the contras' war, Washington spent $900 million in six years to help consolidate Mrs. Chamorro's Government, and now would like to direct its foreign aid elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Report Says Global Warming Poses Threat to Public Health

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
As international negotiations on global warming resume, United Nations health and environmental agencies are warning of serious threats to public health if actions to reduce climate change come too slowly.
In a report to be issued during the talks that resume in Geneva on Monday, scientists from United Nations agencies warn that warming due to air pollution "could have a wide range of impacts on human health, most of which would be adverse." 
 Major cities could see thousands of additional deaths each year during heat waves, and tens of millions of people could face the risk of malaria in parts of the world where the disease does not now occur, to cite but two examples from the report.
Concerns about the possible health consequences of global warming have become increasingly widespread among those scientists who believe that the earth's climate will change rapidly in the coming century as pollution in the atmosphere traps solar radiation -- the so-called greenhouse effect.
The 262-page report is one of the most thorough examinations of the issue to date, but it concedes that the predictions are fraught with uncertainty and that much more research needs to be done. At the same time, it warns negotiators against taking a "wait-and-see" approach, since the possible consequences of inaction are so dire.
How fast to act on global warming is the focus of the latest round of negotiations over what to do about global climate change.
Industrial nations are already falling short of their initial goals, which they established in a 1992 treaty, for controlling pollution from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Major industries in some countries, including the United States, are urging their governments to take a go-slow approach to the problem, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood.
Eileen Claussen, the Assistant Secretary of State for Environmental Affairs and a top American negotiator at the latest round of talks on carrying out the climate treaty, called the United Nations' report on health problems "another indication that this is an issue that has to be taken seriously -- and we intend to do just that."
In the treaty, which has been ratified by 159 nations, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce and stabilize their emissions of greenhouse gases by the year 2000 at the levels that prevailed in 1990. But almost none of them will meet that target, which, according to the current scientific consensus, would not be enough anyway to head off global warming.
In the United States, for example, where the Clinton Administration adopted a largely voluntary program of measures to reduce the pollution, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise every year since the treaty was written in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
The Clinton Administration is expected to call for tougher steps to control pollution, but it is not expected to propose specific new measures to reverse the trend until after the November election. Other nations are calling for steps ranging from increased taxes on energy to global standards for fuel efficiency.
In a report issued in London last Thursday, the World Energy Council, an independent research group, said that carbon dioxide emissions, largely from burning of fossil fuels, rose 12 percent between 1990 and 1995, and said that immediate action was required to reverse the trend.
But representatives of major energy-producing and consuming industries, like John Schlaes of the Global Climate Coalition, say there is no rush and that steps to control emissions before further research is conducted would cause grave economic harm. "The time for decision is not yet now," he said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday.
The new report on the health risks posed by global warming, being issued by the World Health Organization, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, comes down squarely on the side of those who are calling for early action, despite the uncertainties that permeate the scientific studies it cites. A copy of the report was provided an American government official who deals with environmental issues.
"If adverse population health impacts are likely to result from climate change, we do not have the usual option of seeking definitive empirical evidence before acting," the study says. "A wait-and-see approach would be imprudent at best and nonsensical at worst."
The report concedes that rapid worldwide reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases "may not be politically achievable." It says that paying more attention to health risks might help galvanize public opinion for taking quicker action.
Some of the research cited in the report, including a study on the dangers of heat waves, was conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
It has long been recognized that heat waves kill people, both by the direct effects of heat and by intensifying chemical reactions that form hazardous smog.
E.P.A. researchers studied data from China, Egypt, Canada and the United States.
Many cities could have thousands of extra deaths annually, the researchers said.
Last July, a heat wave killed 465 people in Chicago alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
In New York, where heat-related deaths now average 320 per year, the study predicted that three to six times that many might die annualy by 2050, depending on which climate-change scenario was examined. Even if people naturally became acclimatized to hotter weather, the figures could increase two- or threefold, the study suggested.
The spread of infectious diseases could occur even sooner -- indeed, there is some research to suggest that it has already begun as a result of recent warming, the report said.
Within five years, the warming of the climate could increase substantially the proportion of the world's population living in potential malaria zones, according to the report, and several other diseases spread by insects or other pests might also become more widespread.
The report concedes that measures to adapt to a warmer climate -- developing a vaccine against malaria, for example, or teaching the elderly to drink fluids and mineral supplements during heat waves -- could help stave off illness. But it says these ideas are of limited value, especially in poorer countries, and that in light of these shortcomings governments should focus on the preventive option: reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in the first place.

HEADLINE: Journalist as Broker in Mixed Marriage Next Week of Microsoft and NBC News

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
Today, Merrill Brown may be stepping around paint cans and sawhorses in the MSNBC studios still under construction in Fort Lee, N.J., dressed in the white shirt, rep tie and conservative suit of a network television executive.
Tomorrow he may be strolling the leafy campus of Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., in a T-shirt and jeans. 
 Mr. Brown -- for whom New York-to-Seattle has become a shuttle flight -- is the chief journalist in charge of MSNBC Interactive, the Internet side of the ambitious new joint venture between NBC News, a unit of the General Electric Company, and the Microsoft Corporation. The venture will go on screen -- TV and computer -- a week from today.
In either uniform, Mr. Brown has been working seven days a week to forge connections between Microsoft's technology wizards and NBC's news hounds, between MSNBC on the Internet, based in Redmond, and MSNBC Cable, based in New Jersey. Since his employers have staked $200 million each over the next five years on this unconventional marriage, helping the two corporate families learn to get along is no trivial task.
And the family cultures can be quite different. "They love E-mail at Microsoft," said David Corvo, an NBC News vice president in New York. "We're reporters. We use telephones all the time. We've had to learn more E-mail; they've had to learn more telephone."
Earlier this year, NBC visitors to the Microsoft Network's newsroom, where news was pulled from wire services for MSN's on-line service, were struck by an almost total absence of television sets. Yet Microsoft visitors to NBC News in Manhattan found computers being used almost exclusively as word processors.
"We talk about customers; they talk about viewers," a Microsoft executive said.
"They talk about content; we talk about journalism," Mr. Corvo said. "It's important to make sure we mean the same thing."
That is a major responsibility for Mr. Brown, a veteran journalist with newspaper, magazine and cable network experience, who also has extensive computer credentials.
"Part of Merrill's charge," said Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, "is to raise the bar for the people working on the on-line side so that their skills and experience and journalistic sensibilities match those on the NBC side."
Mr. Brown's counterpart heading MSNBC Cable is Mark Harrington, formerly in charge of new media at CBS News, whom Mr. Lack hired as soon as the deal with Microsoft was sealed. He, too, has been concerned about hiring qualified journalists, even as he tries also to hire those with top-flight computer skills.
"Some of the younger people who aren't steeped in journalism may sometimes get cockamamie ideas about it," Mr. Brown said. "We're working on being very careful about what we put out, and not abusing the fact that we can gather tons of information on the Internet, some of which may have limited value."
An example, he said, was polling data that crops up all over the Internet, and may look intriguing but turn out to be flawed. Still, he said, the cultures over all can be melded.
"Superficially, of course, they are very different cultures," Mr. Brown said of Microsoft and NBC. "But fundamentally, it's a media-news-information culture we're dealing with. For the interactive side, we've hired people from CBS News, from U.S. News & World Report, from Time, and from the Far Eastern Economic Review."
Similarly, Mr. Harrington has hired people from print journalism as well as television for MSNBC Cable. The 24-hour news and talk channel will use NBC reporters, as well as some special contributors, and in prime time will have news and interview shows using some of NBC's best-known journalists -- Tom Brokaw, Bill Moyers, Jane Pauley, Brian Williams, Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel and Bob Costas, among them.
Together, the two enterprises have hired about 400 people. On June 3 in Fort Lee, about 300 people all reported for work for the first time, in a broad, sunny newsroom where each desk has a Hewlett-Packard computer and tiny RCA television set on top.
"It's a tremendous population explosion within NBC, no question," Mr. Lack said. "And I'll tell you candidly, I've been disappointed in my search within electronic journalism for enough capable colleagues to meet the challenge. I've increasingly turned to reporters who have come through the kind of training you get at a major newspaper. "
The majority of newcomers are young, in part because they can be paid lower salaries and in part because younger people tend to have more computer knowledge.
"But the primary criteria," Mr. Harrington said, "were journalistic skills and interests, and the ability to work together. These are people who want to do news -- not entertainment programs, not sports, not talk shows, not television in general, but news."
All new staff members are employees of NBC News, not MSNBC specifically. "This is NBC News on cable, not some parallel universe," Mr. Corvo said.
To those who scoff, saying that the real NBC News producers and correspondents will not stay involved long, Mr. Lack, Mr. Corvo and others point to some fairly major moves.
For one thing, some big-name producers have moved to MSNBC Cable full time. For another, almost the entire assignment operation for NBC News is being moved to New Jersey. David Verdi, the man who knows where all NBC correspondents and crews around the world are at any given time, will be based there. So will one of the two top foreign editors, a national editor and editors for MSNBC Cable, MSNBC Internet and CNBC, the NBC-owned cable business-news channel.
"With computers and all, it doesn't really matter if the assignment desk is on Mars," Mr. Corvo said, "But it's an amazing commitment psychologically."
MSNBC will start with 22.5 million subscribers, having been converted from America's Talking, a cable channel owned by NBC. CNN, a unit of Turner Broadcasting and the largest cable channel in the country, has more than triple that number, reaching 68.5 million households.
MSNBC's daytime executive producer, Bob Epstein, said the hope is to create something so different from CNN that viewers will have a clear choice. "We'll pick the best three, four, five stories a day and focus on them," said Mr. Epstein, who also came from CBS News. "Not the rat-a-tat-tat of CNN or Headline News, which is fine for what they do, and which some people want."
And MSNBC Internet will take that focus further.
"I thought I'd have to do a lot of evangelization," said Peter Neupert, Microsoft's vice president in charge of MSNBC Internet. "But every executive producer and senior producer there who is designing programming is experimenting with, and toying with, and has, front of mind, how they can use the Internet in creating great television. That has really surprised me."

HEADLINE: In America;
Can We Talk?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The founders of a new national organization, called the Campaign for America's Future, are asking the question, "What kind of society do we want to have in the 21st century, and what will it take to build it?"
America's postwar economic engine is sputtering. Wages for high school graduates (most Americans do not have college degrees) have been declining for more than 20 years. Wages for college graduates have been disappointing for a decade. And despite the modest economic expansion during the Clinton Administration, the median wage for U.S. workers fell 3.3 percent from 1992 to 1994. 
 On Friday, a kernel of good news on the employment front caused a panic on Wall Street. The consensus: The Fed will have to raise interest rates to insure that any improvements in wages and employment do not get out of hand.
Working people have been told for the better part of two decades that the way out of their economic morass was to cut taxes, especially for the wealthy, reduce to an absolute minimum the levels of corporate responsibility and accountability, beat up on the Federal Government (except for the military establishment) and reverse our decades-long commitment to humane treatment of the elderly, the sick and the poor.
"We've been there, done that, and it's not working," said Roger Hickey, who will be the co-director, with Robert Borosage, of the new organization.
"Our goal," Mr. Hickey said, "is to make politics focus on the economic conditions of working people."
The Campaign for America's Future will be officially launched at a press conference on July 17. The organization will be composed of progressive thinkers and activists seeking to counter the debilitating and divisive policies of the right.
"I think the bankruptcy of the conservative agenda is quite apparent," said Mr. Borosage. He noted that a small percentage of Americans live lives of unimaginable luxury, while one of every four children is born into poverty, and more and more working families find themselves falling further and further behind in the chase for an ever more elusive American dream.
"In the end," said Mr. Borosage, "they've got Bob Dole running for President on the same agenda they have been arguing for decades. The same agenda that got us into the fix we're in."
Which is not to say that the Clinton agenda has been so great. Bill Clinton has performed the startling (and confusing) feat of masquerading as a Republican while at the same time offering as his main re-election theme the fact that he is "not Newt." The voters, while not wild about Bill, seem to have moved in his direction primarily because he is not Dole.
Whatever emerges from this muddle, it will not be a compelling vision of America in the 21st century.
The Campaign for America's Future has set its sights somewhat higher. It hopes to spark a serious "four-year national debate" aimed at increasing economic opportunities and reigniting the can-do spirit and sense of optimism that have been dimmed by the steady erosion of living standards for so many.
There is a hunger for such a debate that has long remained unsatisfied. Each election seems a bigger farce than the last. And behind the scenes in both parties big money calls the tune.
Mr. Hickey and Mr. Borosage believe it is possible to frame a national debate in a way that does not pit races and ethnic groups against one another, that does not pit the middle class against the poor, and that recognizes that the long-term health of the U.S. is intimately tied to what is good for the broadest spectrum of working people.
In a draft of a position paper that is to be released on the 17th, Mr. Hickey and Mr. Borosage wrote: "The measure of the economy is whether it works for working people. It is not sufficient for the wealthy to prosper, speculators to strike it rich, corporations to profit, if working people are not sharing fully in the rewards produced by their labor and productivity."
That once seemed so clear and fundamental. A point of national pride.

 BODY:
The dessert of choice here is the beignet, a vaguely triangular French doughnut. It has no hole. The city's professional football team, the Saints, wears helmets decorated with the fleur-de-lis.
The oldest neighborhood is called the Vieux Carre, but the Spanish built most of the historic structures that survived the centuries. On some streets, the tiny frame homes of later centuries are distinctly Haitian. 
 There is a Congo Square, so named because slaves once gathered there to drum and dance, and an Irish Channel, where white immigrant laborers went home after swinging picks in the canals.
For years, a typical lunch has been the Muffaletta sandwich, made with Italian olive salad. Lately, for dinner it has become fashionable to drive over to New Orleans East for cold spring rolls and iced Vietnamese coffee.
New Orleans has always been one of the least American of American cities, and its citizens have always taken pride in that difference.
So why are so many people here so happy that it was recently awarded the title of All-America City?
"Morale," explained Mayor Marc Morial, halfway through his first term of governing a city that had been plagued with bad news. In New Orleans, the Mayor said, "it is validation" that the city and its people are making progress in making it a safer, better place.
The award was created by the National Civic League 47 years ago. It is not intended to honor cities that are pristine and perfect in their scenery or livability. Instead, it goes to cities that are working to make imperfect cities better, through a broad partnership of private citizens, city programs, churches and civic groups. Cleveland, for instance, has won it.
When it was announced earlier last month in Fort Worth, that New Orleans had not only won the award but was also at the very top of the list of 10 winning cities, citizens of New Orleans actually stormed the stage. The next day in New Orleans, it was front-page news.
New Orleans had been hungry for some good news.
For the last few years, much of the national attention this "City That Care Forgot" received was less than positive. At times, it boggled the mind.
As its murder rate climbed to the top of the nation's charts, its police officers were being snared in F.B.I. stings, caught guarding warehouses for drug dealers and even found contributing to the city's murder rate. One officer contracted to have a young woman killed; another killed her own partner and two young Vietnamese immigrants in a restaurant robbery.
Crime soared. A Catholic priest was shot dead. A young man was killed just outside the door of a popular downtown restaurant. Toddlers died from stray bullets.
Beyond the huge crime headlines, the city suffered from high unemployment. Its major casino shut its doors just before Christmas.
Its gambling industry is still in trouble and its police department still has a long way to go to gain credibility with citizens, critics say. But the city seems to be turning the corner on some problems.
The city's murder rate in the first half of 1996 declined 22 percent from the first six months of 1995. In 1994, New Orleans led the nation.
In New Orleans, being in the top five cities in killings per capita -- as opposed to being No. 1 -- is reason to celebrate. Mr. Morial says one reason for the decline is community policing, as the department placed officers and sub-stations in the housing projects that have been the most deadly.
Mr. Morial said the city raised beginning salaries for its officers to $24,000 from $16,000, hoping to attract better candidates.
As bad as things seemed, tourism, the lifeblood of the city's economy, never faltered. Signs at the city limits that proclaimed New Orleans America's most unique or interesting city were by and large true. The tourists read about the violence and poverty but were rarely touched by it. But the people who lived here demanded change.
Many of them helped force it. Because the Police Department was beyond their control in many ways, several churches and civic organizations concentrated on the quality of life.
It was that effort that won the All-America City Award, said people who worked for the award.
"People got together and changed things that needed changing," said Kim Sport, one of the people who led the push for the award.
New Orleans took the award, at least primarily, because of three different projects: the Community Resource Partnership, a community revitalization program that is rebuilding the lower Garden District, a racially and economically diverse corner of the city that had decayed; the New Orleans Jobs Initiative, a jobs training program for disadvantaged people aged 18 to 35, and the School-to-Work Initiative, a holistic program designed to reduce the dropout rate and prepare students for the working world.
New Orleans entered the contest as a region, and included programs in its application from outside the city limits. Other cities and areas winning the award were Greater Buffalo; Westminster, Calif.; Hays, Kan.; Holland, Mich.; Hartsville, S.C.; Quincy, Fla.; McAllen, Tex.; Roanoke, Va., and Fosston, Minn.
But New Orleans, an All-America City? While the flavor of the place may be more European or more Caribbean, Mr. Morial said, in problem-solving, New Orleans is proving, "we are very American."

HEADLINE: Mexican Stocks Off As Wall St. Falters

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 7

 BODY:
Mexican stocks fell sharply Friday, closing at their lowest level since April 11, in sympathy with a drop in the United States stock and bond markets, traders said.
The IPC index of 37 leading stocks lost 68.96 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,105.92. 
 "The market was affected by the fall of the Dow Jones, which itself was influenced by the United States unemployment figures and lower prices on the bond markets," said Felix Boni, an analyst with James Capel in Mexico City.
Of 90 stocks traded, 66 lost, 17 were unchanged and only 7 gained. Volume was moderate at 79.14 million shares.
Dina led the list of losers, falling 10 percent, to 4.50 pesos, on a 28,000-share sale by the Invermexico brokerage firm.
Cemex CPO shares fell 4.85 percent, to 25.50 pesos, after the company, a cement giant, announced it would increase its prices by an average of 17 percent.

HEADLINE: In Hope of Winning Clinton Over, Netanyahu Visits U.S. This Week

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 7

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu leaves on Monday for his first visit to the United States as Prime Minister of Israel, his Government struggling with dissension and his plans for the Middle East peace effort still unclear, yet determined to win over the country where he was raised and educated.
Mr. Netanyahu has made no secret of the importance he places on the trip, his first foreign foray since he was elected on May 29. He is clearly eager to win the approval of the Clinton Administration, which actively opposed him in the election and remains skeptical about his intentions towards the Arabs. 
 The Prime Minister has worked hard to prepare for his trip to the United States, declaring in interviews and meetings that he is dedicated to making peace and streamlining Israel's economy, and insisting that Israeli-American relations are "like a rock."
As the first popularly elected Prime Minister in Israeli history, Mr. Netanyahu, 46, has also tried to give his office a more American style, adding high-level security and economic councils to the Prime Minister's staff and inviting more news coverage of his family life.
Yet on the eve of Mr. Netanyahu's departure, the image that has emerged so far is different from what he evidently intended. His Government remains entangled in disputes over power and money, and it is not even clear whether his coalition will survive in its present configuration.
Despite shifts in formulations and tone, his peace policies remain largely a collection of slogans and hints, and his Government's contacts with the Palestinian Authority have been only through an adviser.
"The mass of interviews do not help in understanding what he is going to do tomorrow, in two months or two years from now," wrote Zvi Barel, a commentator in the daily newspaper Haaretz. "What are the borders of the Palestinian autonomy? What conditions are included when he says there are 'no preconditions' to negotiations?"
Domestically, Mr. Netanyahu's main problem has been trying to find a slot in his Government for Ariel Sharon, a hard-line former general and Defense Minister.
Threatened with an embarrassing defection by Foreign Minister David Levy if Mr. Sharon was excluded from the Cabinet, Mr. Netanyahu decided to borrow pieces from other ministries to form a new Ministry of Infrastructures to offer Mr. Sharon.
But other ministers balked at giving up any powers, and on Friday, Mr. Levy upped the ante by warning that he would leave on the eve of Mr. Netanyahu's trip if Mr. Sharon was not in the Cabinet by then.
Tonight, the Cabinet approved the creation of the new ministry, and a spokesman said Mr. Netanyahu would swear in Mr. Sharon on Monday before leaving for the United States.
Israel Television said the compromise was reached when Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush agreed to give up the public works department, which is in charge of roads. The Infrastructures Ministry will also have authority over oil refineries and pipelines, fuel imports, electricity, railroads, water and sewage.
The compromise came after some bitter wrangling. Over the weekend, Mr. Netanyahu's chief of staff, Avigdor Lieberman, made an unusual public show of irritation at a Likud meeting when he declared, "At every step or appointment, we go through an unprecedented campaign of slander and incitement."
Even Mr. Netanyahu's personal life has not escaped turmoil, with a widely publicized brouhaha that erupted after his wife, Sara, fired a nanny, and the nanny went to the press with a most unflattering picture of Mrs. Netanyahu.
Much of the chaos could be attributed to the normal tumult of Israeli politics, to the change of Government, to Mr. Netanyahu's inexperience in the job and to the novelty of a having a Prime Minister with more powers by virtue of being directly elected. Mr. Netanyahu has maintained a public calm, assuring interviewers that the problems are all part of a normal readjustment.
"Most people, when they watch my activities, see the oscillations and don't see the general direction until they remove to a distance," he said in an interview on Thursday.
"The fact is that in the last two weeks, we've moved quite a distance," he added. "We formed a Government in record time. We managed in record time to pass the budget-cut decision, which I think is very significant. We opened up channels to Arab neighbors and those beyond the immediate circle. We're preparing to go to the United States to reaffirm our relationship. And yes, there are some tail ends of the coalition-making process that we're dealing with, and we will resolve all of them."
In any case, Mr. Netanyahu's trip to the United States is likely to overshadow much of the initial disarray. One reason is the traditional importance that Israelis place on links to America. Another is the emphasis Mr. Netanyahu himself gives to the trip, and a third is the expectation that the Prime Minister will have to declare some concrete intentions in Washington.
With his own re-election campaign under way, President Clinton is not expected to push Mr. Netanyahu hard, but rather to give the impression of patching over differences and searching for common ground.
Still, the Administration is expected to look closely for ways to maintain the momentum of the peace effort that began under Mr. Clinton's patronage with the reconciliation of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel on the White House lawn in 1993.
Mr. Netanyahu has said in interviews that he intends to continue negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, but he has couched this with conditions that leave unclear whether the Palestinians will find any reason to keep talking.
Haaretz has reported that Mr. Netanyahu is expected to say he will agree to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron, but not under the plans drawn up by the previous Government, and without commitment to a timetable.
He has also indicated a readiness in principle to lift restrictions on letting Palestinians work in Israel, and support for international aid to the Palestinian Authority.
Mr. Netanyahu is not expected to give much hope of resumed Israeli negotiations with Syria. Instead, he is expected to bring evidence of extensive Syrian complicity in international terrorism and to seek American assistance in putting pressure on Damascus to end support for terrorists.
He is also expected to tell Mr. Clinton that if Lebanon guarantees Israel's security on its northern border, he might be prepared to strike a separate deal to pull Israeli troops out of south Lebanon.
Mr. Netanyahu's centerpiece on the trip is expected to be economic reform, especially when he meets with potential American investors on Sunday. On the eve of his departure, the Prime Minister wrestled with his Cabinet for ways to slice $1.4 billion from the $32.6 billion budget for 1996, with deep cuts expected in all military and civilian spending and a reduction of the public work force by 8,000 jobs.
Mr. Netanyahu has also spoken of lifting Government economic controls and privatizing many state services.
But he is not expected to offer to relinquish $1.2 billion in civilian aid from the United States, as he proposed while in opposition. In an interview, he said his ultimate aim was to achieve economic independence for Israel, but that it was "too soon to say" when this could happen.

HEADLINE: Consumers Get the Credit for Expanding Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
President Clinton claims the credit for himself, and analysts cite an array of other possible factors, but the most important source of the economy's remarkable resilience and vibrancy this year appears to be the consumer.
For most of this year, Americans have spent prodigiously on homes, cars, refrigerators and dinners out, carrying forward an aging economic expansion that as recently as January seemed in danger of expiring. In the process, they have largely ignored warning signs that they are becoming overextended. 
 The consumer spending spree was a major force in the surprisingly robust economic data released on Friday, economists said. The Labor Department estimated that the economy created 239,000 jobs in June, far more than expected, making that month the fifth consecutive one with strong employment gains. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.3 percent, the lowest in six years, and the economic growth is so rapid that it has revived fears of inflation.
Among the industries showing the biggest gains were retailing, which added 75,000 jobs in June, nearly half of them in what the Government classifies as eating and drinking places. Job growth was also strong at car dealers, gas stations, hotels and stores selling building materials, garden supplies and home furnishings. Employment in construction was up by 23,000, reflecting in part the continued strength of home building.
"Consumer spending is two-thirds of gross domestic product, and consequently without consumer spending supporting it you cannot have substantial economic strength," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "It's a very important part of the picture, and apparently consumers are not ready to stop spending."
Just how long consumers can carry on with their free-spending ways, however, remains an open question and one that is critical to policy makers at the Federal Reserve as they decide whether to raise interest rates to keep the economy from accelerating enough to generate increased inflation.
Some economists believe that consumers have amassed so much debt that they will be forced to rein in their spending for the rest of the year, resulting in a slackening of economic growth. Credit-card delinquencies in the first quarter were at their highest level since 1981, and personal bankruptcies were up 15 percent from the first three months of 1995.
The ratio of total household debt to after-tax personal income is at record levels, said a recent report from the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. The report said a recent survey by the Fed of the willingness of banks to make consumer loans had shown a sharp drop, suggesting that banks were increasingly concerned about the ability of their customers to make loan payments and would clamp down on credit.
Most economists also agree that the surge in spending this year has been driven in large part by temporary factors -- including low interest rates, higher-than-expected tax refunds and rebates from auto makers -- that have been reversed or phased out.
Long-term interest rates have been pushing higher since March, making mortgages and other loans more expensive. Though sales of new homes in May were at the highest level in a decade, housing analysts expect higher interest rates to restrict sales of new and existing homes in coming months, cooling off one of the most important sectors of the economy.
The run-up in interest rates has already ended a boom in mortgage refinancings that swept the country last year. By renegotiating home loans at lower rates, many consumers had benefited from increased disposable income that they spent during the first half of this year on cars and other goods and services.
Tax refunds have long since been sent to most people who are getting them. And after generating strong sales with rebates and special promotions, car makers saw sales level off or decline last month.
"It seems likely that most of the factors that helped accelerate the economy are no longer providing a boost," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York.
One wild card in assessing the course of consumer spending is the stock market, which has been making many relatively affluent consumers feel flush with its continued boom. Economists have grappled for years with the question of the extent to which paper gains on stock market investments lead consumers to spend more, and they still do not agree on an answer. But they said it was relatively clear that the bull market of recent years -- and the fact that more and more Americans invest in the market through retirement plans and mutual funds -- has provided some impetus to consumers to spend more.
"The stunning rise in financial net worth over the last year means that in the aggregate, the growth in consumer credit has not implied any deterioration in household balance sheets, but somewhat more strain on cash flow," Mr. Lipsky said.

HEADLINE: Tourists in Search of the 'Real' New York

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
They whooshed to the summit of the Empire State Building and ogled the city's steel and stone glories. They jostled the bustling gray suits on a blue-chip afternoon on Wall Street. But what most fascinated the Hackl family of Austria on their first visit to New York City were not the must-see sights, but the mundane ones.
There was, for instance, the white steam wafting mysteriously from manholes on Fifth Avenue. The urgently flashing and blithely ignored "Don't Walk" signs. The fat rats supping boldly from a garbage bin in Times Square. 
 It was the Independence Day weekend and the Hackl family had ventured from their motel on 10th Avenue in Manhattan all ready for a Hollywood version of New York. With wallets secreted in the waistbands of their shorts and well-worn sneakers on their feet, they were prepared both for leisurely strolls past notable monuments and hasty sprints past rodents (already sighted) or muggers (expected around every corner).
But on one of the busiest tourist weekends of New York's summer season, in what is expected to be the busiest year for tourism since 1990, the Hackls and other visitors who flocked to the city found unexpected truths in their most ordinary experiences: that New Yorkers can be kind and hospitable; that trees actually grow in Manhattan, and that gun-toting bandits do not terrorize every city street.
"Almost every film about New York shows someone getting killed," said Sabine Hackl, a 21-year-old technology student, who lugged her pocketbook beneath her pink and white polka-dot shirt as she wandered along Fifth Avenue with her parents and older sister. "But that's not true. People are actually helpful here. When we got lost on the subway, a stranger guided us and gave us his map. It's fantastic here."
One of the brightest spots in the region's economy, tourism in New York City is on the upswing, economists and city officials say. Hotel occupancy rates -- expected to reach nearly 80 percent this year -- have hit their highest levels in 16 years, the Federal Reserve reported last month. And the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau expects 25.4 million visitors this year, the most since 1990 and a slight increase over a successful 1995. By year's end, the city expects those visitors to have spent $12 billion on shopping, hotels and sightseeing.
And city officials believe the industry will continue to grow, particularly if they promote the sharp drop in the city's crime rate, the improvements in the quality of life and the less traditional activities outside the usual attractions. To that end, the Giuliani administration will undertake a $12 million advertisement campaign to promote the new New York.
"To continue the momentum it's important for people to get an accurate picture of what New York is like," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in an interview. "Stereotypes are very hard to change. But we have a great story to tell."
Of course, despite reductions in crime and the cleanup of Times Square, some New Yorkers seem determined to keep negative stereotypes alive, like the bellhop who abandoned a French tourist's luggage on the sidewalk when the visitor forgot to give him a tip. "He ignored me," lamented the tourist, Fardad Farzam, 30, who ended up hauling his bags to his room without any help from the bed-and-breakfast staff.
But drawn by the weak dollar, a reduction in the hotel occupancy tax and improving economies in some states and countries abroad, tourists have been visiting in gradually increasing numbers since 1993, even though some remain unaware of improvements in the city.
The rise in the number of foreign tourists, which is expected to creep up 3 percent this year, is particularly encouraging to city officials, who note that foreigners are responsible for nearly 40 percent of all tourist spending even though they make up only 22 percent of visitors. Top on their list of favorite New York activities, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau, is shopping.
On the Fourth of July, as cars breezed through the mostly gridlock-free streets that the natives had fled, the sidewalks were packed with foreigners: Indian mothers in saffron-colored saris shopping for televisions at Macy's, French families standing in line to see the Picasso exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art and Dutch college students poring through the compact disks at the new Virgin Megastore in Times Square.
Rachid Ayouni of Canada wanted to buy a fancy watch, but he passed up a trip to one of the big department stores for a truly New York experience: haggling with a salesman working out of a briefcase in Times Square.
"Eleven hundred dollars in the store, but only $25 here!" cried the salesman, flinging open his black leather briefcase under the nose of the awe-struck Mr. Ayouni.
After a bit of back and forth, the 21-year-old student walked off with what the merchant described as an authentic Tag Heuer timepiece, paying only $20. "The prices here are much lower than in Montreal," Mr. Ayouni said. But when he turned to the salesman to reassure himself that he had made the right decision, he had vanished.
The Hackl family -- Alfred, a 47-year-old math teacher; his wife, Michaela, 46, and his daughters, Sabine and Edith, 23 -- found their favorite entertainment in such street theater, looking on with astonishment at the yellow taxis tearing through the streets, the incredible mix of colors and languages of the city's citizens, and the cavalier manner in which many people ignored posted rules.
"It says 'Don't Walk' and everyone walks," Mr. Hackl marveled as he and his family were stranded curbside yet again as a pack of fast-moving natives surged past them. "At home we would be fined."
There is a sense among city officials that tourists like the Hackl family -- especially repeat visitors -- would like to expand their exposure to a broader range of experiences in the city, to see more urban life than can be found in art museums. And toward that end, the Convention and Visitors Bureau is encouraging travelers to attend salsa concerts in the Bronx's Orchard Beach, take bus rides through Prospect Park in Brooklyn, or wander some of Harlem's historic streets.
That idea appealed to Jacob Graafsma of the Netherlands, who chose to stay in the red-brick youth hostel on 103d Street and Amsterdam, partly because it was cheap but also to get a sense of parts of the city that many tourists never see.
"You see everything here, the music coming from the windows, the children playing in the street, the people speaking Spanish," said Mr. Graafsma, 23, as he sat on a street bench, watching the world go by. "You can see the sights in a video, but here we can catch the real vibe of the city."

HEADLINE: Troubling Issues in a Silicon Valley Spy Case

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 7

 BODY:
On a brisk May afternoon last year, a frantic Argentine man carrying a stack of papers and videotapes knocked on the doors of several American newspaper offices here.
"I'm a spy, and I think they're going to kill me, so I want you to know what has happened," were the first words out of his mouth. 
 The man identified himself as Bill Gaede, an engineer who claimed to have stolen secrets about computer-chip technology from companies in the United States and passed them to the Governments of Cuba, China, Iran and others. And now, he insisted, he was being tailed by the Central Intelligence Agency and by Argentine intelligence agents.
So remarkable was Mr. Gaede's tale of political and industrial espionage and of his eventual conversion to being an F.B.I. informant that few people believed him. Not even when Mr. Gaede, whose first name is Guillermo, though he goes by Bill, provided audio and videotapes of encounters that seemed to support his story.
As it turns out, many of Mr. Gaede's contentions have in the last year been shown to be true. Mr. Gaede (pronounced GAY-dee), who is 42, recently began serving a 33-month prison sentence, now at the Santa Clara County jail in San Jose, Calif., after pleading guilty to Federal charges of mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen information. Mr. Gaede says that a plea bargain he struck allows him to remain in the United States after completing his sentence and prevents prosecution of his wife, who he says assisted him in his activities.
His booty, the Government says, was trade secrets from the Intel Corporation, the largest maker of semiconductors in the world. The Government said those secrets were worth $10 million to $20 million.
And now, whether one believes Mr. Gaede's contention that the F.B.I. condoned his espionage or accepts the view that Mr. Gaede acted alone and simply managed to slip through Intel's security net, his account of foreign spying might give pause to any chief executive in Silicon Valley. "There are so many foreigners working in these companies that this sort of theft is bound to happen again," Mr. Gaede said in a telephone interview last week from the jail.
The F.B.I., which last year declined to comment on the case, now acknowledges having had regular meetings with Mr. Gaede while he was stealing trade secrets from Intel and his previous Silicon Valley employer, the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But the agency denies Mr. Gaede's contentions that he was an informant and that the F.B.I. sanctioned his espionage as a means of infiltrating Communist governments.
George Grotz, a spokesman for the F.B.I.'s office in San Francisco, said in a recent telephone interview that the bureau warned Intel in June 1993 that Mr. Gaede had a history of espionage. Intel says it never received that warning.
Mr. Grotz said that during the F.B.I.'s relationship with Mr. Gaede, the bureau considered prosecuting him for criminal activities on at least three occasions. But the Government did not bring charges, he said, because there was no applicable Federal economic espionage statute.
Still, "it was our responsibility to notify Intel of a situation we thought was important," Mr. Grotz said of the warning that the F.B.I. said it issued in 1993.
Mr. Gaede is highly critical of the bureau.
"I admit that I broke the law and that I should serve time in jail," Mr. Gaede said. But "the F.B.I. was an equal participant in the crime because its agents instructed me to continue stealing information so they could catch the Cubans.
"The F.B.I. is not clean in this case, and neither are the companies that I stole from," he said, because their security was inadequate.
The crime to which Mr. Gaede pleaded guilty did not involve a transfer of Intel secrets to a foreign government but, instead, what Intel executives say was an attempt to sell the information to his former employer, Advanced Micro, in May 1994.
Mr. Gaede contends that he was framed by F.B.I. agents, who he said sent the material to Advanced Micro to build a legal case against him. But he does acknowledge stealing the information and says he sold it to China and Iran, through various contacts, for "large sums of money."
Many troubling questions remain. How, for example, did Mr. Gaede, an Argentine with forged United States documents, gain access to the trade secrets of the country's largest computer chip makers? Do United States companies have adequate security measures to prevent future acts of espionage? Did F.B.I. agents fail to properly monitor Mr. Gaede, who continued to steal trade secrets even after he had briefed agents on his past thefts?
Mr. Gaede came to the United States in 1977 on a tourist visa and stayed on by using forged documents. Mr. Gaede, who said he was a communist ideologue, began working for Advanced Micro as an engineer in 1979. He said he began stealing the company's plans for its computer chips in 1982, giving the stolen information to Cuban officials in hopes that it would help the Castro Government develop its own semiconductor industry.
But Mr. Gaede said that after a visit to Cuba in 1989, he became disillusioned with Communism and turned himself in to the Central Intelligence Agency -- an assertion that the American Government declines to verify or even discuss. The C.I.A. put him in touch with the F.B.I., Mr. Gaede said.
And the F.B.I., Mr. Gaede said, encouraged him to maintain his contacts with Cuban agents, even if that meant continuing to supply them with stolen trade secrets. He said he resigned from Advanced Micro in the fall of 1992, after concluding that the company would eventually detect his activities.
Advanced Micro's chief of security, Peter Costner, said the company was preparing to dismiss Mr. Gaede when he left. The company believes that Mr. Gaede stole "a significant amount of intellectual property," Mr. Costner said, but it did not press charges because it did not believe that it would be able to prove the crime.
In the spring of 1993, Mr. Gaede began to work for an Intel subcontractor. The F.B.I. evidently was aware of this, though Intel officials say they have no record of the warning about Mr. Gaede that the agency says it issued in June 1993. And Intel officials say that because the company hires so many foreign workers for technical positions it often cannot perform extensive background checks.
Howard High, an Intel spokesman, declined to comment on whether Intel had tightened its security measures in the wake of the Gaede affair.
Three months after Mr. Gaede went to work for the subcontractor, Intel hired him as a senior engineer at its chip plant in Chandler, Ariz. (Mr. Gaede said he was surprised that Intel apparently had no problem with the references he provided for his job application: his former supervisor at Advanced Micro Devices and several F.B.I. agents.)
"Obviously, we should have done a more thorough background check on Mr. Gaede, especially since he worked for one of our competitors," Mr. High said. "I really can't say what went wrong."
Mr. Gaede said he soon began stealing technical information from Intel, with the encouragement of F.B.I. agents eager for him to keep channels open with his foreign Communist contacts. But Mr. Gaede said he remained disillusioned with Communism and fearful that the F.B.I. might be setting him up, so he decided to quit the spy business.
But not without one last, brazen heist.
In May 1994, Mr. Gaede, working at home on his personal computer, downloaded Intel's voluminous manufacturing specifications for the Pentium and 486 computer chips and copied the data by training a video camera on his computer screen as the information scrolled past. That approach "allowed me to work undetected, store greater amounts of information in a smaller medium and make copies quicker for interested parties," he said, explaining why he did not simply store the data on a disk. He said he planned to sell the information to foreign governments that might be anxious to start indigenous high-technology industries.
On June 1, 1994, Mr. Gaede was dismissed by Intel for refusing to cooperate with an internal security investigation. Within weeks, he was back in Buenos Aires.
As the months passed, Mr. Gaede came to believe that he was being pursued by intelligence agents and would be safer in the hands of the American justice system. At that point, he decided to go to the press with his story, and in the summer of 1995, he returned to the United States. He was indicted in September and pleaded guilty this past March to charges of mail fraud and interstate transportation of Intel's stolen secrets.

HEADLINE: India Suddenly Leads in H.I.V., AIDS Meeting Is Told

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 7

 BODY:
India has quickly emerged as the country with the largest number of people infected with the AIDS virus, only a few years after it was first detected there, the head of the United Nations AIDS program said as the 11th international AIDS meeting opened here today.
More than 3 million of India's 950 million people are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, which apparently began circulating in the subcontinent about a decade later than in the United States, where the disease was first recognized in 1981, said the United Nations official, Dr. Peter Piot. 
 Nevertheless, impressive gains in preventing the disease are being made in several regions of the world, illustrating the varying patterns in which H.I.V. has spread, Dr. Piot said, with the incidence of new infection rising in some areas, like India, stablizing in others, like the United States, and decreasing in countries like Thailand and Uganda.
The apparent success of combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs means that "nobody can call AIDS an inevitably fatal, untreatable disease anymore," Dr. Piot said.
Opening the meeting in the arena where Vancouver's professional basketball and hockey teams play, Doreen Millman, a 63-year-old grandmother, sitting alone at the center of the stage, brought the 15,000 participants to their feet, cheering, when she said: "How did I get infected? The answer is very simple: It just doesn't matter."
A co-chairman of the meeting, Dr. Martin T. Schechter of Vancouver, said the world was "at a crossroads in the history of the H.I.V. epidemic" because, after many years, "we are beginning to see glimmers of hope." But he warned that many Governments "are drifting toward indifference at this critical juncture."
Canadian scientists and advocates campaigning on behalf of people with the disease complained bitterly that Prime Minister Jean Chretien had not accepted an invitation to open the meeting, unlike his predecessor, Brian Mulroney, who did so at the 1989 meeting in Montreal.
When the Canadian Health Minister, David Dingwall, spoke in Mr. Chretien's place, several hundred AIDS activists stood, turned their backs and jeered to express their rage over the Prime Minister's absence and the Government's plan for large cutbacks in the Canadian AIDS program.
Another co-chairman of the meeting, Dr. Michael V. O'Shaugnessy of Vancouver, cautioned that despite the prospect of favorable news about AIDS therapies, "there will be a lot of overstatement of results."
Eric L. Sawyer of New York City, an advocate for people with AIDS, strongly criticized leading researchers and drug companies for creating an over-optimisitic mood in suggesting that combinations of new and old drugs might become a cure.
"If you think the cure is here, think again," Mr. Sawyer, who has AIDS, said at the gathering, which has drawn people from 125 countries. "The cure is not here. We are a long way from a cure, even for the rich who can afford the treatments."
"People with AIDS need access to treatments, not false hope," Mr. Sawyer added. He called on drug companies to lower prices to make newer therapies available to more people, particularly in developing countries.
There are 22 million people in the world who are infected with the AIDS virus, with 8,500 new infections occurring each day, including 1,000 in children, health officials said. Two-thirds of the infections are in sub-Saharan African countries, which unlike the rest of the world, have more infected women than men.
Trailing India in the number of people infected are South Africa, with 1.8 million cases; Uganda, 1.4 million; Nigeria, 1.2 million, and Kenya, 1.1 million, Dr. Piot said.
In the United States, the number of infected people in 1992 -- the latest year available -- was estimated at between 650,000 and 900,000, said Dr. John M. Karon of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The number of infected Americans no longer appears to be increasing rapidly, and may even be declining in some groups, he said.
No country is free of H.I.V. infection, nor is any province of India or China, Dr. Piot said. The number appears to be rising rapidly in many groups. For instance, in the Indian state of Manipur, the infection rate has tripled among intravenous drug users to 65 percent since 1991, he said.
He said that in China infections were rising in cities like Beijing and Shanghai and among drug users in Yunnan Province on the border with Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Areas of China are also experiencing a resurgence of sexually transmitted diseases, which experience shows closely parallels the incidence of H.I.V. infection.
Meeting participants called for bold action to apply the latest gains in prevention and treatment throughout the world.
A range of AIDS prevention programs is credited by C.D.C. officials for a more favorable trend in infection rates in the United States. For instance, the number of new infections in San Francisco has dropped to about 1,000 a year from 8,000 a year in the early 1980's.
In Uganda and Thailand, public education about safer sex practices has led to decreases in the number of sexual partners, increased fidelity and abstinence and dramatically reduced new infections. Such success shows that "countries do not have to be rich to be successful," Dr. Piot said, adding, "If Uganda, one of the poorest countries in the world, can reverse its H.I.V. trends, so can other countries."
Health experts are sounding the theme that "prevention works" and attribute much of the decline to a greater use of condoms through nonprofit companies like Population Services International of Washington, D.C., that rely on social marketing techniques to sell condoms.
Richard A. Frank, president of the company, said in an interview that it would sell about 175 million condoms in Africa this year, compared with about 4 million in the late 1980's, before the company began distributing condoms.
Sales of condoms in Vietnam nearly tripled to 117 million between 1991 and 1995, Dr. Piot said.
He urged that many countries follow the lead of the campaigners for people with AIDS who sped up access to drugs in the United States. But Dr. Piot said he hoped other countries would accomplish the same goals without resorting to the disruptive tactics many activists have often used in the United States
Dr. Piot, Dr. O'Shaugnessy and other participants joined with AIDS campaigners in criticizing the lack of access to basic drugs needed for AIDS and related illnesses in many third world countries. They cited such examples as isoniazid, or I.N.H., a standard drug for tuberculosis; Bactrim for pneumocystis pneumonia; other drugs to treat diarrheal illnesses and fungal infections, and pain killers.
Many participants have urged countries to be bolder about prevention, citing the billboard and television advertisements promoting condoms in Switzerland and messages in religious sermons in countries like Pakistan.
"If a country with strict religious norms like Pakistan can broadcast almost daily TV messages about AIDS, others can too," Dr. Piot said.
Some countries have imposed heavy import duties on condoms -- up to 100 percent -- to protect local economies, creating obstacles to prevention. Brazil recently dropped its tariff, but it could not be learned how many other countries still impose such duties.
"The AIDS problem will not be solved in any country until it is solved everywhere," Dr. Piot said, agreeing with many others that such a goal could not be accomplished until a vaccine is developed.

Lobbying Intensifies Before Minimum-Wage Vote
On the eve of a crucial Senate vote to raise the Federal minimum wage for millions of workers, organized labor and business groups are running an all-out lobbying campaign to swing the outcome their way. 
 The amendment would exempt businesses earning less than $500,000 a year, allow employers to pay newly hired workers a sub-minimum wage of $4.25 for six months and delay the effective date of a wage increase by six months, to Jan. 1, 1997. [Page A8.]

Tourism in New York City is on the upswing, economists and city officials say. Hotel occupancy rates have hit their highest levels in 16 years. And the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau expects 25.4 million visitors this year, the most since 1990 and a slight increase over a very successful 1995. And city officials believe the industry will continue to grow, particularly if they promote the sharp drop in the city's crime rate, quality of life improvements and less traditional activities. To that end, the Giuliani administration will undertake a $12 million advertising campaign to promote the new New York. [Page A1.]
 
Ouster at Board of Education?
With two days to go before the Board of Education is to vote on a president, the Giuliani Administration raised the possibility that the Mayor might seek to oust Queens board member Carol A. Gresser from the job. Mayor Giuliani's top aide, First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, told Queens Borough President Claire Shulman that the Mayor was "leaning toward" ousting her appointee in favor of William C. Thompson Jr., the Brooklyn representative on the board, Mrs. Shulman said. The mayor, seeming to leave all his options open, refused to say whether he had made a decision. [B1.]
 
A Fight Not About the Budget
Governor Pataki and legislative leaders can agree on one thing: The longest budget fight in New York State history no longer has much to do with the budget itself. Instead, what is clearly holding up final passage of the spending plan is an arcane debate over how to reduce costs in the state's $5 billion system of compensating workers injured on the job. News analysis. [B1.]
 
Budget talks resumed in Albany, but aides to Governor Pataki and legislative leaders said that little progress had been made. [B4.]
 
Tips for a Workaholic Mayor
Mayor Giuliani will not take a vacation. In some ways, the Mayor's workaholism is admirable. But the benefits of travel could offset the drawbacks -- if Mr. Giuliani picked the right destinations. For instance, he could visit Charles City County, Va. Charles City makes a business of burying other people's trash and using the profits to reduce its taxes. So instead of closing the landfill on Staten Island, New York could expand it and get rich on refuse. Or the Mayor could go to London and ride in roomy, comfortable taxis, driven by cabbies who always know where they are going. Or he might try Paris, to walk spotless streets. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]
 
Investigating Coney I. Fire
As authorities investigated a fire that ignited after a natural gas pipeline ruptured in Coney Island, attention focused on whether workers on the scene knew they were operating in potentially hazardous conditions. The gas leak apparently began nearly three hours before the fire, but dozens of men continued operating machinery as they excavated a crater to repair a broken water main. Twelve people were injured, six with severe burns. [B3.]
 
Charges in Firefighter's Death
A man was charged with fatally shooting an off-duty New York City firefighter who had tried to stop an argument outside a bar in Howard Beach, Queens. In an unrelated incident, another off-duty New York City firefighter was killed in Orange County, N.Y., after attacking a cabdriver, the police said. [B3.]
 
Lights! Camera! Little Italy!
On Mulberry Street in Little Italy, romance was in the air. Or something like it. As the cameras prepared to roll, Bette Midler stood at attention in front of Angelo's restaurant, closed her eyes and struggled to attain deep concentration. A split second before an assistant called out "action," Dennis Farina, her co-star, reached over and pinched the Divine One's rear end, eliciting a startled laugh. As the couple walked on, he kept at it, causing Ms. Midler to hop her way down the sidewalk, slapping at the offending hand. His scripted efforts, in take after take, provided capital entertainment for the tourists and other passers-by who drifted into the set of "That Old Feeling." The romantic comedy, directed by Carl Reiner, swooped into New York for a few quick days of location shooting. The Arts. [C9.]
 
REGION
 
Tracking Juveniles' Guns
President Clinton will announce the creation of a Federal computer system to track the illegal sale of guns to young people as part of an initiative to help local police cut off the supply of firearms to youths and halt the sharp rise in gun violence among young people. The police chiefs and prosecutors from 17 cities, including New York, are to sign an agreement at the White House voluntarily pledging to provide information on every gun they seize from a juvenile during a crime so it can be entered into the Federal computer system. Each gun will then be traced to its original seller through documents and serial numbers to try to find who is selling guns illegally to juveniles. The traffickers will then be prosecuted. [A1.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
A Political Crossroads
For many Republicans around the country, the road to political prominence runs through a spartan industrial park on the outskirts of Princeton, N.J. A former warehouse at 741 Alexander Road contains two political action committees, three separate political consulting companies, a design company that produces campaign brochures and direct-mail advertising, and a company that provides political consulting as well as accounting services for both political action committees. The activity at 741 Alexander Road is a microcosm of the arcane, ever-shifting world of campaign finance. It is an incestuous arrangement in which the same small group of people control the two PAC's and the various businesses, passing money back and forth among themselves as they handle fund raising, spending, contracting, billing and payments.

System Fails Asylum Seekers
Hawa Jama, a 26-year-old Somali woman who sought asylum in the United States in 1994, was released after 14 months in detention, and was subsequently granted asylum. She now lives with her sister in Tennessee. Her lengthy detention after entering the country illegally is emblematic of broader failings in the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service's program to release asylum seekers who have credible claims, pose no danger to society and have ties in the United States, say immigration experts and advocates for refugees.

HEADLINE: By Now, the Budget Fight Isn't Really About the Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 7

 BODY:
More than half a year after Gov. George E. Pataki introduced his budget and precisely 14 weeks after the state's fiscal year began on April 1, Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders can confidently agree on one thing: the longest budget fight in New York State history no longer has much to do with the budget itself.
Aides to Albany's ruling triumvirate -- the Governor, the Senate majority leader and the Assembly Speaker -- acknowledge that the things once considered great obstacles to a budget agreement, including overall spending, welfare and criminal justice policies, have largely been resolved, though they still refuse to provide details. 
 Instead, what is clearly holding up final passage of the spending plan is an arcane debate over how to reduce costs in the state's $5 billion system of compensating workers injured on the job.
Though the issue is only tangentially related to the $64 billion spending plan, Mr. Pataki has refused to agree to a budget deal until the Democratic-controlled Assembly compromises on a plan to reduce workers' compensation insurance premiums. And while the leader of the Assembly Democrats, Speaker Sheldon Silver, agrees that those premiums must be cut, he adamantly opposes almost all of Mr. Pataki's plan. Hence the deadlock.
Many legislators on both sides of the aisle, frustrated that the impasse is eating into their once-sacrosanct time for summer vacations and fall campaign preparations, wonder why a middle ground cannot be reached on an issue everyone agrees is important to the state's economic health.
But in Albany, the length of a debate is almost always directly proportional to the power and wealth of the special interests aligned on either side of the issue. And in the case of workers' compensation insurance, those interest groups are among the most influential in state government.
On one side, Mr. Pataki has allied himself closely with the state's two most important business organizations: the Business Council of New York State, a statewide chamber of commerce representing many Fortune 500 companies, and the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents hundreds of smaller companies.
Mr. Pataki's plan, which is supported by the Republican-controlled State Senate, would for the first time cap payments for injured workers, establish an objective standard for courts to use in determining the extent of disability and prohibit a type of lawsuit against employers. It would also raise benefits for injured workers. The Governor contends that his plan would reduce insurance premiums, which are paid by every employer and are among the highest in the nation, by at least 25 percent.
On the other side, Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who is Mr. Pataki's chief nemesis in the budget fight, has linked arms with the state's largest union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, who have long been major campaign contributors to state officials in both parties.
The Assembly Democrats' plan would require insurance companies to expand their anti-fraud efforts and lower premiums for employers with good workplace safety records. The plan would also increase benefits for injured workers, but only after premiums declined by 5 percent. Mr. Silver says his proposal would reduce rates by 20 percent.
Though the sides agree that high workers' compensation premiums are hurting job growth in the state, their plans are in many ways diametrically opposed.
Mr. Silver and his allies have harshly attacked Mr. Pataki's plan as anti-worker. They say its provision to cap benefits for partly disabled workers will force people onto welfare. And they contend its prohibition on a certain type of litigation will eliminate an important motivation for employers to keep their workplaces safe.
Mr. Pataki, the Speaker's supporters charge, has prolonged the debate because he expects campaign contributions from big business in return for tough new rules. "Are we going to be concerned about how many bonuses we can give the chief executives of some of the major businesses in this state?" Mr. Silver asked recently. "That's what this is about."
But business groups say Mr. Silver is fighting Mr. Pataki's proposals largely because he is beholden to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the trial lawyers. Both are major contributors to the Assembly Democrats and both have close ties to its leadership.
In an attempt to avoid appearing anti-union, Mr. Pataki has focused his criticism on the trial lawyers. He contends that the Assembly has been unwilling to budge on his proposal to prohibit so-called third-party lawsuits against employers because it would reduce earnings for many personal injury lawyers.
"This is not about worker safety," the Governor said last week, referring to the Assembly Democrats' position. "It's about protecting those who profit from the system now."
Republican Party leaders and Pataki aides say the Governor is positioning himself for a campaign depicting Democrats as favoring rich lawyers over business owners and working people. They believe the issue will resonate with voters this fall, when all 211 seats in the Legislature are up for election.
Many Democrats see a more fundamental political struggle going on. They contend that Mr. Pataki is attempting nothing less than to sever the powerful ties between the trial lawyers and unions and the Assembly Democrats. In a year when the Legislature has succeeded in rejecting most of Mr. Pataki's budget initiatives, the Governor could still walk away from the session with an important political victory if he succeeds on workers' compensation, those Democrats say.
For that very reason, they do not expect Mr. Silver to give in soon. And that means the budget fight might be far from over.
"If Pataki wins, it will be a huge political victory," said one Democratic legislative official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "He will have hit the Assembly in the center of its political core support. Shelly just can't let him do that."

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Washington Leaves His Own Shadow Across Center Court

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
ARTHUR ASHE casts a monumental shadow in more ways than one. On Wednesday, a statue of him holding books and a tennis racquet will be officially dedicated in his hometown of Richmond -- on historic Monument Avenue.
Never mind that the nearby statue of Robert E. Lee is 60 feet tall and the statue of Arthur Ashe is 12 feet tall. It took a great deal of fence-mending and soul-searching to put the general and the activist athlete on the same street. 
 It may take a few more years and a few more stars before MaliVai Washington is no longer viewed in the shadow of Arthur Ashe, but Washington was clearly his own man in his own age as he lost to Richard Krajicek, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, yesterday in the Wimbledon final.
The international crowd clearly favored the underdog against Krajicek, a Dutchman born in the former Czechoslovakia.
"Why do I think that is?" Washington asked rhetorically. "I don't know. Maybe I'm better-looking than Rich. I don't know. You tell me. But it feels good when you have a lot of crowd support."
Perhaps the crowd was reacting to the intense, controlled way Washington came back from a 1-5 deficit in the fifth set to beat Todd Martin on Saturday -- and the open way the two friends greeted each other at the net. Washington was a credit to himself, his family, his Baptist faith, the University of Michigan, his country and his race -- "the human race," as the immortal Jimmy Cannon once wrote about the immortal Joe Louis.
Washington deserved any comparison with Ashe after the logical, polite and passionate way he argued on Saturday when the chair umpire reversed an overrule by an official, which would cost Washington a crucial game in the fifth set.
Again yesterday, Washington avoided the born-in-the-U.S.A. tantrums that John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi have staged. Ashe would have loved the way Washington began a dialogue with the chair umpire by saying, "I don't complain about a lot of calls."
Ashe still looms over any African-American male player, Washington being the only prominent one at the moment. Ashe won the United States Open in 1968, the Australian Open in 1970 and Wimbledon itself in 1975, and he was a writer, thinker, organizer, civic asset, transcending all the boundaries of American athletes. He contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion during a heart operation, and he died in 1993. His monument will be dedicated on Wednesday, what should have been Arthur's 53d birthday, and there are thousands of us who miss him.
After his gallant comeback against Martin, Washington recalled being 6 years old and watching Ashe's Wimbledon triumph on television.
"It's a moment you dream about," Washington said on Saturday. "Every kid from 5 years old, and even guys 50 years old, have dreamed of being at this moment. I have a lot of support from the black community in the States and around the world. It's great when you can win because you're winning for yourself, and you're winning for those who are pulling for you. It's an honor to be the first black since Arthur to be in the final.
"I just hope I can spur more young blacks into playing the game."
Ashe had to overcome the lingering restraints of segregation in his childhood. Learning tennis was not easy for the five Washington children, Mashona, MaliVai, Mishiska, Masanja and Michaela.
The children learned to play outdoors, even in the winter near Swartz Creek, Mich. Washington once said: "We'd just go outside. It would be so cold we'd hit for a few minutes, then get back in the car, turn the heater on, warm up for a little bit, then go back out and hit some more."
He earned a scholarship to Michigan, approached the top 10 a few years ago and has always been popular at tournaments in the United States.
"I feel pressure as a player," Washington said. "When you're playing a tournament in a city with a large population of black folks, you're going to have a lot saying you have to beat so and so."
The barrier may be more economic than social and political now, but the result is the same. It is hard to produce black tennis stars. The past two weeks, the world had one.
Yesterday Washington laughed at the female streaker before the match; he did his best in the match and never sulked as Krajicek's serve and range dominated him. Afterward, he bowed to royalty, praised his opponent, feigned scaling his trophy plate into the stands like a Frisbee, remembered friends like Chris Evert and Andy Mill, who sent him a telegram, and laughed off a suggestion about putting a sliding roof over rainy Wimbledon. ("Geez, I don't know if I'd ever change that court. That's nice.")
MaliVai Washington appreciates the tradition of Wimbledon. And now he is part of it.

HEADLINE: Climate Session Opens With Words of Warning

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 8

 BODY:
United Nations officials and scientists today urged governments to agree in the coming two weeks on tighter targets for limiting the emissions of the greenhouse gases that are blamed for global warming. The officials, speaking at the start of the United Nations' Climate Change Convention, also issued a strong affirmation of the notion that economic activity is the main cause of global warming, dismissing critics of that view as industry lobby groups.
The conference seeks to nail down new pledges by industrial powers to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they pump into the atmosphere. 
 "We will be successful if we get agreement on further commitments that might be made in the process of controlling climate change," said the conference president, Chen Chimutengwende, Zimbabwe's environmental minister.
And Bert Bolin, a Swedish scientist and chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is playing a vital role in the discussions, renewed warnings of more world disasters and health problems if warming is not slowed.
He said at the opening session of the conference that analysis by his group, which links 2,500 scientists around the globe, has shown that failure to act could bring more severe droughts and floods and more disease, in rich nations and poor.
The conference, which involves 150 countries, is to wrap up on July 18 and 19 with a meeting of environmental ministers. Industrial group are challenging important aspects of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that will be a main focus of the gathering.
In the report, issued at the end of last year, the panel said there was strong evidence that global warming was the result of industrial activity, primarily the use of fossil fuels like oil and coal. That argument is the basis for the effort being led by the United Nations to reduce emissions.
But in a statement issued in Geneva today, the Global Climate Coalition, a group based in Washington that includes some of the most powerful companies in the United States, said it was too early to determine what causes warming. The coalition, which is also fighting United States backing for the convention, said lower emission targets could bind the United States "to economic and regulatory obligation that could have serious impacts on American industry and its job holders for the next 40 years."
Michael Cutajar, the convention's executive secretary, said the coalition's campaign reflected "concern among certain industry groups about where their industries would end up" if strong action were taken against warming. He called the attack on the report "a defense of economic interests disguised as an attack on scientific credibility."

HEADLINE: For the Sake of Salmon, California Dam Gets an $80 Million Alteration

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: SHASTA LAKE CITY, Calif.

 BODY:
If chinook salmon embryos and fry could sweat, they would drip with perspiration in water exceeding 56 degrees. In water over 57.5 degrees, they begin to die.
An endangered run of salmon on the Sacramento River are under such a threat, blocked by a dam from their historical spawning grounds in the chilly, gravel-bottomed creeks of Northern California's Cascade Mountains. In an effort to keep the young salmon from overheating, the Federal Bureau of Reclamation is bolting a huge $80 million temperature control system to Shasta Dam. 
 The device, which can draw water from Shasta Lake's chilly depths as well as the warmer layers above, will end a decade-old conflict between two compelling goals, the production of electricity and the protection of salmon. Once complete in December, the cooling system will be the largest structure ever devoted to fish preservation.
"If we didn't go to all this effort we would lose a population of fish that is important to a whole region of the state, especially the economies of ocean and river communities," said Harry Rectenwald, a biologist with the California Fish and Game Department.
Shasta Dam, a 602-foot concrete barrier 200 miles north of San Francisco, was built at the confluence of the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud Rivers in the 1940's, before much thought was given to fish habitat. The dam created Shasta Lake, out of which the Sacramento River now flows on its way to the San Francisco Bay. Experts blame the dam's water intake system for the Sacramento River's fluctuating temperature.
The intake pipes are not deep enough to draw water from the cold lake bottom. As a consequence, the water taken into the dam's hydroelectric system and then sent rushing downstream is sometimes warmer than salmon can tolerate.
The problem is worst during the searing summer and when drought causes the lake's water level to drop. Thousands of salmon died during a drought in 1976 and 1977 when the water temperature in the Sacramento River rose to 62 degrees.
The 55 miles of river below Shasta Dam are prime spawning grounds for winter-run salmon. They spawn in three-year cycles, and in the last three years only 2,000 adults were counted. By contrast, in 1969 alone, nearly 117,000 salmon made the journey north through the Central Valley farm country to the spawning grounds. These fish, which can weigh up to 30 pounds as adults, swim upstream from the ocean to their birthplace. They lay eggs from April to June and then die. Their young spend the summer and fall feeding in fresh water before heading to the sea.
Concerned about the dwindling salmon population, the Bureau of Reclamation in 1987 began voluntarily shutting down electricity production during hot spells. When electricity is not being generated, cold water is released from the dam's lower face into the Sacramento River. These precautions have been a state requirement since 1993.
But such care comes at a price. The bureau has lost an estimated $40 million over the years by turning off its turbines.
However, extending Shasta Dam's intake system 100 feet, to near the bottom of the lake, as the current project will do, will keep the power plant's generators at a low hum year-round. It will be possible to fine-tune temperatures with a shutter system that will let operators choose the depths from which to draw water, simply by opening and closing huge louvers with the touch of a button.
Jeffrey S. McCracken, a spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation, conceded that the $80 million project was a substantial financial commitment. Indeed, measured in terms of the 2,000 endangered salmon recorded in the recent count, the price comes to a formidable $40,000 a fish. But Mr. McCracken said the project would pay for itself many times over with increased efficiency because the generators will not be idle. Central Valley water users will pay for the project through an environmental improvement tax.
"I guess there are people who would say: 'Hey, wait a minute. This costs a lot of money,' " Mr. McCracken said. "But you do everything you have to do to ensure this species lives."
A much smaller temperature control device is in use at the Flaming Gorge Dam on Utah's Green River. It was assembled on land and floated into place, whereas Shasta Dam's 8,000-ton, 250-foot steel frame system is being bolted to the dam by divers. Some must live for a month at a time in pressurized chambers because of the depth at which they work.
Besides heat, salmon have had to adapt to a number of changes in their Sacramento River habitat. Large rocks placed to control erosion have replaced gravel along some stretches of the riverbank. Shade trees have been cut to make way for levees. And channels have been cleared of fallen wood, draining pools where salmon like to congregate.
Dr. Daniel B. Botkin, who has studied salmon habitat for the Center for the Study of the Environment, a nonprofit educational organization, applauds current efforts to correct some of those problems.
"If the structure of a stream is inadequate," he said, "then no matter what the water temperature is, nothing can help the salmon."
Unlike the Sacramento River's imperiled winter run of salmon, the fall and spring run populations are robust. Their young grow up when hot weather is less of a factor.
The winter run's recovery is likely to be slow.
"They are on the edge, and this new temperature device will help them get secured," Mr. Rectenwald said. "But one thing people don't realize is how long it takes to bring back an animal."

The Federal Bureau of Reclamation has spent $80 million to build a new water intake system on the Shasta Dam on California's Sacramento River. Salmon below the dam have been suffering from warm summer surface water run through the dam's hydroelectric plant and then sent downstream. The new system allows water intake from deeper, cooler levels of the lake the dam created. (The New York Times; Illustration by Baden Copeland)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Flat After Rally Against the Yen Fails to Hold

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended nearly unchanged yesterday as a rally to a 30-month high above 111 yen gave way to profit taking and worries over falling United States stock and bond markets.
A report showing that Japan's current-account trade surplus sank 46 percent in May from a year earlier helped push the dollar to 111.16 Japanese yen in Asian trading, its highest point since January 1994. 
 Currency dealers pointed to that new high as a signal the dollar would continue to advance on the yen.
But the gains evaporated in early New New York trading as bonds and stocks opened weaker, raising fears of a repeat of Friday's big selloff.
Stocks and bonds tumbled after a report showed surprising strength in the United States jobs market, suggesting that the economy was picking up speed and that the Federal Reserve would be compelled to raise interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating. The dollar surged that day, bolstered by those same expectations of higher interest rates.
But the prospect of a continued selloff of United States securities worried currency traders because it would eventually generate dollar sales as foreign investors moved their proceeds overseas.
"It's an open question whether the dollar moves with yields or asset prices," said Anne Parker Mills, foreign exchange analyst at Lehman Brothers. "But a big drop in the asset markets would not be good for the dollar."
Stocks and bonds fared better yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.31 points; Treasury prices ended little changed.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 110.80 yen, down from 110.85 yen Friday. The dollar fell to 1.5261 marks from 1.5298 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5540 from $1.5525.
The dollar was bolstered against the market by comments from the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, on Saturday. Mr. Tietmeyer told German television that he saw no reason to cut German interest rates.
"People are getting nervous about Tietmeyer," said John Duffy, senior dealer at Bayerische Vereinsbank. "A lot of people have sold the mark expecting a cut in German interest rates and they're not getting it."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Up as Supplies Fall Near the Shortage Level

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose in New York yesterday after the London Metal Exchange reported a drop in its stockpiles and the strong economic data from the United States pointed to hefty demand.
On other markets, corn prices rose after a report of larger-than-expected weekly exports. 
 Copper prices rose on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on the first day of trading since Wednesday, when the market began a long Fourth of July weekend. On Friday, the London Metal Exchange said stockpiles fell 11,700 metric tons, to 241,600 tons, the lowest since Dec. 12. The same day, the United States Labor Department said the unemployment rate dropped to a six-year low of 5.3 percent.
The reports helped bolster a seasonal rally in copper even amid concerns that the Sumitomo Corporation would sell some of its copper holdings to pay for its recently disclosed $1.8 billion in copper trading losses.
"Steady consumer demand has helped to provide a base for prices," said Michael Frawley, a vice president of futures trading at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. "The copper tube business is steady."
Copper for September delivery rose 2.75 cents, to 90.55 cents a pound, its highest since June 20.
Copper stockpiles at the London Metal Exchange are down to 3.8 weeks' supply, according to estimates from Bain & Company. Shortages can occur when stockpiles fall to 3.5 weeks' supply, analysts said.
Corn prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade after an Agriculture Department report showed that corn shipments were 38 million bushels for the week that ended July 4, slightly higher than market expectations.
The demand for corn comes amid concerns about the new crop. The Agriculture Department said yesterday that corn crop conditions were unchanged from a week earlier.
The weekly index of conditions showed 61 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition as of Sunday, the same as a week earlier. Many analysts had expected that number to be 63 to 65 percent.
Corn for July delivery gained 6 cents, to $5.37 a bushel, after earlier touching a record $5.465. Corn for December delivery, reflecting the fall crop, rose as much as 5 cents a bushel before closing at $3.50 a bushel, down 3.5 cents.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices End the Day Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended virtually unchanged yesterday, as a market still reeling from a sharp selloff on Friday paused to ponder what a strong jobs report meant for interest rates.
After tumbling 2 25/32 in a half-session on Friday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday at 85 19/32, to yield 7.18 percent. 
 Friday's selloff followed a report that showed 239,000 new jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month, much more than had been expected. The report revived fears that the economy was expanding at a clip fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to intervene and raise short-term interest rates quickly, in an effort to keep inflation from accelerating.
Early in the session yesterday, the market continued to price in a rate increase expected before the Fed's next policy meeting on Aug. 20.
"A 50-basis-point move at the Aug. 20 F.O.M.C. meeting is a given," said Peter McTeague, an analyst with MCM Tradewatch, a Boston research and analysis firm. "The risk is that it happens between now and then." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Despite concerns about a rate increase coming sooner and sharper than expected, traders said they saw very little follow-through selling from Friday. Bargain hunting and short-covering helped stabilize the market yesterday.
The lack of fresh economic news until Friday, when the June producer prices report is released, will weigh on bond prices, Mr. McTeague said.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A., a financial consulting firm, said that there was some covering by short-sellers yesterday when the market approached the psychological support level of 7.25 percent in the 30-year bond. Short-sellers borrow securities and sell them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit. When prices rise, they try to limit their losses by buying the securities, or covering their positions.
"But dealers are still concerned about finding buyers for next month's supply, period," Mr. Stiles said.
The Treasury is scheduled to sell $10 billion of new 10-year notes today.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the 10-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.05 percent.
With the bearish tone of the market and expectations of a rate increase by the Fed, a number of market participants may be expected to avoid the auction.
"The investment community is asking, 'Why buy at levels we have already seen a month ago?' " Mr. Stiles said.
But some investors may find the 7 percent or better yield on the notes attractive.
Among the things working against the 10-year note auction is that the market has had little time to prepare for an auction, after a week marked by the Fourth of July holiday, the Fed's policy meeting and the employment report.
At the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction yesterday, short-term rates were up, as the average rate for a three-month bill increased by 9 basis points, to 5.21 percent, and the rate for a six-month maturity increased by 19 basis points, to 5.41 percent.
Analysts said the bid-to-cover ratios were weak; noncompetitive bids, however, were decent because of the higher returns. Over all, the auction results were short of acceptable. The bid-to-cover ratio is the total dollar amount of all bids for the issue divided by the size of the auction and is regarded as a measure of demand.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.683	97.265	Discounted Rate	5.21%	5.41%	Coupon Yield	5.35%	5.64%	High Price	98.688	97.280	Discounted Rate	5.19%	5.38%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.61%	Low Price	98.683	97.265	Discounted Rate	5.21%	5.41%	Coupon Yield	5.35%	5.64%	Accepted at low price	63%	40%	Total applied for	$43,456,701	$46,226,893	Accepted	$14,580,471	$14,591,393	Noncompetitive	$1,376,263	$1,340,140	

Both issues are dated July 11, 1996. The three-month bills mature on Oct. 10, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on Jan. 9, 1997.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Is Increasing At Slower Rate

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The growth in consumer debt slowed sharply in May, climbing at an annual rate of just 4.9 percent. Some economists attributed the slowdown to a tightening of credit standards by lenders worried about rising delinquency rates.
The Federal Reserve said today that the May increase in debt followed a 7.2 percent rate of gain in April and that both were the slowest increases since mid-1993. The May advance left total consumer debt, defined as loans not secured by real estate, at $1.15 trillion, up $4.7 billion from April. 
 Consumer debt had been rising at double-digit rates for much of the last year as credit card companies competing for business offered attractive enticements for new customers. But economists said lenders have become more cautious in recent months as delinquency rates have been on the rise.
"The credit card companies are tightening their standards," said Paul Getman, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "They are offering fewer new credit lines than they were just six months ago."
Mr. Getman predicted that consumer spending would begin to slow if lenders continued to tighten credit standards. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity and has been the major driving force behind the current expansion.
David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said he also expected consumer spending to slow in coming months but not by a large enough amount to threaten the recovery.
"We are not seeing a major swing in credit habits," he said. "We are seeing a minor swing as the consumer becomes a bit more cautious."
The category of consumer credit that includes credit cards rose at an annual rate of 16.1 percent in May, down from a rate of 20.3 percent in April. The increase left debt in this category at $444.4 billion, a gain of $5.9 billion from April.
The slowdown was more pronounced for auto loans, which rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in May, compared with an increase of 10.8 percent in April. The May advance left auto debt standing at $360.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Gazans' Plea to Netanyahu: Stop Closing Us Out of Jobs

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: GAZA

 BODY:
In Jerusalem and Washington, people ask whether Benjamin Netanyahu will withdraw from the Golan Heights, share Jerusalem or permit the Palestinians a state. These are among the questions likely to be on the agenda on Tuesday when Mr. Netanyahu pays his first visit to the White House since his election as Prime Minister.
But in the teeming Jabaliya refugee camp here, the men squatting by the side of an unpaved and cluttered street ask only one thing: Will he lift the "closure"? 
 "Closure" is Israel's barring of Palestinians from leaving the overcrowded stretch of sand dunes known as the Gaza Strip to work in Israel.
Such border closings have been imposed on Gaza's million Palestinians to one degree or another for 11 months in the two years since they were granted self-rule, and continuously since two suicide bombings killed 27 people in Israel on Feb. 25.
The restrictions have prevented thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank from working in Israel, but have been devastating for the Gaza Strip, which is more dependent on Israel as a source of jobs. About 70,000 Gazans made a living doing menial work in Israel. In the last two years, even when the closings have been lifted, Israel has rarely issued more than about 20,000 work permits.
"We would like the closure to be lifted, but our freedom is much more important to us," one of the men, Marwan, began telling a reporter, only to be quickly interrupted by angry retorts from the others.
"You don't help yourself by lying," barked Rafik, 27. "Say the truth. If you ask people what is important, it is closure. Only closure. Not Jerusalem. Not a Palestinian state. There's not enough food, no medicine. Come to my house -- we have more than 16 people living in two rooms."
Soon the mandatory tray of sweet coffee was brought and several more men joined in, forming a circle on carpets laid on the sand.
Barefoot children swarmed around, the boldest of them occasionally breaking into the circle to get a closer look at the outsider.
"It's true," Marwan acknowledged. "We want to eat more than we want politics. The last time I worked in Israel was in December 1994. I used to earn 120 shekels a day" -- about $40 -- "as a construction worker. I haven't had any work since. I have three children. We are living with my parents. What do I do? Sit around, play chess."
A young man interjected in English: "They all say, 'God will not forget us.' " He was Khalas, a student from Bir Zeit University in the West Bank who was forcibly sent home three months ago by the Israelis and, like all other Gazans studying in the West Bank, has not been allowed back since.
He bitterly denounced the Palestinian Authority, the governing body led by Yasir Arafat.
"The only reason I'm studying is to get out of here, to America, Canada, anywhere," he said. "I refuse to sit here with the thieves of the Authority, with no democracy. The occupation was better. During the uprising, the whole world supported us. Now they say: 'You have your rights. Go to your Authority.' If the occupation came back, I'd welcome it."
The comments were translated into Arabic, and a nervous murmur spread. All the men knew of Eyad Sarraj, the Palestinian psychologist who was twice jailed by Mr. Arafat's police for saying things like this to the American press. The men were only partly reassured when promised that their surnames would not be published.
"It is not true," declared an older man, who was introduced as an official of the Palestinian Authority. "Israel destroyed our infrastructure to the ground, and the Authority is doing things -- it is paving roads."
"I don't see any pavement," Rafik interrupted, bringing on a round of derisive laughter. "The only thing men think of here is getting daily food, only how to survive.
"We don't meddle in politics. Netanyahu may be worse from a political side, but if he opens the checkpoints, he's better than Peres."
The mention of Shimon Peres, the former Israeli Prime Minister, set off another boisterous argument. To these men, the sacrifices they endured since late February were supposed to be their contribution to getting Mr. Peres re-elected, and it was understood that he would then open the gates. He lost, and before leaving office lifted the closing only to a few thousand workers.
Since Mr. Netanyahu was sworn in, he and Israeli Army chiefs have raised new hopes by hinting that they want to let as many as 70,000 Palestinians work in Israel.
One reason is that the Romanian, Thai and other foreign workers imported to do the menial labor formerly done by Palestinians are proving troublesome, officials say.
A police report published by the daily Haaretz noted a steady and steep increase in violence, alcoholism, prostitution and crime among the foreigners. The report said that in addition to 100,000 foreigners legally in Israel, there are at least as many working illegally.
There is also a question whether the border closings really contribute to security. Gideon Ezra, a new member of Parliament from Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party and a former officer of the internal secret service used to combat Palestinian militants, startled Likud supporters by asserting that the closings were primarily a psychological measure to reassure Israelis, and that they were largely useless for security.
He noted that no suicide bombings had been carried out by laborers with valid permits. Mr. Ezra said the closings were creating dangerous pressure in Gaza, and urged that they be lifted.
In all, the United Nations has estimated that each day that Gaza has been sealed off has meant $5 million to $6 million in lost earnings for residents. Many families have been living on as little as $100 a month.
Even when closings were lifted, the men said, there was the struggle to get a work permit. Often, they said, that meant paying a $300 bribe.
A new man, Abdullah, joined the group, and soon his anger took the forefront.
"I'm so frustrated I don't want to talk about these things," he said. "I have eight children. My wife is pregnant. I have had no work since Israel. My wife had a gold bracelet -- I sold it. Come, come see how we live!"
The entire group rose and followed Abdullah, 38, down a reeking alley and into a cramped hovel consisting of one room, a small roofed yard and a toilet.
Some 74,000 Palestinians are crowded into Jabaliya's half square mile, the most heavily populated of the refugee camps in Gaza and the West Bank. Barefoot children are everywhere, a visible confirmation of the recent United Nations finding that Gaza -- along with the sultanate of Oman on the Arabian peninsula -- has the highest rate of population growth in the world.
"I used to pick oranges in Ashdod," Abdullah said. "I could make 60 to 80 shekels a day," about 20 to 25 dollars. "When Arafat came to Gaza, I ululated, I danced in the street. Now nobody cares. I'm tired, really tired."
An old woman piped up: "He's not telling everything. He had to send some of his children to live with his in-laws." Abdullah dropped his head.
"I am telling you from the heart," he said, "I fight with my wife for no reason, I beat my children. My son is a man now. Where should he sleep? Between me and his mother? God help us."
The problem is endemic, said Dr. Fadel Abu Hein, a psychologist working for Unicef, the United Nations agency for children, in Gaza. "The closures have brought more intercommunal violence, more aggression, more depression, more child abuse, more woman abuse, more bitter humor," he said in an interview.
"During the uprising," he said, "there was a sense of being together under pressure, of jointly facing problems and the enemy. Now there's nothing to do, no work, no way to satisfy the family's needs.
"Last week, a man committed suicide after he saw his son rummaging through garbage for food. The man began to cry, poured kerosene over himself and set himself on fire."

HEADLINE: Sharon Joins Netanyahu's Cabinet at Last

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 8

 BODY:
After weeks of political haggling and last-minute crises, Ariel Sharon was sworn in as a Cabinet minister today, strengthening the hard line in Israel's new Government as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington to meet President Clinton.
The Israeli Parliament voted 58 to 33 with 1 abstention to approve Mr. Netanyahu's appointment of Mr. Sharon, 68, a hawkish former general and Defense Minister who bitterly opposes the Israeli-Palestinian accords and is a forceful advocate of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
 Mr. Sharon will head a newly created National Infrastructures Ministry, one of the largest portfolios in the Government, with sweeping powers lopped off from other ministries.
Mr. Netanyahu, who is likely to include Mr. Sharon in an inner "security cabinet," said he expected him to be involved in areas beyond the wide scope of his ministry.
"The addition of Ariel Sharon to the Government will benefit us greatly," Mr. Netanyahu told Parliament over heckling by opposition lawmakers, "not only in developing the infrastructure of the state for the future, but also in the areas of security and policy, given his rich experience. He contributed to previous Governments, and he will contribute much to this Government."
There was no immediate public comment from Mr. Sharon, who only smiled as he lumbered out of the Parliament chamber after the vote.
Among the powers given to Mr. Sharon's ministry is responsibility for negotiating water arrangements with neighboring Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority.
But the transfer of other authority was resisted by several ministers, especially from religious parties, who balked at surrendering departments under their control.
From the Housing Ministry controlled by the United Torah Judaism party, Mr. Sharon will receive the Lands Administration and Public Works Department, large agencies responsible for state lands and road-building, including bypass roads for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
The Energy and Infrastructure Ministry, which was assigned to the National Religious Party and which oversees fuel supplies and electric power, will be dismantled and merged with Mr. Sharon's office.
He will also take over management of ports and railroads from the Transport Ministry, also assigned to the National Religious Party; water supply from the Agriculture Ministry, given to Tsomet, a part of the Likud-led bloc, and mineral resources from the Ministry of Industry and Trade, a fief of the party of Russian immigrants.
By creating this vast domain for Mr. Sharon, Mr. Netanyahu paid off a political debt and solved a problem that had dogged him in his first weeks in office.
Mr. Sharon had helped Mr. Netanyahu get elected by brokering an alliance with Foreign Minister David Levy, who had originally planned to run for Prime Minister himself.
When Mr. Netanyahu formed a Cabinet without Mr. Sharon, Mr. Levy threatened to stay out, and warned that he would resign if a solution was not found by the time Mr. Netanyahu left for Washington.
But by including Mr. Sharon, Mr. Netanyahu risks challenges to his authority from a strong-willed and powerful minister whose hawkish views might clash with attempts to follow a more pragmatic line.
Mr. Netanyahu, for example, has said that he would abide by the accords with the Palestinians if they do, and would consider meeting Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, if necessary. Mr. Sharon has condemned the agreements as "terrible and dangerous" and calls Mr. Arafat a terrorist and war criminal.
Mr. Netanyahu also pushed through a $1.5 billion cut in the budget today, and told Parliament that he would soon introduce measures to speed up the "liberalization" of the Israeli economy and the sale of Government-owned enterprises.
"I intend to inform the President of the United States and those I will talk to in the American business community that Israel has a new Government with a new economic policy," he said. "I definitely intend to attract here new investments and new investors."

HEADLINE: Study Says Job Cuts Rose 28% in First Half

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 8

 BODY:
The number of job cuts jumped 28 percent in the first half of 1996, a study said today. But the study by Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an outplacement firm, also contained some good news for American workers: Some companies that cut hundreds of thousands of jobs earlier in the 1990's are hiring again.
The firm said companies announced 270,513 job cuts in the first half of 1996, up from 211,771 in the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent over the comparable period in 1993, the biggest job-loss year of the decade. 
 "I think the pressures on companies to cut costs and to make layoffs are really immense," said John Challenger, executive vice president of the Chicago-based firm, which helps companies find new jobs for workers being laid off.
Mr. Challenger said in an interview that he expected companies to continue cutting back, but said some companies that had been cutting jobs were hiring again.
The study said the number of job cuts announced in the first half of 1996 exceeded the 254,878 announced in the first half of 1993, when more than 615,000 jobs were lost for the full year.
Telecommunications took the biggest hit of any industry, announcing cuts of 42,754 jobs, or nearly 16 percent of the total, the report said. After telecommunications, food, computers, retail and automotive were the biggest job cutters.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
The city is as up front as it ever was, for it can deny neither its purpose nor its psychology.
 -- Michael Ventura
Unlike millions of Americans who come here each year seeking a windfall, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have found a way to beat the proverbial Vegas odds. In the 1996 election, both candidates and parties are raking in Las Vegas money as never before, taking record contributions from gambling interests in this desert boom town. 
 As always in the casinos, however, the real game is largely hidden, and it's the house that wins in the end. Pursuing national influence that the gamblers of the Old Strip never presumed, the new Vegas connections have become an unprecedented force in American politics, with the public's losses yet to be tallied.
In June 1995, then Senator Dole went to Shadow Creek, the gambling mogul Steve Wynn's 320-acre, $48 million private golf course near Las Vegas, a guarded preserve where the staff is sworn to secrecy and the few guest players, who are required to have a minimum $100,000 credit line at one of the Wynn casinos, are served caviar on the fairway. But Mr. Dole had no trouble gaining entry. At a $5,000-a-plate luncheon with gambling executives and other wealthy Las Vegans, the Senator raised a half-million dollars. Guests included Frank Fertitta and Blake Sartini of the Station Casinos and Jack Binion of Binion's Horseshoe Club.
In 1994, Mr. Wynn was also the host at a breakfast that gave $540,000 to the Republicans to capture Congress. As documented by the Center for Public Integrity, in Washington, that cash was only a fraction of nearly $5 million that Vegas interests have poured into national races as well as "soft money" coffers of both parties since 1991. Mr. Wynn has personally raised more than a million dollars for the Dole candidacy, including some $90,000 from his family and employees. By April 1996, gambling interests had contributed eight times more money to this year's campaign than in 1992.
Republicans were initially ahead in Vegas winnings, but the Democrats soon hit their jackpot. On June 9, President Clinton attended a lunch at the home of The Las Vegas Sun editor, Brian Greenspun, a longtime friend of his and sometime Shadow Creek golfer whose wife, Myra, had recently given $35,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Dark-windowed limousines jammed the streets of Green Valley, a suburb built on Howard Hughes land, as powerful Las Vegans ate salmon catered by Spago at $25,000 a couple. Executives of the Sands, Bally and Circus Circus, as well as the same Steve Wynn, gave some $650,000 to the Democrats.
Behind all this bipartisan good fortune are enormous stakes. Las Vegas leads the pervasive expansion of gambling throughout the United States. Amid the fiscal ravages of the 1980's, more and more states and localities turned to gambling for basic revenue, and the industry now wields the attendant political influence not only here in Nevada but in 47 other states as well.
In what the author Robert Goodman calls "the pathology of hope," Americans are gambling their money as never before -- and losing more than $40 billion a year. Uncertain of the present and future, suffering "a collapse of confidence in the utility of work," as A. Alvarez wrote in The New York Review of Books, we now spend six times more on gambling than all other spectator sports combined, more on slot machines, cards and numbers rackets than on movies.
"We're not U.S. Steel," a colleague of Mr. Wynn's was quoted as saying, about the industry's still shady image. Indeed, it also stands to be bigger. With 30 to 50 percent profits, double the average of most businesses, the trillion-dollar gambling industry is a power like few others in the nation's history, and its indisputable headquarters is Las Vegas.
To up the ante, the Vegas connections, including a powerful new Washington lobby, intervene in government more overtly than ever. "In the old days, casino owners just gave money to politicians and stayed in the background," John L. Smith, a columnist for The Las Vegas Review-Journal, said in an interview. "Now it's an open orgy of power. If politicians don't give back what they want, they run them out."
While Vegas casinos boast "government relations" departments and conduct polling for candidates, the industry's new American Gaming Association lobbies Washington under the direction of Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Dole intimate. Vegas influence is also wielded by Republican notables like former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, a senior consultant to Mr. Dole, and by the candidate's finance chairman, John A. Moran, an associate of Mr. Wynn in philanthropic causes.
The industry's cash and lobbying have concentrated on two issues. In 1994, the White House floated a 4 percent Federal gaming tax as part of welfare reform; the potential billions from such a levy might also have slashed the deficit. Mr. Dole opposed the tax, which casino owners have likened to a reign of terror. Then, after what The Los Angeles Times described as a "fierce lobbying effort," including several senators and Congressmen besieging the White House, Mr. Clinton quickly abandoned his proposal.
In Las Vegas last month, the President disowned the tax as an idea of "someone well down" in the Treasury Department. "That was never a recommendation of my Cabinet," he told The Las Vegas Sun, "much less of anyone in the White House."
Meanwhile, Vegas interests still face a grass-roots backlash against gambling, embodied in an unusual alliance that includes the Christian Coalition, race track owners and liberal activists. Working with little money, the anti-gambling coalition has recently defeated the industry in more than 20 local referendums on the expansion of gambling, and has seized on the growing public concern over issues of addiction, increased crime and a general corrupting influence associated with gambling.
Congress is considering a Gambling Impact Study Commission to examine gambling's social effects. The industry has reason to fear such an inquiry into what many believe is gambling's scavenger economy: taking billions while giving back nothing of social or economic value.
But what Las Vegas seems to fear most is the commission's potential subpoena power, according to Bill Eadington of the University of Nevada Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. Such power would afford for the first time a comprehensive probe into accusations of hidden casino ownership, profit-skimming, possible money laundering and organized-crime ties, and other corruption haunting the industry since its inception.
Saying it is scrupulously above-board and has been for many years, the new Vegas has spent millions over the past decade to change its public face from "gambling" to "gaming," from "joints" to "resorts," from "nude revues" to "family entertainment."
Despite the breadth of the anti-gambling coalition, Las Vegas has prevailed on the issue of subpoena power. The morning after dining with Mr. Wynn last April in Las Vegas, Speaker Newt Gingrich told a Republican fund-raiser at Mr. Wynn's Mirage that the bill on the study "should be modified," as The Washington Post recorded his remarks, "so that the commission does not have the power to issue subpoenas."
He vowed to eliminate effective subpoena power in the final House-Senate conference committee version of the legislation. For his part, Mr. Dole had quietly supported a Senate bill in which subpoena power, as Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois put it, was "completely gutted."
Not to be left out, Mr. Clinton pledged during his June 9 visit here that he would not allow a "witch hunt" of gambling. He assured casino owners that he backed the emasculated Gingrich-Dole version of the commission's subpoena power.
Among the many influential political contributors in Las Vegas, the most visible figure is Mr. Wynn, who swiftly rose from modest means to spectacular wealth with the help of $160 million in Michael Milken's junk bonds and the patronage of E. Parry Thomas, a local banker with access to millions in Teamsters funds.
In 1982, the British Government denied Mr. Wynn a gambling license after New Scotland Yard investigated allegations of business ties to organized crime. (The inquiry was inconclusive but found the accusations "so numerous and significant that it would be impossible to accept coincidence as a reasonable explanation.") But he has angrily denied such connections, and New Jersey officials, reviewing much the same record, subsequently granted Mr. Wynn's licensing there.
Mr. Wynn admits he has been protean in his political wagers. Within weeks of addressing Nevada Republicans and extolling Mr. Dole as a "good, solid-thinking" man, the multimillionaire was promising to raise six-figure donations for Mr. Clinton. The switch reportedly coincided not simply with Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls but with a golf game in late May.
Democratic Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada arranged for the President and Mr. Wynn to play together at the Congressional Country Club in Washington. The round took place just days before Mr. Wynn moved his bet to the President. "I'm just one of those fence-jumpers," the casino magnate joked with a local reporter. "I just see which way the wind's blowing." By the end of June, however, there were other reports from Mr. Wynn's corporate spokesman that Mr. Wynn was still supporting Mr. Dole.
This does not mean that Mr. Clinton is losing out in the money game in Las Vegas. One of his longtime chief fund-raisers in Las Vegas is Elias Ghanem, an enterprising 57-year-old doctor whose rise to prominence began as an on-call doctor for V.I.P.'s, including Elvis Presley, and others at the Las Vegas Hilton. Today, Dr. Ghanem, who was close to Mr. Clinton's late mother, owns a chain of medical clinics and is a member of the Nevada Athletic Commission.
Beyond the politics of Las Vegas and its colorful characters lie deeper issues about the influence of this place and the ethic and future it represents -- what the writer A. Alvarez called "the Las Vegasing of America." In a Psychology Today article, the writer Michael Ventura paints an equally dark picture, claiming that the heedless rise of Las Vegas is rooted in "the appalling cost we pay for the dominance of money."
But if Las Vegas is worried about a ruling industry that creates nothing as it consumes a national fortune, it is not evident here. The Vegas backers of both candidates are watching a 1996 race in which they have all their bets covered. Some of the money they take each year from the hopeful masses is now given to hopeful politicians to keep the games going. That cash and the power it buys have made Las Vegas a kind of shadow capital, in political as well as socioeconomic terms, and the masters of this city know a good thing when they see it.
No matter what happens in the next election, the Vegas connections win.

HEADLINE: An Old Story for Migrant Farm Workers;
Advocates Fear a New State Code Will Have Little Impact on Their Hardships

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: PINE ISLAND, N.Y., July 5

 BODY:
It's high season here in the black dirt mucklands. The air smells like sweet young onions, rows of green shoots stretch clear to forever and the migrant workers have tons to do.
They hit the fields by dawn and spend 12 to 13 hours inching their way through dirt hot as beach sand. Weed now, harvest later. The job doesn't change from year to year, and neither, for that matter, does the life. 
 When they leave the fields, in school buses the bosses send around, most farm workers retreat to cinder-block barracks or trailers or mobile homes or shacklike little bungalows plopped down on the edges of the farms. There are camps here, 50 miles from New York City in southeastern Orange County, that look straight out of the days of Tom Joad. After work, 20 men will line up to use one shower. Workers take turns using washstands to scrub the pesticide residue from their clothes. A few camps still use outhouses.
This is an old story, really. But surprisingly little seems to have changed over the decades for migrant workers here or anywhere else in the nation. Things have improved since 1960, when Edward R. Murrow's CBS documentary "Harvest of Shame" exposed the hard life of migrant laborers. But farm workers still earn the least amount of money working the hardest jobs with the worst living conditions of any other group. They remain hidden, forgotten workers for one of the country's most powerful industries.
No one really complains. The migrant workers who make their way up to New York from Mexico, Central America and the Southeast (their numbers are estimated at from 5,000 to 10,000 in the Hudson Valley, 25,000 to 75,000 throughout New York State) hope for lots of work with a free room and little else. From about April to November, that's what they get. There is no movement, as there is in California, to form unions. "It would be nice to take a good shower once in a while," a worker said after spending 13 hours in lettuce fields. "Guess I have to wait until I get back to Mexico."
New York's housing code for migrant-worker camps has not changed in 28 years. Now, after three years of study, the State Health Department has proposed new regulations that are expected to become law at the end of the month. The two most dramatic changes would phase out outhouses and require smoke detectors in all housing in the 430 state farms with regulated worker camps. In instances where the state code is less stringent than the Federal migrant housing code (states are allowed to use their own codes), the Federal standards would be adopted.
But there are loopholes. The proposed code would allow farmers to seek waivers from any of the new regulations. They would also let local officials waive inspections during the worker season in camps that they deem have operated up to code for two years. And some code requirements -- like a minimum ceiling height of seven and a half feet or a minimum temperature of 70 degrees -- apply only to new construction.
To the New York Farm Bureau, the state's largest lobbying group for agricultural interests, the proposed regulations make sense. "This has been a reasonable effort by the Department of Health," said David Fellows, the bureau's associate director for policy research and analysis. "It's moving in the right direction of streamlining the code and improving conditions."
But advocates for farm workers are outraged. They say the proposed regulations do more to protect the state's largest money-making industry and Gov. George E. Pataki's most powerful upstate constituency, than to reform deplorable housing conditions for a group of largely invisible, mostly immigrant, transients.
Dan Getman, a lawyer for Farmworker Legal Services of New York in New Paltz, calls the proposed regulations an "abdication of responsibility" on the part of the Health Department. "One outrage is the new provision to not require hot water for dish washing," he said. "It only says hot water should be accessible, as in heating water on the stove. It's an insult."
Mr. Getman said he is particularly incensed at the provision that waives inspections when workers are in the camps. "I'm not aware of anything in life that works like this," he said. "I suspect that this was created as a gift to the farmers, and what a gift it is."
Conditions on farms vary widely. In Orange County, one of the nation's largest producers of onions, cabbage and lettuce, a few camps look like roadside motels. Most are cinder-block barracks, with showers in a separate building. One has a basketball court.
In one of the worst-looking camps, five men share a corrugated aluminum-covered building with no indoor toilet, no heat and an ancient stove with two working burners. (This actually meets the current code, two working burners for every 10 residents, and the proposed code, two burners for every five.)
Several hundred feet from the shelter, past a wall of mosquitoes, down a rocky incline, stands a double outhouse. In the shelter, there is a trickly shower that spits out tepid water that the men say leaves a film. They live here six months a year.
A woman in one of the nicer camps -- farm workers were interviewed on the condition that neither their names nor the names of farms would be mentioned -- was annoyed that the issue of conditions was being explored. Speaking in Spanish, she said the press just stirs up trouble.
Aspacio Alcantara, of the Independent Farmworkers Center in the Orange County village of Florida, an organization that helps migrants in the Hudson Valley, said workers are always worried that publicity could hurt them. "They are most concerned about keeping their jobs," he said.
If workers understood how essential they are to the industry -- most farmers say they could not function without them -- they might be less timid about asking for better terms. (Working conditions may be worse than the housing. Most farm workers make minimum wage, $4.25, with no overtime pay, for a job that the General Accounting Office ranks, with mining, as the most hazardous occupation.) Instead, Mr. Alcantara said, they believe that with one complaint, they would be out.
Several years ago, after a newspaper ran an expose about the housing on a local farm, authorities closed the camp. Now the workers on that farm rent rooms in Middletown, about 10 miles away. Farm workers consider this a cautionary tale. Renting is expensive and most workers don't have cars. They ride bicycles or walk to the village, three miles away, to buy food at a farm workers' grocery store, cash their checks at the local supermarket or make phone calls home.
Most nights, there is a wait of an hour long for the phone at the Farmworkers Center.
Under the proposed housing code, workers must have access to "an adequate communication system for summoning help," but the regulations give no distance specifications.
There is really nothing to do in the camps but get ready for work. Few workers can afford a television and the antenna one would require. Most speak only Spanish, and a cassette player for listening to music is considered a necessity. After work, most of the workers shower, eat and sit around waiting for bedtime. Some drink.
No one will say a bad word about the job or housing in front of a stranger or even an acquaintance. When Mr. Alcantara approached the men in the corrugated aluminum shelter, they all smiled nervously.
"How is everything, my friends?" Mr. Alcantara said in Spanish. "Todo esta bien" ("Everything is fine"), the men said, one after the other. It was as though they practiced it.

HEADLINE: A Wave of Casinos Hits Mississippi's Gulf Coast;
Las Vegas Operators Hope to Build Biloxi Into a Top-Tier Gambling Port

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss.

 BODY:
Here in the South's Monte Carlo among the magnolias, casino companies are transforming the Mississippi coast from a strip of decaying motels and dilapidated mansions into the nation's hottest new gambling hub.
Industry executives come to check out their rivals' projects, bump into each other and then waste no time in augmenting their already ambitious plans. Four 1,000-room hotels are now being built, and a fifth is planned. Mirage Resorts, vowing to outdo all comers, announced a $200 million, 1,000-room hotel and casino last fall, raised the stakes in April to $325 million and 1,200 rooms and then upped them again in May to $475 million and 1,800 rooms -- more than any hotel in Atlantic City can boast. 
 Mirage says the extravagance that succeeded in Las Vegas can triumph again in Biloxi. "We have never gone into a market and not overbuilt," boasted Barry Shier, chief executive of the company's Golden Nugget division. In a golf shirt and gold watch, he leaned over a model of his Biloxi project -- named Beau Rivage, or beautiful shore -- set up in a room at a rival Grand Casino hotel here that is also expanding. "Here are the live oaks," he said, pointing. "And we'll have magnolias, dogwoods and azaleas. Formal gardens and fountains."
And that's just the landscaping indoors.
All this and much more is coming to the steamy coastline of a city with no scheduled jet service and whose sleepy downtown still relies mostly on stop signs and blinking red lights to control traffic.
As a backlash slows the spread of legalized gambling, the casino industry is throwing most of its resources into states that welcome it. And Mississippi, desperate and poor, sees the business as its economic savior. It has enacted some of the most liberal gambling laws, with unlimited licenses for dockside casinos, this side of Reno.
The casino industry is also drawn by the state's beaches and year-round golfing and fishing. "There are only three viable gaming markets," said Sarah Ralston, a spokeswoman for Circus Circus Enterprises, a pioneer in turning casino hotels into family resorts. "Las Vegas, of course. Atlantic City, of course. And now, the Gulf Coast of Mississippi."
The casino companies hail the Mississippi gambling boom -- extending upstate to Tunica County, an easy drive from Memphis -- as a testament to free markets. Politicians here, they say, have avoided the quarrels and meddling that slowed Atlantic City's growth and helped kill plans for the world's largest casino in New Orleans.
Like free markets everywhere, Mississippi's has winners and losers. After casino licenses were first awarded in 1992, major companies like Mirage stood by as smaller, often local operators made their mistakes. But now they are rushing in.
Grand Casinos Inc. is expanding its two casino hotels in Biloxi and nearby Gulfport to 1,000 rooms each. Imperial Palace, which owns a major Las Vegas resort, is building another 1,000-roomer here with a 30-story tower, the tallest in the state. Circus Circus wants to be next with an equally tall 1,400-room hotel, and Boyd Gaming is noisily sniffing around.
The risks are as visible here as the Gold Shore casino sign that towers over a vacant, weed-grown parking lot. Steel-pipe moorings jut purposelessly out of the sea, the gambling boat they once held nowhere to be seen.
The Gold Shore wasn't the only failure. The new Golden Nugget casino will be on the site of the Biloxi Belle, which promised "Old South charm and elegance" but delivered a New South bankruptcy filing. The Palace Casino nearby is still operating but has sought bankruptcy protection. Among its handicaps: no hotel and not enough capital to compete with the big boys. "Just like Vegas, what was big one day is now the smaller property today," said Howard J. Reinhardt, the Palace Casino's general manager.
James J. Murren, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, says that only about half the coast's current and planned casinos will survive. "If you don't have the right location or you're poorly capitalized you don't have a chance," he said. He cited blunders by even the larger companies: Imperial Palace's poorly chosen site away from the gulf beaches ("Blow it up") and Mirage's investment of too much too soon ("Overkill").
But Mr. Murren counts on Mirage to generate about half of its $350 million in annual Biloxi revenue by drawing new visitors to the casino.
Even though analysts say the Gulf Coast will soon become a $1 billion gambling market -- nearly half the total for the whole state -- Las Vegas, with $5.7 billion, and Atlantic City, with $3.7 billion, will remain far larger.
Not everybody here celebrated Mississippi's building boom. Police officials and social workers say that on the coast, as elsewhere, the growth of gambling has led to higher rates of divorce, crime and personal bankruptcy. Others in Biloxi hate to see their sleepy town bristling with hotel towers and crowded with traffic.
Casino companies answer in economic terms. While the older, smaller casinos drew heavily on locals who gambled money that might have gone to other businesses in the area, the larger casinos want to entice overnight visitors from out of state.
Casino executives like Mr. Shier of Mirage say they can succeed where others have failed because their companies have more experience and money. Under Steven A. Wynn, its chief executive, Mirage led Las Vegas's comeback by building some of the world's largest hotels, featuring pirates battling on full-sized ships and a volcano with scheduled eruptions. Now, Mr. Wynn wants to do the same for Atlantic City, with a $2.5 billion plan, and for the Gulf Coast, where he plans to open in early 1998.
For now, out-of-state gamblers have to fly to New Orleans or Mobile, Ala., and hop a commuter plane or rent a car to reach Biloxi. Already, local officials are negotiating with the airlines to offer direct service. Casino executives predict the airlines will want to meet the demand as one resort after another opens with a burst of advertising throughout the South. "There's no reason it couldn't become a national destination," said Denis O'Brien, regional manager for Grand Casinos Inc. "I even find people from California who can pronounce Biloxi."
Westerners, however, can more easily pronounce -- and visit -- Las Vegas. The Mississippi coast must content itself by drawing gamblers from the rest of the Southeast, parts of Texas and, especially in winter, the Middle West. With all the new construction, said Wade Ragas, director of the University of New Orleans Real Estate Research Center, "There's not enough population within a day's drive to support the gambling market."
Marketers must also persuade visitors that the coast offers more than cramped, cheesy riverboats. State laws have been loosened to the point where, while casinos still must float, they don't ever have to move. The newest are just vast boxes built on flotillas of barges welded together and permanently moored. At the Grand Casino in Biloxi, doors, passages and entryways from the hotel and parking lot to the casino all but erase the shoreline.
"That probably is our biggest challenge: making people understand that these are casinos you would see in Las Vegas," Mr. O'Brien said. "You don't know you're on the water."
Grand Casinos has prospered by concentrating its gambling operations on Indian reservations and new markets like the Mississippi coast, where it says its investments will be about as great as those of Mirage.
Along 26 miles of beaches, the casino count so far includes eight in Biloxi, two in Gulfport and two in the Bay St. Louis area. There is no doubt about their economic impact. The average house price rose to nearly $90,000 in 1994 from $68,500 in 1992. Total employment on the coast soared 17 percent, to 159,270 jobs at the end of 1995 from 136,250 three years earlier.
Billboards for the Mississippi casinos begin just outside the New Orleans airport 98 miles away. New Orleans still has riverboat gambling, but construction of the world's largest casino there ceased with a bankruptcy filing in November, due in part to Mississippi competition. Michele N. Moore, a top aide to Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, derides the Mississippi coast as "basically a dressed-up Howard Johnson's."
Well, not exactly. The Imperial Palace Mississippi will look like what might result if the Ming empire had extended to Las Vegas. A 1,018-room, 30-story hotel tower, the tallest building in the state, will feature Oriental motifs like gabled blue-tile roofs and calligraphic sign lettering.
Mike Kelly, the construction manager, ducked under dangling cables as he muttered about the greater cost of building a casino on water. Even at 6 P.M., the clatter of construction continued. Mr. Kelly, proud of his reputation for making everyone scurry and sweat, said it was not even the middle of the second shift.
Though some Biloxi churches still scorn their new neighbors, the region's moral qualms appear to be receding. Even churches run bus trips. Margaret Murphy, playing the nickel slots at Grand Casino, came on one of two 44-passenger buses filled with retirees from St. Dominic's Church in Mobile.
For $12, she gets the bus ride, a 77-item lunch buffet and the show. "You can't beat that for a whole day out," Mrs. Murphy said. In the end, though, the casino almost always comes out ahead. Mrs. Murphy usually bets until she's lost $50, switching to the nickel machines from the quarter machines as her cash runs low.
Grand Casino executives boast of conventions scheduled as far ahead as 2003. Sybil Casso, a volunteer at Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, noted as she gathered her friends in the lobby that the Mississippi coast was host to the Southeastern Hospital Conference for the first time.
A resident of Baton Rouge, La., who owns a Gulfport condominium, Ms. Casso has transferred her loyalties here. She helped steer the convention to the coast and boasts of seeing "Stagestruck," billed as "An Award-Winning Salute to Broadway," at the Grand Casino theater in Biloxi 55 times.
Somehow, Ms. Casso said, Mississippi has mastered the casino business while her home state couldn't. "It's politics as usual in Louisiana," she said. "It's a shame. In Mississippi, they have done it right."

HEADLINE: An Increase in Wages May Hurt Some Teen-Agers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
At one time, Sidewinder Pumps Inc., in Lafayette, La., would hire a dozen or more young people to work each summer at minimum-wage jobs like weeding or expanding the parking lot -- tasks that were not really essential to the company but that let it give teen-agers a taste of what paid work is like.
When the Federal minimum wage went up in the early 1990's, the company cut back to three or four summer workers. And this year, the prospect of another increase led the company to end this quarter-century tradition. "We don't have any part-timers," said Ernie George, a co-owner of Sidewinder. 
 As the Senate prepares to vote today on another round of increases, to $4.75, probably within a month of passage, and then to $5.15 next year, most of the incendiary political and economic debate has dissolved into an inconclusive statistical battle over whether the move will hurt more workers than it helps.
But some economists point to employment figures to argue that however lightly a higher minimum wage may weigh on the economy at large, in the past it has fallen heavily on teen-agers, especially black teen-agers, and on adults with little education. These are groups often also pointed to as having the greatest need to learn basic job habits, such as the importance of showing up regularly and on time.
A look at what happened after the last round of increases -- to $3.80 in April 1990 and to $4.25 in April 1991 -- shows how sharply the bottom end of the job market can contract, especially when this disincentive to hire workers coincides with an economic downturn.
While almost nobody argues that the higher minimum contributed significantly to the latest recession, which was ultimately determined to have lasted from July 1990 to March 1991, the higher wage does seem to have coincided with a marked worsening of the job market for the youngest and least skilled.
In March 1990, just before the Federal Government raised the minimum to $3.80 from $3.35, 47.1 percent of teen-agers had jobs, but that promptly began a slide that carried it down to less than 43 percent a year later, when the $4.25 wage kicked in. The figure then tumbled to 39.8 percent by June 1992 before slowly recovering to 43.2 percent now.
"The timing of the drop in teen-age employment is absolutely coincident with the increase in the minimum, whereas for other groups the recession's bite was delayed," declared Finis Welch, an economics professor at Texas A& M University and a prominent student of the subject.
More evidence of the impact of the higher wage, Professor Welch said, is how acutely teen-agers -- who account for nearly a third of minimum-wage workers -- were affected compared with other demographic groups.
"Based on the reduction in employment of prime-aged men, 35 to 54, teen-age employment fell more than we would have expected" from the study of earlier recessions, Professor Welch said.
Black teen-agers, often most in need of basic job skills, fared even worse. At the beginning of 1990, 28.8 percent of this group held jobs. But lack of hiring and dismissals drove this down to 22.5 percent by January 1991 and to a low of 20.4 percent that August. Not until April 1996 did it recover to 28 percent.
The unemployment rate, a less-favored gauge because it ignores those who stop looking for work, reflected similar distress. Joblessness, which for blacks aged 16 to 19 stood at 27.8 percent at the beginning of 1990, climbed steadily to more than 33 percent in the months following the first installment of the higher minimum wage and then averaged 36.2 percent in 1991 before peaking at 44.6 percent in April 1993.
"Teen-agers shouldered a disproportionate share of the burden" even after allowing for their ranks contracting from demographic trends, said H. Erich Heinemann, an economist at Brimberg & Company, a Wall Street firm. "To a very significant degree," he added, "the 1990-1991 recession was a teen-age recession."
Those who support raising the minimum wage, which is paid more prevalently in the South than in other regions, contend that it will help millions of workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, allowing many to avoid welfare.
They join Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich in dismissing likely job loss as "negligible" and in denying any concentration of effects. "One never knows for particular groups," Mr. Reich said in an interview.
And Joseph E. Stiglitz, head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, insisted, "The evidence is just very ambiguous." If a higher minimum was burdensome enough to employers to force them to trim staff, he asked, why did they not make use of the virtually ignored provision at the time of the last increase that would have allowed them to pay a starting subminimum that was 15 percent less?
Employers said at the time that too much paperwork would be involved, a problem that supporters of a higher minimum dismiss as exaggerated. The latest increases would also include some subminimum.
The idea that an increase in the minimum would cost jobs found a great deal of skepticism as well among a number of black teen-agers working at such jobs yesterday in Silver Spring, Md. That danger appeared remote next to the tangible benefits they saw from what they considered a long-overdue increase.
"I know plenty of kids who are trying to save money for college and other things, so any increase in the minimum wage will be greatly appreciated," said Lamont Smith, who will begin college this fall.
A co-worker chimed in: "I don't know what all the fuss is about. This increase can go a long way to helping me get to the next level."
But some have found the 1990-91 experience persuasive. "The last increase turned out to be a cruel joke for low-skilled teen-age workers," said James W. Coons, economist at the Huntington National Bank, based in Columbus, Ohio.
 
Minimum Wage: Who Earns It
Workers earning the minimum wage tend to be young, with just over half of those earning $4.25 or less under 25 years old and one-third of them teen-agers. Among teen-agers paid by the hour, about 20 percent earned the minimum or less -- some workers are exempt from the law's provisions -- compared with only 3 percent of workers 25 and over who earned the minimum or less.
In all, 3.7 million workers earn $4.25 or less and additional millions would presumably benefit from an increase because they earn between $4.25 and the proposed $5.15. The highest concentration is in retail trade, where 55 percent of minimum-wage workers are employed.m
Geographically, the South had the highest proportion of minimum-wage workers and the Northeast the lowest.

HEADLINE: NYC;
People . . . Who Needs People?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
THE atomization of New York life continues with no relief in sight, the latest threat to person-to-person contact coming from the phone company.
If you haven't called 411 lately, you may be unfamiliar with a new Nynex automated system, installed months ago in counties north of New York City but introduced to the five boroughs only in mid-June. When you now dial information -- er, punch directory assistance -- you get a recording that asks "What city?" and then "What listing?" Assuming you haven't been left speechless by the unexpected mechanical voice, you say "Manhattan" and then "Acme Widget Company." In short order, a real operator gets on the line to ask if that's the Acme Widget outlet on Lex or the one on Broadway, then hooks you up to another machine that provides the phone number. 
 This is all for efficiency's sake. While you're blabbing your details into the phone, the operator is finishing up with someone else. She or he does not miss a beat in turning attention to you, because your information already appears on a screen. It saves a few seconds per call, and since the average 411 operator handles 950 calls a day, that can add up to big savings. Nothing has really changed for the customer, said John Bonomo, an affable Nynex spokesman. "There's always that operator there if clarification of your request is needed," he said.
But Mr. Bonomo acknowledged that, as kinks in the system are worked out, the goal is a straight pass-through from the machine receiving your request to the one supplying the phone number, with operator and customer not speaking to each other at all. "That's an ideal call," he said.
A thoroughly unscientific survey of 411 operators suggests that New Yorkers are giving the new system Bronx cheers. "Oh, they hate it," one operator said. "I'd say 80 to 90 percent complain." Perhaps one reason is the company's idea of ideal. The last thing New York needs is another mechanical system that keeps people apart.
TRUE, the city has long made a virtue of anonymity. But technology makes it possible now to avoid almost all human contact. And while some New Yorkers say hallelujah to that, you have to wonder what attracted them to the big city if not the opportunity to mingle with all manner of people.
You no longer need to speak to another person to book an airplane flight, or to order movie tickets, or to find out how much is in your checking account, or to alert the phone company to trouble on the line, or even to collect unemployment benefits, since you can call a state office and answer recorded questions about your job status by pressing buttons.
Banks encourage you to avoid tellers with prizes for those who use only A.T.M.'s to make deposits. One purpose of the subway Metrocard is eliminate contact with token clerks. With "honor boxes," you can buy the morning paper and never meet a news dealer.
Let's not even get started on voice mail. Call a corporate number (including, to make full disclosure, that of this newspaper) and you get not a person but a recording that asks you to tap in the desired extension. Do that, and you get another recording telling you to push a number to leave a message. Do that, only to get still another recording announcing that your message is about to be recorded. After all those frustrating steps, you develop a new appreciation for the sharp drop in New York's murder rate.
ARGUABLY, nowhere does machine meet human with more undesirable results than on the subway, where so many passengers sport earphones blaring music that makes them oblivious to everything and everyone around them. Are boom boxes preferable? Hardly. But life in New York requires more than tuning out the rest of the world. It requires knowing who's around you, if only to make a quarter-turn so that others can get on and off the train. Being oblivious is just not good enough in this city.
"Like most people, I have mixed feelings about all these machines," the writer Calvin Trillin said. On one hand, he said, banking by phone makes his life easier, and how many token clerks are really interested in a conversation with him? But Mr. Trillin happens to like talking to operators.
"I tell little white lies sometimes to talk to a real human being," he said. "I pretend I have a rotary phone."
It's a clever tactic, but one, he agreed, that will eventually leave him "orphaned" as push buttons become universal. "Woe betide those people who have rotary phones," warned another writer, Luc Sante. "They're sunk."

HEADLINE: Isolated and Corrupt, Serbia's Economy Stagnates

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, July 7

 BODY:
You can still buy a small, boxy Yugo car here, but you have to wait for months. When cars are finally delivered, the more fortunate buyers find they are missing mirrors, upholstery panels or ash trays. The unfortunate ones must clank their way to the nearest garage, where work immediately begins under the hood.
"As soon as I drove away, I had a leak in the fuel hose," Branislav Cuckovic, 23, said of his Yugo. "A week later the brakes failed, the window handles broke off and the transmission went. I've spent all my money just to keep it going." 
 The stripped-down car, with a Fiat engine, was once the pride of Yugoslavia. The huge Zastava Yugo Automobile plant in Kragujevac rolled out 200,000 vehicles a year beforecivil war broke out five years ago. The cars, which cost about $5,000, were exported to other Eastern European countries and the United States.
But the plight of Zastava, where production has fallen to 3,500 cars in the first six months of this year, is indicative of the deep economic and political crisis brewing in Yugoslavia, which now comprises only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro.
The break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 destroyed its industrial sector as large manufacturing centers in Serbia were cut off from their suppliers and outlets. International sanctions imposed because of Belgrade's support for the Bosnian Serbs, together with the refusal by the Government to relinquish its grip on state industries, contributed to the withering of manufacturing. (The sanctions, imposed in June 1992, were lifted in January of this year.)
The central bank's hard currency is almost gone, bringing enormous pressure on the Yugoslav Government to print more money to pay salaries and keep businesses open, but so far officials have resisted increasing the money supply. Once that begins, economists say, the days of hyperinflation are not far away.
If things do not improve soon -- and there are few signs they will -- the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, could face "serious political unrest within six to nine months," according to United States intelligence reports. Union leaders, who led a series of strikes this spring, have given the Yugoslav Government until September to raise salaries and create new jobs, or face renewed nationwide protests.
As many people in Belgrade remind visitors, the war in the former Yugoslavia was as much about the control of diminishing resources, jobs and industries as about nationalist ideologies peddled to whip up popular support.
An economic disaster here could spell real trouble in flash points like the Kosovo region, where ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of the population, are under the thumb of repressive Serbian police and officials sent from Belgrade.
"Foreign companies come in here, take one look at what is going on and pack up and leave," a Western diplomat said. "We don't even bring in trade delegations now; it's no use."
Dragoslav Avramovic recently lost his job as governor of the central bank after criticizing the Government for economic mismanagement and its failure to reform the economy -- a failure that has seen Yugoslavia shunned by every major international lending institution. Mr. Avramovic, 76, a former World Bank official, now warns that catastrophe looms.
"The Government has two ways left to manage the deficit," he said. "Either print more money or stop paying the bills. I am not sure which is worse. The Government has stopped, for now, paying its bills, but we are running into trouble. The Government does not generate any savings. It is barely able to pay pensions."
The country's infrastructure is crumbling: Belgrade's bus fleet is down to 750, from 900, because of the need to cannibalize vehicles for spare parts. There are increasing power failures. The rail system, with 50 engines that are more than five decades old running on hundreds of miles of poorly kept track, can no longer haul products reliably. The water system works sporadically.
Salaries are paid months late, if at all. The average wage, rural or urban, is about $100 a month, a drop of 80 percent in the last decade.
"I earn $140 dollars a month, and even then my check comes three months late," said Milanka Bojanovic, 44, who works for the port authority. "I have neighbors who have not been paid for six months."
Institutional Investor, the trade magazine, recently ranked Yugoslavia Number 129 of 137 countries as a prospect for foreign investment. Among the countries rated less attractive were Libya, the Sudan, Zaire and Afghanistan.
There never were many foreign companies here. Those that have looked into investment say the import-export process is cumbersome, with many bureaucratic restrictions and paperwork. The Government makes it tough to get hard currency. Taxes and fees, piled one on the other, are also barriers to doing business. Nor was there much direct foreign investment; most foreign companies here handled only sales and distribution.
And there is a powerful lobby, built up in the last five years, that vigorously opposes economic reform, despite the threat of political upheaval.
"Milosevic's power is based, as it was under Communism, on nepotism," an American businessman said. "Those who support him get rich, really rich. Those who do not, starve. The middle class is being wiped out, and a new, powerful oligarchy rules this place like a feudal estate."
Nearly every major state industry is now headed by a senior government official. Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic is the director of Progres, the oil-importing company; the Deputy Prime Minister, Slobodan Radulovic, runs the largest chain of supermarkets.
Given the political and economic muscle the state-run corporations wield, local rivals are easily squashed. New businesses that find a niche are quickly absorbed in the maw of government-run monopolies.
For example, when farmers began to make money by selling raspberries to Germany, trade that was not permitted under the sanctions, the farms were simply taken over by government officials or their cronies, or growers were forced to sell to the state. Not a raspberry leaves this country now without the profits going to one of the huge agricultural conglomerates, including Pik Takovo, which is run by the Agriculture Minister, Ivko Djonovic.
"A large proportion of the so-called socially owned firms, or government-owned firms, are losing money," Mr. Avramovic said. "These are very inefficient industries. Companies constantly raise prices to keep up, and this has been one of the major causes of inflation."
The latest row, between wheat farmers and the Government, has many in the countryside seething and could lead to unrest this fall.
Wheat farmers, many of whom cut back on the number of acres they planted this year because they are being forced to sell their harvests at below-market prices to state-run export companies, warn that they are being pushed over the brink.
"Never have I seen such anger," said Momir Crnogorac, 32, a farmer from Vojvodina, the major wheat-producing region. "Milosevic, who got away during the war by blaming all this on sanctions, is now playing a very dangerous game. People no longer believe him. They are fed up with being robbed."

HEADLINE: Senate Debates Minimum-Wage Increase

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Senate Democrats and Republicans debated today whether a 90-cent increase in the Federal minimum wage would throw an economic lifeline to millions of workers or force small businesses to lay off hundreds of thousands of them.
The Senate is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on a plan to raise the minimum hourly wage to $5.15, from $4.25, in two steps over the next 12 months. The increase, which would be the first in six years, won approval from the House by a 2-to-1 ratio in late May. 
 After months of skirmishing, the battle lines are sharply drawn.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the proposal's chief Senate sponsor, said raising the minimum wage was essential to keep many working families out of poverty, and called a Republican amendment to exempt many small businesses "a shameless trick" to gut the increase.
"No American who works for a living should have to live in poverty," said Senator Kennedy, who dismissed Republican assertions that a wage increase would cost jobs.
Republicans countered that without their amendment, many small businesses would go under or lay off workers. The amendment would exempt businesses with less than $500,000 in annual sales from the increase, allow employers to pay all new workers a sub-minimum wage of $4.25 for their first six months of employment and delay the effective date of an increase by six months, to Jan. 1, 1997.
"This merely carries out the intent of Congress to exclude the smallest of small employers from the burdens of the minimum wage," said Senator Christopher S. Bond, the Missouri Republican who is the amendment's main sponsor.
President Clinton has said he will veto a bill that includes any of these "poison pill" provisions. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich estimates that the Republican amendment would deny a wage increase to about half the 10 million workers now toiling at or near the minimum wage.
The wage increase is one of this year's political surprises. Few people at first gave Democrats much chance of pushing it through the Republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats made it a fairness issue, and it caught on with the public, blindsiding Republicans first in the House and now in the Senate.
A majority of senators support the increase. So the important vote on Tuesday will be on the Republican amendment to modify who gets the increase, and when.
All 47 Senate Democrats oppose the Republican amendment, Democratic aides said today. So if all 100 senators vote, Democrats need to pick up at least 3 Republican defectors to kill it.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has made it clear to fellow Republicans that victory on the amendment is important to him as their new leader. In exchange, he is telling Republican moderates that he will soften some of the more objectionable provisions when the House and the Senate negotiate a compromise bill later this summer.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, is considered a swing vote on the amendment. He supports the higher wage.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said today that if the Republican amendment succeeded, he would recommend that Senate Democrats approve the bill and then try to kill the amendment in the conference committee.
The Republican amendment would also exempt restaurants from paying the wage increase to those who receive tips, who now must be paid only $2.13 an hour if their tips bring their earnings to $4.25. In the future, they would be paid $2.13 an hour so long as their tips brought their wages to $5.15.
"They're proposing to create a Swiss-cheese amendment with as many holes as they can get away with," Mr. Daschle said today.
Most senators were traveling back to Washington today after the Fourth of July recess, and so today's floor debate, on an issue affecting millions of Americans, unfolded before a largely empty chamber.
The most contentious issue centered on whether raising the wage increase would cost jobs.
Mr. Kennedy said the wage increase would attract people not working now. He cited the example of Vermont and Massachusetts, which raised their minimum wages to $4.75 an hour in January: unemployment declined, even though neighboring New York and New Hampshire did not raise their wages.
But Republicans said a wage increase would act as a barrier to the lowest-paid workers.
"The Federal Government would be determining that it's better to stay at home and not work if you can't get a job at $5.15 an hour," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate's second-ranking Republican.

HEADLINE: New Gauge for Shorter Day of Past

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
BY counting microscopic stripes in sedimentary rock imprinted by the rise and fall of ancient tides, a team of planetary scientists and geologists has calculated that 900 million years ago, the length of a day was only about 18 hours and 10 minutes.
Their measurements, reported in the current issue of the journal Science, also imply that at a time when life on Earth was limited to single-cell organisms, Earth took 481 times as long to complete one orbit of the Sun as it does now, and the Moon was considerably closer to Earth. 
 Dr. Charles P. Sonett of the University of Arizona and his colleagues from the Universities of Arizona, Indiana and Utah, and Colorado State University, based their conclusion on a study of four ancient rock deposits dating from different periods in Earth's early history. The oldest, deposited some 900 million years ago, is at the Big Cottonwood Formation near Salt Lake City. The other sites are the Elatina Formation, which is near Adelaide, Australia, and is 650 million years old; the Pottsville Formation, in northern Alabama and some 312 million years old, and the Mansfield Formation, in Indiana and 305 million years old.
Like tree rings, tidal layers in rock, known as tidalites, can be interpreted as indicators of time intervals. Tidalites can be distinguished as daily markings and as the more prominent semimonthly "spring" and "neap" tides. (Spring tides are the highest high tides, occurring during the second and fourth quarters of the Moon. Neap tides are the lowest high tides and highest low tides, at the first and third quarters.)
Tidalites are created by the sedimentation of mudstone or sandstone, which proceeds at different rates during high and low tides. The semimonthly markings created by spring and neap tides are prominent and easier to identify and count than the daily tidal marks.
Scientists have long understood the tidal forces exerted by the Moon and sun that tend to slow down Earth's orbital rotation and increase the distance of the Moon from Earth. During the Apollo program of lunar landings, astronauts left a reflector device on the Moon; by periodically sending pulses of laser light from Earth to the reflector and measuring the time needed for light to make the round trip, scientists can calculate the changing distance between Earth and the Moon. The moon is receding at a steady rate of about 1.5 inches each year.
But determining tidal effects on Earth itself hundreds of millions of years ago has proved difficult. During the early 1960's, studies of the tidal rings left in the fossil shells of intertidal coral that lived between 345 million and 395 million years ago suggested that the Moon was retreating from Earth at an implausibly rapid rate.
"At that rate," Dr. Sonett said in an interview, "the moon would have been very close to the Earth at only half the estimated age of the Earth -- a seeming impossibility."
But the lunar recession rate determined by Dr. Sonett and his colleagues from the tidalite record appears to be more or less consistent with the rate implied by the Apollo laser measurements.
"I'm being asked whether we can infer anything about changes in the climate from these measurements," he said, "but I just can't say. With a more rapid rotation of the Earth, there would have been a stronger coriolis effect -- the effect that makes storms circulate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. We just don't know how that would have affected climate."
Aramais Zakharian, a member of Dr. Sonett's group, said that in another 15 billion years, the Moon would have receded from its present distance from Earth, 240,000 miles, to 336,000 miles. At that distance, the moon will be locked into a synchronous orbit, meaning it will be permanently over the same place on Earth.
But the scientists say that life is unlikely to survive to that distant time. By then, the expanding sun will have scourged the last vestige of life from the planet, even if Earth survives earlier catastrophes.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times yesterday, about the changing length of a day on Earth, misstated a new finding. Scientists' figures suggest that one year, or one orbit, once lasted 481 days, not that Earth once took 481 times as long as it does now to complete one orbit of the Sun.

HEADLINE: Skirmishes in a Tug-of-War With a Refrigerator Door

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
BLAME the talking pig.
After too many late-night viewings of "Babe," I started having these recurring barnyard nightmares.
Each one is the same. I'm standing as naked as a newborn in this sunny field of, well, dreams. And all around this pastoral place are big, marshmallowy cows. They just stare at me with those weepy cow eyes as they mindlessly chew cud. With no apparent warning or reason, they start to close in with a sort of slow-motion, slow-moo stampede. Cows, cows, too many cows. They're surrounding, crowding, shoving, making it impossible to escape them, even to breathe. 
 Then, I wake up.
Recently, while I was once again revving up my fitness regimen to lose some nasty cold-weather poundage, the meaning of the dreams came to me in a bolt of bovine-inspired clarity.
The cows, you see, represent "cals," my jocular shorthand for cal-ories. The cows (old beasts sounds like obese, right?) were stand-ins for the great herds of calories that for most of my life have been everywhere I have turned, chasing me, literally getting under my skin.
As a 42-year-old writer whose profession requires no more heavy lifting than placing fingertips to keyboard, my battle with the bulging middle is reaching the breaking point. Standing just under 5 feet 11 inches, I tip the scale at 230 -- a good 40 pounds heavier than I was just a couple of summers ago when I was running half-marathons and pridefully wearing cutoff T-shirts.
But today, like many Americans, I am in a near-constant tug-of-war with my refrigerator door. And the darn thing seems much too willing to let me win -- or lose, depending on your viewpoint.
More than two-thirds of Americans this year said they would like to lose weight, according to a recently completed survey by Weight Watchers International. Most said they were hoping to shed 5 to 14 pounds. Some 12 years ago, Government studies concluded that only about one-fourth of adult Americans said they weighed too much. And among children, the incidence of overweight has doubled in the last 30 years.
A big part of the problem, diet authorities say, is that Americans are trained to be consumers in a land of plenty of plenty. The "I want I want I want" clamoring might be good for the economy, but it is terrible for the national waistline.
"It's important to view our eating patterns as both cultural phenomena and physical phenomena," said Lawrence Cheskin, the director of Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center in Baltimore.
Many Americans -- both thin and not so thin -- use food inappropriately, he said. They eat because a clock strikes the lunch hour, or because they are sad, bored or anxious, or because they are happy and gather friends to make a baseline biological necessity a celebration. The body's built-in impulse to eat -- called hunger -- is often muted in a chorus of other prompts to pig out.
Donn Jasura, a formerly overweight man who last fall created a popular site on the Internet to help others lose weight like he did, boiled his overeating behavior down to seven motivations: "I'm bored." "It tastes good." "I am alone, time to sneak something." "It's because of something that happened to me in the past." "My mother always made me eat." "I am stressed out -- it's nerves." And "It is comforting."
Mr. Jasura, 39, an education director for the International Business Machines Corporation who lives in Staatsburg, N.Y., said: "The next time you go to put food in your mouth, ask yourself a question: Are you really hungry? Does your body really need that food? That snack? That second portion at dinner?"
"There are as many triggers to eat as there are people," added Mr. Jasura, who several years ago trimmed his six-foot frame to 175 pounds from 240 pounds.
But Ben Z. Krentzman, a diet specialist whose 23-year-old practice is based in Venice, Calif., says the compulsion to overeat can be as strong as the lungs' insistence to breathe.
"Hold your breath for two minutes and that's what they feel," he said, referring to the chronic overeaters and their struggle.
I can attest to that. Even as I write this article I have gulped down 20 ounces of a drink called Mucho Mango, 20 ounces of Virgin Cocktail Pina Colada, 16 ounces of Nestle Quick Chocolate, 2 ounces of Cheeze Balls and a bag of fat-free sourdough hard pretzels. That intake, over a four-hour period, totals 1,530 calories, not including the gyro sandwich -- with the works -- for dinner.
My only exercise? Getting up and walking to the vending machines about a hundred steps from my desk or to the deli a few doors down.
Dr. Cheskin of Johns Hopkins maintains that people "should only eat enough food for us to sustain ourselves." But that proposition is more difficult than it sounds because so few people actually remember, from meal to meal, exactly what they consume.
SO in the interest of journalism and self-discovery, I kept a journal of my eating habits -- and even when I merely thought of food -- for a month. What I discovered confirmed what I have long suspected: I eat more than I think I do, and I eat much less when I am not so busy and manage to exercise regularly.
On the first Saturday of my record-keeping, I slept late, until 11 A.M. I woke up hungry, thinking about having a full, old-fashioned breakfast: eggs and bacon, home-fried potatoes, pancakes and coffee. At 11:30, that is exactly what I ate at a neighborhood restaurant.
By 4:40 P.M., I had put in 90 minutes at my health club, sweating away on the bike for 25 minutes, doing two full circuits of the weight machines and a number of specialized exercises for my legs and abdomen. On the way home I stopped, as is my habit, at the Papaya King on 72d Street and Broadway for a medium banana drink.
At 8:45 P.M., I made myself a large garden salad with an oil and vinegar dressing.
At 2:25 A.M., I ate a low-calorie strawberry-filled whole-wheat bar.
By 3:10 A.M., I was in bed falling asleep and thinking, Not a bad day for the old frame. And no cow dreams.
For the most part the pattern held up over the next few weeks: I ate moderately well, exercised hard every other day and got to bed without eating anything more harmful than a drink made from yogurt, skim milk, ice and half a banana.
Things began to unravel four days later when I flew to San Francisco to work. I dodged the ubiquitous peanuts on the flight out. I even passed on the ice-cream dessert and stuck to my Cobb salad for lunch. But after I checked into the hotel at 5 P.M. (8 P.M. in New York), I found myself in the "honor bar" in my room, palm deep in a 2.5-ounce can of salted cashews, a fat-laden snack that my tenure in Weight Watchers years ago taught me is a red-light food for me.
By 5:30 P.M., I had gobbled down a granola bar.
By 9 P.M., I tried to regain my bearings for having a solid dinner -- a Caesar salad with croutons, stir-fried shrimp with noodles and a light beer. But the cows were already out of the barn. I felt tired, deserving and thirsty. At 11 P.M., the honor bar revealed a small bottle of Bailey's Irish Cream and I sipped it over rocks. By 11:58, I added a natural passion and mango juice as a chaser. I got to sleep shortly after midnight.
I awoke at 7:30 A.M. feeling pangs of guilt. I skipped breakfast and went to the hotel's health center. I was disappointed to find just a small room with a few exercise bicycles and some well-worn treadmills. I rode a bike for 30 minutes.
At 10 A.M., I took a break from work and began to think of food, something nonthreatening, like a plain bagel with no butter.
At 11:30, I decided to have only coffee, more self-inflected punishment for the previous night. Work kept me too busy in nearby Berkeley to have anything more than a large cappuccino with no sugar at 2 P.M.
At 7 P.M., I went to a Korean restaurant in Oakland and spent more time interviewing than eating.
At 9 P.M., I returned to San Francisco and bought a pint of low-fat chocolate milk. I felt myself slipping into bad habits.
At 11 P.M., convinced that I deserved whatever I wanted because I had skipped lunch and had hardly eaten dinner, I got a bagel with lox, cream cheese and onions at an all-night deli. Still not satisfied, I raided the honor bar again and discovered that the empty can of cashew nuts had been replaced with a filled one.
At 12:30 A.M., I gobbled down the last of the cashews before going to bed, thinking that the day, as far as fitness went, was a bust.
For the most part, my pattern of bad food choices and trying to overcompensate for them, leading to worse choices, persisted until I returned to New York three days later.
Even then, days of too much attention to work and too little to proper food led to hours of junk food. And as food is everywhere, it is more difficult to avoid giving in to impulse. But I must resist, no matter how satisfying the transgression is going down.
It is as plain as the bulge over my belt that the herds of cows/cals are waiting for an opening to make their collective weight felt.

U.S. Bonds Rise as Yield Falls to 7.13%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices recovered somewhat yesterday, following robust demand at an auction of new 10-year notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 86 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.13 percent, from 7.18 percent on Monday, but still sharply higher than the 6.93 percent on Thursday, before a surprising strong employment report sent bond yields surging. 
 The seeds of yesterday's gain were sown early in the session as speculators set themselves up for a disappointing auction and a drop in prices.
The timing of the auction had not seemed fortunate, with uncertainty over when and how much the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates and concern over the market's ability to absorb new supply. The $10 billion auction itself was a little different, the first as the Treasury increases the number of auctions to six a year, from four.
Before the sale, some dealers said they had wanted to see the yield on the notes come in at 7.06 percent or better to insure quick distribution.
But the average yield at auction yesterday was lower than expected: 7.016 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio was a decent 2.66. The ratio is the total dollar amount of all bids for the issue divided by the size of the auction; it is regarded as a measure of an auction's success.
The stronger-than-expected results prompted short-sellers, who had bet that demand would be weak -- and that prices would fall -- to try to limit their losses by buying securities.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of Government bond trading at Cowen & Company, said that dealers had sought to push the yield on the 10-year note to 7.05 percent. "Failing to get the note any cheaper forced some short-covering, and for the remainder of the morning the market's bid was better," he said.
"Once the results were released," Mr. Gamba said, "we had some follow-through buying as additional shorts were squeezed from the market."
The strong focus on the auction detracted from the economic data yesterday. The weekly Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim index of chain-store sales rose two-tenths of 1 percent, while the Commerce Department's wholesale trade inventories report showed a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in May, compared with a gain of 1.2 percent in April.
Late in the day, a weaker-than-expected retail sales report by Johnson Redbook, down 1.6 percent, added more support to bond prices.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said that "while the market is retracing some of last week's losses, and you have to buy the market, you'll have to be pretty nimble about it."
He continued: "That's because the longer-term outlook is still pretty bearish, and this retracement is technically based without any strong fundamental backing. After all, people do expect the Fed to tighten sometime this summer."
He said the appearance of speculative and retail buyers in yesterday's auction gave stability to the market. "What buying there has been has been largely speculative buying since mid-June," he added.
Still, the market continued to weigh the implications of the strong jobs data and how the Federal Reserve might react.
"One thing seems apparent at the moment," said Carroll J. Delaney, director of research for Stires, O'Donnell & Company. "There are many who believe that the longer the Fed waits to act, the more nervous and confused the market will become."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

The cost of doing business on the road is expected to increase by 4.7% next year.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
THE cost of traveling for business will rise 4.7 percent next year, led by an 8.5 percent increase in car rentals and a 7.5 percent advance in lodging costs. Air travel, which amounts to about 41 percent of total travel spending, and ground transportation will each increase 4 percent.
Those estimates, by Runzheimer International, the management consulting firm that tracks such matters, are exactly that -- estimates. But Runzheimer said businesses could offset expected increases with policies like trading down to compact cars or economy hotels. 
 In any event, relief appears in sight. "By the end of 1997," according to Runzheimer, "competition in travel services will emerge that should bring overall costs down." These include ticketless air travel and improvements in hotel productivity.
 
A Really High Bid
Auctions using frequent-flier miles for payment are no longer a novelty, but the Northwest Airlines auction, to be held at Sotheby's in New York on Sept. 27, will take such fun and games to new heights -- literally. One of the packages likely to be auctioned is one in which the high bidder gets to engage in a dog fight in a jet fighter plane, using lasers for rockets.
The general public is also invited to compete by purchasing Northwest frequent-flier miles for 5 cents a mile. Habitat for Humanity will be a major beneficiary of the auction, and one of the packages will allow the winner to work building houses alongside former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn. Other winners will be given instruction in a jet simulator from Chuck Yeager, the first pilot to break the sound barrier, or be allowed to perform on stage with the Beach Boys in a concert of the winner's choice or tour and perform with B. B. King.
A Sotheby's catalogue with a detailed list of packages will be available by mid-August.
 
Working at the Olympics
Chances are that many of those eager young faces in the Olympic Village in Atlanta will be incoming freshmen from the Hospitality College and the College of Culinary Arts at Johnson and Wales University. Some 250 of them were selected from more than 1,600 applicants to work during the Summer Olympics for the Marriott Corporation, which has 47 hotels and more than 10,000 rooms in Atlanta.
Through Aug. 7, each student will work 60 hours a week in the Media Village, helping to serve about 5,000 meals at each sitting. Marriott will pay them $9 an hour, as well as provide dormitory-style housing and two meals a day. It will also give each student a $1,000 scholarship to Johnson and Wales, a 72-year-old private school based in Providence, R.I., with campuses in Charleston, S.C.; Norfolk, Va.; North Miami, Fla., and Vail, Colo.
 
Arts Calendar
You need not even be a guest at any of the six Rafael Hotels to receive their attractive 64-page booklet, "Five Cities 1996: The Rafael Arts Calendar." Conceived by Georg Rafael, the company's chief executive, and co-sponsored by American Express, the booklet lists the 1966 schedules of art exhibitions, antiques fairs, auctions or opera being staged in Geneva, Dusseldorf, Munich, New York and Miami.
All five cities have Rafael hotels within the city limits or nearby; in New York the Rafael property is the Mark, while near Miami it is the Turnberry Isle Resort and Club in Aventura. (The sixth Rafael property is the Elbow Beach in Paget, Bermuda, on the island's south shore.) The five cities also have busy cultural calendars.
The booklet lists the events by month, and features short texts and color illustrations of significant art, including works by Picasso and Winslow Homer. Free booklets can be obtained, while supplies last, by calling (212) 679-5717 weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., New York time.
 
Hertz Turns to Never Lost
After testing Never Lost navigation units in nine cities, the Ford Motor Company's Hertz subsidiary said yesterday that it would install them in at least 7,500 cars in 16 cities, starting in Atlanta this month.
Manufactured by Rockwell Automotive, a unit of Rockwell International, Never Lost combines satellite technology with dead-reckoning and map-matching technology to provide explicit directions to almost any address within a defined geographic area. Cars equipped with Never Lost cost an additional $6 a day.

Kantor Takes Up Brown's Bosnia Mission

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor will set out on Wednesday to complete the trip on which his predecessor, Ronald H. Brown, died, escorting American business executives through Bosnia and Croatia to explore opportunities to reconstruct a land divided by war.
All but three of the companies that had executives on Mr. Brown's mission have signed up to return to the region, Mr. Kantor said today. 
 Mr. Brown's mission ended in a plane crash near Dubrovnik, Croatia, on April 3 that killed all of the 35 passengers and crew aboard. Along with a number of executives, the crash victims included officials from the Commerce Department and other agencies, and Nathaniel C. Nash, the Frankfurt bureau chief of The New York Times.
While the executives accompanying Mr. Kantor will be negotiating deals to sell airplanes and rebuild highways and a crippled telephone network, Administration officials say the trip will also serve as a traveling memorial to Mr. Brown and a demonstration that Washington remains committed to the region's economic reconstruction.
President Clinton recently termed Mr. Kantor's return trip "an attempt to put the power of American commerce to use for peace."
Mr. Kantor, who was among Mr. Brown's closest friends in Washington and a colleague on the Administration's economic team, said: "This trip is full of emotion. Everyone here lost a lot of friends on that trip, and I lost a friend of 20 years. But we all know that the right thing to do, the very American thing, is to go back and finish Ron's mission."
For Mr. Kantor, the trip represents a full transition to his new and very different role. As the United States trade representative, his arrival in foreign lands usually presaged a trade fight, not a discussion of new business opportunities. In the last three months, Mr. Kantor has slowly settled into Mr. Brown's old office. In the building's lobby, where a picture of the sitting Secretary usually hangs, he has placed a photograph of himself with Mr. Brown, taken last year.
He has also begun to venture abroad with the kind of business delegations that Mr. Brown first used as a weapon of commercial diplomacy, and then as a symbol of economic reconstruction in Northern Ireland, South Africa and the Baltics. Two weeks ago Mr. Kantor returned from his first lengthy overseas trip as Commerce Secretary, visiting South Korea and several nations in Southeast Asia.
Today, preparing to leave, he said that after landing in Dubrovnik he planned to hike up the mountainside where Mr. Brown's Air Force plane crashed. Then, along with executives from Boeing, United Technologies, the Riggs Bank of Washington and other companies, he has planned three days of meetings in Dubrovnik, Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zagreb. In Tuzla, he will also visit American peacekeeping troops.

HEADLINE: Above All, Don't Dress Up As a Cow

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, July 9

 BODY:
"Do not run toward the bulls."
"Do not challenge, touch or otherwise distract the bulls. This could be fatal." 
 "Do not be overconfident. Retire before you get into difficulties."
In a first, Pamplona city hall has published a glossy brochure in English, French and German disclosing the secrets of how to run with the bulls. The 16-item checklist arrived just in time for the weeklong annual San Fermin festival, which began on Sunday.
"A lot of people who come here are ignorant about running with the bulls," said Deputy Mayor Joaquin Pascal, adding that some people were beginning to think the event was "less risky than jogging."
The 25,000 copies of the new color pamphlet, distributed at information booths around Pamplona, may help correct the problem. The cover advises people to "Run Safely!" and features an artist's rendering of two bulls about to trample and gore several runners.
City officials have become uneasy in recent years as more and more foreigners have crowded into town during the festival and tested their luck in the daily morning ritual of racing with the bulls through the cobblestone streets to the bull-fighting ring, a spectacle that became widely known among English-speakers when Hemingway depicted it in his 1926 novel "The Sun Also Rises."
Seventy years later, Pamplona's population of 185,000 easily doubles on peak festival days, a boon to the city's economy, and the number of runners varies from about 1,000 to 3,000. A city spokesman, Santiago Gomez, said Pamplona aims to avoid "more massive accidents."
It might seem obvious not to run toward the bulls, but astonished city officials have seen it happen at the beginning of the half-mile course when runners seek better position.
Each piece of advice in the brochure responds to actual problems that city hall has encountered, like the reminder, "Do not carry anything when you run."
That includes video cameras and babies. Last year, course marshals evicted two women carrying small children, and other people carrying cameras, just before the corral gates opened and the six fighting bulls charged forward.
In addition to the marshals and the first-aid crews and ambulances standing by along the course, the city added another safety feature last year with a loudspeaker system broadcasting advice in five languages, including English.
The incident that added urgency to publishing the brochure, city officials said, was the fatal goring of a 22-year-old man from suburban Chicago last year. He was the first person killed in 15 years and only the 13th since 1924, when record-keeping began.
Far from making people think twice before going to Pamplona, city hall feared the American's death would induce even more thrill-seekers to attend, and Mr. Pascal estimated there were 10,000 Americans in the city last weekend, a few thousand more than normal during the festival.
Some Pamplona officials believe the young American made a fatal mistake when, after falling to the ground as the bulls approached, he got up and started to run again, instead of remaining motionless on the ground and covering his head with his hands until the herd thundered past. It is a safety tip that Pamplona residents know well. Now it is in the brochure.
The pamphlet mentions a problem that some veteran runners consider nearly as threatening as the bulls. "Do not push or elbow the other runners," it commands. But compliance during this week's daily runs seemed spotty, with many runners shoving each other, mainly to get away from the bulls.

HEADLINE: New Owners Plan to Bring New Life to the Blighted Kenmore Hotel

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
The Kenmore Hotel, a dilapidated, crime-infested residence near Gramercy Park that was seized by the United States Government two years ago, will be renovated by new owners who plan to turn its 641 cell-sized rooms into 326 air-conditioned studio apartments.
The nonprofit organization buying the hotel, Housing and Services Inc., bought the 22-story building, the largest single-room-occupancy hotel in New York City, for $750,000, hoping to transform a notorious eyesore into a vibrant part of the neighborhood. 
 Before the United States marshals took over management of the hotel in 1994, crack dealers, thieves and prostitutes freely roamed the hallways of the building at 143 East 23d Street. The hotel's absentee owner did nothing to address problems at the building, which had come to symbolize deplorable conditions at S.R.O. hotels.
Using a mix of Federal, state, city and private financing, Housing and Services Inc. plans to spend $23.6 million to build private bathrooms and kitchenettes in each room, renovate the lobby and the red-brick facade and add a library, an exercise room and a social-service center, said Claire Haaga, the president of Housing and Services. None of the 300 poor and elderly tenants, who pay $215 rent each month for each 80-square-foot room, will be evicted during the two years of improvements or after the make-over is completed, officials said.
"For many of the tenants, the Kenmore provided that one, all-important step up from the shelter or the street," said United States Attorney Mary Jo White, whose prosecutors seized the building from a landlord who failed to stop a brisk cocaine trade in the building's lobby, hallways and stairwells.
At a City Hall news conference yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross said the project marked the first time in New York City that the Federal Government had sold a forfeited building for use as a single-room-occupancy hotel.
"Through an extraordinary collaboration of all of these different levels of government, and with the private sector, the Kenmore can once again be an asset to the community," the Mayor said.
At the Kenmore Hotel yesterday, residents were ebullient about the new owners and the planned renovations, which are scheduled to begin today. Many tenants said they looked forward to living in rooms with more space and fewer cockroaches.
"We're relieved," said Tony Merritt, a 55-year-old unemployed tenant who has lived at the Kenmore for seven years. "This is like a ton of bricks lifted off our heads."
Victoria A. Jagel, a 78-year-old retired schoolteacher, recalled hiding in her room from the drug dealers, crack addicts and thieves who roamed the hallways. "My room was robbed three times," Mrs. Jagel said. "They stole $75, a TV remote, a calculator. They even stooped to steal my Tums and mouthwash. Now, isn't that pathetic?"
But much has changed since the Federal takeover, she said. Just last week, Mrs. Jagel gave a greeting card to the new owner. Someone taped the card to the glass-enclosed mail room. It reads: "We're so glad that you gave the tenants our Fourth of July freedom on July 3, 1996. Love, Victoria."
"Soon," Mrs. Jagel said, her eyes twinkling, "this place will be a little piece of heaven."
Even though crime has gone down since the takeover, some tenants said that crime and drugs were still a problem.
Tenants said they were ecstatic that their rent would not be raised, even after the renovations are completed. The rents at the 73-year-old building will be subsidized by Federal funds.
Tran Dinh Truong, an expatriate Vietnamese shipping magnate, paid $7.9 million for the building in November 1985. Officials said Mr. Truong allowed the building to deteriorate over the next nine years, using its losses to shelter income from his other rundown hotels in Manhattan.
Last year, a Federal judge ordered Mr. Truong to forfeit the building to the Government under a 1984 Federal law that says property used by drug dealers can be forfeited if the landlord knows about or encourages the narcotics trafficking.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu Airs Differences With Clinton on Peace Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, after his first meeting with President Clinton, made it clear today that his new Government had important differences with the Americans on the approach to peace in the Middle East.
He made no public concessions to American concerns about proposals for new Israeli settlements in the West Bank, his arm's-length approach to relations with Yasir Arafat and his public wavering on Israel's promise to withdraw most of its troops from the West Bank city of Hebron. 
 Mr. Netanyahu vowed to keep Israel's commitments to Arab neighbors and the Palestinians. But he insisted at the same time that both sides must keep to their agreements, criticizing the Palestinians and their leader, Mr. Arafat, for maintaining offices in Jerusalem in violation of Israeli-Palestinian accords.
Israel's fulfillment of its commitments, the Prime Minister said, will depend on his perception of the Palestinians' fulfillment of theirs.
"We want to live up to the agreements, but we can't be the only side to do so," Mr. Netanyahu said at a news conference with Mr. Clinton after two and a half hours of talks, which senior Israeli officials described as warm, direct, open and supportive.
Mr. Clinton, who was careful not to highlight differences in his public comments, spoke more generally of the need to pursue a wider peace. "I believe the tide of history cannot be turned," Mr. Clinton said of Middle East peace. "Going back -- and I said this to the Arab leaders -- will be a bad mistake."
Mr. Clinton recognized, aides said, that Mr. Netanyahu had won an electoral mandate for a different approach to peace. But in private, the Americans also wanted to hear from him, "as definitively as possible, where he's going," a senior White House official said.
The Americans were mindful that President Carter and Prime Minister Menachem Begin got off to a bad start when Mr. Begin first came to the United States, even though the relationship, with the crucial concessions of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, eventually produced the Camp David accords of 1978.
The Americans especially want to insure that Israel keeps to its commitments to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, a senior State Department official said, to make sure that Mr. Arafat is not undermined. "We don't see anyone else out there who can be as effective an interlocutor as Arafat," a White House official said, "and we see no purpose in undermining him. That view was reflected in this meeting, and Netanyahu appreciates that."
But Mr. Netanyahu rebuffed American efforts to secure from him a promise not to construct new settlements in the West Bank, as opposed to expanding existing settlements, Israeli officials said. Mr. Netanyahu wanted no confusion on this issue of the kind that damaged relations between President Bush and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1989, when Mr. Bush thought Mr. Shamir had promised a halt to settlements.
Mr. Netanyahu -- who like Mr. Begin and Mr. Shamir before him leads the conservative Likud Party -- cited Israeli Government statistics showing that in the last four years under the Labor Party, the population of settlers on the West Bank and Gaza had grown from 96,000 to 145,000, which he called "natural growth." He then said, "I assume that no one here is expecting us to do less."
Mr. Clinton simply said that settlements were contentious and could create problems in peace talks.
Mr. Netanyahu also refused to give the Americans a date by which Israel would redeploy its troops in Hebron, saying that while Israel will keep its commitments, he continues to study the security situation there, where some 450 Israeli settlers live heavily guarded in an otherwise Palestinian town.
Under existing agreements, Israel is to withdraw from most of the city, leaving a contingent to guard the Israelis.
Mr. Netanyahu also said he was mindful of the pain caused to Palestinians by the closing to free travel and trade of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which prevents most Palestinians from going to Israel to work.
"As soon as I deem the security conditions allow it, I will ease the closure," he said. "But the closure, as you know, is one of the consequences of the absence or the failure of the Palestinian Authority in the past to conform with their obligations vis-a-vis security and fighting terrorism."
If the Palestinians continue to curb terrorism, Mr. Netanyahu said, "our response will be very, very positive in a number of areas, and especially and most directly in the economic areas."
Mr. Netanyahu said Israel wanted to pursue a wider peace with Syria, but on different terms than the previous Government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres. With the Syrians as well as the Palestinians, he said, Israel will insist that all terrorist activity end before peace talks.
He said Lebanon would be a test case of Syrian intentions toward Israel, and he called on Damascus to stop supporting the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas who are fighting Israeli troops in southern Lebanon and have lobbed rockets into northern Israel.
A senior Israeli official said later, "Lebanon is the natural place to build a new and different relationship with Syria."
There was a moment of humor when Mr. Clinton was asked about his support for Mr. Peres in the recent Israeli election. "I don't think it needed that much explaining," Mr. Clinton said, reddening, then added: "There is one thing I've learned in years of dealing with Mr. Netanyahu: he's a very bright man. Sometimes I wish I could explain things that don't need much explaining."
Mr. Netanyahu broke in to say, "Mr. President, we didn't discuss the election results." A relieved Mr. Clinton then said, "We didn't discuss it at all."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
People close to Apple don't rule out a sale of some of its parts.

BYLINE: By John Markoff 

 BODY:
ARE slices of Apple Computer up for sale?
Just five months after Apple's board spurned a takeover bid by Sun Microsystems and chose, instead, to hire Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and chief executive, Mr. Amelio's turnaround prospects look increasingly grim.
Sales have continued to crumble. The schedule for new products that might restore consumer confidence has slipped by at least a quarter. The stock price, which edged down 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $19, is at its lowest point in nearly a decade -- and well below the $23 to $24 a share that Sun offered back in January. That put Apple's market capitalization yesterday at $2.37 billion, or less than 40 percent of Apple's $6.2 billion valuation only one year ago. 
 Peering through the gloom, financial analysts and market researchers have begun to conclude that Mr. Amelio no longer has the leisurely luxury of a one-year turnaround timetable, but will need to take some sort of quick action to appease shareholders. And so Silicon Valley is rife with talk that portions -- or even all -- of Apple may be in play again.
Of course, as Apple executives meet with all sorts of companies these days in an effort to devise a winning strategy -- including a recent retreat that found Mr. Amelio talking technology with William H. Gates, chairman of Apple's longtime archenemy, the Microsoft Corporation -- it is possible, of course, that Apple watchers are confusing brainstorming with horse trading.
And Apple officially declines to comment. But while people close to the company insist that the whole Apple is not for sale, they do not rule out a paring of one or more parts. The likeliest may include Apple's printer business, the division that produces the Newton hand-held computer, or the company's new Pippin television set-top CD-ROM and Internet terminal.
The latest storm of speculation involves the Oracle Corporation. Oracle has held on-and-off merger talks with Apple over the years, and its chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison, has long let it be known that he would like to add Apple's lineup of personal computers and software to Oracle's market-leading lineup of corporate data base management programs. Last week Mr. Ellison and Oracle's president, Raymond J. Lane, at the last minute canceled their attendance at a long-scheduled gathering on Bali of several hundred of Oracle's top sales representatives. Word among the Oracle sales force, jittery over the implications for their own company's stock, was that the two top executives were back in Silicon Valley negotiating some kind of deal with Apple.
Oracle has declined to comment, other than the attempt by one company executive to laugh off the rumors. "Larry has a long history of blowing off meetings -- ranging from Nobel laureates to grand conferences of Oracle customers," the executive said. Mr. Ellison was said to be traveling yesterday and unavailable to discuss the matter.
Given Mr. Amelio's publicly stated strategy of refocusing the company on a clearly defined set of products, and his recently completed assembly of a management team with no-nonsense business executives like the former Texas Instruments manager Marco Landi and the I.B.M. veteran Ellen Hancock, several people close to the company say there has been a let's-make-a-deal atmosphere inside Apple in recent weeks.
The PC maker Gateway 2000 has reportedly come calling. And while Microsoft has publicly denied kicking any tires, the company is known to covet the Quicktime techology that has consistently given Apple an edge in multimedia computing.
Scott G. McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsytems, who earlier this year offered what at the time was a controversially low bid for Apple of $23 to $24 a share, is said to be no longer interested in salvaging all or part of Apple. Instead, people familiar with his thinking said, Mr. McNealy is now focused on Sun's work station business and Java software for the Internet.
The Internet, in fact, seems to be compounding Apple's problems. The most innovative software for use with the global computing network these days typically does not appear in versions for Apple Macintosh computers until months after it is available for PC's based on Microsoft's Windows operating system -- if the Macintosh programs appear at all.
"The Internet is proving to be Apple's worst nightmare," said Apple's co-founder and former chairman, Steven Jobs. "People are switching to Windows computers to take advantage of the Internet."
With Apple's stock-market value so depressed, some analysts see it as only a matter of time before a buyer shows up, money in hand, with an offer for parts or all of Apple Computer.
"Apple's stock price is so low that either Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison could buy the company by putting it on their personal American Express Gold cards," said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a Seaford, L.I., computer-industry consulting firm.
But Mr. Jobs apparently no longer sees much value in the company he founded. He said that when he recently took his college-bound daughter computer shopping, he came away disappointed with the available Macintosh Powerbook offerings. So what did Mr. Jobs purchase? An I.B.M. Thinkpad.

HEADLINE: Disregarding Pure Politics

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
As a matter of pure politics, Republicans in Congress have handled the minimum wage as an exercise in snatching defeat from the jaws of defeat. Or at least snatching prolonged, painful defeat from the jaws of quick, change-the-subject defeat.
Since March, Democrats have marveled at their good fortune as Republicans fought off holding a vote on raising the $4.25 per hour wage. Democrats thought they would win, sooner or later, because the public overwhelmingly supports an increase, but they never counted on dominating Congressional debate with the issue. Speaker Newt Gingrich saw that risk, and let the House vote in May, so the Republicans could reclaim the agenda. 
 But in the Senate, where the leadership was distracted by Bob Dole's farewell tour, the issue languished six more weeks. Today Democrats won, and figured they would have to settle for victory. But conservative Republicans decided to keep the wage issue alive a while longer, saying they would prevent the bill from going to conference or back to the House for a final vote.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the deputy Republican leader, said he would keep the bill tied up until Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, gave ground on a health insurance bill. Gleeful Democrats applauded the Nickles strategy, saying the longer the wage issue flourishes, the more political hay they make.
The odd thing, even in this presidential year, is that pure politics does not pull all strings. Philosophical views on policy still matter. While plenty of conservative Republican Senators from Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania voted to gut the wage bill by reducing its coverage and then "got well" by voting to pass it, two dozen voted against passing it at all.
They argued that raising the minimum wage would hurt small business, cost jobs, and even, in the words of Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, cause "a crime problem and a juvenile problem of epic proportions," involving suddenly unemployed teen-agers.
For most lawmakers, politics was at the core of today's events, even if it was muted on the Senate floor, where Democrats were wary about offending Republican allies they needed to defeat the amendment reducing coverage, but not outside.
A noontime rally on the West steps of the Capitol had sweltering union members chanting "American needs a raise," and Mr. Kennedy, the bill's chief sponsor, proclaiming, "You're out Republicans, you're wrong on the minimum wage." He told the union members, "We're going to make sure they are out in November," and they roared.
Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, said few issues have so united the Democrats, all 47 of whom voted against reducing coverage and for the bill. Beyond what the bill does "for 10 million working people," he said, this issue "symbolizes whose side Democrats are on and that this party is fundamentally about hard-working people."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the issue was helping party candidates in places like Texas and Idaho, two states whose four Republican senators voted against the bill. But he said that while "the good news is we get a lot of votes, the bad news is the Republicans get a lot of money" from the issue.
Just as the issue helps Democrats to reconnect with organized labor, financially and ideologically, it enables Republicans to identify with their small-business base. Today it enabled one Senator in a tough primary, Sheila Frahm of Kansas, to work against the suspicion that she was too moderate to succeed Bob Dole. She voted against the bill, even though her retiring colleague, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, voted for it after voting to reduce its coverage.
The threat of further delay was raised even before the bill was passed. Emerging from a party luncheon, Mr. Nickles told reporters, "My intention is to see that we don't have conferees appointed on the minimum wage bill until after we have conferees appointed to the health bill."
He was referring to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, whose central feature would make insurance coverage portable from job to job and curb insurance companies rights to limit coverage of pre-existing conditions. Mr. Kennedy has blocked the appointment of conferees after Mr. Dole sought to stack them in favor of adding a provision for tax-deductible Medical Savings Accounts which the Senate had killed, though the House favors them.
Some of his Republican colleagues argued it was smart to hold Mr. Kennedy's feet to the fire by this tactic. One senator said Mr. Nickles was telling Mr. Kennedy, in effect, "We're not going to play in the sandbox by your rules." But others shook their heads and rolled their eyes, though declining to speak for quotation.
An aide to one Republican senator who voted to reduce the coverage and then voted for the bill said: "Republicans don't believe in raising the minimum wage. We voted for it because it was killing us."
The G.O.P. Senate aide and Mr. Reich agreed on one thing -- the futility of the Nickles maneuver. "If he wants to dig even a deeper hole for Republicans than he's in now," the secretary said, "I feel sorry for him and his colleagues."
The aide was even more caustic, saying, "To drag it out is absurd."

HEADLINE: Six Flags Plans to Build a 200-Acre Theme Park Near Foxwoods Casino

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 9

 BODY:
The nation's second-largest theme park company announced today that it wanted to build a park on 200 acres that the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe owns seven miles from its Foxwoods Resort Casino.
The project could transform the little town of North Stonington, with a population of 5,000. It is the latest in a series of projects that have brought major economic change to southeastern Connecticut. 
 While officials of Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. have yet to offer details, they said the park would be comparable in size to Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J. They estimated that the new park would attract two million visitors a year and create several thousand jobs.
Charles E. Elias, the First Selectman of North Stonington, said today that he favored the idea, though he agreed that it would generate opposition and would need to be reviewed.
"North Stogington is a typical small New England town," Mr. Elias said, after meeting this morning with Six Flags officials. "This project will basically bring the amount of development that we would expect to see over 30 years in about 30 months. It would be a major change in virtually the way all our departments and people function.
"A lot of citizens here are going to be very concerned about it," Mr. Elias added.
In recent years, the Pequot casino has become the nation's most profitable casino and the state's biggest tourist draw, attracting 20 million visitors last year. Another casino, operated by the Mohegan Tribe, is scheduled to open in nearby Montville in October.
Along with gambling, the area has the Mystic Aquarium, which is undergoing major renovations, and the Mystic Seaport, said to be the country's largest maritime museum, and several beaches.
"This is an ideal location for us," said William W. Moore, a senior vice president at Six Flags. "It's part of a region with a strong tourism base that has no big theme parks."
Six Flags, which operates 12 theme parks across the country, is jointly owned by Boston Ventures Inc., with a 51 percent stake in the company, and by Time Warner Inc, with the remaining 49 percent. This would be the first theme park that the company has built since 1972.
The deal hinges on approvals from state and local authorities. Mr. Moore said the lease would be for 35 years, but is not final until the company completes a series of studies. He declined to say how much the company would pay the Pequots.
The site, off Exit 92 of Interstate 95, has been intended for development since the 1960's, and in the 1980's another developer considered building an amusement park there.
Mr. Moore said the park would be completed in two to four years. He said it would incorporate characters from Warner Brothers cartoons and movies. It would be seasonal, open daily in the summer and on weekends in the fall and spring. It would be closed in winter.
Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said today that the Governor supports any economic development that creates jobs, though he said Mr. Rowland wanted to make sure that it met environmental and traffic laws, as well as the concerns of its neighbors.
The announcement comes four years after the state began an effort to increase tourism, enacting a $1 tax on car rentals to finance promotions. In the last three years, Connecticut has moved up to fifth most popular tourist destination for New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Strength Has U.S. Executives Grumbling

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
With the dollar near its highest level against the Japanese yen in nearly two and a half years, industrial leaders in the United States are beginning to express concern that the currency's strong rebound may undermine American competitiveness against foreign rivals.
Over the last week, the dollar rose to levels it has not enjoyed against the yen since January 1994, although it dropped slightly in trading today. After touching 111.16 yen on Monday, the dollar sold in New York late today at 110.30 yen, 38 percent higher than its intraday low in April 1995 of 79.75 yen. 
 Traders said the dollar could move even higher if the Federal Reserve increased interest rates later this summer, as some now expect. Higher rates in the United States would make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors, especially in relation to investments in Japan, where interest rates have been kept extremely low in an effort to stimulate the long-stagnant economy.
While the complaints from American executives have worried some currency traders, the executives' concerns have not carried a great deal of weight among economic policy makers so far. Neither the American nor Japanese Government has expressed public concern about the dollar's strength, and both have indeed suggested that they are relatively happy with current exchange rates.
At their meeting in Lyons, France, last month, top officials of seven leading industrial nations said the rebound of the dollar in the preceding 15 months and the general direction of exchange rates were "positive and promising."
The dollar has also gained against other major currencies, including the German mark. The dollar was quoted at 1.5263 marks in late trading today, up slightly from 1.5261 marks. In April 1995, the dollar reached a low of 1.3675 marks.
Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and other Clinton Administration officials have repeatedly said that a strong dollar is good for the United States and that the currency's level should reflect economic fundamentals.
At the moment, they said, the dollar's strength is a function of such factors as low inflation, a reduced budget deficit, steady growth, falling unemployment and improved corporate efficiency.
And Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, said: "We're concentrating on strong fundamentals that are ultimately important for competition and for markets. The American economy is very strong and doesn't need currency-induced adrenaline."
In the mid-1980's, when the dollar was worth more than 200 yen, American manufacturers would have been thrilled with an exchange rate of 110. Moreover, American industry generally has cut costs and greatly improved efficiency in the last decade, allowing many companies to absorb currency fluctuations with less strain.
A stronger dollar makes American products more expensive in terms of foreign currencies, and allows foreign exporters to cut prices or benefit from higher profit margins in the United States. A strong dollar can benefit American manufacturers to some degree by pushing down prices for parts they purchase abroad.
But in industries most subject to competition from Japan, including automobiles and other heavy equipment, there have been increasingly loud complaints in recent weeks that the dollar's rise may need to be checked.
The latest and most explicit comment came today in Tokyo from Donald V. Fites, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar Inc., the earth-moving equipment company, whose main competitor is Japanese.
"The recent dramatic weakness of the yen against the dollar is most worrisome and may demand attention from governments," said Mr. Fites, who is also chairman of the U.S.-Japan Business Council, at a business conference. "The yen at 111 to the dollar has the potential to erase and reverse the recent beginning of improvement in our bilateral trade balance."
American auto makers have also made clear that they are concerned. Robert J. Eaton, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, brought up the dollar in a meeting with White House aides last month. The Big Three are worried that the stronger dollar will give Japanese car companies greater ability to lower their prices.
In a statement today, the National Association of Manufacturers warned that one result of an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve would be to "hurt U.S. sales overseas by raising the value of the dollar."
Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, said last month that an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar was reasonable, although he also suggested that this was near the high end of what the United States should consider acceptable.
Other economists said that the current exchange rate struck a good balance between the needs of the American and Japanese economies, but that a further substantial rise could create economic and political pressure to force the dollar back down.
"At 110, it's the level of exchange rate at which Japanese industry is making money, but one that will not produce major deterioration in the current account," said David Hale of Zurich Kemper Investments.
A decline last year by the dollar against the yen helped narrow the trade deficit with Japan somewhat. Economists said that at the current exchange rate, the United States would probably not see any further currency-driven improvement in its trade balance after this year, but that the trade deficit should benefit from strengthening economies of Japan and other major trading partners.
"I still think we're in pretty good shape and that we could see an even higher dollar and still get improved exports if the European and Japanese economies live up to their potential," said Joseph Liro, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. "What we have going for us now is very clear cost competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese and German producers."
As a result, he said, American manufacturers can weather, and policy makers in Washington would tolerate, a rise in the dollar to perhaps 115 yen.
"If the Fed does start tightening and the dollar starts to appreciate to around 115 yen, we would start getting clear and unambiguous talk out of the Administration that that is unacceptable," Mr. Liro added.

HEADLINE: Clinton Likely to Visit China in 1997 if He Is Re-elected

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Wednesday, July 10

 BODY:
Celebrating an apparent warming in relations, Chinese and American officials said today that they expect President Clinton to visit China sometime next year if he is re-elected. In return, President Jiang Zemin would visit Washington.
As President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, concluded two days of meetings with China's top leaders, officials from both countries stressed the positive side of their relationship. 
 No final decisions have yet been made about the timing or location of summit meetings, but the expectation that they will take place at all marks a shift from the recent acrimony. It also underlines a new focus on China by the Administration, which has been criticized for inattention to China and a wavering policy.
"Because of our recent progress, I would expect that there will be an exchange of state visits," Mr. Lake said this morning. "We're glad that the progress we've made even allowed that discussion to take place."
Only a few months ago, the two nations tensed over Taiwan, as China lobbed missiles into the sea around the island and the United States sent warships to patrol nearby. Last month China and the United States slipped to the brink of a trade war before reaching an agreement.
On Tuesday, although serious disagreements persist over human rights violations, Taiwan's future and various trade issues, officials from both sides concentrated on similarities and cooperation.
"Common interests between China and the United States are far more numerous than our differences," said Cui Tiankai, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, avoiding the invective that has often colored official comments over the last year. "There is no reason to be pessimistic about the future of bilateral relations."
The shift follows a sequence of problems that have been, at least in part, solved in recent months: the resolution of last month's trade talks, Congress's decisive vote to renew China's most-favored nation trading status, and the receding of the immediate problems in Taiwan.
Officials also said on Tuesday that the United States had accepted in principle a long-standing invitation for Vice President Al Gore to attend a conference on sustainable development in Beijing, though no dates have been fixed.
Mr. Lake, the most senior American official to come to China since 1994, said that he did not achieve any diplomatic breakthroughs, but that he had not expected any. The underlying differences between the United States and China -- human rights and Taiwan -- have not changed in any essential way.
"It is very unlikely that one meeting is going to produce a giant step forward," Mr. Lake said, referring to human rights. "This is a long-term issue."
Yet the main purpose of Mr. Lake's visit, as one American official put it, was to construct a bond of "mutual expectation."
For in agreeing to improve ties and to work toward a summit meeting, American and Chinese leaders each get what they most want: President Clinton can expect the Chinese to prevent any diplomatic blow-ups before the election in November, and President Jiang can play host to his American counterpart in Beijing in 1997, bolstering his position as leaders here prepare for a Communist Party Congress late next year.
Two senior American officials, in a briefing for reporters, described Mr. Lake's visit as part of a concerted effort to prevent unexpected problems from derailing relations.
"The main approach," said one official, describing Mr. Lake's talks, "was the need precisely to anticipate problems, or at least figure out how to manage them jointly, or to contain any damage that might be caused."
American officials have been frustrated by the way American-Chinese relations have lurched from crisis to crisis, like the arrest of Harry Wu, the human rights activist, last summer, or the maltreatment of orphans in China that was revealed in January. Each of those events, coming as a surprise, caused an uproar in the United States.
"Security and stability and predictability" was how the official characterized what each side wants. "We're trying to be based on a little more -- I don't want to use the word 'trust' -- but based on mutual expectation."
Mr. Lake said much of his discussion addressed how to coordinate long-term interests, a topic that one of his aides called "managed competition."
"It's very important that China understand that the U.S. does want to see China" sharing world leadership, Mr. Lake said. "That sounds like geo-babble; it really isn't."
Two American officials described Mr. Lake's visit as the second round of a budding long-term relationship with a Chinese counterpart, Liu Huaqiu, director of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Office.
In March, the officials said, Mr. Lake met for seven hours with Mr. Liu at the home of the United States Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, in Middleburgh, Va., where they spoke about how to manage the crises at hand: Taiwan, the Chinese shipment to Pakistan of ring magnets, which can be used in nuclear weapons production, and the dispute over intellectual property rights.
On Monday, the American officials said, Mr. Lake and Mr. Liu met again for seven hours in a secluded room in a guest house in Beijing.
After working out the details with his counterpart, Mr. Lake met on Tuesday with President Jiang, discussed economic cooperation and trade with Prime Minister Li Peng, and talked about Taiwan with Defense Minister Chi Haotian.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rebound, With Dow Climbing 31.03

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stock prices rebounded somewhat yesterday, as investors looked for bargains in shares that had been beaten down by four days of losses.
Analysts said the market was aided by some encouraging second-quarter earnings reports. And stock traders also took cues from the bond market, where prices rose and yields dropped yesterday. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 31.03 points, to 5,581.86. In the four previous sessions, the Dow had tumbled 179.15 points, or 3 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 379.43 million shares, up from 367.56 million on Monday.
Among broader market gauges, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.21 points, to 654.75, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.77 points, to 1,153.59.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was 2.24 points lower, at 566.67.
The market's weakness in recent days has been spurred by fears that the economy was growing too fast and that the Federal Reserve was about to raise lending rates to slow it down as a way to forestall inflation.
Stock traders took their cues from the Treasury bond market, where interest rates spiked upward on Friday, after a report on June employment showed much stronger job growth than economists had predicted.
Increased lending rates generally hurt stocks because of expectations that consumers will spend less and individual and corporate borrowing will cost more, resulting in lower corporate profits.
Yesterday, the bond market rallied, sending its rates downward. That helped spur stock buying, said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston.
Mr. Freedman noted that the stock market had taken a hit after other recent reports showing faster-than-anticipated job growth -- but had usually recovered. Yesterday's gain might be more of the same, he said.
"I think there's some bargain hunting out there," he said, cautioning that the market was likely to remain volatile until June's inflation indexes were released, starting on Friday.
Interest-sensitive bank stocks, which fell Monday, rebounded yesterday.
Shares of the Bank of New York gained 1 1/4, to 50 3/8, after it declared a 2-for-1 common stock split, which is to take effect after the company pays a quarterly dividend of 44 cents a share.
Mellon Bank also gained 1 1/4, to 55 1/4, while BankAmerica gained 1 1/2, to 75 1/8. Higher rates make bank loans less profitable.
Stocks were also supported by early second-quarter financial reports, said Andrew Brooks, vice president of equity trading at the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
"We're watching the corporate earnings pretty closely and so far they're coming in O.K.," he said. "That's a key underpinning for the market."
Among them was the athletic shoe maker Nike Inc., which surprised the market with quarterly earnings of $1.06 a share; Nike shares gained 4 1/2, to 108 3/4.
International Paper reported earnings of 33 cents a share, nearly 10 cents higher than predictions. Its shares rose 1 5/8, to 39 1/8.
Other paper companies advanced on the news. Georgia-Pacific gained 2, to 72 1/8; Union Camp jumped 5/8, to 49 3/4, and Willamette Industries rose 1 3/4, to 60 1/4.
An exception came in health maintenance organization stocks, which fell after Mid-Atlantic Medical Services said it would lose between 5 cents and 10 cents in the second quarter because of higher medical claims.
Mid-Atlantic is the latest of several to predict a weak second quarter. It lost 1/2, to 13 3/4. The much bigger United Healthcare lost 2 3/8, to 45 3/4.

HEADLINE: What Inflation?

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith teaches economics at the Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
The economic news on Friday was so good it was a disaster. Unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent, the lowest it has been in six years. June payrolls increased by 239,000 jobs. And the average hourly wage rose by 9 cents, the biggest one-month jump ever recorded, a level "noticeably above the inflation rate," as The New York Times reported.
Pandemonium on Wall Street! The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond leaped a quarter of a point, finishing at 7.18 percent. And stocks plummeted: the Dow Jones industrial average dived 114 points. 
 Amid the commotion, one could hear the bond bears roaring their message that, with inflation sure to surge, the Federal Reserve must raise short-term interest rates. Many of the bears said that had the Fed's Open Market Committee known at its meeting last Wednesday what the secretive Bureau of Labor Statistics would announce two days later, it would surely have raised them. Some urged the Fed to correct this "error" immediately without waiting until the next regular meeting in August.
Nonsense. There is no cause for alarm. The evidence does not portend surging inflation. To begin with, the annual rate remains low: 2.9 percent in the year that ended in May. Inflation is not accelerating. Instead, productivity growth appears to be picking up. If this pattern continues, it will permit wages to grow for some time, with little effect on price inflation.
The decline in unemployment also means little. Some economists still hold to the notion of a "natural rate of unemployment" at 6 percent or a slightly lower figure, below which they believe inflation spirals out of control. But joblessness has been less than 6 percent without raising inflation since September 1994.
Recent economic studies confirm there is little reason to fear that prices will rise simply because of low unemployment -- or, for that matter, rapid growth. Most inflation of past decades had different causes, like oil shocks and war.
Some say to forget the facts. An official of a regional Federal Reserve bank recently told Business Week (anonymously, of course) that "you have to move on anecdotal data." In other words, monetary policy should be based on gossip. Mercifully, it is likely that the Federal Reserve Board's governors do not share this view.
The bears in the bond market must also know that their inflation warnings are unfounded. So what are they up to? The answer seems clear. We have a speculation problem, not an inflation problem.
The bears make their living by betting on the Fed's next decision, not by calling the economy. The bears predict when short-term rates will be raised and when they will decline. By selling and buying long-term bonds in advance, they can make a lot of money -- if their predictions are right. So it is natural that they try to affect the Fed's decisions.
This game has been in full cry since at least October 1993, when bond-market insiders correctly anticipated (and may have provoked) the Fed's rate increase of February 1994. All through that year, each time the Fed raised interest rates, the stock and bond markets churned.
If short-term rates are pushed up tomorrow, many ordinary investors will panic and dump their bonds and stocks. Then the speculators can buy cheap and "shear the sheep" -- the small investors, in the speculators' lingo.
Sell bonds, create gossip, influence policy -- what a game! But maybe the game has changed. News reports preceding the Fed's inactivity last week suggested that the chairman, Alan Greenspan, may have given up the "pre-emptive strike" anti-inflation strategy of 1994. Good. The idea that the economic evidence counts for something is central to proper monetary policy.
But Mr. Greenspan's possible credibility as a pragmatist, only a week old and none too sturdy, will depend on facing down the bears.
It would be an extremely good thing if the Federal Reserve held the line through the summer and fall -- at least as long as core inflation (calculated without volatile food and energy prices), measured over six months or so, remains reasonable.
In that event, the interest rates on long-term bonds will finally begin to decline, and maybe short-term rates will follow. Traders committed to a strategy of creating panic will lose money. So what?
The Fed did the right thing. Now it should stand firm and show the speculators who is in charge.

HEADLINE: Hartford Court Bars Imbalance In the Schools

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 9

 BODY:
Connecticut's Supreme Court ruled today that the racial segregation in Hartford's public schools is unconstitutional, and called on the General Assembly to remedy the disparity between suburban schools and those of the city, which serve black and Hispanic students almost exclusively.
The ruling that segregated schools are unconstitutional, regardless of the cause, was the first by a state high court since California's ordered the desegregation of Los Angeles schools in 1975. When the California Constitution was amended to bar the busing of students a few years later, it largely ended national efforts to combat de facto segregation in inner-city schools. 
 While Connecticut's ruling today gives new life to the fight against such segregation, it comes as recent United States Supreme Court rulings have barred governments from setting racial goals, except to remedy intentional discrimination, which the Connecticut court ruled was not in evidence in this case.
That means Connecticut's efforts to comply with the court's order could face a challenge in Federal courts.
Gov. John G. Rowland and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal pledged to act as quickly as possible to comply with the ruling, but added that they would oppose forced busing. The ruling struck down the state's school-districting law as it has been applied to Hartford and its suburbs, but Mr. Rowland and Mr. Blumenthal said it was unclear whether other cities, like Bridgeport and New Haven, would be affected. Three dissenting judges complained, however, that the ruling struck down the state's school-districting law in its entirety.
"We have had our day in court," Governor Rowland said. "The court has ruled. And we must abide by the decision."
But, he said: "It has taken seven years for this case to make its way through the courts. The problem of school segregation in our urban areas is a very complicated problem with deep-running social and economic causes. I do not expect any quick answers and I cannot predict what the remedies will be."
Mr. Rowland said he expected that some legislators would propose a constitutional amendment eliminating the basis for the court's 4-to-3 decision, particularly its unusual clause that prohibits not only racial discrimination, but also segregation.
But several legislative leaders said their first response would be to spur voluntary integration efforts, like regional magnet schools, which are already under way in Hartford and other cities under a 1994 state law prompted by the Hartford suit, which is known as Sheff v. O'Neill.
"I don't like amending the Constitution if I can avoid it," Senator Adela M. Eads, the ranking Republican in the Republican-dominated Senate, said. "That would be the last thing I would think about doing."
At an elementary school in Hartford's mainly black North End today, the suit's namesake, Milo Sheff, a senior at Weaver High School who was in the fourth grade when the suit was filed in 1989, celebrated with his mother, other plaintiffs and civil-rights lawyers.
In April 1995, a trial judge's rejection of the Sheff case's arguments provoked angry protests in the city. The Supreme Court's reversal of the judge, and its passionate declaration that segregated schools violate the constitution, brought smiles amid calls for quick action.
"We are mindful of the urgency and the necessity and the desperation to help the children of the city of Hartford," said John Brittain, a lead lawyer on the case. "We stress the urgency of this action in formulating some legislative response."
Seeking to link Hartford's schools with those of its suburbs, even as Federal courts were refusing to order desegregation plans across district lines unless intentional discrimination was proved, Mr. Brittain and other lawyers based their case on Connecticut's Constitution.
The extreme concentration of poorchildren in Hartford's schools, 94 percent of them from minority groups, deprived them of the equal educational opportunity guaranteed by the constitution, they argued, even though generous state aid permitted the city to spend more per pupil than nearly all of its suburbs.
As evidence of the harm, the Sheff lawyers cited the ranking of Hartford children on the state's standardized tests. They are last.
The state acknowledged the racial imbalance, but said it had occurred because of demographic changes, despite efforts to counter it. The schools were doing an adequate job, experts testified. They said the low test scores reflected the poverty and social problems of the students.
In the decision today, written by Chief Justice Ellen Ash Peters, the majority agreed with the state's experts that the academic performance of Hartford children resuted largely from poverty, but said that did not matter. The racial segregation was itself harmful and unconstitutional, they wrote.
"We conclude that the existence of extreme racial and ethnic isolation in the public school system deprives schoolchildren of a substantially equal educational opportunity and requires the state to take further remedial measures," Justice Peters wrote.
The main cause of the segregation, the majority concluded, was the basing of school districts on town boundaries, which allowed the movement of middle-class families to suburbia in the 1950's and 60's, leaving poor minority groups behind.
But Justice Robert J. Callahan, who will succeed Justice Peters as Chief Justice on Sept. 1, and Justice Richard N. Palmer joined in a sharp dissent by Justice David M. Borden. It accused the majority of inventing a theory of law to fit the conclusion that it wanted to reach.
"The necessary implication of the majority's reasoning," Justice Borden wrote, "is that virtually every school district in the state is now either unconstitutional or constitutionally suspect. Without explicitly saying so, the majority has effectively struck down, not just for the greater Hartford area but for the entire state, the municipality-based school system that has been in effect in this state since 1909."
David Armor, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who testified for the state, said the ruling would probably prompt civil-rights lawyers to explore similar suits under other state constitutions with similar provisions. A suit has already been filed in Minneapolis.
"But we're talking about de facto segregation," he said, "the result of actions of individual people. If that's the case, the people can amend the Constitution and make it clear that de facto segregation is not unconstitutional. Maybe that's why the Supreme Court is putting it back in the legislature's lap."
Gary Orfield, a leading expert on desegregation who testified for the plaintiffs, said Connecticut could take several voluntary measures, such as allowing Hartford students to enroll in suburban schools, before dealing with district boundaries.

HEADLINE: Aging, and Clasping The Mortal Coil;
Raves for 'Shakespeare With Bob'

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep.
It was a summer afternoon in a lower Manhattan center for the elderly, and Bob Smith was working the crowd, wandering among the snowy heads and aluminum walkers, discoursing, teasing and ruminating about Hamlet. The audience was standing-room-only: some 65 people, mostly in their 70's, 80's and 90's, picking their way through Act V, Scene 2 at the point at which Hamlet tells Horatio he has been unable to sleep.
"I had one of those nights last night," Mr. Smith interjected.
A few people in the class chuckled, anticipating more.
"I have a cat named Emily," he went on. "And she kisses me."
Now more people were laughing.
"And I like it," he said. "More than I should. If I wake up in the night and I even move, there she is: 'Oh, yes, we can make out!' Emily and I made out a lot last night."
People were chortling, leaning back in their chairs.
"Hamlet apparently didn't have an Emily," Mr. Smith said, working his way back toward the point. "But he's talking about the same thing. He says, 'In my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep.' "
Two years ago, someone asked Bob Smith for a small favor. As a theater director who had spent much of his life thinking about Shakespeare, would he be willing to talk about Shakespeare, just once, at a center for the elderly connected to a theater at which he had worked?
He did not exactly leap at the chance. He had what he calls "enormous prejudices." Which is to say, he took it for granted that, in contemporary American culture, after a certain age, most people disappear.
But he agreed to do it. And what he found between the center's beige cinder-block walls left him stunned: a group of people whose range of experience and frame of reference illuminated plays he had known for years.
That class so surprised and thrilled Mr. Smith that he asked to do four more. The crowd doubled, quadrupled, multiplied by six. Word spread and other centers started calling, wanting Mr. Smith's classes.
Now Mr. Smith teaches Shakespeare to as many as 600 people every week in five centers around Manhattan. His classes regularly break attendance records, center officials say; only bridge class comes close.
 
More Enthusiastic Than High Schoolers
"Shakespeare w/Bob," as it was described in the lobby of a center on the Lower East Side, bears little resemblance to the unhappy stereotype of baffled adolescents being lectured about the derivation of swounds. Instead, the classes are packed with people in their seventh to 10th decades of life, bespectacled, some maneuvering on canes, handbags and shopping bags clutched in their laps, engaged in animated study and talk.
There are high school dropouts and people with advanced degrees; Shakespeare neophytes and buffs; theatergoers, balletomanes, devoted Lincoln Center volunteers; retired teachers, economists and a former chorus girl.
Their discussions stretch far beyond Shakespeare's use of heroic couplets to broader issues like love, honor and loss -- questions of philosophy that Mr. Smith now suspects have a special appeal to people in old age.
A scene in "King Lear" inspired a long dialogue one morning about the curious experience of passing on possessions to children, then unexpectedly living another 20 years and visiting the children and the possessions.
After one woman began to weep over a speech in "King John," written about the death of a child after Shakespeare had lost a son, she revealed to the class that she had had two children who died. Another woman had lost three.
For Mr. Smith, who is 55 today, the classes have become a passion, a kind of love affair, it seems, the significance of which he may not yet understand.
"It is very clear to me that I am at a well and that I had better drink while I'm standing there, because there is something about this that is meant to nurture the rest of my life," he said recently.
"And I need it more than they need me," said Mr. Smith, who is paid on average $50 for a one- or two-hour class. "Not for the money; there is no money. I need whatever this is."
Early on, Mr. Smith recalls, he was teaching a class when he noticed a woman being wheeled into the room. She was heavy and slumped in her wheelchair; there seemed to be ribbons in her hair. He recalls feeling "slightly off put."
He happened to be speaking at the time about a phenomenon in Shakespeare in which characters are made to appear to be something they are not, and about how other characters, who are the antithesis, suffer for being direct.
As he was talking, he says, he noticed the woman's mouth seeming to twitch. Wondering if something was wrong, he said, he made his way to the back of the room, lowered his head to her face and asked if she was O.K.
"Cordelia," she whispered hoarsely.
She had known instantly the character that Mr. Smith had in mind. As he put it later, "Through all of that obstruction, there was that pure thought." The experience, he said, taught him "a spectacular lesson."
"It's the lesson," he said, "that we keep wanting to shorthand people's appearances, whether it's race or age or sex. We want to make an easy, acceptable shorthand so we don't have to go the extra step of intimacy.
"We make people invisible in order to not get connected to the thing in them that makes us uncomfortable. Therefore, we throw away all that they are."
In this case, he said: "It's about death. Everybody is afraid of death."
As Mr. Smith describes his life, he is a kind of Shakespeare autodidact. He grew up in Stratford, Conn., the home of what was the American Shakespeare Festival, where, as a teen-ager, he got a job as a dresser.
He would spend hours there, on the floor in the darkened entranceway to the stage, listening to plays being performed. As a result, Shakespeare never intimidated him. In fact, he says, Shakespeare saved his life.
"When I first really heard the ideas and that those ideas were allowed to be talked about -- what people really feel, what they really care about, what's important, what honor means, what loyalty means -- that those were very essential discussions for human beings to be having with each other, it absolutely blew open my universe," he said.
He never went to college. He became a painter. But he would memorize Shakespeare's plays, or sections of plays, reciting them out loud while he painted, puzzling over their construction and what they meant.
Friends who were actors began to ask his advice about parts, at first over the telephone and then in person. When some began to encourage him to teach classes, he said, he resisted. In the late 1970's, he gave in.
From there, Mr. Smith also got into directing Shakespeare, mostly in smaller theaters and on college campuses. Much of his work, he said, has involved using Shakespeare to explore and illuminate social issues.
"I'm interested in Shakespeare as it applies to real life, not so much in doing a Broadway play," he said. He sees Shakespeare "as an opportunity to ask important questions about fairness, truth, whatever."
 
A One-Man Touring Company
These days, Mr. Smith finds himself exploring those questions at the Stein Senior Center on East 29th Street at Second Avenue; the center at the Robert Fulton Houses on Ninth Avenue near 17th Street; the Sirovich Senior Center on East 12th Street near First Avenue; the Caring Community Senior Center in Washington Square, and the 92d Street Y on the Upper East Side.
At each center, and in a small private class he gives each week in some of his elderly students' homes, he moves through plays from start to finish, line by line, analyzing, interpreting and cajoling his students to join in.
He might stir up a discussion about everyone in Shakespeare who dies of a broken heart, or about Elizabethan laws governing Holy Communion, about whether Claudius has a drinking problem or about adversarial love.
"Have you ever been 'replete with too much rage?' " he queried a student in a discussion of a sonnet, bending to peer at her through her reading glasses. "Surely you have!"
In a class on "Romeo and Juliet," after Juliet's father refers to "ladies that have their toes unplagued with corns," Mr. Smith remarked: "Isn't he charming? He sounds like L.B.J. Right? He's got this kind of Texas quality to him."
Of Henry VI: "You know how it is -- people who have a celebrity dad and are somehow injured by it? It's a hard thing to work through." And on Antony: "When he's depressed -- a lot of people go shopping -- he likes parties."
 
Between the Lines, A Plain-Spoken Man
Mr. Smith is similarly plain-spoken with his students.
"He treats us in a very, very unsentimental way," said Ruth Lauterbach, 75. "He'll joke with us, kid around, talk about how old we are, what we look like. You take it from him because he's so funny. We all adore him."
Naomi Lewis, 66, who said she has not missed a class in two years, said: "Sometimes, it almost sounds like an insult. He'll be talking about sex and he'll say, 'Well, at your age. . . .' "
What has emerged is an unusual kind of closeness. One man drops cookies, like gifts, into Mr. Smith's bag. Another surreptitiously slips him bus transfer slips, indignantly insisting that Mr. Smith deserves to ride free.
Over Mr. Smith's objections, a man named Arthur gave him an entire set of 78 r.p.m. recordings by the Royal Shakespeare Company. When the man died, Mr. Smith devoted a whole class to references to Arthur in Shakespeare.
"He'll come in and say, 'I didn't see you last week,' " said Ruth Rubinstein, 78, whose husband died two years ago, leaving a void in her life she does not even attempt to describe.
"He comes in here: 'How are you doing today?' " she said of Mr. Smith. "He never forgets to kiss me. Oh, I love those kisses. This is what I miss. Bend down and kiss me again with that gorgeous face!"
One afternoon recently, as a class at the Sirovich Senior Center wound down, one of Mr. Smith's students bolted for the door, saying her husband was scheduled for surgery.
"Big or small?" Mr. Smith called to her.
"Small," she said, composing a cheerful face. Then she added, with a self-conscious wave of her hand: "To be or not to be?"
Mr. Smith gazed back.
"I say to be," he answered. "Why not? Can always not be."

HEADLINE: SENATE PASSES BILL FOR RAISE, TO $5.15, IN MINIMUM WAGE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
After four months of incessant Democratic pressure, the Senate approved a bill today to raise the Federal minimum wage to $5.15, virtually assuring a 90-cent-per-hour pay increase to more than 10 million Americans.
The final vote was 74 to 24, with 27 Republicans joining all 47 Democrats in favor. But the crucial vote came earlier, on a Republican amendment that would have exempted many employers from paying the increased wage. Five Republicans, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, broke ranks to join all 47 Democrats. 
 Tax provisions benefiting small business were merged with the wage measure, which is otherwise identical to the House version, to sweeten it for Republicans. Still, the outcome was a stunning political coup for the White House, Senate Democrats and their allies in organized labor. [News analysis, page A12.]
Six months ago, few people expected the Democrats to succeed in forcing the minimum wage onto the agenda of the Republican-controlled Congress this year. The House approved the increase in May by a vote of 281 to 144.
Some Republicans who opposed the increase as a job killer threatened this afternoon to delay the measure, by blocking the appointment of conferees to reconcile the few differences between House and Senate bills. But senior Republicans said the tactic would not succeed in blocking the first increase in the minimum wage in six years.
"It will help working people without hurting our economy, and it is plainly the right thing to do," President Clinton said in a Rose Garden ceremony after the vote. Mr. Clinton has used the issue against former Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, who had opposed the measure.
The final vote, which also approved a $14 billion tax relief package for small businesses over the next 10 years, masked the divisiveness over the minimum wage part of the bill, and the intense lobbying by labor and small business groups to influence the outcome.
Besides Mr. D'Amato, the Republicans who broke ranks on the earlier vote were Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and James M. Jeffords of Vermont. Mr. D'Amato did not cast his vote until the outcome was clear.
The Republican amendment would have exempted businesses with less than $500,000 in annual sales from the increase, allowed employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage of $4.25 for the first 180 days of employment, and delayed the effective date to Jan. 1, 1997.
As passed by the Senate, the bill would allow employers to pay a sub-minimum wage to new workers under the age of 20 for the first 90 days. It would not require restaurant owners to increase the wages of workers who receive tips, who must only be paid $2.13 an hour now if tips bring their wages up to $4.25. Their wage would stay at $2.13, so long as tips bring their wages to $5.15.
The effective date in the bill is July 1, 1996, but Democrats said they would be willing to change that to 30 days after enactment to give employers time to plan for the pay rise. Democrats said they hoped Mr. Clinton could sign the bill by Labor Day.
"Today's vote means that millions of Americans will get the long-overdue increase they deserve," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the wage increase's chief Senate sponsor, told reporters after the vote.
The Senate defeated a Kennedy amendment by a vote of 52 to 46 that would have shortened the sub-minimum wage period to 30 days.
The bill passed by the Senate today would raise the minimum wage to $4.75 this year and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997. Full-time workers paid the minimum wage now earn about $8,500 a year. Today's vote would put an additional $1,800 a year in their pockets.
A potential obstacle to speedy passage emerged when Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Senate Republican, threatened to delay the appointment of Senate negotiators to work out the differences with the House on its version of the bill. Mr. Nickles said he was retaliating for what he said was Mr. Kennedy's insistence on blocking the appointment of negotiators to a major health insurance bill.
But most Republicans would just as soon be rid of the minimum wage issue and move on to their own legislative priorities. Democrats, led by Mr. Kennedy and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, have effectively tied up the Senate since March by threatening to attach the wage increase to any bill the Republican leadership brought to the floor.
The arguments for and against the minimum wage have not changed much since the minimum wage was first introduced, at 25 cents an hour, in 1938.
In two days of sometimes impassioned debate on the Senate floor, Republicans said an increase could force small businesses to lay off 100,000 to 500,000 workers over the next several years.
"These are Main Street businesses, mom-and-pop operations that are working out of their garages," said Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri Republican who was the main sponsor of the Republican amendment.
Moreover, critics said much of the benefit would go to teen-agers who don't really need the extra money but who value the job experience.
Democrats dismissed the dire predictions of job losses and countered that workers were entitled to a living wage and that a pay rise would lift hundreds of thousands of working families out of poverty.
"It's a matter of simple justice," said Senator Paul D. Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. "It's about more than a minimum wage for people. They view this as providing a foothold into the middle class."

HEADLINE: Birdie Amsterdam, 95, a Pioneer for Female Judges in New York

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.
Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench. 
 She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.
In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.
In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.
The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.
Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.
She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.
Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.
Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."
Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.

HEADLINE: Proposed Rule on H.M.O.'s Didn't Meet Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to "U.S. Shelves Plan to Limit Rewards to H.M.O. Doctors" (front page, July 8), Kaiser Permanente did not "denounce" regulations that protect Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and all managed-care patients from financial incentives that might induce physicians to withhold necessary care. Rather, we recommended that the current version of the regulations be withdrawn because it "does not adequately deal with the requirements of the statute on which the regulation is based." 
 We support the need for regulations to assure that the risk assumed by physicians is managed fairly for patients. The provider incentives under review by the Health Care Financing Administration were designed by managed-care plans to emphasize preventive care and early interventions to avoid more costly treatment later.
These methods reverse the traditional economics of health care, which encourage overtreatment and unnecessary testing.
Criticism of these incentives has been aimed at managed-care plans that pay contracting physicians on a per-patient basis. Kaiser Permanente's physicians are compensated primarily through their salaries, of which only a small portion is "at risk," so they can practice medicine without worry that individual care decisions will affect their incomes.
