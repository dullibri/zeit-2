HEADLINE: New Tremor Shakes Quake-Devastated Area of Turkey

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: IZMIT, Turkey, Aug. 31

 BODY:
A strong tremor shook already devastated towns in northwestern Turkey today, bringing several buildings crashing down and causing at least one death.
It was the strongest tremor to hit the area since the shattering earthquake of Aug. 17, which killed more than 14,000 people. Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are homeless as a result of that quake. 
 Today's tremor, which shook the earth back and forth for about 10 seconds, struck shortly after 11 A.M. and was followed by an aftershock about 20 minutes later.
The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the aftershock measured 4.6. Seismologists with the United States Geological Survey put the strength slightly higher at 5.4 for today's initial tremor and 4.7 for the aftershock.
Here in Izmit, where many homeless families are living in tents and railway boxcars, 166 people were admitted to hospitals and clinics after being hit by debris. A 30-year-old man was killed when masonry fell on him as he was fleeing a building that had been weakened in the Aug. 17 quake. Seven buildings were reported to have collapsed.
A man broke his leg in the town of Adapazari when he jumped from the third floor of a swaying building. The local Governor sent aides into the streets with loudspeakers to urge residents not to panic.
In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was one of the hardest hit by the Aug. 17 quake, which had a magnitude measured at 7.4, today's tremor sent people racing away from blocks of already weakened buildings. Many buildings shook, but none fell.
The tremor was also felt in some parts of Istanbul, which is about 65 miles from the apparent epicenter near Izmit. Dishes rattled in some homes, and desks shook in one of the few schools where the academic year had already begun.
But in Istanbul as in other areas, the main effect was psychological.
"Even if it doesn't do more damage, I don't like it," said Yusuf Ozkul, a carpenter in Golcuk who lost his home in the earlier quake and who is now living in a tent beside the Sea of Marmara. "It makes me nervous, because I've seen what these things can do. I hate it when the ground shakes, even if it only shakes a little."
The tremor struck minutes after J. Brady Anderson, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, left Golcuk after a tour of the devastated area.
He chatted with several survivors living in tents. They expressed gratitude for American aid and said their greatest need now was housing. The weather in this part of Turkey usually turns cold around mid-October.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has announced that she will visit Turkey on Sunday. She will be in the region on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals and added Turkey to her itinerary at the last moment.
Prosecutors in the town of Duzce, on the eastern edge of the devastated area, issued warrants for the arrest of 33 contractors, engineers and building owners. They were charged with using low-quality concrete, weak reinforcing rods and shoddy construction techniques that led to the fatal collapses of their buildings in the Aug. 17 quake.
"I've been a construction engineer for 30 years, and I've never seen reinforcing rods that are completely smooth like the ones I saw here," said Fred Stolaski, a relief worker from Florida. "I didn't even know they still made them."
One Turkish contractor sought by the police, Veli Gucer, gave a telephone interview to the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Mr. Gucer, who spoke from an undisclosed location, built a large apartment complex in the seaside town of Yalova in which several hundred people are believed to have perished.
"There's no reason for me to have a guilty conscience," he was quoted as saying. "Naturally I sympathize with the victims and their families, but I don't understand why I'm being made a scapegoat. I began building the Bahcekent complex in Yalova about six years ago. Naturally I didn't know much about the business. I studied literature in school. I'm a poet, not a structural engineer.
"I remember visiting my first construction site. I saw workers using beach sand to make concrete. When I asked about it, the architect told me it was completely normal. Only later did I learn that this is a completely wrong and dangerous technique. So I gave the order to stop doing such a disgusting thing. Unfortunately, half the complex was already finished by then."

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
FRANCE: FARMERS PROTEST -- Farmers and environmentalists demonstrated in several cities to call for the release of Jose Bove, an activist who was imprisoned after he led the ransacking of a McDonald's restaurant in the town of Millau. His group as well as farmers elsewhere in the country have picked various hamburger outlets as targets in a low-level trade war between the United States and the European Union. Washington has imposed sanctions against a range of European products, including some French food items, in response to a European Union ban on imports of American meat from hormone-fed cattle. Marlise Simons (NYT) 

NETHERLANDS: BOSNIAN SERB DENIES CHARGE -- The chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army pleaded not guilty to charges of persecuting civilians during the Bosnian war in 1992. Gen. Momir Talic, the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb official detained so far, made his first court appearance at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal had secretly indicted General Talic for his responsibility in the campaign in which tens of thousands of Muslims and Croats were imprisoned, mistreated or expelled from their land and homes in Bosnia. Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: PEACE TALKS CONTINUE -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators worked into the night trying to hammer out a deal to revive a frozen peace initiative. Both sides remained optimistic that an agreement could be reached before Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrives in Egypt on Thursday. Despite the positive tone of negotiations, differences remained. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: COMPENSATION FOR AUSTRALIANS -- The Government agreed to help compensate Australian Jewish athletes injured in the collapse of a makeshift bridge at the start of the Maccabiah Games near Tel Aviv in 1997. Four athletes died and dozens were injured after they fell into the polluted waters of the Yarkon River as they marched into a stadium for the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah. Joel Greenberg (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: POLITICAL KILLINGS? -- The police are investigating whether the murders of a young Orthodox Jewish couple, who were found stabbed to death in a nature reserve, were politically motivated. Newspapers reported that the woman had been raped, which is atypical of an organized terrorist act by Islamic fundamentalists. But the police, who are releasing no details and have banned the publicaton of information about the case, apparently believe that the murders were committed by an Arab. It is not known whether that is the only factor that has led them to investigate the deaths as political. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: OPPOSITION ASKS FOR HELP -- Opposition parties who are in talks to form a coalition for Mexico's July 2000 general elections agreed to invite about a dozen historians, political scientists, authors and other distinguished citizens of "recognized moral stature" to help them break an impasse in their negotiations. The eight parties have written a common electoral platform for the proposed coalition, but have failed to agree on how to select a joint presidential candidate. The opposition leaders declined to immediately identify the committee members. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: STRIKE CALLED -- A coalition of labor unions and social movements began what they called an indefinite nationwide strike to protest President Andres Pastrana's economic austerity program. The action is supported by left-wing guerrilla groups, one of which said it had seized an electrical power plant as a gesture of solidarity. In a speech, Mr. Pastrana called for patience and announced measures to assure that public transportation and other services would continue to function, but many schools and some businesses around the country closed anyway. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
AFGHANISTAN: REFUGEES FLOCK TO KABUL -- Refugees fleeing fighting between the ruling Taliban and the remnants of the Government they ousted three years ago have been arriving daily in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, where at least 8,000 are crowded into the former Soviet Embassy grounds. Taliban officials, facing more than 40,000 displaced people on their territory, say they cannot provide for the basic needs of the refugees. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
PAKISTAN: PLEA TO U.N. ON KASHMIR -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called on the United Nations to hold a referendum in Kashmir similar to the one just completed in East Timor to allow Kashmiris living on territory in dispute between India and Pakistan to decide their future. India, which regards the Kashmir Valley as its territory, has not allowed United Nations resolutions from the late 1940's demanding a plebiscite to be carried out. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
CAMBODIA: PREMIER TO MEET ANNAN -- Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose Government rejected United Nations plans for a war crimes tribunal for the Khmer Rouge, will meet Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York this month, Ralph Zacklin, an Assistant Secretary General for legal affairs, said in Phnom Penh. Mr. Zacklin was unable to win agreement for a proposed tribunal with international and Cambodian judges chosen by the United Nations. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
KAZAKHSTAN: ROCKET BAN LIFTED -- Kazakhstan lifted a ban on launchings of Russian Proton rockets after Moscow paid compensation for a recent crash of one of the boosters, the Interfax news agency reported. It quoted Kazakh and Russian officials as saying after talks in Moscow that a launching of a Proton, one of the workhorses of the Russian space program, would take place on Sept. 6. Kazakhstan banned all launchings from its Baikonour cosmodrome after a Proton-K rocket crashed on July 5. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
KENYA: A FINANCIAL PLEA -- African countries need both debt relief and new investment, a group of African finance ministers and central bank governors concluded after a two-day seminar in Nairobi. Many representatives from 17 of Africa's most indebted nations favored across-the-board debt cancellation. Botswana's President, Festus G. Mogae, said one of the main reasons for the debt crisis was the collapse of world commodity prices. (AP)

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON with Marcelle S. Fischler and Alex Kuczynski 

 BODY:

A Former Chief Out of the Shadow
New York City had a Commissioner of Consumer Affairs before BESS MYERSON, whom MAYOR JOHN V. LINDSAY appointed in 1969. But one would not have known that from looking at the photographs of former commissioners at the agency's headquarters at 42 Broadway. Miss Myerson's was always the first.
Until now. A black-and-white photograph of JOSEPH L. FORSTADT, who headed the agency for 11 months beginning in April 1968, will go up today. 
 "I was one of those commissioners in short pants that were referred to," said Mr. Forstadt, who was 28 then and is now a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, the law firm that he joined as an associate when he left city government in 1969.
The agency had been created in a merger of city departments that regulated a variety of licenses.
"Joe Forstadt laid the groundwork," the current Commissioner, JULES POLONETSKY, said, explaining that he decided to add Mr. Forstadt's photograph after a chance encounter some weeks ago. "He said, 'I was at the department,' " Mr. Polonetsky said. "I said, 'I've got Bess Myerson through JOSE MALDONADO. We have to put you up there with the likes of ANGELO APONTE and Betty Furness.' "
In fact, Mr. Forstadt said, he was not the agency's first commissioner. He said Mr. Lindsay's initial appointee was Gerald M. Weisberg, who ran the agency for several weeks until he was named a Criminal Court judge.
When Mr. Forstadt left Consumer Affairs, he became assistant administrator of the Economic Development Administration and tried -- unsuccessfully -- to move the Fulton Fish Market to the Bronx. "I now represent the wholesale dealers in the market," he said. "I've made a 180-degree turn."
 
Event of the Year In Food, Too
It was midafternoon at the United States Open, and BILLY STRYNKOWSKI was on his walkie-talkie, calling for more nacho cheese sauce, warning that the Caesar dressing was running low, asking for more disposable aluminum pans.
For Mr. Strynkowski, the main event at the Open is not tennis. Mr. Strynkowski, 37, is the chef of the food village at Flushing Meadow, a string of 11 fast-food stands controlled by Restaurant Associates, the management and consulting group that created some of New York's best-known restaurants.
The rest of the year, he runs the corporate dining room at the headquarters of Bertelsmann, the publishing-and-recording conglomerate on Broadway at 44th Street. But for 26 days in the summer, starting with the qualifying round, he and a staff of about 50 prepare 3,600 Black Angus burgers daily (and up to 7,000 on weekends). They also bake 1,200 potatoes, keep three 20-gallon pots of pasta boiling and slice into 150 cantaloupes and 200 pineapples a day. In the two weeks of the championships, they serve roughly 45,000 pounds of hot dogs. And, O.K., buffalo wings.
"Wings are wings," he said. "You have to have them. It's a tradition."
And what does he eat?
"Nothing," he said. He goes home hungry. "My wife will have something there, probably like peanut butter, bananas and Cap'n Crunch."
 
Ferret Humor? Caution Is Advised
It doesn't pay to make fun of Mother Nature. The founders of Modern Ferret magazine -- yes, there is a magazine celebrating an animal that looks like a cross between a rat and a dachshund -- found out the hard way.
ERIC and MARY SHEFFERMAN, who started the magazine in 1994, decided to spice up the September/October issue by putting a celebrity on the cover. A human celebrity, that is.
They chose HARRY ANDERSON, the actor who played Judge Harry Stone on the 1980's sitcom "Night Court" and is a part-time magician. Inside the magazine, he was pictured holding a ferret over a meat grinder.
"He has worked with ferrets in his magic act," Ms. Shefferman said. "He once ate a guinea pig on Saturday Night Live. Of course, it wasn't a real guinea pig. He's got that sense of humor."
But Petco, the 489-store chain that sells pet products, does not have that sense of humor. The company removed 6,000 copies of Modern Ferret from the shelves last week, declaring that the center spread might offend customers.
The Sheffermans maintain that Petco overreacted because the meat-grinder photo was humorous and the ferret in the photograph was a fake one, but that Mr. Anderson is upset.
"He was really hurt that any company would imply that Harry Anderson would hurt ferrets," Ms. Shefferman said. "He would not hurt ferrets. He loves ferrets. By Petco pulling the issue, they are saying, 'Harry Anderson is a terrible person who does not like ferrets.' But we know that he does." JAMES BARRON with Marcelle S. Fischler and Alex Kuczynski

HEADLINE: Asking Its Views, Labor Woos the Young

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
As the nation's labor unions struggle to reverse their decline, they are focusing increasingly on an immense group that they have long overlooked: young workers.
Yesterday, the labor movement took a new tack in seeking to court that group, releasing a survey that it had commissioned on young workers' attitudes toward their jobs, the economy and unions. 
 Not surprisingly, the survey of 752 workers from the age of 18 to 34 showed that those workers were concerned about many of the same issues unions have been emphasizing.
In the survey, conducted in June by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, workers said their biggest worries were falling behind the cost of living, lacking time for family responsibilities and being unable to afford to educate their children.
The survey found that only 45 percent of young workers had employer-sponsored health insurance, while just 43 percent had pension plans to which their employers contribute.
"They see today's jobs as failing to meet the most basic needs: health care, retirement security and time to spend with family," said John J. Sweeney, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said that in commissioning the study, it was showing that it listened to young workers and could articulate their concerns to employers and the Government.
"If we're going to grow, we obviously have to make young workers aware that unions are an option for them," said Kirk Adams, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s organizing director. "We know they don't know too much about unions because the labor movement didn't do a very good job talking to them or to their parents over the last 25 years."
Labor unions are also seeking to improve ties to the young by working closely with anti-sweatshop groups on college campuses and by recruiting hundreds of people in their 20's to work as union organizers.
In the survey, young workers were less sanguine about the booming economy than were older workers -- 45 percent said the economic climate was good, while 58 percent of workers over 35 described it that way. The survey, which had a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points, found that more than 90 percent of workers under age 35 said big corporations, top management and stockholders were doing well. But 42 percent said their own situation was "just fair," "not so good" or "poor."
With the percentage of workers belonging to unions slipping to less than 14 percent now from 35 percent in the 1950's, the labor movement is acting on many fronts to recruit members. In addition to focusing on the young, it has made special efforts to reach out to low-income workers, women and minorities.
Union leaders see young workers as a fertile ground for organizing efforts because while there are 45 million people under age 35 in the work force -- roughly a third of the total -- just 9 percent of them belong to unions. Surveys also show they are more favorably disposed to unions than are older workers.
The A.F.L-C.I.O. survey found that 54 percent of young workers said that, if given a chance, they would definitely or probably vote for a union, compared with 36 percent for workers over age 35.
Critics of the labor movement attribute this difference to the unhappy experience many older workers have had with unions, but Mr. Adams, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. organizing director, had a different explanation.
"Young people," Mr. Adams said, "are thinking in terms of what will be not an immediate fix, but a long-term fix to build a better future with job security and pensions."
Union leaders say there is a misguided perception that most young workers are entrepreneurs at Internet companies or day traders making overnight fortunes. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. report found that often, the three-fourths of young workers who lack college degrees are just scraping by.
For example, 64 percent of workers without college degrees earn less than $20,000 a year, compared with 32 percent for college graduates. And 39 percent of nongraduates have employer-provided health insurance compared with 67 percent for young college graduates.
The labor movement is pushing several organizing drives that would bring tens of thousands of young people into unions, among them flight attendants, health-care workers, hotel workers and graduate teaching assistants at schools from the University of California to New York University.
Kimberly Johnson, a 26-year-old doctoral candidate in American studies at N.Y.U., said the school's 1,500 teaching assistants need a union because "it would give us some say in working conditions like pay and health coverage."
The survey found especially tough conditions for young workers from minority groups. While 39 percent of young white workers earn less than $20,000 a year, 48 percent of young black workers and 52 percent of young Hispanic workers do. The poll found that 51 percent of young white workers were covered by employer-sponsored health coverage, considerably more than the 36 percent for young black workers and 39 percent for young Hispanic workers.
The survey found that 56 percent of workers from 18 to 24 said opportunities for advancement were more important than job security, while 63 percent of workers over 35 said job security was more important.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Despite Recent Oil-Revenue Rise, Mexico Will Limit Spending

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Despite a jump in crude oil prices, the Mexican Government will reap enough of a windfall this year only to stabilize its accounts, and it plans no spending sprees, Energy Minister Luis Tellez said today.
The international oil market has taken Mexico on a dizzying ride in 1999. In February, the price of Mexican crude oil for export -- which sells well below London and New York prices -- dropped to less than $7 a barrel, the lowest real price ever. But by Aug. 19, more than a year after Mexico joined forces with Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to curb production, the country's crude oil reached a high for the year of $19.24 a barrel, a 175 percent rebound. 
 So far in 1999, Mexico has earned $1.3 billion more from petroleum exports than budget planners anticipated.
Still, in advance of President Ernesto Zedillo's state of the union address on Wednesday, when he will tell Mexicans what he intends to do in the coming year, Mr. Tellez said the Government is taking a sober view of the upturn in its oil fortunes.
About a third of Government income comes from levies on petroleum sales. Increased oil revenue will allow Mexico to meet its promises to hold the budget deficit to 1.25 percent of the gross domestic product, but not to give more help to the nation's poor.
When oil prices were falling, Mr. Zedillo cut about $1 billion from social programs.
Yet the oil boom will only plug holes left in this year's budget by slow progress in the selling of Mexican airports to private owners, finance officials said.
Mexico also continues to look warily at the world oil markets, Mr. Tellez said, because much of the inventories that led to the price collapse last year and early in 1999 still exist. Almost all the world's producers have reduced their output, bringing about the steepest and longest-running decline in world oil production ever recorded.
But even if producers maintain their discipline, the supplies will come down slowly, Mr. Tellez said, dropping by the end of this year only to the level of 1997.
Last weekend in Caracas, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico agreed to maintain current production cuts until next April.
"There is no way that Mexico is going to jump up and take any decisions without the other countries," Mr. Tellez said.
He expects to fix the estimate of the average price of Mexican crude oil for 2000 at $12 to $14 a barrel, a conservative figure far below current levels. Mexico's estimate of the average annual price of its petroleum exports is a cornerstone of the Government's budget projections. Finance officials revised the figure downward twice when oil prices plunged, and it now stands at $9.25 a barrel. Each dollar added to the price of a barrel of oil is worth about $1 billion to the Mexican Treasury.
Opposition leaders have accused Mr. Zedillo of concealing huge unexpected oil earnings this year in the labyrinth of the Federal Treasury.
Ricardo Garcia Sainz, the chairman of the budget committee in the lower house of Congress, said the Government was hoarding money to spend it without congressional approval on an unpopular bank bailout and on programs to benefit the ruling party in the coming electoral year.

HEADLINE: Washington, Pressed by Inquiries, Tries Again to Justify Bold Economic Aid for Russia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, pressed by investigations into money laundering and capital flight out of Russia, is being forced anew to justify its policies of bold economic assistance to Moscow during the last seven years.
This time the reassessment has raised questions of what the Administration knew about Russian corruption and what should have been done differently, officials said. 
 Some figures in the Administration, as well as outside critics, said the indications of corruption were put aside to insure President Boris N. Yeltsin's support for American security interests, including the safekeeping of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
Those officials also assert that the Administration played down what it knew about corruption at the top levels of the Government and chose instead to trumpet success stories as Russia limped toward a free-market system.
Early last year, when the Administration asked Congress for $18 billion in new payments for the Interational Monetary Fund at a time the fund was considering increasing its loans to Russia, the Administration knew about the corruption problems in Russia but was reluctant to disucss it on Capitol Hill, Administration officials said.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who through his close relationship with President Clinton is considered the architect of much of the Russia policy, said in an interview, "There are legitimate questions about how much and by what mechanisms the money left Russia."
He acknowledged that a result of the secret flight of money out of the country was the impoverishment of many Russians.
A former American diplomat who was in Moscow until recently said the Administration had consistently failed to criticize the corruption out of fear that doing so would jeopardize Russian cooperation on security interests, including Russian behavior toward Iran and Iraq.
Instead of explaining that tradeoff, the former diplomat said the Administration had tried to oversell the "success" of Russian reform and the "partnership" relationship that United States Treasury officials and others boasted about.
An Administration economist said his agency was often asked by the State Department for success stories in Russia that could be cited to Congress and elsewhere.
At the heart of the Clinton policy was the decision to help Russia through loans from the I.M.F. and other sources to lift itself out of Communism and privatize the economy as quickly as possible.
When a handful of Russians emerged almost overnight as the newly rich owners of major natural resources and industrial enterprises -- some by questionable means -- they were acceptable to the Clinton Administration, because they largely backed Mr. Yeltsin against the threat of a Communist comeback.
With the assistance of campaign contributions from the so-called oligrachs, some of whom are under investigation in the West, Mr. Yeltsin was victorious in 1996 over a Communist candidate, Gennady A. Zyuganov.
The United States recognized the assistance that the oligarchs provided in re-electing Mr. Yeltsin, a senior Administration policy maker said, but chose to play down their dark side and their manuevers intended to strip the country of many natural resources.
In another indication of reluctance to face the corruption problem, Vice President Al Gore was shown evidence by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1995 of what it considered the personal corruption of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, with whom Mr. Gore led a joint American-Russian commission.
Intelligence officials said late last year that Mr. Gore rejected their report, a move that those analysts said had led them to understand that Mr. Gore was not interested in further information on the topic.
One official who worked on economic changes in Russia said that as it became clear that the I.M.F.'s conditions for macro-economic reforms were not working, it also became clear that efforts by the Clinton Administration to introduce small-scale changes were not working, either.
Last month, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that the Central Bank lied to the I.M.F. in 1996 about the level of its foreign-exchange reserves to encourage the fund to continue lending to the country. The report said the Central Bank had channeled assets through , a company based in the Channel Island tax haven of Jersey. The first deputy managing director of the fund, Stanley Fischer, said after the audit had been released that the Central Bank reserves were overstated by $1.2 billion in mid-1996.
Since the report was released, several Administration officials said there was now a serious question of trust with senior Russian officials.
In another effort that went awry, Washington tried to help Russia develop a money-laundering law. Again, experts from the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were sent to Moscow. They worked on a bill intended to enable prosecutors to investigate laundering. The legislation passed the Parliament twice, but was vetoed two times by Mr. Yeltsin, most recently last month.
Asked how the Administration had expressed its disappointment about the veto, Mr. Talbott said, "We did the obvious." He added that he could not provide the details. Mr. Talbott asked a deputy, Stephen Sestanovich, Ambassador at Large for the Newly Independent States, to do so.
Mr. Sestanovich said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had urged Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia to restart the process of enacting the bill. Administration officials have acknowledged in the past that Mr. Ivanov has little influence with Mr. Yeltsin.
As it became clear last year that the Russian Government was not receiving the necessary tax revenue, the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission was used by the Administration as a vehicle for trying to deal with corruption, officials said. An official knowledgeable with the workings of the panel said that Mr. Gore's people had raised the corruption issue but that they could not find any interlocuters in Russia with whom they could regularly follow up. That effort, too, frittered away, the official said.
This week, as the State Department, Treasury and the National Security Council reviewed yet again their Russia policies, one paradox was apparent. Mr. Yeltsin's jettisoning of the money-laundering measure means that there is no serious law against laundering. American law-enforcement officials who are investigating money flows through the Bank of New York will not have a legal basis on which to work with Russian law-enforcement agencies, officials said.

HEADLINE: $18 Million Trading Loss at Kaufman & Broad

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, one of the nation's largest home builders, said today that it had lost $18.1 million from unauthorized trading of mortgages by an employee.
As a result, the company said, it will take an after-tax charge against earnings of 24 cents a share in its third fiscal quarter, which ends today. The charge will reduce the quarter's earnings by about 25 percent. Analysts had forecast that Kaufman & Broad would earn 93 cents a share. The company said today that even with the charge, it expected record earnings for the quarter, exceeding the 68 cents reported in the comparable period last year. It added that the full extent of the loss had been identified. 
 Kaufman & Broad, which is based here, said the unauthorized trading had mainly been conducted in the last 30 to 60 days by a single person, whom it declined to identify. The employee, who the company said tried to conceal the trading by falsifying records, has been dismissed, and the company is now considering what, if any, legal action to take.
Investors seemed to take the news in stride, with the stock dropping 37.5 cents, to $20.4375.
"In the ultimate scheme of things, it was a relatively modest one-time event," said John Stanley, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, who has been recommending the stock.
The employee who engaged in the unauthorized trading was Kaufman & Broad's only mortgage trader. He had worked at the company for two years and there were no other known problems with him, said Mary M. McAboy, vice president for investor and public relations. She declined to discuss his possible motive but said there was no evidence that the employee had profited personally from the trading.
The problem occurred at a San Fernando Valley subsidiary that provides mortgages for about 80 percent of the parent company's home buyers, the Kaufman & Broad Mortgage Company of Woodland Hills, Calif. It then resells the mortgages in the secondary market.
Because it takes 30 to 60 days from the time a loan to a home buyer originates until it can be resold, the company makes a contract to sell the loan at a future date at a specified price. This locks in the interest rate, insulating the company from any gains or losses caused by interest-rate fluctuations that might occur until the mortgage is sold.
The company's policy is to make such forward contracts only for loans it originates, Ms. McAboy said. But the employee engaged in speculative trading not connected with such loan origination. While she was not specific, he might have agreed to sell loans that the company had not yet originated, hoping that interest rates would decline before he had to deliver, allowing him to obtain a loan and resell it at a profit.
The fact that the employee was the only mortgage trader could have given him latitude to hide his dealings. Ms. McAboy said the trading was caught by the company's internal security and audit procedures, which have since been strengthened.
Kaufman & Broad said it expected to be the nation's largest home builder this year in terms of the number of homes delivered. It has grown by acquisitions and has benefited from a strong economy in its territory, primarily California and other Western states. Orders for the third quarter are up about 35 percent over last year's period, in part because of an acquisition late last year.
Still, the company's stock, like that of many other home builders, has not performed well; investors fear that rising interest rates or the eventual end of the economic boom will depress the housing market, Mr. Stanley of Warburg Dillon Read said.

HEADLINE: Though Japanese Save Diligently, The Nation Sinks Deeper in Debt

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN and NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
One of the striking paradoxes of Japan is that this is a country with the greatest savers in the industrialized world, and yet everywhere one looks there is debt.
Japanese savers are famous for their ability to salt away money for the future, but as a nation, this country has some of the worst accounts in the industrialized world, and its debt trajectory increasingly looks like that of a third world country like Tanzania. 
 Much of the public debt, which totals about $5.4 trillion, was taken on at the urging of the United States to stimulate growth.
But Japan's debt situation is now so precarious that as talk of new stimulus plans heats up this fall, there are growing doubts about how long Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can continue to spend furiously in hopes of reviving the economy.
"It's like trying to adjust the fire carefully so that you don't ruin the fish," said Sadakazu Tanigaki, a Vice Minister of Finance. "The weight of the debt is extremely large. It is obvious that we can't leave the current situation as it is."
The dangers are difficult to gauge, and if Japan's incipient recovery gains momentum, profits may flow in around the country and the nation's debt problems could diminish. Indeed, despite gloom-and-doom talk from some economists in the 1980's, the United States has transformed a budget deficit in those days into a surplus today, while enjoying spectacular economic growth now.
So the Clinton Administration, while concerned about Tokyo's debt, has urged Japan to keep spending on the bet that doing so may revive the economy and generate the cash to pay back later.
Still, Japan's debt is not only tarnishing the Government's reputation as prudent proprietor of the world's second-largest economy. It is also raising troubling questions that extend far beyond Japan.
"There is no end in sight to the buildup of debt," said Vincent J. Truglia, managing director at Moody's Investors Service, which has downgraded Japan's formerly pristine credit rating, an important sign of diminished foreign confidence in its financial stamina.
"We're just concerned that Japan has already entered the highest levels of debt of an industrialized country," Mr. Truglia said, "and soon will be entering unprecedented levels."
Perhaps more important, rising debt levels will tend to lead to higher long-term interest rates in Japan. The effects of those higher rates may nudge up lending rates around the world, possibly threatening the economies of Asia that are trying to climb out of a financial crisis that is now two years old.
Higher lending rates could also ripple across the Pacific to raise business costs in California and mortgage rates in Florida, undermining the American economy.
"If Japan goes through a period of fiscal paralysis or outright crisis, then it's going to have a very negative impact on global financial stability," said David L. Asher, a specialist on Japan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "They've already broken a lot of world records for debt management in postwar history."
The risk of a default by the Japanese Government is remote, but there are anxieties here that rising debt levels could lead to a confidence crisis, provoking a flight of capital and currency turmoil.
Although Japan's troubles have not hurt America so far, a sudden shift to safe assets in the United States could send the dollar soaring in value against the yen and hurt American exports by making them more expensive.
The debt is an astonishing contrast to Japan's reputation for thriftiness. Japanese citizens have amassed a pool of $6.4 trillion in household savings, which appears at least on the surface to be more than enough to pay off the debt.
One major problem is that the domestic savings and foreign assets held by private citizens are exactly that: private. The debt, by contrast, is held mostly by the Government, and the Government can hardly seize the savings of private citizens to pay it off.
The deterioration in Japan's finances has been amazingly rapid, a result of tax cuts and spending increases that have resulted in annual budget deficits that now amount to 10 percent of its economy -- or 13 percent, if nationalized railroad debts are included. Even the lower figure is the highest among the industrialized countries.
As recently as 1992 the Japanese Government's gross debt amounted to just 70 percent of its gross domestic product, a ratio only a bit higher than that of the United States. This year, Finance Ministry figures show, the debt will reach 120 percent, exceeding that of Italy, which for many years has been by far the worst among the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2003 the Japanese ratio will rise to 138 percent.
Moreover, Moody's estimates that the Government may also have to absorb additional debts equivalent to between 30 and 40 percent of gross domestic product from the banking system, postal system loans and other areas.
That would take Japan's debt to around 170 or 180 percent of GDP, a figure about three times the level of the United States debt in the 1980's, when American budget deficits and mounting public debt were the talk of the world.
These days in Japan, the central Government's tax money cannot even cover the bills for debt service and entitlements like pensions, let alone payrolls.
Its debt-to-revenue ratio, which measures potential fiscal problems by comparing a nation's debt burden to its annual cash intake, is quickly approaching 1,400 percent, far worse than that of other industrial powers. That means that Japan must repay 14 yen for every yen it takes in from taxpayers.
All this puts Prime Minister Obuchi in a bind. He has managed to restore growth to the Japanese economy this year, but only by huge stimulus measures that add to the debt. And there is widespread apprehension that the economy will run out of momentum when the extra Government spending fades this fall.
Already, after raising about $1.4 trillion since 1992 to boost the economy, the scorecard shows a massive pile of debt on one side and on the other seven years of minuscule annual growth that may not be self-sustaining.
At some point, officials worry, the debt will get so high that the benefit of any further stimulus will be outweighed by rising long-term interest rates. Already, long-term rates are nearly 60 times the level of short-term rates.
Ichizo Ohara, an influential member of Parliament, said he had warned the Prime Minister against bowing to pressure from President Clinton for a new supplementary budget to stimulate the economy.
"That would raise interest rates and knock stock prices down," Mr. Ohara said.
But Mr. Obuchi is moving to introduce, probably by autumn, yet another giant supplementary stimulus package that could reach $45 billion or more, adding to the mountain of debt.
It is not just Japan's central Government that is vastly overextended. Debts are emerging everywhere else as well.
The local governments of Japan's top four most populous regions, including Tokyo, have declared a fiscal emergency, and to stabilize themselves they must lay off large numbers of workers or get a central Government bailout. Already, local governments around Japan have amassed $1.6 trillion in debt, a staggering sum that is greater than the assets of any bank in the world.
In the corporate sector, the bad debt problems of the banks are well publicized and by some estimates may still amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.
But Japan's insurance companies invested in many of the same foolish property ventures as the banks, yet the insurance companies so far have barely faced up to their problems.
Countless other companies, engaging in construction, real estate and even in autos and technology, also are mired in bad debts because Japanese companies historically have financed themselves through bank loans. Many of the companies have used permissive accounting rules to hide the obligations.
Mikuni & Company, Japan's only independent credit rating agency, assesses the risks of Japan's top 1,000 bond issuers -- the country's corporate equivalent of prime real estate. Even looking at just those elite companies, Mikuni rates about two-thirds of them BB -- junk status -- or below.
"What's happening is very scary," said Akio Mikuni, who runs the rating agency and expects many corporate defaults to come. "So far in Japan, the Government has avoided bankruptcies. But this system cannot be continued. It is impossible. So the probability of bankruptcies is quite significant."
Some Japanese officials deny that the problem is so serious. They note that Japan's "net debt" figures, which take into account the country's social security assets, look much better than the gross figures usually cited.
But economists are nearly united in agreeing that the net figures are misleading, because social security accounts are themselves in disastrous shape. While there is a surplus today, the social security system is projected to run out of money by 2010.
Indeed, economists estimate that the public pension system may be severely underfunded. Corporations are in the same position, and Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. has estimated that pension plans at major corporations are underfunded by about $727 billion -- making the corporate problem one of roughly the same scale as the banking system debts that have hobbled the Japanese economy in recent years.
Then there is the question of what has been done with the funds that come from deposits at the Government-run postal savings system. Japanese post offices accept cash deposits in a system that if it were counted as a bank would be the biggest one in the world -- and perhaps one of the worst-run.
The Government has used those funds, a total of about $3.8 trillion, for pumping up the economy by lending to small businesses or for building bridges and tunnels around Japan. The Government has also used public pension contributions and postal life insurance premiums on similar projects.
Many people worry that much of the money has been squandered, though the Government denies it. The upshot is that when losses in these areas are finally acknowledged, the Government will have to absorb them and its debt levels will rocket even higher.
Even though many politicians and officials acknowledge that Japan's finances are spinning out of control, they say it will be difficult for the political process to correct the problem any time soon.
"That gap essentially must be bridged with taxes," Kaoru Yosano, the Minister of International Trade and Industry and a senior member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in a somber interview in his spacious office. "But the Liberal Democratic Party and all other political parties are enormously wary, even frightened, of raising taxes. Accordingly, politically speaking, it has become a taboo."
Mr. Yosano paused and added, "I think that this can be characterized as a lack of courage among the political parties."

HEADLINE: Joan Braden Is Dead at 77; Hostess to a Capital Elite

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series "Eight Is Enough," died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.
The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
 For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for John and Robert Kennedy.
The 1975 book "Eight Is Enough," by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.
In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: "She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful."
By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.
According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good, and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.
But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.
Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103 pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.
Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, "Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir" (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, "Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage."
"The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband," Ms. Dowd wrote. "Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' "
But "this reviewer does not take such a harsh view," Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features "a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?"
Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and worked in the Pentagon during World War II.
From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.
Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.

New Jersey's crime rate decreased by a record margin in 1998, prompting Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to trumpet the news today with a marching band in a high school gym.
With West Windsor-Plainsboro High School students sitting in bleachers behind her and a band playing, Mrs. Whitman said that the crime rate dropped 9 percent last year, the biggest one-year decrease since the state began collecting crime data in a uniform way in 1966. 
 The Uniform Crime Report also showed that violent crime dropped by 10 percent in 1998 and that crime dropped in every major category.
"I am very pleased to release a report that shows New Jersey is becoming an even safer place to work, live, and raise a family," Mrs. Whitman said.
Not every aspect of the report, however, was a cause for celebration. New Jersey's murder rate, for example, dropped at a much lower rate than those of the nation as a whole and of the Northeast, largely because of an increase in murders tied to domestic violence. Reports of bias crimes also were up.
Mrs. Whitman said she released the report at a high school because shootings at schools around the country, including Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., "are a reminder that crime can happen anywhere, and we must always be on our guard." The Governor said efforts to curb youth crime in the state have been successful, with juvenile arrests having dropped 14 percent.
Attorney General John F. Farmer Jr. used the event to discuss school safety and the uproar over the state police's stopping drivers because of their race. "I don't want people to believe that every trooper is a bigot," Mr. Farmer told students. "It's simply not true."
He also said that while the school shootings should prompt vigilance, "Let's not turn our schools into armed camps."
The Uniform Crime Report shows a crime was committed every minute and 46 seconds in New Jersey last year.
There were 35,722 violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- reported in New Jersey, down 10 percent from 1997. Murder was down 4 percent to 321, rape decreased 6 percent to 1,623, robbery dropped 11 percent to 15,115, and aggravated assault declined 10 percent to 18,663.
Property crime -- burglary, theft, and auto theft -- dropped 9 percent. Crime was down in every county except Cape May and Hunterdon.
Mrs. Whitman said the statistics show her administration's law enforcement efforts are working. She also said that a better economy has produced more jobs and helped reduce crime.
But economic and crime statistics mirror national trends. New Jersey's 9 percent reduction in crime was slightly better than the nation's 7 percent drop. In the Northeast, covering New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the New England states, crime dropped 8 percent. New Jersey's 10 percent reduction in violent crime was better than the 7 percent decline recorded in the Northeast and the nation.
However, the state's 4 percent reduction in murders was only half the 8 percent national decline. Mr. Farmer attributed this to a 24 percent increase in murders that were the result of domestic violence.
The report also showed 877 bias incidents, up 9 percent from 1997.
The crime statistics have been known for a while, but the report was not released until today -- by far the latest during Mrs. Whitman's two terms. She has released the report as early as July 25.
Mr. Farmer said there was a delay because he was concerned about how the report used race to profile the typical person arrested in a specific crime. With disputes about racial profiling surrounding the state police, Mr. Farmer sought to change the way the statistics were presented.
Mr. Farmer said that when the numbers are close -- 51 percent of those arrested for a crime are from one race, while 49 percent are from another -- "to say that the typical offender is of either race, to me, is meaningless and misleading."
The report continues to give the race of the "most frequent offenders" -- even when one race accounts for 50 percent. But now it also lists percentages.

HEADLINE: U.S. Dollar Is Sliding Against Yen and Euro

 BODY:
As investors turn their attention to rebounding economies in Asia and Europe, the United States dollar has begun to slide against the Japanese yen and the euro.
The dollar fell below 110 yen, the second time it has done so since the fall of 1996. Against the euro, which was introduced in January as a currency for 11 European nations, the dollar is falling after a 15 percent gain in a rally that ended in July. 
 Asian economies, many of which fell into recession after the currency turmoil of 1997, show signs of life, as does Europe's. So the potential for growth in the near term may be just as good or better elsewhere than in the United States, investors reason, causing dollars to flow out of the country and into foreign markets.
A weaker dollar means prices of imported goods will rise, increasing inflationary pressures. But the falling dollar will also have positive effects, like making American goods more competitive abroad. That could aid economic growth and help America's manufacturers recover from a slump. More exports, combined with a slowdown in imports, would also help reduce the country's ballooning trade deficit.

HEADLINE: A Palace Fit for a Fugitive And Ukraine's Ex-Premier

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Even in a state familiar with jaw-dropping displays of wealth, a mansion set on 18 acres in northern California is opulent. Once occupied by the Hollywood star Eddie Murphy, the property in Marin County boasts two helicopter landing pads, five dog kennels, a barn-sized ballroom, granite floors inlaid with brass, and gold-plated doorknobs. And it was sold last September for $6.75 million -- in cash.
The estate's owner is a former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, who ensconced his wife and children in the 41-room mansion late last year. But Mr. Lazarenko has been unable to join his family. Federal authorities are detaining him while they consider requests from Switzerland and Ukraine that he be extradited on charges of embezzling state funds and money laundering. 
 As Federal investigators continue to examine the filtering of billions of dollars through the Bank of New York from Russia, there is increased concern in the West that ill-gotten gains from the former Soviet Union are infiltrating the United States and Europe.
In a recent press release Mr. Lazarenko denied charges that he looted money from Ukraine. He said he was a victim of political intrigue back home where, not surprisingly, his personal wealth has become an issue. Hardly a thief, Mr. Lazarenko is, the statement said, "fighting to bring about gradual reform leading to an improved economic climate in his native country."
But questions have also arisen about how Mr. Lazarenko's own economic position has improved. As a political official who traversed the line between public authority and private deal making, Mr. Lazarenko made money buying and selling natural gas contracts when he was energy minister, United States authorities say. As Prime Minister, he may have pocketed millions of dollars from state programs, according to Ukrainian and Swiss authorities. In fact, his wealth led to a falling out with the Ukraine President.
Mr. Lazarenko declined to be interviewed. Michael Handwerker, an attorney representing Mr. Lazarenko, said his client contests the charges against him in Europe and dismisses them as politically motivated.
"It is my position that this is a political witch hunt being orchestrated by the political powers that be in the Ukraine," said Mr. Handwerker. He declined further comment, but Mr. Lazarenko has said in the past that he fears for his life if he is sent back to face charges in Ukraine.
Since the fall of Communism, Ukraine, Russia and other former Soviet Union countries, many of which still share close economic and political ties, embraced capitalism with a raft of privatizations, foreign investment and a speculative frenzy that came to a screeching halt with the financial crisis in Russia last year.
In Ukraine and in neighboring countries, there were few legal or regulatory constraints on those with the financial or political clout to reap the rewards of the rush to capitalism. "In the industrial sectors that mean anything in Ukraine you will see many of the same problems as in Russia," said a United States Government official based in the Ukraine who requested anonymity. "There's a lot of room for manipulation and diversion of profits."
Mr. Lazarenko's wealth and power were growing so briskly during 1996 and 1997, his two years as Prime Minister, that it sparked a rift with President Leonid Kuchma, who dismissed Mr. Lazarenko from his influential post.
Mr. Lazarenko subsequently formed an opposition party and planned to run for the presidency until he suddenly fled the country late last year, only days before prosecutors there charged him with embezzling and misusing millions of dollars in government funds as part of a long-running corruption scheme. Before he fled, he told Parliament in a written statement that he was going to Greece for treatment of a stress-related heart ailment.
Last December, the Swiss Government arrested Mr. Lazarenko at the border when he tried enter on a Panamanian passport and charged him with laundering millions of dollars through numbered bank accounts in Switzerland. He was freed on $2.6 million bail.
He turned up in the United States in February, and was taken into Federal custody in Queens after he arrived at Kennedy International Airport and was judged to have an invalid visa. He has not been charged with any crime in the United States and, at his request, Federal authorities transported him to California so he could be near his family while awaiting a court decision on the extradition request.
Whatever the merits of the charges in Ukraine, Mr. Lazarenko's California mansion offers proof that his financial wherewithal outstrips typical government employees. The multimillion-dollar estate was purchased last September by a Sausalito, Calif., company, Dugsbery Inc., according to real estate records. But United States law enforcement officials said the real buyer is Mr. Lazarenko, who awaits his fate in a Dublin, Calif., detention center.
"Lazarenko has definitely diverted a lot of dollars and whether or not it was billions, it shows you what is possible in Ukraine," said the American Government official based there.

HEADLINE: A Letter and a Response

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, wrote to 10 business executives on July 28 suggesting that they resign from a group promoting overhaul of campaign finance laws, which prompted a reply on Aug. 23 by three leaders of that group. Following is a letter sent to an executive, with the recipient's name deleted by the advocacy group, the Committee for Economic Development, and the group's reply: 

Mr. McConnell's Letter
 I was astonished to learn that . . . has lent its name, prestige and presumably financial backing to the Committee for Economic Development in its all-out campaign to eviscerate private sector participation in politics, through so-called "campaign reform."
This week, the Committee for Economic Development joined hands with Ralph Nader and the Sierra Club in taking out a full-page ad in The Hill, demanding new campaign finance laws that would ban corporate political activism and render the Republican Party powerless to defend pro-business candidates from negative TV attacks by labor unions, trial lawyers and radical environmentalists.
To legitimize its claim to represent the corporate community in advocating anti-business speech controls, the Web site of the Committee for Economic Development prominently lists . . . as one of the trustees that is "engaged in implement ing their policy recommendations."
If you disagree with the radical campaign finance agenda of the Committee for Economic Development and resent its abuse of your company's reputation, I would think that public withdrawal from this organization would be a reasonable response.
Thank you for considering my great concern over these developments.
 
The Committee's Letter
 We are responding to your letter of July 28 to several trustees of the Committee for Economic Development (C.E.D.) urging them "to resign from C.E.D." because of our recent policy statement on campaign finance reform.
Your letter refers to a full-page ad that C.E.D. and other organizations sponsored urging the Senate to work toward meaningful campaign finance reform. We make no apologies for expressing our views and associating with groups such as AARP, the League of Women Voters, and the Sierra Club. In our view, it is entirely appropriate for groups with diverse interests to speak out jointly on an issue that they believe threatens the vitality of our participatory democracy. In fact, we find it ironic that you are such a fervent defender of First Amendment freedoms but seem intent to stifle our efforts to express publicly our concerns about a campaign finance system that many feel is out of control. Efforts to secure funding for the Republican Party should not be based on silencing other organizations.
You also accuse C.E.D. of an "all-out campaign to eviscerate private sector participation in politics." We respectfully submit that you have misread our report. First, it is disingenuous to imply that a business organization such as C.E.D. wants to silence the private sector or is anti-business. Second, if C.E.D.'s recommendations were enacted tomorrow, there would be more, not less, money available to finance elections. These funds would come primarily from individual contributions -- either directly or through political action committees -- not through loopholes in existing laws that have created today's unregulated, apparently limitless, flood of soft money. Our proposal would restore the principle that campaign contributions should be made by individuals not corporations or unions.
We know that a majority of the House and the Senate supports campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also shared by a growing number of business community leaders. We hope that you will reconsider your opposition and enable the issue to be discussed and voted on this fall in the Senate.
Those of us at C.E.D. applaud your many years of public service. We respect and share your commitment to the First Amendment. However, many of our trustees happen to disagree with you on this issue.

HEADLINE: Executives Press for Political Finance Change

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Leaders of a committee of business executives who have endorsed a ban on unlimited campaign contributions said today that their members would not be intimidated by an aggressive letter-writing campaign led by Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the Senate's most ardent opponents of a bill that would overhaul the campaign finance system.
In the letters, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, accused the group of trying to "eviscerate private sector participation in politics" by imposing "anti-business speech controls." 
 "I hope you will resign from C.E.D.," Mr. McConnell scribbled near the bottom of one letter sent to an unidentified senior executive of a telecommunications corporation.
Leaders of the organization attacked by Mr. McConnell, the Committee for Economic Development, which includes executives of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and the Sara Lee Corporation, refused to identify the executive or the corporation in the letter. But they did say that Mr. McConnell wrote letters to executives who work for companies that have significant issues pending before Congress.
None of nearly 20 members of the Committee for Economic Development planned to resign from the committee, as Mr. McConnell urged in the letters sent in late July, committee leaders said.
Edward A. Kangas, a co-chairman of the C.E.D. committee that studied the campaign finance system, said today that Mr. McConnell's letter confirmed for him that the organization, which has enlisted more than 100 current and retired executives to endorse new campaign finance rules, was beginning to shape the contentious debate on the subject on Capitol Hill. The letter was first reported on Sunday on the editorial page of The New York Times.
"What we've been doing as a group of business leaders is obviously beginning to have an impact," said Mr. Kangas, the chairman and chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accounting and consulting firm. "If we weren't having an impact, he would not be communicating with us."
In his public statements, Mr. McConnell argues that current campaign-finance legislation would infringe on free speech protections of the First Amendment. Critics of the Republican Party's position on the issue, however, say that Republicans are motivated by the knowledge that they hold a commanding advantage in raising campaign money from the private sector.
In one letter, Mr. McConnell also wrote that he was "astonished" that the corporation of the recipient had "lent its name, prestige and presumably financial backing" to the Committee for Economic Development, which he said was lobbying on behalf of a "radical campaign-finance agenda." Mr. McConnell argued that the executive's alliance with such a group had consequently damaged the reputation of the executive's employer.
Mr. McConnell wrote the letters in his role as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's major fund-raising group for Senate candidates. His spokesman, Robert Steurer, said that Mr. McConnell was unavailable for comment, and referred questions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Steven Law, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, issued a brief statement tonight, in which he said: "Nearly all the companies we contacted had no idea that C.E.D. was throwing their name around in connection with campaign-finance reform and they were outraged that C.E.D. had hijacked their corporate identity to sell a position with which they sharply disagreed."
The executives on the C.E.D. committee are speaking for themselves, and not necessarily on behalf of their companies. Most of their corporations still continue to give large sums to political parties and candidates.
Mr. Kangas and other committee leaders said they had recruited more executives in the past several days. They said their goal was to have 300 executives endorse their campaign finance proposals by late autumn.
"I think most of the people at C.E.D. have figured out just how corrupt the campaign finance system is, and this letter is just an example of what they already knew," Mr. Kangas said. "Actually, we are broadening the constituency of business leaders who recognize that the campaign finance system is a real problem. Senator's McConnell's letter has not had much impact."
The letters were seen by some as an attempt to intimidate the members with the implied message: Resign and keep quiet or don't count on doing business with Congress. "The reaction was interesting," Mr. Kangas said. "These guys are running big enterprises of their own. They are not easily intimidated. They looked at the letter and most of them just chuckled and filed it away."
The committee is a 60-year-old business-led public policy and research association based in Manhattan. Its leaders pride themselves that it is fiercely non-partisan.
The executives on the committee are urging Congress to prohibit soft money, the unlimited donations that corporations give to political parties. The committee also advocates increasing the limit on individual contributions to $3,000 from the current limit of $1,000.
"The business community, by and large, has been the provider of soft money, said Charles Kolb, the committee's president. "These people are saying: We're tired of being hit up and shaken down. Politics ought to be about something besides hitting up companies for more and more money."
The committee's members studied the campaign finance system for two years. Committee members said they were horrified at the public perception that big donors receive special favors in Washington. In a report released in March, the committee wrote: "The suspicion of corruption deepens public cynicism and diminishes public confidence in Government. More important, these activities raise the likelihood of actual corruption."
In a response sent to Mr. McConnell last week, leaders of the committee wrote: "We know that a majority of the House and the Senate supports campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also shared by a growing number of business community leaders."
Both Warren E. Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, have tried on their own to persuade chief executives of businesses to embrace campaign finance reform measures. But many, though sympathetic, refused to speak out because they do not want to rankle the legislators on whom they depend.
Mr. Kangas said he disagreed with Mr. McConnell's position that campaign contributions were protected by the First Amendment. "I was a little disappointed that he would suggest that freedom of speech does not apply to us, but it applies to the people who agree with him," Mr. Kangas said.

HEADLINE: Embracing la Nouvelle Economie;
String of Big Deals Elevates France in Europe and World

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 27

 BODY:
When Thierry Desmarest joined the French oil company Total as an exploration expert 19 years ago, most of Total's shareholders were French -- including the French state, with a 35 percent stake -- and most of its profit was made in France. Its far larger domestic rival, Elf Aquitaine, was mainly a Government fief run by bureaucrats.
Mr. Desmarest, now the chairman at 53, mused in a recent conversation that it would be "difficult to imagine" Total contemplating a merger with Elf back then. 
 Today both companies are publicly owned, and about 65 percent of Total's shareholders and 51 percent of Elf's are not French. Earlier this year, Total took the brash step of merging with the big Belgian group Petrofina to become Total Fina and is now locked in a brawl to acquire Elf Aquitaine. If Mr. Desmarest succeeds, and he is convinced he will by the end of the year, the combined Elf and Total Fina will still be only half the size of new giants taking shape, like the Mobil-Exxon combination, but it will dwarf many European rivals.
"Things can change rapidly," Mr. Desmarest said, seated in his office here with a view of Elf's black glass headquarters tower.
Indeed, in the last two years, France has moved to shake up and slim down its corporate world more thoroughly and quickly than many had thought possible. And in the process, it is simultaneously creating a kind of fortress within Europe even as it reaches aggressively beyond its borders into the global economy.
France has gone through periods of wrenching restructuring in the past. In the 1980's, heavy industries like steel and coal, as well as financial services like insurance, were reorganized, and tens of thousands of jobs were shed.
But while those changes, which were aimed at overcoming a chronic bloat that was smothering the economy, required France to go through a decade of pain, there are tentative signs that the latest wave of overhauling will produce a much faster payoff.
France has become a darling of foreign investors, and the Paris bourse has surged by 50 percent in two years, against an average of 44 percent for the top 300 European companies.
Growth prospects are brighter than in a long time. This year, the economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent, and though that is less than last year's 3.3 percent because of the downturn in emerging markets, the Government expects as much as 3 percent in 2000. Last year's growth produced a windfall of tax revenues, which were $6 billion higher than anticipated in this year's first half, prompting discussion of possible tax relief.
There is even some relief on the job front. Though unemployment, at 11.5 percent, remains stubbornly high, in this year's second quarter private-sector jobs rose by 266,000, or nearly 2 percent, over 1998. The feeling, however tenuous, that things are getting better has helped transform the gloom that shrouded France in the mid-1990's into a new consumer confidence.
And there is little sign that the corporate reshuffling will let up soon.
In banking, an unsuccessful $37 billion hostile bid by Banque Nationale de Paris for two domestic rivals, Societe Generale and Paribas, ended with the takeover of Paribas, a strong investment bank, by the far larger Banque Nationale, creating what will be the third-largest bank in Europe after Deutsche Bank, the German banking giant, and UBS of Switzerland. The takeover will reshape the banking landscape in ways that could favor future consolidation beyond France.
Emboldened by the changes, French corporations are entering new and inventive alliances.
Earlier this month, the big aluminum group Pechiney joined Alcan of Canada and Alusuisse Lonza of Switzerland to form a behemoth to challenge the pre-eminence of Alcoa.
Earlier, the chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc agreed to a $23 billion merger of its drug operations with those of Hoechst in Germany.
And as French companies reorganize, they are flexing their muscles abroad. Americans were struck in recent months by the struggle of two French giants, Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, for control of the growing American market for water services. In March, Vivendi, once a stodgy utility called Generale des Eaux, made the biggest French acquisition ever in the United States when it paid almost $8 billion for the United States Filter Corporation. Not to be outdone, Lyonnaise des Eaux has spent more than $6 billion on similar acquisitions.
"There's no other way but to follow the rules of the game as it's played now," said Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas. Change is much in evidence at Paribas itself after the takeover by Banque Nationale. Yet Mr. Barthalon senses spirits rising.
In 1997, when he returned to Paris after spending two years at Paribas's offices in London, "it was a nightmare," he recalled. Paris was crushed by gloom, particularly among the young, who felt little chance of upward mobility. Talented graduates emigrated to Britain or the United States, finding work in Silicon Valley or at London brokerage firms. "This has pretty much changed over the last two years," he said. "Good people don't have to go abroad for jobs."
Partly, the shake-up is the work of a new type of French-bred corporate raider. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has consolidated the fashion and perfume businesses. Earlier this year, the billionaire Francois Pinault bought a large stake in Gucci, the Italian fashion group, in hopes of creating a rival luxury goods conglomerate.
More often, graduates of the elite French training schools are learning to play by the new rules.
Claude Bebear, chairman of the big AXA insurance group, got a degree from the Ecole Polytechnique. But with results below those that would have qualified him for top Government jobs, Mr. Bebear went to work at a sleepy insurance company in Normandy. In the past, he would never have made it to the top of French society. But Mr. Bebear, now 63, had a strong sense of opportunity, picking up acquisitions at opportune moments. The turning point in his career came in 1991, when AXA paid $1 billion for a majority stake in the Equitable Insurance Company. Today, AXA's stake is worth 15 times that.
In 1996, Mr. Bebear went further, acquiring Union des Assurances de Paris, a big French insurer the Government had sold off two years earlier. But Mr. Bebear's real influence comes from AXA's role as one of France's, and the world's, largest asset managers. AXA is the biggest shareholder in Elf Aquitaine and owns substantial shares of Banque Nationale and Paribas. "He is a fabulous manager, but he has a vision," said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. He added that Mr. Bebear, who is an avid big-game hunter, brings the same instinct to his business decision-making. "He knows that if you have to kill, you have to kill immediately."
Consolidation is also being driven by the Government's push the last two years to sell big shares of more than a score of huge enterprises, including banks, industrial companies, and insurance. Though the state still holds large stakes in companies like Renault, Air France and France Telecom, the Government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, despite its Socialist heritage, has sold assets worth more than $30 billion to private shareholders. Many of these assets have gone to British and American investment funds, which become involved with the way the businesses are run, demanding good returns on investment and sound long-term strategies.
Total was one of the pioneers. In 1991, the company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, starting a flood of investment from institutional investors.
And the trend toward an international shareholder base continues. The arrival of the euro is encouraging European investors to diversify geographically. "What strikes me much more now," Mr. Desmarest said, "is the arrival in the last year of new shareholders from Germany, the Netherlands."
But if the private sector is getting back into shape, overstaffed Government operations pose even greater challenges for Mr. Jospin. Government spending, much of it on railways, postal service and medical care, account for 54 percent of the economy, against 40 percent in Britain. More than 25 percent of the workers in France are employed by government compared with 14 percent in Britain.
To reduce unemployment, the Government has resorted to an immensely costly make-work program that created 174,000 jobs.
Mr. Jospin's immediate challenge, advisers say, is getting a handle on pensions and health spending. With more than two years before national elections, Mr. Jospin wants to start debate on reducing the gap between Government pensions, which reach as much as 85 percent of final salary, and those in private business, where they are about 50 percent. To cut medical costs, the Government wants to consolidate the public hospital system.
Despite union resistance to changes in the traditional public sector, labor leaders support Mr. Jospin in his bid to speed financial and industrial privatization.
Jean-Christophe Le Duigou of the executive board of the C.G.T., the big labor federation that grew out of the Communist labor movement, accepts the Government's retreat from the business of running businesses, arguing that the public sector had "reached its limits both industrially and financially."
And he acknowledges that the private sector is creating jobs, even if many of them are considered temporary or part-time employment. Last year, hours lost through private-sector strikes were the fewest ever in postwar France. What his union now wants is for the Government to help by improving education and pouring more state money into industrial research. Fingering a cellular phone on his desk, he asks, "Why should this be made by Nokia or Motorola -- not in France?"
His union is conciliatory in part because Mr. Jospin delivered on a pledge to enact legislation cutting the workweek from 39 hours, to 35. The idea, based on a popular notion of the labor market as a pie of fixed size, is that if the slices are cut smaller, there are more slices for everyone.
Mr. Le Duigou acknowledges that the 35-hour week has not automatically created jobs. Still, he says, the new law is delivering benefits because it forces labor, business, and the Government to sit together and discuss ways to ease the dislocation caused by corporate restructuring.
Business grudgingly swallowed the 35-hour week, negotiating in exchange a union commitment to more flexibility. In exchange for fewer hours, business won the right to more overtime, weekend and night work, increasing the productivity of factories that operate on high- and low-production cycles, and can now run nonstop in periods of high demand.
Total Fina is an example. The 35-hour week, Mr. Desmarest says, means the company "will try to achieve a level of productivity gains to compensate" for lost hours. Total Fina should benefit from greater flexibility at its robot division; the unit supplies the auto industry, which has seasonal and cyclical demand.
Still, Mr. Desmarest added, he would have preferred a different approach. "At the end of the day," he said, "I am not at all convinced this will create jobs."

As Economies Revive Abroad, Dollar Falls vs. Key Currencies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The United States dollar has begun to slide against the Japanese yen and the European single currency, as investors turn their attention to reviving economies in Asia and Europe.
The dollar fell yesterday below 110 yen, the second time it has done so since autumn 1996. In January, it briefly pierced the 110 yen level before rebounding. Against the euro, which was introduced in January, the dollar is falling after a 15 percent rise that ended in July. 
 Though the American economy continues to expand, growth slowed in the second quarter. And some analysts and investors are saying they expect higher interest rates to prove a further drag on the dollar this year.
At the same time, Asian economies, many of which fell into recession after the currency turmoil of 1997, show signs of life, and these countries' stock markets have soared in 1999. Optimism is being heard about the economic prospects of European countries, too. So the potential for growth in the near term may be just as good or better elsewhere than in the United States, many are saying, and this is causing dollars to flow out of American investments and into foreign markets.
"Over the past year or so, the dollar has leveled off, and we are in an environment now in which the dollar should start a moderate slide," said James McCormick, currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "It's not a question of a weaker dollar. It's a stronger rest of the world."
The euro rose yesterday to a value of $1.0578, from $1.0471 on Monday. Mr. McCormick said he expects the euro to rise further, and the dollar to fall, to a rate of $1.12 by the end of the year, while the yen could move to 105, a dollar decline of 4.2 percent from current levels.
A weaker dollar means that prices of imported goods will rise, increasing inflationary pressure. It also makes travel abroad more expensive for Americans. But analysts note that a falling dollar also has positive effects. It would make American goods more competitive abroad, which could aid economic growth here and help American manufacturers recover from a slump induced by the global financial crisis that began in 1997. More exports, combined with a slowdown in imports, would also help reduce a ballooning American trade deficit.
Whether this weaker dollar is a policy problem for the Clinton Administration is not yet clear. The former Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, had supported a strong dollar, in part because it helped restrain inflation. His successor, Lawrence H. Summers, says he is supportive of that policy, but some analysts wonder if he is as committed as Mr. Rubin.
The Federal Reserve will be looking at the dollar, too, with an eye toward any inflationary pressure. But other factors, including consumer spending that is being fed by a strong stock market and gains in home values, are a bigger concern. The central bank traditionally has paid close attention to the dollar only if it is considered drastically out of line with where it should be or if it fluctuates so rapidly as to risk destabilizing other financial markets.
The big move against the dollar this year has come from the Japanese yen, which is up 11.8 percent since early July. In trading yesterday, the yen settled at 109.59 to the dollar, up from 110.73 on Monday.
Most of the move this year has been caused by the rush of foreign investors into Japanese stocks as they bet that a turnaround in the Japanese economy will improve corporate performance and push a long-depressed stock market higher. So far they have been right, with the benchmark Nikkei index up more than 30 percent in dollar terms.
Mr. McCormick said that foreigners had made about $54 billion in net purchases of Japanese stocks so far in 1999, compared with $17 billion in all 1998. To buy the stock, foreigners sell their local currency and buy yen, pushing up the yen's value.
Though the weakening dollar may not be regarded as unalloyed trouble for the United States, economists say it could become difficult for Japan. As the yen strengthens, Japanese goods become more costly abroad. And if this cuts into sales by Japanese companies, the long-sought economic recovery there could run into trouble.
For this reason, Japan tried to slow the rise of the yen by intervening in the currency market to sell yen six times in June and July. But last month, Japanese officials indicated that they were abandoning this policy, at least for now. That shift opened the door for the yen to move below 110. One reason Tokyo relented is that intervention, without the participation of the United States, is unlikely to work. In addition, officials are hoping that their economy is on the rebound, which would make the rise in the yen less worrisome.
A test will come on Sept. 10, when Tokyo releases data on growth for the quarter that just ended. If the data are strong enough to confirm that the recovery signaled in the first quarter is continuing, worries about the yen's rally could subside. Comments from Japanese officials yesterday indicated that the growth outlook was still positive.
But now that the yen is below 110, currency traders will be on the lookout for any sign that Japanese policy makers are ready to intervene again. Investors are showing some signs of concern, too.
As for the euro, since mid-July when there were the first sure signs of a turnaround in the German economy, it has risen 4.4 percent. But it is still down 9.3 percent against the dollar for the year. The relative strength of the dollar against the euro and some other major currencies suggests that there is no serious dollar swoon in the making now.
Still, the Federal Reserve's vigilance against inflation is not helping the currency. By moving to increase short-term interest rates, the Fed aims to slow growth here before the economy overheats to a point that prices and wages spiral upward. Though higher interest rates can sometimes support a currency, they are negative for the dollar in this case because investors are betting that a slowdown here will make American investments a little less attractive.
The threat of a further rate increase by the Fed when it meets in October, and comments about rising asset prices made last Friday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also put downward pressure on stock prices this week as foreign investors fled the market and, with that, the currency.

HEADLINE: Keyes Draws the Few, but Devoted

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
As he wanders the nation prophesying a political apocalypse, Alan L. Keyes, the staunchly conservative radio talk show host, is the invisible man in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination.
He gets few cameras at his events. Political analysts tend to forget him in their prognostications. Polls show him receiving 1 percent of the vote or less. And when the Log Cabin Republicans, a homosexual group, issued a news release recently criticizing culturally conservative candidates for intolerance, Mr. Keyes did not even merit a mention. 
 But to his small yet devoted cadre of followers, Mr. Keyes is the best-kept secret of the campaign. To them, Mr. Keyes, a former Reagan Administration diplomat with a Harvard Ph.D., has something his fellow conservatives lack: mesmerizing oratorical skills twinned with a messianic vision.
And therein lies the heart of the Keyes for President campaign. With little money, name recognition, organization or governing experience, Mr. Keyes is running on his powerful voice, breathlessly wooing far-right voters with Boschian word pictures of schools that are "places of death," taxpayers who are "enchained slaves" and children who have fallen into a "howling moral void."
Though he is given little chance of winning -- he finished seventh of nine candidates in the Iowa straw poll -- winning is not what he promises his followers. What he offers is the chance to feel morally correct on Election Day.
"The conclusion I've reached is that no one is doing what I believe needs to be done," Mr. Keyes said in a recent interview, speaking of the moral issues. "If I were satisfied that anyone else was addressing it, I would not run."
His campaign chairman in South Carolina, Hal W. Stevenson, said, "If you only care about your chances of winning, you don't back a guy like Alan. You back him because you like what you hear. You'll feel better when the election is over."
Mr. Keyes did win the Alabama Republican straw poll last Saturday, but other than Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who finished second, he was the only candidate who competed.
Indeed, at a time when several Republican candidates, including the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, are trying to play down divisive issues like abortion and gay rights, Mr. Keyes provides an eloquently uncomfortable reminder that, to some dedicated conservatives, ideological purity matters more than victory in November 2000.
"I think there is a struggle going on in the party," said Mr. Keyes, 49, who also ran for President in 1996. "It's a struggle between the Money-is-God Republicans and the God-is-God Republicans."
On the stump, Mr. Keyes aims the sharpest barbs at Mr. Bush, whom he considers a tepid-tongued pragmatist. In Greenville, S.C., recently, he mocked Mr. Bush's slogan of "compassionate conservatism," saying, "You don't prove you are compassionate by talking about it." He accused Mr. Bush of exploiting moral issues, "without being seriously committed to facing the moral challenges." And he ridiculed the Texan for saying he would not demand that all his nominees to the Federal bench share his opposition to abortion.
"Is it true we need leaders who will be vague in their response to the most compelling moral issues we face as a people?" Mr. Keyes, who is black, asked the virtually all-white crowd in Greenville. "No!" many of them responded.
Though his campaign has received little media attention, Mr. Keyes has consistently drawn hundreds of people to his "Renewing America" speeches in South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire. Marietta Kaiser, 72, of Greenville, walked out a convert. "He's a breath of fresh air," she said after Mr. Keyes's appearance in mid-August. "We've heard the cliches of the other candidates, and they just don't move the spirit."
But his against-all-odds campaign has drawn questions from some rivals and analysts, who suggest that he is using the race trying to draw attention to his speaking-for-hire business and to gain listeners for his radio program, which until recently was syndicated to about 75 stations in more than 43 states.
In 1997 and 1998, Mr. Keyes gave about 20 paid speeches a year, typically to corporations or college groups, charging $12,000 to $15,000 for each, his aides said.
But the aides scoffed at the assertion that he profits from running for office. They said that he suspended the radio show during the campaign and has scaled back his paid speaking engagements to about 15 this year. They added that most of his speeches are given free to benefit pregnancy counseling centers and anti-abortion groups.
Other critics have asked whether he is living off his campaign account, as he did in his losing 1992 Senate race in Maryland when he paid himself more than $8,000 a month from campaign donations. Though the practice was legal, it prompted criticism even from Republicans.
Mr. Keyes says he is not drawing a salary from his campaign fund, which had raised $1.9 million as of June 30 and had $172,497 on hand. But he argues that the practice is legitimate and that his critics are "wealthy oligarchs."
In private, Mr. Keyes cuts a different figure from the acid-tongued talk show performer who has amazed even the most combative hosts with his ability to shout them down. With his goatee and newly trim build -- he has lost 70 pounds in two years -- he can come across as a genial academic. An opera buff, he confesses to relaxing with westerns and action films or "Star Trek" reruns.
Mr. Keyes, the youngest of five children, is the son of a career Army officer who moved the family repeatedly through Italy and the United States. Reared a Roman Catholic, Mr. Keyes attended parochial schools for much of his youth, though he graduated from a public high school in San Antonio.
In high school, he was already demonstrating his powerful speaking skills, winning the American Legion's national oratorical competition and getting elected president of the Legion's Boys Nation, the first black to do so.
Though his parents were Democrats who admired John F. Kennedy, Mr. Keyes became a Republican in the late 1960's while attending Cornell University, where he viewed Vietnam War protesters as repugnantly anti-American. He transferred to Harvard, where he went on to earn a doctorate in government.
While serving as a State Department official in India during the Reagan Administration, he met Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who later called him "one of the most dramatically articulate people" she had ever met. After she became chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick made Mr. Keyes the Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Mr. Reagan later appointed him Assistant Secretary of State for international organizations.
In India, Mr. Keyes also met his wife, Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, who is Indian. They have three children and live in Maryland.
Mr. Keyes's speeches are aural spectacles, part revivalist sermons, part Oprah. With a microphone on his lapel, he wanders through the audience, talking -- sometimes in a whisper, sometimes in a shout -- for an hour or more without notes, weaving images of an America going to hell in a high-speed handbasket.
He argues that a collective loss of faith in God's authority has caused a panoply of social ills, from the breakdown of "marriage-based families" to the Columbine High School shootings to failing schools to "immoral" military interventions abroad, including in Kosovo.
Without God in their lives or their politics, Americans are allowing an authoritarian central government to tax and regulate them into submission, he says. Likening Americans to a frog that sits calmly in a pot while the water gets hotter, he argues that Americans are passively watching their freedoms erode.
"We're past medium rare and headed toward well done," Mr. Keyes said in Greenville.
Not surprisingly, he prescribes strong medicine. He would eliminate the income tax and finance the Government on tariffs, duties and excise taxes. He would end welfare and outlaw abortion. He has floated the idea of public paddling of parents who abandon their children.
But in private conversation, Mr. Keyes reveals more nuanced views. And that makes for some paradoxes.
Though he ridicules targeted tax cuts as "marionette strings," he also endorses federally subsidized mortgages for families and tax breaks for banks that invest in poor neighborhoods. And while he warns that "perpetual war" is a means by which totalitarian governments control their citizens, he is not an isolationist, having strongly supported America's involvement in Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada and Kuwait.
There are interesting nuances in Mr. Keyes's views on race as well. He is an ardent opponent of affirmative action and other race-based social programs. But he also speaks about the need to address urban poverty through private investment, and has often lambasted the Republicans for not recruiting more blacks.
"The Republicans vacillate between trying to buy off black voters with programs, trying to out-Democrat the Democrats, and just writing them off," he said in an interview.
Indeed, Mr. Keyes says, his revulsion for slavery has intensified his conservatism, not weakened it. As a teen-ager, he voraciously read books about slavery, weeping while he wondered why more slaves did not revolt. Lincoln became his hero. Even his stump-speech language -- "We need to strike off our chains," is a favorite phrase -- is drawn from the peculiar institution.
"I always wondered, why didn't people resist to the point of fighting and dying?" Mr. Keyes said. "Why would human beings let themselves be oppressed, when they could have said, 'give me liberty or give me death,' and gone out in a blaze of resistance?"

Safety Isn't the Point

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "New Trade Threat for U.S. Farmers" (front page, Aug. 29): Whether or not genetically engineered food is grown in an ecologically sound manner or is safe for consumption is beside the point. What should worry us is the fact that a very small number of transnational corporations like Cargill and Monsanto are coming to dominate the world's food production and distribution systems. 
 Those of us who do not wish to be a part of the grossly overconsumptive global market economy look forward to building strong, diverse local communities and economies that are ecologically sound and socially just. We know that a system in which a handful of transnational corporations control food production and distribution at the expense of human rights and ecological conservation has no place in our lives.

HEADLINE: Haiti Still Needs Help From U.S.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While the headline of Bob Shacochis's "Only Haiti Can Save Haiti" (Op-Ed, Aug. 30) is true, it may also be misleading. 
 Although Haiti's economy can be characterized as little merchants and their unmoving pyramids of oranges and mangoes, it is also true that some heroes (in the form of American alternative investors) have created microbanks for these small merchants to diversify and grow. Other inconspicuous heroes have brought 500 Cuban doctors into the country to aid in health care. Many Haitians are working at reforestation and literacy.
Haitians need continuing partnerships with outsiders willing to take risks to help them build an economy. For the United States to recall its small military presence sends the wrong message to Haitian elites who believe that only fascism can save Haiti. Sadly, they seem to have support from many in our Congress.

HEADLINE: Click Here for the Ivory Tower

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
FOR almost as long as students have been going to college, educators have been trying to bring college home to them. More than 100 years ago at Cornell University, professors traveled to rural areas on horseback to teach farmers about the latest agricultural research. Correspondence courses have been available for decades, first through the mail and then through television and video.
But the development of the Internet has created new excitement around what has become known as distance learning. This summer a start-up company called Unext.com (www.unext.com), based in Deerfield, Ill., announced a venture that is one of the most ambitious yet: delivering executive training and, eventually, a full M.B.A. program over the Internet. This summer, Unext.com (pronounced you-next) christened its virtual school Cardean University after a Roman goddess, Cardea, who could "open what is shut and shut what is open," in the words of a company press release. 
 The plan attracted attention not only because one of the initial investors was the former junk-bond king, Michael R. Milken, but because of the five prestigious institutions the company had brought on board -- the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University and the London School of Economics and Political Science -- a veritable all-star team of elite universities.
The plan is for Unext.com to produce, market and distribute the courses -- as well as hire a corps of employees to serve as mentors and E-mail correspondents for Cardean's students. The universities will provide the curriculum and the impressive credentials, without risking their endowments on untried technology. Some of them have projected that their own campuses will each earn at least $20 million in royalties from Unext.com within five to eight years.
"This is a way to embark on distance education by using what others bring to it," said John Preis, associate dean for finance and administration at Columbia University's School of Business. "We think this is a home run." Distance learning, it seems, has come of age.
But has it? Since the dawn of the Web in the mid-1990's, the concept of earning degrees entirely on line has become a rallying point for university presidents, politicians and profit-seekers alike. Yet while millions of people are diving into on-line shopping malls and chat rooms, virtual universities have been something of a bust.
"I think it's going to be the joke of the 21st century," said Carole S. Fungaroli, an adjunct professor in English at Georgetown University who is writing a book about the value of university degrees. "I don't see anything that these people are offering that you can't get better on campus."
Western Governors University, a venture started by 17 states and Guam, opened its on-line doors to much fanfare last year but has enrolled only 120 students, far below its projections. California Virtual University, a project initiated by the California Board of Regents in 1997, folded this spring, citing financial problems. Many other virtual university projects have appeared to be nothing more than on-line catalogues of courses that can be taken for credit only by students who are already on campus.
One place the distance education concept has been successful is Wall Street, where analysts' reports are thick with data on the rapidly growing adult-student market. The Apollo Group, the company that runs the University of Phoenix, an accredited institution that offers on-line degrees, has seen its stock soar more than 1,500 percent since 1994. Apollo, which also operates other educational programs, now has a market capitalization of $1.7 billion.
Administrators at the universities that have signed up with Unext.com readily admit that the possibility of becoming part-owners of a publicly traded Internet company is a part of Unext.com's attraction. "I was less interested in the income stream than in the market capitalization of Unext.com," Meyer Feldberg, dean of the Columbia University School of Business, told The Wall Street Journal. "The huge upside essentially is the value of the equity in the I.P.O."
There have been other concerns raised about Unext.com. The management of the company is made up of several Chicago professors, including John P. Gould, a former dean of the university's Graduate School of Business, and two Nobel laureates, Gary Becker and Merton H. Miller. Several other members of the Chicago faculty have publicly raised questions about conflicts of interest. Whose interests will be served, the company's or the institutions that need to protect their good names and academic integrity?
The entrepreneur behind Unext.com is Andrew M. Rosenfield, a business consultant and University of Chicago alumnus who was running Lexecon, a company that employed many of the same people who are now involved in Unext.com. In the last decade, he has also served as a part-time law professor and trustee for the university, remaining immersed in the culture of an institution known not only for breeding free-market intellectuals but also for being strongly resistant to change.
In the mid-1990's, Mr. Rosenfield started thinking about about creating an Internet-based education company that would be both a radical departure and a continuation of the values of his alma mater. He wanted to create an on-line environment that would be "the technological equivalent of the small break-out session or the evening at the coffee shop, where students really teach each other." He also wanted to reach students outside the United States who wanted access to education delivered by American universities but who could not travel to get it.
He mulled over the idea with Dr. Becker -- his former professor and now longtime friend, who had won his Nobel prize for his theories about human capital. The two brainstormed over lunch at the University of Chicago's faculty club and while watching Chicago Bulls games.
The first investor for the company, which was founded in December 1997, was Knowledge Universe, a company owned in part by Mr. Milken. His involvement stirred gossip throughout the higher-education community last year, when Mr. Rosenfield started to shop his idea around to select universities. By the time Mr. Rosenfield signed up his first partner -- Columbia University, in March 1999 -- the contracts included the condition that Mr. Milken's investment would never exceed a 20 percent ownership stake and that he would have no voting rights.
In the last four months, four more universities have signed on; the last was Carnegie Mellon, which struck a deal in July. Other universities, like Cornell, were approached by Unext.com to be pioneering members but declined. Cornell has already developed its own distance-education technology, said Jonathon D. Levy, executive director of Cornell's distance-education office.
Critics say that the partnership could damage the universities' academic credibility. The quality associated with getting a degree from these schools cannot be replicated on the Internet, said John K. Wilson, an outspoken graduate student at the University of Chicago who has written columns accusing administrators of jumping in blindly with "dollar signs in their eyes."
University administrators have responded vaguely to questions about how much the deals may be worth. Mr. Preis, at Columbia University, confirmed reports that his institution expected to make at least $20 million in five to eight years. Other university administrators said they expected the same return.
But Unext.com would not confirm the $20 million figure. "That's the universities' expectation," said Edwin Eisendrath, the spokesman for Unext.com. Mr. Eisendrath added that not every university had signed the same deal. He would not elaborate.
Within the business faculties themselves, the reaction to the announced deals has ranged from approval to confusion. Administrators at some of the participating schools have pleaded ignorance about exactly what the deal means and who will be affected. At the University of Chicago, a committee was formed to talk about Unext.com before the deal was signed, but at Columbia University, most professors had not heard of the proposal before they awoke to an announcement of the deal.
In Carnegie Mellon's case, a Chicago public relations firm sent out an announcement about the university's involvement before the university's press office had a chance to see the release and fix a large error. The announcement said Carnegie Mellon would offer courses in E-commerce courses through Unext.com, but the dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Douglas M. Dunn, said it had no plans to do so. The university, Dr. Dunn said, is still negotiating over exactly which courses Carnegie Mellon will help create.
Meanwhile, some professors are wondering what involvement with Unext.com will mean to their scholarly reputations, the coin of the realm in the academic world. Robert Connolly, a professor in the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has worked with another distance-education company, called University Access, to create several economics courses using the Web and videotape. The experience, he said, has improved his teaching skills but hurt his standing in his department.
"I can't get people in my own school to talk to me about it," Mr. Connolly said. Colleagues who have been willing to acknowledge his distance-education work expect that his research -- a professor's ticket to tenure -- must be suffering, he said. "They look at it and say, 'If you are spending time on that, that takes time away from your research and publishing.' "
The American Association of University Professors has also asked questions about teaching quality in distance education courses. Last spring, when an on-line university called Jones International University became the first completely Internet-based school to gain accreditation, the association wrote a letter of protest to the accrediting agency. The letter cited "major worries about the denigration of quality" that could come with on-line education.
Most distance-education courses are not cheap either. The Caliber Learning Network, a company based in Baltimore, persuaded three universities -- the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Southern California -- to join it in offering business courses via satellite television and the Internet. Tuition is high; students who take the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Direct program pay $2,500 each for six-week courses.
Most of the students can afford to attend, said Alison Pierce, Wharton Direct's director, because they are already in upper-income brackets and the companies for which they work pick up most of the tab.
While Unext.com expects to benefit from companies' tuition-reimbursement programs as well, it will offer lower tuition prices, Mr. Rosenfield said. The company has not yet set its prices, but the cost of an Internet-based education, he said, should not be more than that of attending schools in person.
Still, critics ask, what will a degree from Cardean University be worth? Dr. Fungaroli has called such on-line programs "a new version of a trade school."
And students who enroll in M.B.A. programs from Stanford or the University of Chicago, Mr. Wilson argued, are doing so to build networks of contacts. "There is a real question about whether the 'good old boys' network' can be created in the same way it is created in elite business schools," he said.
But International Business Machines, Unext.Com's first customer, is willing to give the concept a try as a way to encourage their employees to learn without losing them to on-campus business schools. I.B.M. will offer its employees a finance course this year. It is also a partner in the Unext.com venture; the courses are being delivered through Lotus Learning Space, software developed by Lotus, an I.B.M. subsidiary.
Mr. Rosenfield admits that Unext.com does not plan to offer a full M.B.A. on line for years. Until then, the company will focus on executive training. Unext.com is not being structured to attempt to compete with what universities are already offering on campus, Mr. Rosenfield said.
In fact, Mr. Rosenfield himself calls on-campus education the best way to learn. "For people who have the ability to attend facilities-based schools, we recommend it," he said. But, he asked, why not also attempt to create a worthwhile experience for people who cannot attend those schools?
"They will not have direct interaction," he continued, "but what they will have is the wisdom of professors and pieces of their knowledge that are captured and scalable. And they will have supporting resources and mentors who are their guides."
So would Mr. Rosenfield take these courses? "Absolutely," he said. "The days when you ended your education at college, or graduate school, are truly over."

HEADLINE: Finding Fashion And History On the Edges;
Museums Look Again At Their Picture Frames

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
In a hushed gallery at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Elizabeth Easton, the curator of European paintings, and Jared Bark, the founder of Bark Frameworks in SoHo, were huddled around a Sisley landscape. The talk was not about the painting, but of its Louis XV-style reproduction gilt frame festooned with intricately carved flowers, swags and shells. "Look how the frame overpowers the painting," said Ms. Easton. "It's just too Louie-Schmooie."
Dissatisfied with the frames on many of the pictures in their collections, museum curators from Brooklyn to Kansas City, Mo., are caught up in a flurry of costly reframing projects. At the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City the curator of European paintings has spent $500,000 to reframe 75 paintings. The National Gallery of Art in Washington paid $60,000 to put a 17th-century walnut frame on Rembrandt's "Man in Oriental Costume," the most it has ever paid for a frame. And at the Art Institute of Chicago curators do a special "before and after" presentation to encourage benefactors to support the cost of reframing paintings. 
 Increasingly, as museums across the country expand, works that have languished in storage are being re-evaluated. Economic considerations underlie some of the activity. In today's robust art market, curators can no longer afford to buy paintings as often as they once could, so they try to make the best of what they have. Sometimes a painting brought back into view has a frame deemed hopelessly out of fashion; or a painting, framed to enhance a donor's decor, just doesn't work in a museum. But scholarship also plays a role. In recent years curators armed with new information about how artworks were originally framed are becoming fussier about authenticity
So now, in addition to raising money for exhibitions, acquisitions and expansions, curators are also trying to convince donors that the right frame, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, is not just window dressing.
"Framing has always been a business," said Keith Christiansen, a curator of European painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "But now there's big money in it." Like the price of all antiques, those of frames from the 17th through 19th centuries have escalated in the last decade. The most expensive and hardest to find are the simple, hand-carved 17th-century frames that curators covet.
In London, at the Bond Street gallery of Paul Mitchell, frames of all ages, sizes and styles line every available inch of wall. Mr. Mitchell's business is booming largely because of work from American museums. "It's a ripple effect," Mr. Mitchell said. "Once a curator changes a frame on one picture he wants to keep going." And when one curator learns that a colleague at a competing museum is reframing a collection, he suddenly wants to do the same.
In art history books, pictures are shown, but rarely their frames, Mr. Mitchell said. "Famous paintings are catalogued from head to toe, but about their frames you know nothing," he said. "That's because art history books only show the picture. They don't show the frame." Some artists have had definite ideas about how their works should be framed, but this information is also rarely documented.
So framers like Mr. Mitchell compiled their own historical references. He has systematically photographed pictures in their frames and created an archive of more than 40,000 paintings from museums, private collections, exhibitions and auctions worldwide. He also uses computer imaging to show clients how one painting might look with different frames.
"Few paintings have withstood the ravages of time in their original frame," he said. "Generally Old Masters have been divorced from their frames, either because of change of ownership, transport (it's easier to ship a painting without its frame) or changing tastes in interior decoration."
Every artistic movement has produced its own style of frame. The earliest frames, from the Renaissance, were merely protective edges for religious paintings and were extensions of the painting. The conception of frames as separate from the painting began in Italy during the 16th century. By the 19th century frame making had become a growth industry as the new middle class framed everything from paintings to lithographs.
At the National Gallery of Art in Washington, a frame committee of four museum staff members -- David Bull, a senior consultant in the conservation department; Philip Conisbee, senior curator of European paintings; Mark Leithauser, chief of design, and Alan Shestack, deputy director and chief curator -- was formed 10 years ago to reduce the chances of choices based purely on personal taste.
"Before we change a frame all of us have to agree," Mr. Bull said. Since 1990 the National Gallery has reframed some 200 paintings and plans to do 200 more.
Because it is so large, the museum has a growing computer database that consists of some 3,000 frames in its collection. Along with images and detailed descriptions of each frame are conservators' reports. "We look within our own collection first whenever we decide to reframe something," Mr. Conisbee said.
When the committee members decided to find a new frame for Degas's "Three Dancers," for instance, they discovered the perfect one in their storeroom. It was designed by Degas and was originally on the painting, which had been badly reframed by a dealer by the time it came to the museum in the 1940's. Luckily the original frame accompanied the painting. Because museum policy is never to throw out a frame, conservators were able to restore the more restrained Degas frame.
"We don't get rid of frames just in case 50 years from now people think we've made a mistake," Mr. Leithauser said. "This way they can easily change something."
For Dutch Old Masters, reframing can be a challenge because large 17th-century frames rarely exist. "In the 19th century dealers and collectors took off the original 17th-century black frames believing they were too somber and devoid of decoration," Mr. Leithauser said. "If you were a collector with a Rembrandt, you wanted a frame that said, 'I am a Rembrandt.' The older frames were therefore scrapped or burned."
For van Eyck's "Annunciation," which is 36 1/2 inches by just over 14 3/8 inches, the committee studied the original frames that they found on paintings by the same artist. One in the National Gallery of Art in London became the basis for a reproduction.
But the gallery was able to find a perfect match for Rembrandt's "Man in Oriental Costume," a 17th-century frame costing $60,000 from Guttman Frames. It replaced the overpowering gold frame that was on the painting when the museum acquired it. The men have no regrets. "Compared to what the painting is worth, it's cheap," Mr. Bull said.
In the early 1980's, before frames increased in price, Roger Ward, the curator of European art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum, made a list of the 20 most difficult to frame paintings in his collection. "The price I paid then for a period frame couldn't even pay for a reproduction now," he said.
The Nelson-Atkins was one of the first museums to comprehensively reframe major portions of its Old Masters and European art collection.
Mr. Ward said that 60 of his paintings now wear antique frames.
One of his prized paintings, Caravaggio's "St. John the Baptist," had been framed in a spindly 18th-century tapestry molding that had been cobbled together. Mr. Ward found a 16th-century Italian altarpiece frame that was appropriate to the scale and color of the painting.
"Since this was originally stuck in a stone altar, this frame is as close to the original as I could get," he said. When he bought the frame in 1987 it cost just over $26,000. "It would cost a lot more now," he said.
Mr. Ward said he realized that he is luckier than most museum curators: "I had sympathetic trustees and a sympathetic director. I have an endowment for my department, which includes expenses for things such as frames, so I don't have to find a donor for every frame I want to buy."
At the Art Institute of Chicago, curators have been evaluating the need to reframe gallery by gallery. With financial help from the museum's Old Masters Society, a group of about 400 people, and from the institute's director, curators have raised $125,000 for the Dutch and Flemish galleries and are raising another $225,000 for reframing major works in the mid-19th-century galleries.
The "before and after" presentations at the museum have persuaded potential donors to help. To illustrate the difference an appropriate frame can make, curators take Corot's "Interrupted Reading," an image of a woman looking up from her book. First they show the painting in its original 17th-century Italian frame, which had been stripped and painted a dull brown, presumably to match the painting's background. Then they replace that frame with an 1870 Louis XIII-revival-style frame from Wiggins in London.
"It restores the balance between the background and the flesh tones in the figure," said Gloria Groom, a curator in the museum's department of European paintings. "This is a frame the artist would have put on the painting for an exhibition in a salon in the second half of the 19th century."
The museum started to think about reframing nearly 10 years ago, with the exhibition "Monet in the 90's." "When we put paintings of similar subjects together we could actually see what was historically and esthetically pleasing," Ms. Groom said. Some of the original frames on works the museum borrowed, she said, opened curators' eyes. "Ninety-nine percent of the time we try to figure out what the artist put the picture in himself," she added.
The reframing project has been "a consciousness-raising exercise," said Douglas Druick, the senior curator of European paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago. "A lot of the Dutch paintings that had entered the collection at the same time were suffering under the weight of the robber-baron frame."
Curators don't always have the luxury of spending years seeking the right period frame when they make changes gallery by gallery. The Chicago museum has often had reproductions made. Of the six Monet haystack paintings in their collection, two have their original frames. The others have frames made by Mr. Mitchell, all different but all based on the classical vocabulary of the Louis XVI style.
The museum's star painting, Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon on la Grande Jatte," still doesn't have a frame that satisfies curators. They consider it too big, too round and too white. "We feel we need to revisit this," Ms. Groom said.
While the designers who made the frame in 1989 took the shape from the artist's rendition (Seurat is famous for his impossible-to-match white frames), what they considered historically correct then does not do justice to the painting. "Historically correct doesn't always work," Ms. Groom said. "It's difficult to age white because there's a patina you can't get. We just have to keep experimenting."
What may be considered historically accurate and what an artist would have wanted are not always what the public likes. In 1986 curators at the Baltimore Museum of Art removed the ornately carved wood-and-cast-plaster frames from the fabled collection of Matisses that had belonged to Dr. Claribel Cone, a Baltimore pathologist, and her sister, Etta Cone, who bequeathed their collection to the museum.
They replaced the Cones' elaborate frames with simple strip frames and stored the originals. Scholars applauded the museum's boldness, but some visitors criticized the move.
Last year, when Doreen Bolger became the museum's new director, one of her first decisions was to restore the Cone sisters' frames. "We know that Matisse made comments about not liking elaborate frames, but there have been strong feelings in Baltimore that the Cones' frames should go back on the Matisses," she said. "When I first saw them in strip frames I wanted to see the paintings in the more traditional frames."
Archival pictures of the artist's studio show that Matisse put his paintings in flat-edged strip frames, and in a letter that he wrote in 1916 he said he was "very opposed to frames and particularly heavy frames that surround the paintings with a yellow color, stopping all expansion."
He continued, "A modern painting has no need for a frame: it should have a simple border at most."
So who is right? "We have to acknowledge changes in tastes and no doubt tastes will change again; it's cyclical," Ms. Bolger said. "Framing is definitely subject to interpretation."
 
A Waning Passion For Gilt
One reason museums are saddled with frames that do not do justice to their paintings is that many of the world's most famous dealers during the last two centuries -- figures like Joseph Duveen and Paul Durand-Ruel -- put paintings in imposing gilt frames to impress their nouveau-riche clients.
The scroll-shaped corners of a Durand-Ruel frame, for example, can be instantly identified by any seasoned curator. Their flourishes served a purpose. When a painting looked more impressive framed in heavy gilt, it could command a higher price. Ornately carved gilt frames were also used to tame what were considered wild Impressionist paintings, and they went well with the fine 18th-century French furniture that was the decorating trend of the moment.
By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, artists became involved in framing. Whistler refused to allow anyone to design his frames and made simple ones himself. Some Impressionists, particularly Pissarro and Degas, put their pictures in plain white, gray, yellow and even purple frames of their own design. And post-Impressionist artists like Seurat, van Gogh and Gauguin made frames that in colors that complemented their paintings.
Today there are no rules for what makes an appropriate frame, although curators are mindful of a painting's history.

Once Dross, Now Dream: Wrecks Are Suddenly Hot

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, agents say, the smallish two-bedroom apartment overlooking Sutton Place South, with a sidelong glance at the East River, would have been priced at around $475,000 -- and labeled a wreck. The worn linoleum in its dark Pullman kitchen was starting to crack; the grout in the bathroom was falling out. Wind whistled through the old window sashes.
This year, the apartment, up for sale, was labeled, primly and elegantly, in estate condition. The asking price: $895,000. It sold immediately, with at least six bidders. 
 In New York's real estate market, the whopping discount for the handyman's special has gone the way of the $500 sublet. "People always expected a big reduction for an apartment that needed work, and they got it," said Peter R. Marra, the president of William B. May Real Estate. "But now, there's virtually no differential. Appraisers consider square footage, views, building. Condition is not even an issue."
Just this week, a very large Fifth Avenue apartment came on the market, this one also in raggedy condition: crammed with tired furniture, covered with wallpaper hung 40 years ago, with a kitchen decked out in old painted cabinets -- and a terrace strewn with pots of dead ivy.
"It just looked and smelled old," Mr. Marra said. "We priced it just as if it were in very good condition, very aggressively: around $3 million."
Sometimes, a wreck brings even more money than an apartment that has been totally renovated -- especially if it is in a prewar building, and if the original wainscoting and moldings are intact.
And while brokers say that paying premiums for Cinderella apartments is most prevalent along the Gold Coast of Fifth and Park Avenues, and within the grande dames of Central Park West, the phenomenon is not confined to the boulevards.
IN Murray Hill, for example, Laura Enman, 33, a garment district saleswoman, just paid $202,000 for a one-bedroom apartment at 136 East 36th Street, a prewar building that is showing its age. (The last one-bedroom that sold in the building -- this one in really good shape -- went for $175,000.)
The moldings in Ms. Enman's apartment are so obscured with glopped-on paint that it's hard to see that they are moldings; the floor was long ago painted a strange shade of beige, which has rubbed off in places, and the fireplace (yes, there is a working fireplace) was repaired by some overworked handyman who slapped gray mortar over the brick -- and left it like that.
"I love that it's a fixer-upper," Ms. Enman said, as she riffled through her very first mail delivery, surrounded by cardboard boxes. "This way, I'll be in charge of the renovation. I'm not paying for someone else's taste. My father's going to come here and teach me how to strip woodwork."
Ms. Enman knows that she paid more than she would have a few years ago. And she knows that her place is in worse condition than others that have recently sold for less. "But I wanted this apartment," she said. "I didn't want to lose it."
Ms. Enman was infatuated with its charm. And that is why apartments that only a few years ago would have been knocked down in price have been rediscovered: the charm of the old (and shabby).
That and a general shortage of good apartments -- in any condition.
Right now, there are waiting lists for apartments with large rooms, views, fireplaces and moldings. When one comes on the market, the eight or nine or 90 people who didn't get the last such property that came up will be back bidding on it. Which is another reason that a wreck may go for more money than a place that's in pristine condition: bidders don't want to lose out a second time.
"So what if they then pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more to renovate?" said Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of the real estate company that bears her name. "This market is defined by the moment. It's inconsequential, a moot point, what an apartment went for yesterday, whether or not it was fixed up."
In the recession of the early 1990's, she said, the fixer-uppers were a bargain, priced way below what they would be worth if renovated. "People didn't have the confidence that if they invested money to fix them up, they'd ever get their money back," she said, adding that today is different.
Still, there are those who shake their heads at the prices. Two years ago, Ann Keenes bought a large classic six (two bedrooms, formal dining room, living room, kitchen and maid's room) in an Old World building on West End Avenue in the 90's. She paid $560,000 -- and thought she overpaid. The apartment was what she calls, without blushing, a wreck.
Now, an apartment with the same configuration, but one floor down, where the river views are a little less spectacular, is for sale, in the same condition. The asking price is $825,000. "I just can't imagine that it's worth that much money," Ms. Keenes said.
Oh, but it is -- or well may be. Unrenovated apartments, once the dregs, have now risen to the top layer of the marketplace. As one fervent agent said: "We once called them problems. Now we herald them as opportunities."
So, it figures that agents are out beating the bushes for untouched gems. And where better to look for an estate-condition apartment than in an estate?
"We basically have a whole team that looks at estate lists -- people who've actually died and are not coming back, not some guy moving to Florida," Mr. Marra said.
Do the real estate salesmen wine and dine these lawyers? Not exactly, because lawyers don't have the power they once had to dictate to heirs which agents to hire.
"But they can usually recommend two or three firms," Mr. Marra said, "and obviously we, along with every other company in town, want to be one of those three."
So, with all the agents angling, and would-be buyers bidding, are there any bargains left? Probably not. Two young women got what may have been the last one.
Catherine and Edith Kuhnle, aspiring singers known as Cat and Edie, ages 25 and 29 respectively, just bought a three-bedroom Park Avenue wreck for -- you're not going to believe this -- less than $150,000.
The apartment had the right location -- in a fine building on Park in the 80's -- but as Stephen Perlo, the agent, said, "it was unconventionally located within the building."
"It was down three steps off the lobby, past the superintendent's apartment," he said, adding that it was sort of a dark hole. "A lot of people who looked at it just couldn't deal with that." And those who could, he continued, "wouldn't have a chance of passing the board."
Enter the Kuhnle sisters, whose father lives in Washington and is politically connected, Mr. Perlo said.
"And the president of the board is Susan Thomases," he said. Ms. Thomases, a lawyer, is a longtime friend of the President and the First Lady.
Some people have all the luck.

HEADLINE: A Key Index Says Economy Is Continuing To Perk Along

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
In another sign that the nation's economy continues to grow at a brisk pace, a key barometer of future activity rose three-tenths of a percent in July, the same rate as in the prior two months, the Conference Board reported yesterday.
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has registered gains in 9 of the last 10 months. 
 There are concerns that rising interest rates could slow growth later this year, said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group.
"But over all, strength in manufacturing conditions and a robust labor market more than offset the negative contribution of higher interest rates," he said in releasing the figures.
The results for July, which were slightly better than expected, reinforce Tuesday's economic data that showed that the manufacturing economy grew in August.
"Eight of the 10 leading indicators posted increases, underscoring the continuing strength of the current economic expansion," Mr. Goldstein said. "The two key drivers of this latest increase were manufacturing and the labor market."
The economic expansion, now in its ninth year, is, however, showing some signs of cooling, including a report yesterday of a decline in construction spending.
Home building and other construction spending was surprisingly weak in July, according to the report yesterday from the Commerce Department in Washington.
Construction spending fell half a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $695.7 billion. In June, construction spending fell slightly, according to revised figures.
July's decrease was the opposite of what many analysts had expected. They were forecasting that spending would actually go up between three-tenths of a percent and six-tenths of a percent.
Home building and other construction -- driven by low mortgage rates -- were key contributing factors to the strong economic growth in the early part of the year.
But the Federal Reserve has raised key interest rates twice this summer, and that makes buying a home more expensive.
Rising mortgage rates took a bite out of the housing market in July. Existing-home sales fell 3.9 percent, while sales of new homes rose a slight one-tenth of a percent but still reached the second-highest level ever.
Consumers are feeling a little less confident about economic and job prospects, in part because of the rise in interest rates. The consumer confidence index fell for a second consecutive month in August, according to a Conference Board report Tuesday.
The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in 1992. First calculated in the late 1960's, the index is periodically fine-tuned and

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Subaru isn't tampering with success; it's just going to do what it has been doing -- only bigger.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane 

 BODY:
SUBARU is rolling out the largest advertising campaign in its history, but don't expect to see a new cast of characters or any other drastic changes to its existing theme. Instead, the company is sticking by an old adage: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Paul Hogan of "Crocodile Dundee" fame continues as Subaru's spokesman in the integrated campaign from Subaru's agency of six years, Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., and the campaign continues to emphasize safety and performance features, including all-wheel-drive technology. Subaru, however, is doubling the amount of broadcast and print placements and backing the ads with $70 million to $80 million to push its revamped Legacy line and its 2000 Forester model. 
 "Subaru understands who they are," said David Lyon, group account director at Temerlin McClain, a unit of True North Communications. He added, "That's why you see consistency, focus, continuity, and you see the courage to stay with what's working."
Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consultancy, a brand and corporate image company in New York, agrees that sticking to a similar format seems to be the right formula for the Subaru of America unit of Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan. "Given the intensity of the noise level of automobile advertising, essentially the only way they are breaking through the clutter is staying with what they already have," he said.
In the latest campaign for the company's redesigned Legacy models, which include the Outback wagon, the Outback sedan and the Legacy GT, the overall slogan is still, "The beauty of all-wheel drive."
Most of the nine new television commercials, which began running nationally last month, are for the Outback models. In one spot for the Outback sedan, a sleek black car is shown cruising through a city and passing imagery of the Australian Outback, including a woman walking a kangaroo on a leash, crocodiles in potholes and a herd of sheep crossing the street at a crosswalk. Mr. Hogan steps out of his Subaru and says, "My kind of town."
A spot for the Outback Sport vehicle, which is aimed at younger consumers, shows Mr. Hogan tagging along with his nephew en route to an outdoor concert. The two drive on a dirt road through a variety of obstacles to demonstrate the car's performance and horsepower. As they reach their destination, passing tattooed fellow concertgoers, the nephew says, "This might not be your type of crowd, Uncle," to find Mr. Hogan already body surfing in the mosh pit. The Outback tag line is, "The world's first sport utility wagon."
A third commercial to demonstrate the traction and control of all-wheel-drive technology has Mr. Hogan in the classic Subaru chase scenario in the jungle. Two other spots for the Forester emphasize its carlike handling and that it is easier to climb into than other sport utility vehicles. The Forester slogan is, "Sport utility tough, car easy." And another commercial, showcases the entire line of Subaru's all-wheel- drive vehicles.
"I don't think anyone would look at the work and say there is a significant departure from what we have done," Mr. Lyon said, "though we have done some things differently to call attention to the fact that we have a new car."
Mr. Hogan, who has been in the Subaru campaign for five years "represents everything we want to say about this car -- that it's rugged, it's adventurous, it can provide the driver with a lot of confidence and that it's fun," Mr. Lyon said.
Still, he added, "We had to find a way to use Paul a little differently to make sure that we signal news that we have a new car this year."
Bill Cyphers, vice president for marketing at Subaru in Cherry Hill, N.J., said the company's sales figures were argument enough for continuing with the current theme. "We've had three wonderful years back to back -- each year is better than the last," he said. "And this past year was our best sales year in over 10 years."
Over the last six years, Subaru said that sales in the United States had grown more than 50 percent. As of July, Subaru had sold 85,478 cars this year, up 8 percent, from the corresponding period a year earlier.
"Mr. Hogan continues to work for us. The type of ads that we do continue to work, and we are targeting those people with the active life style who have a high propensity to buy our cars," Mr. Cyphers said.
Most Subaru buyers are college-educated, make approximately $75,000 annually and enjoy an active life style involving canoeing, hiking and skiing, Mr. Cyphers said.
Mr. Lyon added that Subaru was also trying to win over consumers who had become disillusioned with sport utility vehicles, which are essentially light trucks and have poor fuel economy.
As Subaru has brought itself back from a string of declining sales ending in the early 1990's, it has grown from a marketer of niche products like front- and four-wheel-drive vehicles that were positioned as cheap and reliable to a full-line producer of mainstream offerings like upscale all-wheel-drive sedans, sports utility wagons and the Forester sport utility vehicle.
The print portion of the campaign gives readers glimpses into the active, outdoor-oriented life styles of Subaru owners. Six ads began appearing in the August issues of publications including Automobile, National Geographic, Outside, People, Southern Living, Smithsonian and Time. All the ads refer consumers to a refurbished Subaru corporate Web site, subaru.com or to a special site designed to showcase the new line, 2000.subaru.com. In addition to search engines like Yahoo, Subaru interactive banner ads have been placed on sites like Autobytel and Carpoint.

HEADLINE: Savings and Loans Had Strong Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The United States savings and loan industry earned $2.12 billion in the second quarter of 1999, bolstered by a strong economy and a vibrant housing sector, the Office of Thrift Supervision said today.
The earnings were the industry's best on record for any second quarter, rising from $2.06 billion in the first three months of 1999 and $2.10 billion in the second quarter of 1998. 
 Despite rising interest rates, mortgage originations remained strong, the office said. New mortgages handled by savings banks reached $79.2 billion, up from $77.4 billion in the first quarter and $78.6 billion a year earlier.
Reduced overhead and higher retail fee income also contributed to the strong performance.
Return on average assets for the industry, a key measure of profitability, rose to 1.01 percent in the second quarter from 1.00 percent in the first quarter. Return on average equity rose to 12.44 percent from 12.29 percent.
Asset quality also continued to improve, the office said. Troubled assets fell to $5.5 billion, or 0.65 percent of the total, the lowest level since the agency began tracking them in 1990. The number of problem savings banks also declined to 10, less than 1 percent of the total number of institutions, from 14 in the first quarter.
Rates of overdue loans fell for all major loan types in the second quarter. On single-family mortgage loans, the overdue rate fell to 0.78 percent of all such loans from 0.84 percent in the prior quarter. Overdue consumer loans dropped to 0.72 percent from 0.82 percent.

Treasury bond prices fell yesterday for the fourth time in five days on concern the economy's strength and prospects for faster inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for a third time this year.
"It's still not clear to people that the Fed is done" raising rates after doing so in June and last week, said David Jallits, who helps oversee $5 billion at Strategic Fixed Income in Arlington, Va. "Until that happens, bonds will continue to struggle." 
 Mr. Jallits has been buying money market securities, the safest fixed-income investments. Strategic has not held so much cash-equivalent debt since 1994, when the Fed began a series of seven rate increases.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 7/32, to 100 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.08 percent from 6.06 percent on Tuesday.
William Stevens, portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management L.L.C. in San Francisco, expects bond yields to rise as high as 6.5 percent by the end of the year. Mr. Stevens, who invests $1.8 billion of debt, currently is favoring 10-year notes over bonds.
Treasuries came under pressure Tuesday after a report showed manufacturing activity rose for a seventh month. Also, an index of prices paid by manufacturers, an inflation barometer, climbed to the highest level in more than four years.
Since Thursday, reports on new- home sales, income, spending and manufacturing have shown no slowdown in the economy's ninth year of expansion, fueling concern that the growth will lead to inflation and cause further Fed rate increases. Friday's jobs release -- which will probably show that the unemployment rate tied a 30-year low in August -- is expected to provide further evidence of strength.
"The U.S. is growing too strongly for its own good," said Gerard Lyons, global head of Treasury research at Standard Chartered Bank in London. "I'm expecting one more rate hike this year" and more early next year, he said.

A Legacy of Conscience From Milton Rogovin

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
Three weeks ago an air-conditioned truck pulled up to Milton Rogovin's house in Buffalo and carted away his entire archive of photographic negatives, contact sheets and prints -- a lifetime of work. When artists allude to posterity, they often do so only half-believing in it, but this was posterity's actual moving van, come to carry Mr. Rogovin's archive to the Library of Congress.
The day must have seemed strange in many respects, not least in the faint but still discernible irony that hung over it. Mr. Rogovin's career as a professional photographer began only after he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, a refusal that diminished his livelihood as an optometrist. "They already had enough stool pigeons," Mr. Rogovin says. "They didn't need me." 
 That was in 1957. The next year Mr. Rogovin was asked by a friend to photograph storefront churches in a black section of Buffalo, a neighborhood Mr. Rogovin already knew well as a voting-rights activist. The result was a series of photographs capturing the pathos, religious and otherwise, of that urban communion. Since then Mr. Rogovin, who will turn 90 in late December, has devoted himself to a photography of implicit activism, to portraits of working men and women, of the rural and urban poor in America and abroad. In a sense Mr. Rogovin has continued on his own the project of the Farm Security Administration, the 1930's sponsor of some of the most remarkable photographic work of this century. His subject is not the Great Depression but the chronic depression that still shapes the lives of the working poor and unemployed.
Two of Mr. Rogovin's most striking photographic series rely on the transformations that place and time bring about. In "Working People," Mr. Rogovin photographed his subjects at work, dressed in the armor of heavy industry, and at home, dressed however they chose. Labor transfigures, but so does leisure, and it is a little alarming to notice how much more sharply defined Mr. Rogovin's subjects seem in hard hats and shop aprons than in coats and ties and Sunday dresses. But nothing transfigures like the years going by. Three times in the past quarter-century, Mr. Rogovin went to Buffalo's Lower West Side and photographed the same people in settings of their own choosing. The result is a book called "Triptychs," as pure a witnessing of time's movement, and the ways in which poverty coarsens that movement, as there is.
If it made sense, during the Depression, to send photographers out into the countryside to chronicle the "ill housed, ill clothed, and ill fed," it makes equal sense to acknowledge, as Mr. Rogovin's portraits do, that for many people those conditions have never changed. An art raised upon that sad fact can sustain itself in esthetic terms without falsely ennobling or falsely degrading the people who stare at us still from these pictures. There is true collaboration in Milton Rogovin's photographs, a conspiring of artist and subject, and that is a legacy of conscience worth preserving.

With LightTouch, Trade Chief Takes Over

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Mike Moore of New Zealand began his first day as leader of the World Trade Organization today with a reminder of some nettlesome issues he faces as the top global trade arbitrator.
White placards with such slogans as "God Is Dead; the W.T.O. Has Replaced Him," waved by a small but voluble band of demonstrators, greeted him as he arrived in a chauffeur-driven black Lexus. 
 "That's a bit flattering I would have to say," Mr. Moore remarked of the placards' sentiment. The protesters represent groups that have increasingly criticized the trade organization as having too much power. They are threatening to disrupt global trade talks in Seattle late in November, which is scheduled as Mr. Moore's initial challenge as Director General. According to his count, he has 11 weeks to pull together a workable agenda on an array of complex issues.
Mr. Moore's congeniality and breezily informal style may help smooth over disagreements among the 134 often-fractious member nations on issues as diverse as cuts in farm subsidies, taxation of electronic commerce, market access to financial services like banking and insurance, and tariffs on industrial goods.
Looming as particularly contentious is whether to include genetically modified food on the trade talk agenda, in light of the dispute between the United States and the European Union over whether barring American hormone-treated beef from the Continental market violates global trading rules.
"Whether we like it or not, these are issues the public is concerned about," Mr. Moore said.
Some trade experts say they think he will have a second full-time job mending fences with envoys from developing countries who supported his rival for Director General, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand.
The 10-month contest escalated into a clash of wills with delegates of many nations expressing resentment of Mr. Moore's support from the United States. This was particularly true among nations that contend they have not benefited from trade liberalization and suspect the United States of having tried to undermine Mr. Supachai's candidacy.
In July, a compromise was struck in which both men will serve three-year terms, with Mr. Moore going first. "It's been a lot of drama and theater," the new trade chief said, "but it will be forgotten in six months because the real issues are so enormous."
Mr. Moore, 50, has spent much of his career in New Zealand, where he was most recently opposition spokesman for trade and foreign affairs. He worked briefly for the printers' union but mostly served in Government posts. In 1990, he was briefly New Zealand's Prime Minister. "I was there such a short time it made Gerald Ford look like Franklin Roosevelt," Mr. Moore remarked.
Jovial one-liners aside, he is well aware that he faces a tough task in figuring out how the trade organization presents itself to a public that is increasingly aware and suspicious of centralized power over trade.
Criticism over the lack of openness erupted last year when the organization brushed aside American safeguards for endangered sea turtles caught in shrimpers' nets. Such environmental or conservation measures are at odds with the views of many emerging economies, which have resisted opening their commerce to outside scrutiny.
"We have to recognize that many nongovernmental organizations have enormous influence," Mr. Moore said, "so we have to engage them and show a more human face.
"If you've got something to hide, the best way is to give out 5,000 sheets of paper and dare people to find it," he said jokingly.
At the same time, he has repeatedly emphasized that the trade organization is driven by its members' needs. To bring more smaller economies into the fold -- about 30 countries are too poor to have diplomats in Geneva -- Mr. Moore plans to help them better protect their trading interests.
"The W.T.O. now doesn't look like the real world," he said. "It looks too rich and clubby, so we have to work on that." That includes admitting Russia and China to the group, he said.
However, the trappings of his new job -- a six-figure salary, an entertainment allowance, the luxury car and a spectacular view of Lake Geneva -- obviously fit the upscale model, although Mr. Moore says he is too down-to-earth to have his head turned by such perks. A worry, he said, is that he does not speak French -- something considered tantamount to sin in Geneva circles.
Aside from that, how will he know if he has been successful? "If I manage to offend everybody, then I'm doing a good job," he said.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Memo Appears to Oppose a Type ofPension Conversion

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Cash-balance pension plans have drawn heavy criticism lately because they often reduce the pensions of older workers. In fact, a memo written by an Internal Revenue Service district director one year ago -- and released Tuesday by a member of Congress -- stated that one cash-balance pension plan may violate age-discrimination laws.
Cash-balance pension plans have become popular with employers because they are cheaper and can offer better benefits to young workers unlikely to spend their career in one place. 
 But middle-aged employees at a number of companies that have converted to cash-balance plans have complained about benefit reductions that they say can take away up to 50 percent of the value of their pensions. In response, some lawmakers in Washington have sought to stop cash-balance conversions through legislation or action by Federal agencies.
Traditional pension-plan benefits are typically calculated using the number of years an employee was at a company and final pay, so most of the value of the pension is based on years late in a person's career. Under cash-balance plans, companies contribute a percentage of an employee's pay to an account every year, and then guarantee that money will grow at a certain interest rate, such as the yield on a Treasury bill. At retirement, that account is the pension.
The September 1998 I.R.S. memo, released Tuesday by Representative Bernard Sanders, a Vermont Independent and critic of cash-balance plans, could fuel efforts to slow cash-balance conversions. In the memo, the I.R.S. district director in Cincinnati, C. Ashley Bullard, told I.R.S. officials in Washington that one company's cash-balance plan may not comply with age-discrimination rules because the "plan's benefit-accrual rate decreases as a participant attains each additional year of age."
Mr. Sanders said in a statement, "This memo bears out what I and others have been saying: If the rate of accrual goes down as workers get older, then the plan violates the law."
Mr. Bullard declined to comment yesterday. A spokesman for the I.R.S., Don Roberts, said the memo merely reflected internal agency debate about a pension plan at one specific company. He declined to say whether the I.R.S. had made any formal decision relating to the plan. In the memo, he said, regional I.R.S. officials were seeking guidance from the national office about the one plan, and the document did not necessarily reflect the position of Mr. Bullard. It "is not precedent-setting and may not be cited as a broad statement" of I.R.S. policy, he said.
I.R.S. officials are also working on a response to a letter from some members of Congress about whether cash-balance plans violate age-discrimination or other rules.
The name of the company that was the subject of the memo was blacked out, but according to people close to the matter, it refers to the Onan Corporation, a subsidiary of the Cummins Engine Company based in Fridley, Minn.
As previously reported, the I.R.S., in a filing in a lawsuit in United States Tax Court, has taken the position that an Onan pension plan should be stripped of its tax-exempt status because of the way it converted to a type of cash-balance plan. If the judge in that case agrees with the I.R.S., Onan will be given the opportunity to correct any problems with the plan. Cummins said Wednesday that the company had not received confirmation that Onan was the subject of the I.R.S. memo, and that the agency had not raised age discrimination in the tax court case. "Onan does not believe there can be age discrimination when everyone who makes the same amount, no matter what age, gets the same company contribution each year," said the spokeswoman, Marya M. Rose.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why all the fuss over pint-sized Ecuador? Brady bonds.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
HAS the looming possibility that Ecuador will default on its foreign debts provoked an excessive amount of hand-wringing? At first glance, it surely appears so. Ecuador produces less output in a year -- about $15 billion -- than the United States produces in a day. The financial travails of such a pint-sized economy would not ordinarily threaten anyone beyond its own borders.
Yet the Treasury Department and International Monetary Fund remain fixated on Ecuador's problems for reasons that go beyond the ordinary duty to help out a distressed country. This week Ecuador became the first country to skip interest payments on Brady bonds -- bonds issued by Mexico, Ecuador and other Latin countries during the debt crisis of the late 1980's and 1990's. 
 Ecuador has a month to make interest payments before its Brady bonds are technically in default. But if it does default, some analysts worry that the Brady bonds issued by other debtor countries will also be tarnished, scaring investors away.
So, will Ecuador's potential default contaminate financial markets in Latin America and beyond? The debate is lively.
"Probably not," said Albert Fishlow of Violy, Byorum & Partners, a New York investment firm. "Ecuador's debt problem is understood to be far worse than that of other countries in the region."
But Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics warned that if the International Monetary Fund did not handle the situation carefully, Ecuador's problem could soon become Brazil's, Argentina's and even sub-Saharan Africa's.
By the late 1980's, Mexico, Ecuador and several other Latin American countries had borrowed from foreign banks far beyond their capacity to repay. The solution, spearheaded by Nicholas F. Brady, who was Treasury Secretary in the Bush Administration, was to replace the bank loans with Brady bonds.
The Brady bonds helped debtors and creditors. Ecuador came out ahead because the banks agreed to knock down the value of its debt payments by about 40 percent. The banks came out ahead because Ecuador and other debtor countries put up collateral to guarantee repayment of the principal and some interest payments.
By eliminating some of the debt overload and creating a security that could be easily traded, Brady bonds made it possible for Mexico, Ecuador and others to re-enter foreign capital markets, a necessary step to reviving aising their depressed economies.
But floods and a plunge in the price of oil, a key export, rocked Ecuador's finances last year. Political paralysis has prevented Ecuador from closing a huge deficit by raising taxes or by ending expensive subsidies for gasoline and other consumer products.
Mr. Fishlow said that Ecuador's debt was perhaps three times, compared with the size of its economy, that of its neighbors. Its foreign debt exceeds $13 billion, of which about $6 billion is in Brady bonds. According to Lehman Brothers, the country spends over 30 percent of its budget on interest payments. Few experts believe that Ecuador can repay all of its debt.
The International Monetary Fund and Ecuador have been negotiating a bailout package that is expected to provide about $400 million in direct aid and release another $800 million from other international institutions. The fund will require Ecuador to reduce its deficit. The fund also expects Ecuador to negotiate debt relief from its private creditors -- a new direction for the I.M.F. intended to insulate it from criticism that the money it would pump into Ecuador would flow right back out to pay off private creditors.
But David Roberts, international economist for Banc of America Securities, warned that current holders of Brady bonds were the wrong target for the fund's new policy toward private creditors. "The banks that originally took Brady bonds in exchange for existing loans already wrote down the value of their loans," he said. "If the fund becomes cavalier toward current holders of Brady bonds, it threatens to drive the right type of foreign lenders out of Latin America." If the fund encourages Ecuador to default, he warned, "it will create a legal mess."
Mr. Hufbauer agreed: "Brady bonds helped countries pull themselves out of depression. The Brady's were thought of as superior debt, protected by collateral and a firm resolve to repay in full. For the fund to appear to be forcing Ecuador to default on these loans could make it impossible to use this device again."
Mr. Hufbauer acknowledged that Ecuador could not pay all its debts and must seek relief. What worried him was the possible role of the fund in insisting on default on the Brady bonds.
Michael Hood of J. P. Morgan disagreed, warning, "Do not sanctify Brady debt." It trades like other debt, he said, and its holders need to provide some debt relief.
In the end, the debate is not so much about Ecuador as about the fund's role in forcing further losses on the holders of Brady bonds. Why, some economists ask, should those who helped save Latin America be treated as villains? Because, says the other side, they are among the only sacrificial lambs available.

HEADLINE: Applications to Medical Schools Decline for Second Straight Year

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The number of applications to medical schools dropped nearly 5 percent last year, continuing a decline that began in 1997 after an all-time high in 1996, according to a study published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The author of the study and others in the field said the decline could be cyclical because applications tended to dip in prosperous times when students had more options for high-paying careers. 
 Other factors may include a more difficult job market for medical school graduates, and complaints by doctors of excessive paperwork and a loss of autonomy brought on by the growth of managed care.
Applications peaked in 1996 when 46,968 people applied for about 16,200 openings at the 125 medical schools accredited by the American Medical Association, the study reported.
Since then, applications have dropped about 12 percent, to 41,004 last year. Figures for 1999 are not yet available, but Barbara Barzansky, the principal researcher of the study and director of medical schools services for the medical association, said applications in May were down 2,000 from May 1998.
Since 1996, the number of applications from minorities -- blacks, American Indians, Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans -- has also declined, about 12.8 percent, Dr. Barzansky said.
The data have spurred speculation over how to explain the decline. Dr. Barzansky said a decline in the number of doctors was not likely because medical schools were still drawing two or three applicants per available slot and there was no indication the quality of candidates was declining, since grade point averages and medical college admission test scores had remained about the same.
But, she said, the dip in minority applicants raised some concern because it comes amid an aggressive recruiting effort by medical schools. One explanation could be reverberations from affirmative action debates, leading some minority students to believe there are fewer openings at the schools, she said.
If the decline continued, it could have broader implications. "Students who are from minority groups are more likely to serve minority groups," Dr. Barzansky said. "In addition, there is a feeling a diverse student body is considered a good learning experience for everybody."
Andrew Frantz, the associate dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, said there were slightly more than 3,000 applicants for 150 spots last year at his college, a decline of more than a 1,000 since 1996.
Dr. Frantz noted that applications also rose and then fell during the 1970's and 1980's, usually in stride with the condition of the economy.
Jordon Cohen, president of the American Association of Medical Colleges, agreed that the economy might explain the decline but also blamed the growth of managed care.
Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group in Washington representing 1,000 managed-care organizations, said blaming managed care was "too simplistic."
"There is a transition going on from the old system to the new system," Ms. Pisano said, "and I think people who want medicine as a career will not be daunted by the challenges."
She suggested an oversupply of doctors as a factor. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported last year that one quarter of doctors who recently completed residency training reported difficulty in finding employment.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Details on Russia's Use of Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it wants assurances that international financial aid already sent to Russia has not been lost to corruption, but stopped short of calling for a halt in future loans to Moscow from the International Monetary Fund.
Seeking to defend the Administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia -- and to defuse an issue that could have political ramifications for Vice President Al Gore -- Treasury Department officials and John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the Administration wanted to be certain that no money loaned to Russia by the fund had been moved surreptitiously out of the country. They were responding to reports of money laundering in which billions of dollars were sent by Russians through the Bank of New York. 
 "We want to make sure that the I.M.F. money is going to reform-oriented projects," Mr. Podesta said today in an appearance at the National Press Club. "The I.M.F., in its latest lending, has instituted additional safeguards, but we want an accounting of the ways the I.M.F. money has been spent."
Previous investigations of monetary fund loans to Russia have found no evidence that the money had been misused, and Justice Department officials have told their counterparts at the Treasury Department that they have no evidence that the money-laundering investigation involves the proceeds of I.M.F. loans. Officials at the fund repeated today that they have no evidence of any misuse of loans to Russia.
"Let's wait and see what the facts are," Mr. Podesta said.
But it is unclear how much new evidence the Administration hopes to assemble about the matter. Officials at the fund said they have not undertaken new studies of how Russia has used past loan proceeds since news of the money-laundering investigation broke on Aug. 19.
Still, the monetary fund has had some serious problems with Russia, including questions about whether the Russian central bank used transactions with an offshore affiliate known as Fimaco to deceive the fund about the country's financial condition. The fund is now waiting for a follow-up report on the Fimaco case from the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers that looks at the central bank and its affiliates in Britain, France and Germany.
At the same time, the I.M.F. is conducting its routine review of its current lending agreement, which was signed in July.
Russia is eligible for $4.5 billion in loans from the fund over the next year and a half, of which $640 million was disbursed as a first installment in July. The next installment, probably of roughly the same size, is scheduled to be released in the next several months. Like the first installment, the next one is intended to help repay previous loans, and will simply be transferred from one fund account to another without entering the Russian banking system. Russia already owes the fund about $16 billion.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in an interview published today by USA Today that the "United States will not support disbursement" of the next loan installment to Russia from the monetary fund "without adequate safeguards to assure that any funds disbursed are used properly."
Treasury officials said Mr. Summers was not implying -- as the headline on the USA Today story suggested -- that the United States was ready to block the next loan installment.
It would be "premature to make any judgments as to whether Russia will meet the conditions" for the loan, said Michelle Smith, a Treasury spokeswoman. The statements suggested that the Administration wanted to express concern about the possibility that the international aid had been misappropriated without changing its policy toward Moscow as Russia struggles to continue its rocky transformation towards democratic capitalism.
Federal investigators are looking into the movement of at least $4.2 billion from Russia through the Bank of New York over the past 18 months. However, some investigators estimate that as much as $10 billion may have flowed through the bank.
Investigators say the money may have come from a combination of organized crime, corporate embezzlement and political graft. Given the amounts of money involved, there has been speculation that some of it might have come from international aid packages, of which the loans from the fund are the largest component. Despite the lack of hard evidence, Republicans in Congress have used the case to raise questions about the Administration's policy of granting aid to Russia, and to renew attacks on the monetary fund as inefficient and perhaps unnecessary.
Mr. Podesta defended the Administration's Russia policy today, citing progress on arms control, defining Russia's role in Europe and starting to build a system of democratic capitalism. "We've made some progress," Mr. Podesta said. "We've had some problems. We're aware of the allegations of corruption."
In Moscow today, Russian officials denounced reports that they might have misused the international aid. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the reports came from people "who do not want our country to take on its role in the world as a great power."
Alexander Livshits, Russia's Ambassador to the Group of 8 industrial nations, said the previous studies by the monetary fund and PriceWaterhouseCoopers showed no misuse of money and that he did "not understand this game."
Part of the problem in resolving the questions lies with the way the monetary fund operates. Until now, money lent by the fund to Russia has typically gone into the Russian central bank. Although agreements between the fund and its borrowers include economic benchmarks that the country must meet to qualify for further aid, they do not specify precisely how the money is to be used.
In practice, the money becomes intermingled with the borrowing country's other foreign currency reserves, making it all but impossible to trace where any particular dollar or euro or ruble might go.
"By and and large it goes to the central banks, and it's their money to use appropriately," said William Murray, a fund spokesman. "We do not earmark -- we don't say, of this $1 billion, $600 million has to go to pension subsidies. We don't track individual transactions."

HEADLINE: Among 14 Charter Proposals: Delaying Special Election for Mayoral Vacancies

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Charter Revision Commission decided yesterday to put 14 proposed changes before New York City's voters on the November ballot but said that its most contentious initiative -- creating a special election to fill mayoral vacancies -- would not take effect until January 2002 if approved.
In proposing a delayed implementation of the special election, the panel veered from what had appeared to be its main objective: thwarting the mayoral ambitions of Mark Green, the Public Advocate, should Mr. Giuliani, who is considering a run for United States Senate, leave office early. 
 The 14 proposed Charter changes, which will appear on the ballot as a single-question referendum, include imposing a cap on city spending increases, creating permanent city commissions to fight organized crime and protect human rights, and making gun-free zones within 1,000 feet of schools.
At its final public meeting in lower Manhattan yesterday afternoon, the 15-member commission voted with minimal discussion or disagreement to include all 14 of its final recommendations on the ballot as a single question, which it forwarded to the City Clerk in time to meet today's deadline.
Randy M. Mastro, the chairman of the commission, said the proposals were substantive and important changes that "would do so much good for our city in the future." He expressed confidence that voters would approve the referendum.
But critics, including Mr. Green and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, continued to denounce the proposals yesterday as unwarranted and ill-conceived, and urged voters to reject them. Mr. Green, however, did praise the decision on special elections that would allow him to succeed Mr. Giuliani.
"This is a huge victory for New Yorkers who really care about fairness and democracy," he said. "The Mayor and the commission withdrew this foolish proposal to change this succession midterm not because they saw the light, but because they felt the heat of a broad civic-labor-elected official coalition standing united in opposition."
It was at Mr. Mastro's urging yesterday that the commission voted to include the special election proposal on the ballot this year, but to delay its implementation until 2002. If the referendum is approved, all of the other changes will take effect at the start of next year.
"I have searched my soul about this issue, and I have reached a conclusion we should delay the effective date of this proposal," Mr. Mastro said about the special election. "Concerns have been raised about this one proposal that have overshadowed the importance of our total body of work."
Recently, Giuliani administration officials had hinted that the panel would take this step, but Mr. Mastro's remarks were striking nonetheless because the Mayor, when he appointed the commission in June, had strongly hinted that his goal was to impede the advancement of Mr. Green, a political enemy.
By law, any Charter Revision Commission must consider the entire Charter, not just specific parts of it, and Mr. Giuliani's panel quickly developed a list of about 40 proposals. In a quick series of public meetings and hearings over the summer, that list was narrowed to 14 specific changes.
Critics accused Mr. Giuliani of appointing a commission stacked with supporters, led by Mr. Mastro, who is one of Mr. Giuliani's former deputy mayors, and of developing the other proposed Charter changes as cover for the effort to settle a political vendetta with Mr. Green.
Under the Charter's current provisions, the Public Advocate automatically finishes the term of any mayor who leaves office early.
Mr. Mastro said the criticism had distorted public perception and yesterday urged delaying the special elections.
Privately, however, advisors to Mr. Giuliani have said that they came to the conclusion that the Mayor, a Republican, had little to gain by Mr. Green's demise and, in fact, having Mr. Green in office might help the chances of a Republican candidate for Mayor in 2001.
Opponents of the Charter revision process, including a number of elected officials, good-government groups and labor unions, said yesterday that they would continue to oppose the ballot referendum.
Some of the changes, like making the Administration for Children's Services a permanent agency under the Charter, are merely technical and could be done by City Council legislation, critics have said.
Other changes, like the imposition of a cap on city spending tied to the rate of inflation, are seen by critics as efforts to restrict the Council's powers in favor of the Mayor.
"Based on the fact that much of the attention was focused on succession and not on the other proposals, we urge voters to reject the Charter recommendations," said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Speaker Vallone. "There hasn't been that much public debate or dialogue over the summer."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Malaysia EndsMost Controls On Investment

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Taking a major stride back into the world's financial mainstream, the Malaysian Government lifted a steep tax on the repatriation of foreign capital today.
The move is expected to uncork a stream of capital out of Malaysia, as overseas fund managers withdraw money that had been effectively locked in the country since the Government imposed sweeping capital controls last September. 
 Still, several analysts said they expected the outflow to be on the order of $1 billion to $2 billion, far smaller than earlier forecasts of $6 billion to $7 billion. As a result, the long-awaited easing of restrictions caused little commotion in stock prices here, which declined less than 2 percent -- an ordinary fluctuation in an emerging market.
Malaysia was also buoyed by new statistics reaffirming that its economy was in the midst of a remarkable recovery. The Government reported that the trade surplus rose to $1.52 billion in July, a 46 percent increase over the period last year, on the strength of surging exports.
"There are some unreconstructed enemies of Malaysia," said P. K. Basu, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Singapore. "But most of the people I talk to are eager to invest in the country again."
Malaysia's decision last year to impose controls made it a maverick among Asia's economically stricken nations. While most of its neighbors adhered to the International Monetary Fund's prescription of open markets and high interest rates, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad turned his back on the West, even laying the blame for Asian ills on foreign currency traders.
Dr. Mahathir had relaxed the controls once before. In February, he replaced a moratorium on removing foreign money with an exit tax that penalized investors for withdrawing it in less than a year.
Malaysia has not lifted all capital controls: its currency, the ringgit, remains nonconvertible outside the country, with an exchange rate fixed to the United States dollar. Also, while investors no longer have to pay a penalty for withdrawing money, they will still be taxed on their gains.
As with the exit tax, the capital-gains tax is graduated to encourage investors to leave their money in Malaysia as long as possible. Profits on investments held for less than a year will be taxed at 30 percent; with investments held for more than a year, the rate will be 10 percent.
"I don't think too many people have capital gains on their Malaysian investments, but for those that do, it's a factor," said Bill Kaye, senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a Hong Kong hedge fund.
On the face of it, Malaysia's experience would seem to vindicate the 73-year-old Dr. Mahathir, who drew worldwide opprobrium when he imposed the controls last September. He said they were necessary to protect Malaysia from the destructive ebbs and flows of foreign capital that had plunged the country into recession and ignited a regionwide crisis.
Critics here and in the United States predicted that Dr. Mahathir would turn a nation that depended on trade into a pariah. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter removed Malaysia from its influential Asian emerging markets stock index. And foreign portfolio investment all but evaporated.
"Malaysia has chosen to become a heretic, a pariah if you like," Dr. Mahathir said in a speech then.
He further alienated investors and others by ousting and imprisoning his protege, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Mr. Anwar, who received a six-year prison term for what his defenders say were politically motivated corruption charges and is now being tried on accusations of sodomy, had advocated a more open financial policy.
As Malaysia has gradually loosened the capital controls, it has won back some of the skeptics. Last month, Morgan Stanley reinstated it on its index, effective next February. And prominent economists, including Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the controls had some beneficial effects.
By fixing its currency at a relatively low rate of 3.8 ringgit to the dollar, Malaysia made its exports extremely competitive. Its booming trade in computers and peripherals is the major reason its economic output swung from negative statistics to 4.1 percent growth in the second quarter.
"The pegged exchange rate is the key to Malaysia's export success," Mr. Basu of Credit Suisse said. "The predictability of the exchange rate allowed exporters and foreign direct investors to plan." He said the new rules could still put off investors. The capital-gains tax will make it difficult for fund managers to value their portfolios since they cannot calculate their profits beforehand.
Mr. Kaye is among those who refuse to put money back into Malaysia. "Who wants to be told the terms on which you can or cannot invest?" he said. "They're putting themselves at an enormous competitive disadvantage."
Indeed, Malaysia has attracted less foreign investment than South Korea or Thailand, even though its economy has rebounded at least as strongly as those countries have. But Mr. Basu said it was a sign of Malaysia's strengths that it attracted more than $1 billion in foreign money between March and July -- a period when it was not included in Morgan Stanley's stock index. He added that it would be a few weeks before experts could judge the magnitude of the capital exodus from Malaysia.
Dr. Mahathir, however, said to reporters today that he was confident the Government could withstand the outflows, which he estimated at $3 billion to $4 billion. It has accumulated $32 billion in reserves and is running a large current-account surplus, the broadest measure of trade. With exports booming, economists said that at least for now, Malaysia does not really need foreign money.

HEADLINE: Clinton Eager to Veto Tax Cut, Aide Says

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The White House chief of staff today urged the Republican majority in Congress to send President Clinton its $792 billion tax cut bill so that he could promptly veto it.
Congress passed the tax measure early last month, but lawmakers have refrained from forwarding it to the White House, where it faces certain rejection. During the current Congressional recess, Republicans have been stumping across the country for their tax plan, hoping to generate public support. The President and his aides have taken every opportunity to criticize the proposal as an unwarranted windfall for the rich and a threat to the booming American economy. 
 John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, pleaded with the Republican leadership this morning to release the bill "so we don't have to keep fooling around with the phony debate."
"We intend to veto it," Mr. Podesta said in an appearance at the National Press Club. "So send it down to us so that we can veto it and then move forward, putting first things first and seeing whether we can find some bipartisan agreement on these other major budget questions."
Mr. Clinton and members of Congress have been out of Washington for the last two weeks and there has been no movement on this year's tax-and-spending debate beyond the occasional rhetorical salvo like the one fired this morning by Mr. Podesta. Congressional officials said today that the leadership would send the tax-cut bill to the White House by the middle of this month.
The White House is clearly spoiling for the fight over taxes and spending to resume. Polling and political experience have convinced the President and his advisers that they hold the high ground of public opinion in the looming struggle.
Mr. Clinton has argued that projected Federal budget surpluses should not be given away in the form of tax cuts but rather "invested" in education, technology, the environment and an expansion of Medicare benefits, including prescription-drug coverage for the elderly.
The ordinarily camera-shy Mr. Podesta took advantage of a relatively news-free week in Washington by venturing out of his West Wing office to attend a crowded news conference at the press club. In his prepared remarks, he complained about Republican plans to pay for their tax cut in part through what he called "devastating" reductions in the Clinton Administration's proposed Federal spending for research and technology.
"This is a 19th-century budget for a 21st-century economy," Mr. Podesta said of the Republican spending plan. "One has to wonder whether the people designing these budgets spent too much time watching Fred Flintstone and not enough time watching the Jetsons."
Mr. Podesta said Congress had cut the Administration's request for civilian research and development spending by $1.8 billion from roughly $38 billion, and had cut $1 billion from the Administration's proposed $13.6 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Republicans also blocked a proposed $200 million increase in financing for the National Science Foundation, he complained.
Until now, American science and technology have enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Washington, Mr. Podesta said.
"But this year, the Republican-led Congress -- to make room for their risky tax plan -- is playing politics with science and technology funding," he continued. "They have proposed deep cuts in many important research programs. And in so doing, they are threatening the potential progress of innovation in America."
Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, said the White House was indulging in the luxury of sniping from the sidelines while Congressional appropriators tried to devise a budget beneath stringent spending limits decreed in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement.
"Every week another Cabinet officer or White House official complains about some part of the budget we've underfunded," Ms. Morra said. "We've done the best we can to prioritize spending under very tight caps."
She said the Administration's budget submission last January included $42 billion in tax increases and user-fee increases that Congress rejected, money that is not available for new spending on research, technology or anything else.
She said many of the research accounts that were cut were in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development that also includes money for NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ms. Morra said a majority of the committee's members decided to increase spending on veterans' health programs substantially, requiring offsetting reductions in research programs.
"It's about prioritizing," she added.

Marshals Seize Waco Tape At F.B.I. Headquarters
Attorney General Janet Reno ordered Federal marshals to the F.B.I.'s headquarters to seize a tape recording of voice communications between F.B.I. commanders and field agents during the tear gas assault at the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. Officials also said she had narrowed the list for someone to lead an independent inquiry. A1

Challenge to Republicans
John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, urged the Republican majority in Congress to send President Clinton its $792 billion tax cut bill so that he could promptly veto it and end "the phony debate." A22
 
Trouble for High-Speed Train
Amtrak's new 150-mile-an-hour express, which was supposed to start service between Washington and Boston this year, will be months late because the wheels on the passenger coaches vibrate at high speeds and are wearing out too quickly, the railroad and the builders said. A18

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Rose Sharply In August

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 1

 BODY:
In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced today that their sales soared in August, with the biggest growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the highest profits.
DaimlerChrysler A.G. said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States with a 2.8 percent increase. 
 General Motors said that its sales jumped 63.4 percent. But its sales in August of last year were severely depressed because a 54-day strike had just ended and dealerships had not yet been restocked with popular models.
Auto executives and dealers were jubilant about the strength of the market last month. "It was unbelievable, it was as hot as Texas," said Alan B. Helfman, a Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep dealer in Houston.
Monthly sales of new automobiles have long been an important barometer of the economy's health, because they account for 4 percent of the nation's economic output and because auto makers disclose sales immediately at the start of the next month. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his reputation as an economic consultant while working for the steel and auto industries in the 1950's and 1960's. He has watched auto sales closely ever since, although noting that the auto industry's role in the economy has diminished somewhat over the years.
Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor and now a consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said the soaring sales increased the chances that the central bank would raise short-term interest rates at the next meeting of its interest-rate policy committee on Oct. 5, particularly if other economic indicators showed the same strength as the August auto sales.
While the minutes of recent committee meetings show that the Fed keeps expecting consumers to become satiated with big-ticket purchases and slow their spending, Mr. Gramley said, "These auto sales say it is not happening."
In another indication of economic strength, the Conference Board, a New York business group, said today that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators had shown an increase of three-tenths of a percent in July. But the Commerce Department announced separately that construction spending was surprisingly weak in July, which could mean that the Federal Reserve's two small interest-rate increases this summer are starting to hurt the housing market.
But the rate increases seem to be having little effect on the auto market. "Demand has exceeded our expectations and everyone else's in the industry," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director of industry and market analysis.
Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing operations, said that the pace of sales actually increased after the Fed's most recent increase in short-term rates, on Aug. 24. "We closed 3 or 4 percent higher than we had forecasted in the middle of the month," he said. "There are a lot of people who have made a lot of money in the stock market, and it seems like they're cashing it out."
DaimlerChrysler also raised its forecast for auto sales next year, predicting today that sales would be a very strong 16 million vehicles, including heavy trucks. That would be a little less than this year, which is on course for a record 17.2 million vehicles, according to DaimlerChrysler.
Sport utility vehicles sold best last month, followed by pickup trucks, with cars and minivans trailing. Auto makers and dealers make their biggest profits on sport utility vehicles because demand has outstripped supply, allowing many models to be sold at full retail price with little discounting.
The introduction of new designs has increased competition in the market for midsize sport utility vehicles. But with DaimlerChrysler offering lower-cost leases on the Jeep Grand Cherokee this summer, sales shot up last month to the highest level ever, the company said.
Mr. Helfman said that while his dealership stocked a dozen models of cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, just one model, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, accounted for 100 of the 210 vehicles sold last month. If Chrysler, Plymouth or Jeep built an even larger sport utility vehicle, the size of a Ford Expedition, it would sell extremely well, too, he added.
"If we had a big one, there'd be another 30 or 40 sales -- man, we'd be eating caviar down here," he said.
Ford Motor is scheduled to release its sales figures on Thursday. Auto analysts predict that it will show only a small gain from a year ago, when Ford dealerships profited from the lack of inventory at rival G.M. dealerships. Without Ford's sales, auto makers' market shares cannot be calculated precisely. Mr. Ballew said that G.M.'s share should be "pretty close" to 30 percent, the company's target.
Nissan Motor, which has been struggling, reported a 7.7 percent drop in sales last month from a year ago. But Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, announced that August was its best month in 12 years, with a 9.1 percent improvement from last year, while Mitsubishi Motors said that its sales had jumped 42.8 percent. Volkswagen, which has been riding the popularity of the New Beetle and the midsize Passat sedan and wagon, posted a 33.8 percent increase in August sales.

HEADLINE: Serbs Driven From Kosovo Live Crowded and in Want

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KURSUMLIJA, Serbia, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Srbislav Bisercic, a competent, bluff and imposing figure who always wore a pistol when he ran the Podujevo municipal administration in Kosovo, is now a broken man, ashamed to be in a jobless exile and hunting for a cheap apartment.
"Yes, I'm depressed," he said. "How could I not be? I left everything down there, everything, my flat, my house, 20 acres of land, my cattle, pigs and tractor." 
 Stopped on the street, Mr. Bisercic is all smiles at first, but his mood quickly darkens, and at one point his eyes become red and wet.
"My biggest problem is being jobless, not having work," he said. "I get my salary, late like everyone else, but I don't know what the state will do with us, since they haven't made it possible for us to go back" home to Kosovo.
Kursumlija, a southern Serbian town of 14,000 people just 15 miles north of Podujevo, is now struggling to absorb 7,000 displaced Serbs from Kosovo.
With the school year starting, Serbs who had been living in Kursumlija's schools are being moved to a tattered local cultural center; thousands more live with host families or relatives or in any apartment they can find.
"Eighty percent of Podujevo's Serbs are looking for a flat here," Mr. Bisercic said. Most Kosovo Serbs are getting only 60 percent of their regular salaries from a state with a severe shortage of cash, its industry smashed by NATO bombs and 10 years of sanctions.
"Everyone is depressed," said Milivoje Mihajlovic, a Serbian journalist from Pristina whose parents now live here. "My wife says, 'I dream every night, and my dreams are in Pristina.' And I'm the same. I spent my whole life, 40 years there, and psychologically that's the biggest problem. Everyone asks everyone else, 'When can we go back?' "
Mr. Bisercic, humiliated and distraught, vows to return to Kosovo soon. Mr. Mihajlovic knows better. "It will take years, if ever, for the pressure to go out of Kosovo," he said. "Everyone needs to calm down, the Serbs and the Albanians." And both need to find less aggressive leaders, he conceded.
According to Vesna Petkovic of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, by last Friday 133,737 displaced Serbs and Gypsies from Kosovo were registered in Serbia, having left Kosovo since February, but the agency estimates the true total was 173,000.
In all of Yugoslavia, including Montenegro, 157,259 people were registered as displaced, and the total was estimated at 196,500.
With 500,000 to 700,000 other Serbs displaced from Bosnia and Croatia, Yugoslavia has more refugees and displaced people than any other country in Europe.
The policies and nationalist wars of Slobodan Milosevic have been the prime source of the refugee burden, which the United Nations refugee agency is working to relieve. This year, it will spend some $60 million to help those in Yugoslavia.
Mira Nikolic, Deputy Minister of the Yugoslav Ministry for Refugees, Displaced Persons and Humanitarian Affairs, said in a telephone interview that the refugees "need almost everything: food, shelter, beds, blankets, hygiene products -- it's better to ask what don't they need." She said that the agency was providing important help, but the biggest problem now would be fuel for heating in the winter.
Host families, with whom some 85 percent of the displaced are living, cannot afford the burden, Ms. Nikolic said, so Belgrade is looking more toward collective housing. The United Nations is ready to help prepare buildings for the winter with construction material, beds and heating fuel.
Ms. Nikolic and Ms. Petkovic agreed that Belgrade's policies toward the Kosovo Serbs had softened. At the beginning, they were urged to return immediately to Kosovo, and Belgrade refused to register them or let them enroll their children in local schools. That has changed, with nearly all students registered for school, but the displaced are encouraged to live near Kosovo and are actively discouraged from trying to settle in Belgrade, where they would be more visible.
Kursumlija is a pleasant but isolated town in the middle of an agricultural area. There is one large company, Drvni Kombinat, making wood products, but salaries average only 200 dinars a month, or $20 at the official rate of exchange. A beer at a cafe costs 50 cents, a sixth of the price in Belgrade. There is no cellular telephone service as there is in bigger towns.
At the shops, people buy 200 grams, or 7 ounces, of meat at a time. "If you buy a kilo," or 2.2 pounds, Mr. Mihajlovic said, "they think you're a millionaire."
If anything, the influx of Kosovo Serbs has pushed up prices a little here, especially for housing, and because the new arrivals are generally better educated they are often seen as a threat to the jobs of the locals.
In the small main square, surrounded by parking, there are many cars with license plates indicating that they are from Pristina and Podujevo and Pec and Prizren.
"I'm lost," said Caslav Bojovic, 44, who was the principal of a school for 367 children in Podujevo. "I feel terrible. I don't know who I am, where I'm going, what I'll do tomorrow."
"We are 'temporarily dislocated people,' " he said bitterly, "and no one cares very much for us, and there is no chance to go back."
He shrugged and said: "We all feel like this. Whatever I had was in my work of 20 years, and it's gone. I was on good terms with my Albanian neighbors. That hurts me, because my neighbors call me and say I should not come back, and I know they are right."
Still, he is angry that Kosovo's Albanians are driving out Serbs, no matter the provocation by others, under the eyes of NATO. "Why don't they indict Thaci as a war criminal?" he demanded, referring to Hashim Thaci, the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Mr. Bojovic is now looking for a building here to try to reopen his school, and says the local authorities are open to the idea. "I can't leave the kids," he said. "And we need to work."
Down the street, at the shabby Evropa Restaurant, the Kosovo Serbs line up, shamefaced, for a free lunch organized by the local Holy Trinity Church, with help from Belgrade and international organizations like the World Food Program. A section of the restaurant is set aside for the refugees, and Radovan Rajovic, the chef, provides a balanced meal, usually a meat and vegetable stew of some kind, salad and bread. Today, the choice was paprikash, a Hungarian-style veal stew that actually had chunks of veal.
The restaurant serves 1,000 meals a day to the Kosovo Serbs in a program that began Aug. 16, said Radoje Milanovic, the restaurant manager.
Registered refugees have cards that entitle them to the meal, and their names are checked off. But 80 percent take the food away with them rather than sit and eat in a group, Mr. Milanovic said. As they leave, their heads are down.
"I wouldn't come at first, but we have to eat," said a woman in her 50's who asked to remain anonymous. "Of course I'm ashamed."
Mr. Bisercic, the Podujevo official, had insisted that he would stay in Podujevo. But in the end, he left, on June 21, 11 days after Yugoslav forces pulled out in long columns from the city, creating a vacuum that NATO forces did not move in to fill.
"Those Serbs who stayed there are dead," Mr. Bisercic said. "I took three of the last out with me." United Nations officials in Kosovo confirm that only three Serbs remain in all of Podujevo, women too old and alone to leave.
Mr. Bisercic faults NATO for the vacuum of power, but he also considers the Belgrade Government erred in allowing one. "They should not have signed anything until they filled the territory with international forces," he said.
But asked if he blamed President Milosevic, Mr. Bisercic bristled, even more upset. "I voted for Milosevic," he said. "Don't touch me there."
Velisa Malevic, 37, was head of the Podujevo tax police. On the square, wearing shorts and flip-flops and a two-day beard, he said he and his mother and brother and their families -- 14 people -- had all moved here, where his wife was born. In Podujevo, they had two houses and an apartment, with 10 acres. But the apartment has been taken by Albanians and the two houses burned, he said.
"I get a salary but I'm not working," Mr. Malevic said. "That's the worst thing."
He said he dreamed about his life before. "It's the biggest wish in my life to go back." He laughed, then said sardonically of Kosovo's new rulers, "I believe in the United Nations and the United States."
He, like the others, insists that the Albanians of Podujevo were his finest friends and that he protected them as best he could. "The K.L.A. attacked the Serbs, and the Serbs defended themselves with guns, and then NATO came and disarmed the Serbs but not the Albanians, and that's the whole story," Mr. Malevic said.
When told how ridiculous his version would seem to an Albanian whose family was murdered by Serbs or who was driven out of Kosovo by force, Mr. Malevic laughed bitterly. "The Albanians are no angels," he said. "You in the West will find out soon enough."
His wife, Sladjana, worked at the Fagar factory in Podujevo. Here, she is back to being dependent on her father while trying to care for three young children. "I feel ashamed," she said. "It's very unpleasant."
She said the people from Kosovo were overwhelming the town. "The people here are more kind to us, since I was born here," she said. "But they are very distant with the others."
She buried her nose in the hair of her son, Lazar, 4, named after the Prince who led the Serbs in the famous battle of Kosovo in 1389. She lifted red eyes and said softly, "We had everything, and now it belongs to someone else."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Line Forming (Wealthy Bidders Only) for Jets

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Shhh. The Jets are being sold. The new buyer probably won't be chosen soon, perhaps not until the end of the season. But in the quiet fashion that was the hallmark of the team's late owner, Leon Hess, his estate is receiving interest from at least 10 suitors, including Charles F. Dolan, the Cablevision chairman; John McMullen, the Devils' owner, and Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir.
Last week, bidders deemed to be sufficiently wealthy received a confidential prospectus written by Goldman, Sachs & Co., the estate's investment adviser, that outlines the myriad reasons the Jets are an attractive investment. 
 The team is very likely to fetch at least $500 million, despite its lack of a revenue-rich stadium, a sweetheart lease at Giants Stadium or the possibility of playing in a new stadium until 2009. A strict financial analysis might yield a much lower price, but the temptation of buying a rejuvenated, New York market football team led by Bill Parcells (even though he may step down as coach after this season) will very likely push the price into the stratosphere.
"The analysis doesn't sustain the numbers being talked about," said one person who has received the prospectus, noting the revenues currently generated at Giants Stadium do not buttress a purchase of a half-billion dollars.
The record price for a sports team is the $800 million paid earlier this year for the Washington Redskins by a group led by Daniel Snyder. But Snyder will have the advantage of a flood of cash from the facility formerly known as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, which is entering its third season of operations.
If the Jets' prospectus is similar to the one issued late last year to sell the Redskins, and another distributed in 1993 to sell the New England Patriots, it will paint an exceptionally rosy portrait of a rare, maybe once-in-a-lifetime chance to join an elite business club of only 31 members.
"Opportunities to acquire professional sports franchises in general are limited," the Redskins' prospectus boasted, "and the opportunity to own an N.F.L. franchise of the reputation and caliber of the Washington Redskins is truly unique." It added that ownership lets one "become a prominent and influential member of the local and national political and business communities."
"Future appreciation potential," said the Patriots' document. And it pointed out that "season ticket sales increased 37 percent following the announcement of Parcells as coach."
Suitors will undoubtedly read about Jets' franchise history (but probably not about the Rich Kotite era), the National Football League's popularity (with charts), analyses of its collective bargaining agreement and its network television contracts, and several years of team financial statements. One person who read the Jets' prospectus said it mentions the prospect of a new stadium in the Jets' future sometime after the team's Giants Stadium lease expires in 2008, but does not indicate who would pay for it.
"If an owner can handle the short-term cash needs, in the long term, it will be a marvelous investment once he's in a new stadium," said Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a consulting firm. "Plus, it would provide a platform of influence in New York second only to owning the Yankees."
Stadium finances were crucial to those looking to buy the Cleveland Browns last year. But before suitors could examine the prospectus, they show their determination by paying the league a $150,000 fee, only half of it refundable.
"That's how they weeded out people," said Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland real-estate developer.
"We got an accurate picture from the book, where the stadium was the real impact," he said, noting the team would keep nearly all the revenues coming into the Browns' new stadium. "We knew what to expect, but in the end I wasn't interested; the whole thing was overvalued."
Al Lerner eventually paid $530 million.
The Patriots' prospectus was so optimistic that it did not mention the team's 2-14 record in 1992, but included a chart comparing its rebuilding program to the one initiated by the 1989 Dallas Cowboys, who recorded a 1-15 record in their first season owned by Jerry Jones and coached by Jimmy Johnson.
The star of the New England prospectus was Parcells, who was entering his first season of coaching the Patriots when the document was issued. His biography was the longest in the prospectus.
"With a stated goal of taking the Patriots to the Super Bowl," it said, "Parcells has put together a talented coaching staff of 11, 10 of whom are new to the team and eight of whom previously coached for the Giants."
Parcells took the Patriots to the Super Bowl in 1997 -- the prospectus didn't promise he would win it -- and his value to the Jets is so enormous that he could have been the cover boy of his current team's sale document.
The Redskins' prospectus, prepared by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, featured one undisputed star: Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, with revenues from its league-high 80,116 seats, 208 luxury suites, 1,506 loge seats and 14,959 club seats; the George Preston Marshall Lower Level, the Sammy Baugh Press Level, the Vince Lombardi Lower Suite Level and the George Allen Upper Suite Level; and the chance to sell the stadium name for millions of dollars for the 2000 season. With the Cooke name off the building, it is temporarily Redskins Stadium.
Stadium revenues and league economics built on broad revenue-sharing help power team sales. Teams like the Redskins, Browns and others that own stadiums or have leases allowing them to swallow nearly all the cash flow usually offer the best reasons for making enormous investments. The 31 teams equally share all network TV revenues and all money from NFL Properties, NFL Films and NFL Enterprises. Visiting teams receive 40 percent of gate receipts from each game.
The Redskins' prospectus describes several years of annual network TV payments for each team ($58.1 million this season, rising to $90.3 million in 2005) and per-team income from NFL Properties ($4.5 million in 1997).
For the 1998 season, the Redskins' combined team and stadium revenues were estimated in the prospectus to reach $141.2 million, with earnings before interest and taxes of $45.6 million. Ticket sales, and luxury box and club seat leases, concessions, parking and advertising expected to total $70.5 million. Last season, the Jets reaped only $22.2 million from the same areas.
When the Patriots were sold, the former owner, James Orthwein, did not own the stadium. In 1992, the team generated $48 million in revenues -- $33.2 million alone from TV and radio -- and posted a $10.6 million loss.
Robert K. Kraft, who bought the team, already owned the stadium and saw the value of purchasing the team for $158 million.
The Hess estate will benefit from selling a New York team that is considered a favorite to win its conference championship with the retirement of quarterback John Elway from Denver. There is no guarantee it will sell for $500 million -- a price is not likely to be mentioned in the prospectus -- but there will be no shortage of those peeking under the team's hood.
Dolan, who bid on the Browns and the Redskins, has the Jets' prospectus. So does McMullen. A spokesman for the real-estate developer Samuel LeFrak, and his son, Richard, said, "They are very interested and talks are going on."
An executive close to Lauder said he has made one inquiry about participating in buying the Jets and expects to make more.
One person reportedly interested is the Las Vegas billionaire, Kirk Kerkorian, who controls Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and MGM Grand. Kerkorian, 81, has the resources, but his casino ownership would put him at odds with the N.F.L.'s blanket prohibition against owner involvement in casinos. "Sports books are a loss leader for the casinos," said Eugene Christiansen, a gaming analyst at Christiansen/Cummings Associates, who added, "Football is by far the biggest sport for casino sports books."
If Kerkorian seriously pursues the Jets, he would have to present a structure in which his ownership is clearly separated from the casinos, or put in the name of his two children, said Greg Aiello, a league spokesman.

HEADLINE: In Panama's New Dawn, Woman Takes Over

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Mireya Moscoso, a schoolteacher's daughter who grew up in rural poverty, was sworn in today as Panama's President, the first woman to lead the nation. She will also become the first Panamanian President to lead a completely sovereign country once the United States withdraws its remaining troops and completes its handover of the Panama Canal on Dec. 31.
Those twin themes flavored her inaugural address, in which she repeatedly urged the Panamanian people to join her in eliminating poverty and corruption and in reviving the civic and moral spirit of the nation. 
 "At this moment," she said, "when we are about to end the century and our nation ends a historic era with the departure of a foreign presence, when we are ready with pride and dignity to usher in the new millennium with our sovereignty fully rescued, it is I, the first woman, who has received the trust of the Panamanian people.
"We begin to make real the hopes of thousands of Panamanian women over the centuries who, through generations of history, have nourished the hope that our society recognize their ability and merit, and share with all the men of this country the great responsibility of leading the nation."
Accompanied by her young son, Ricardito, she entered the National Stadium and raised her arms in a symbolic embrace of the cheering, flag-waving crowd of thousands of Panamanians from throughout the country.
The site was a gesture to the populist pillars of her Arnulfista Party, which was named after her late husband, Dr. Arnulfo Arias, who was elected and removed from the presidency three times.
Although her father was a teacher, her political education came during her marriage to Dr. Arias, a legendary -- and somewhat eccentric -- nationalist whose own beliefs included fascist and mystical leanings. She has often invoked his memory in her speeches, and her address today was filled with poignant references.
"Today is the beginning of the period of government he never had a chance to fulfill for the benefit of the poor and marginalized of Panama," she said. "How much I wish my mother and father and Dr. Arnulfo Arias were sitting in front watching this historic day. But I know they are in heaven blessing us and saying 'Mireya, keep on and fulfill the work I could not finish.' "
While the audience included heads of state and diplomats, notably absent was the man she defeated in last May's election, President Ernesto Perez Balladares, who left the Presidential Palace even before the inauguration.
The slight was the final skirmish in a summer-long battle marked by moves that could hobble his successor's administration, like packing the Supreme Court with his political allies and appointing associates from his Revolutionary Democratic Party to Civil Service posts.
President Moscoso, 53, leads the nation into its most important period as it takes over the canal and some $4 billion in surrounding property. Although the canal is a $700 million operation, it is not a windfall because much of that money goes back into operations.
Several companies have invested in tourism and other projects, but there have been suggestions that the United States should provide more help.
"We haven't tried to support them with a package of trade and investment incentives that will insure the transfer of facilities and land be done smoothly," said Bob Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University and former member of the National Security Council.
President Moscoso vowed to run the canal efficiently and safely, projecting an international image of stability. And she reminded citizens of their new relationship with the canal and of the challenges and opportunities of Panamanian ownership.
"On Dec. 31, at 12 noon, we will once and for all attain our true independence," she said. "From then on, we will have to go on a new path, one where we will have to provide all the elements of a national identity."
Her supporters have high expectations because of her promises to create jobs, ease poverty and deliver better social services.
In a country where more than a third of the population is in poverty, many voters became suspicious of government after her predecessor's policies of privatization and open markets resulted in little they could see, except for miles of new highways. Balladares left behind an unemployment rate of about 14 percent, $7 billion in debt and little cash to pay for Ms. Moscoso's platform.
Some foreign diplomats said she has only vaguely explained how she will translate her intense grass-roots appeal into a workable social and political program.
"She's very good at retail politics, in sensing the mood in a crowd," one said. "But don't talk to her about big policy details. She goes blank."
President Moscoso has said she will not privatize any more state-run enterprises, though few remain. She has also said she wants to raise tariffs to help farmers devastated by imports, but her ability to do so is limited by Panama's membership in the World Trade Organization.
She has suggested dipping into a $1.7 billion fund generated by her predecessor's sale of state industries, but her slim majority in the legislature may not prove strong enough to accomplish this.
While viewed as having the most pro-American administration in decades, the President has chosen a Cabinet of relatively young professionals with little government experience.
And they have been hampered by the departing administration's almost total lack of cooperation in any transition meetings.
But Roberto Eisenmann, an informal adviser on social issues, said she was focused on the task ahead and aware of the risks.
"A few months ago, when the euphoria of her victory was still present, I was in a meeting with people who were talking about the difficulties of governing with an strong opposition in the Assembly," Mr. Eisenmann said in an interview on Tuesday. "A loyal supporter stood up and said, 'Dona Mireya, remember you have the people!'
"With a serenity that was really remarkable she said: 'I have the people today. I could lose it tomorrow if we don't dedicate ourselves and work for the people.' "

HEADLINE: A Step to End Newark's Chapter in High-Rise Public Housing Projects

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Built in 1959, the seven hulking 13-story brick buildings that are the Stella Wright Homes stand as a forlorn monument to another era of urban renewal. It was a time, said Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, when the nation was warring with itself over the impulse to integrate the poor and the impulse to isolate them.
Mr. Cuomo came here today to announce a $35 million grant to tear down the Stella Wright Homes -- Newark's last remaining high-rise public housing complex -- and help redevelop the site with town houses for low- and moderate-income residents. 
 Projects like Stella Wright, Mr. Cuomo said, were examples of the temporary triumph of occasional efforts since the first public housing was built in 1937 to isolate the poor from the rest of society.
"When public housing makes the statement of exclusion and isolation, President Clinton has said, 'Tear it down and don't repaint it, put in new windows or new fences,' " Mr. Cuomo said. "It had the wrong intent from the beginning and should be replaced with smaller, low-rise, low-density places where people want to live."
The announcement of the grant was applauded by Mayor Sharpe James as well as by tenants groups that have taken the city to court over conditions at Stella Wright and delays in building new public housing.
Mr. James has often been criticized for pushing harder for downtown development like the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the city's new minor league baseball stadium than for housing and neighborhood redevelopment. Today he called the Department of Housing and Urban Development grant "a great gift" that confirmed that "we have not forgotten the neighborhoods."
It most likely will be years, though, before Stella Wright is razed and replaced. City officials have yet to arrange over $100 million in financing to build the town houses or to schedule demolition of Stella Wright, where more than a third of the 1,179 apartments now are vacant.
While encouraged by today's announcement, Dave Weiner, a local labor leader who is secretary of the Newark Coalition for Low Income Housing, noted that plans announced by the city in 1994 to build housing at another site remained just that, plans.
"We like this program," Mr. Weiner said, "but our experience is that the Newark Housing Authority is always behind in construction." Last year his group persuaded a Federal judge to order the authority to hire a construction manager in an effort to speed up new construction and renovation of existing housing, which currently has a waiting list of more than 9,000 names.
Robert Graham, acting executive director of the authority, said the cost of rehabilitating Stella Wright to Federal standards has been estimated at $95 million. Stella Wright is plagued by broken elevators, trash-strewn stairwells and fortresslike fencing.
The site of the nation's longest rent strike among public housing residents, it is symbolic of tenant activism as well as the problems of the so-called vertical ghettos of towering projects. The rent strike, from 1970 to 1974, ended only after a Federal court forced both sides to compromise.
But today the officials looked ahead. Under the current plans, the complex's 764 occupied two-, three-, four-, and five-bedroom apartments will be replaced with 755 town houses of various sizes. About 300 will be rented as public housing and 284 sold to moderate-income families. The remaining 167 will be rented at fair market rates. Some of the money awarded today will be used to help obtain $119 million in private and other public funds for the redevelopment effort.
Five parks, two community centers as well as child care facilities are planned for the area around the redevelopment.
The grant, part of a program called Hope VI, also includes money to train and find jobs for about 345 residents of public housing and help prepare 500 young people for employment.
Atlantic City also received a $35 million award, which will go to demolish the 214 apartments in the Shore Park/Shore Terrace public housing development and help replace it with 600 town houses, 386 of which will be sold at the market rate. The HUD funds are intended to attract $154 million in other public and private funds.
Mr. Cuomo said that because the economy was so strong, the private capital needed for the redevelopment efforts in both cities was likely to be more readily available.
As he sketched out how public housing philosophy has evolved, the Secretary expressed fear that the current Republican-controlled Congress, with its plans for using budget surpluses to grant large tax cuts, would again force exclusion of the poor.
For one thing, he said, those proposals would give most of the surplus to those on the top 1 percent of the income ladder. But they would also cut $1.6 billion from HUD's budget for programs like the one announced today. For New Jersey that would mean a $50 million annual loss in HUD funds and for New York State it would mean a $200 million cut.
"This is a battle for the nation's soul," Mr. Cuomo said, referring to the fight over how to allocate the budget surpluses.

New Jersey Economy Described as Robust

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Jersey's already strong economy will add even more muscle over the next year, according to a report released yesterday by economists who advise Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
The Governor's Council of Economic Advisers, releasing a midyear report, upgraded an already rosy outlook for the economy. The group said all sectors of the economy were going strong. 
 Most economists gave Mrs. Whitman high marks for managing the good times, but said that outside forces, like the national economy, were the biggest reasons for New Jersey's success. Unemployment remains under 5 percent, state employers are on track to add up to 65,000 jobs this year, and prime office space is being gobbled up.
Joseph Seneca, a Rutgers University economist who heads the council, said even the long-troubled manufacturing sector was showing signs of stability.
"It's the best economy in a generation," Mr. Seneca said.
The economic advisers said New Jersey's gross state product, which measures goods and services produced in the state, would rise by 5 percent this year. The group also upgraded estimates on retail sales, personal income and consumer spending.
The council's early projections for 2000, however, show slower growth. Mr. Seneca said the state and national economies faced a problem born of their own success: low unemployment rates are producing a shortage of skilled workers. He said this might be one force that could slow the growth.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Investors Seek Bargains Despite Worries About Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks finished higher yesterday as bargain hunting overshadowed interest-rate jitters in advance of fresh statistics on the tight American job market.
Halting a four-session skid that had lopped nearly 500 points from last week's record level, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 108.60 points, or 1 percent, to 10,937.88, paced by a 211/16 -point jump in I.B.M., which has benefited this week from new contracts with Cisco Systems. 
 The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also climbed. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 11.45 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to 2,750.80. It is now up 25.45 percent for the year.
The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 10.66 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 1,331.07.
"It's really hard to identify sustainable trends in a week like this," said Timothy E. Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors. "Everybody's waiting for the numbers," mainly the job report for August, which will be announced Friday, but also the Labor Department's tally today of first-time applications last week for unemployment insurance. Factory orders will also be revealed today for July.
Timothy E. O'Grady, senior portfolio manager at First Capital Group in Philadelphia, said, "Inflation is still a potential issue, an item to contend with."
An initial belief that the Federal Reserve's Aug. 24 credit-tightening might be its final one of the year has been undermined, most recently by Tuesday's survey of corporate buyers who reported paying markedly higher prices last month.
Higher interest rates make stocks less competitive with bonds and make corporate borrowing more expensive and, for some, more difficult. Rates were narrowly mixed yesterday, edging up for longer-maturity bonds while money rates eased.
Drug stocks and those of paper and forest products companies made some of the day's biggest gains, the latter helped by upgrading at Paine Webber.
International Paper, one of 23 Dow blue chips to advance, rose 1 9/16, to 48 5/8, while Willamette Industries was up 3 1/2, to 43 1/8, and Fort James, Westvaco, Champion and Weyerhaeuser each rose more than a point. Georgia Pacific, now up 46 percent so far this year, climbed 15/16, to 42 5/16.
Among the drug makers, Warner-Lambert jumped 2 1/4, to 68 5/8, and Merck, Bristol-Myers and Schering-Plough posted gains of more than a point.
Retailing stocks, beaten up of late, rebounded slightly in most cases though J. C. Penney surged 1 7/8, to 38 1/8, while Sears lost 5/16, to 37 3/16.
The Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 10.66 points, or 0.8 percent, with AT&T, up 2 3/8, to 47 3/8, making the biggest contribution. I.B.M. had the next largest gain followed by General Electric, up 1 3/8, to 113 11/16. Intel was another sizable gainer, up 1 1/4, to 83 7/16, after the company introduced a new line of networking chips.
On the other hand, Qualcomm, the cellular company, was a significant drag, falling 23 1/2, to 168 11/16, after an analyst at Everen Securities warned of an earnings shortfall after meeting with management.
Juniper Networks was another casualty, sliding 24 3/4, to 180 1/4, after registering 5.75 million shares for a secondary offering, more than half from company officials.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Chinese Glass As Stepchild

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan

 BODY:
Antique Chinese glass is a stepchild in the family of Chinese decorative arts. There are only a handful of scholarly books on the subject, and few American museums have high-quality Chinese glass collections. (The outstanding exceptions are the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Corning Museum of Glass in upstate New York.) Much more attention is paid to Chinese painting, calligraphy and ceramics from ancient times through the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368 to 1644).
"Lack of knowledge has made people afraid to touch Chinese glass," said Mostafa Hassan, owner of a Manhattan gallery, Imperial Oriental Art. Mr. Hassan, a former specialist at Christie's, sells pink, amber, turquoise and "mutton fat" white examples of 18th- and 19th-century Chinese glass in his gallery, at 790 Madison Avenue, near 67th Street. 
 The market for Chinese glass has had dramatic ups and downs. In the early 1980's it was relatively inexpensive because there was little demand for it. By the end of the 1980's the market heated up and the prices for the finest examples increased dramatically. The stepchild status persists, however. As James B. Godfrey, a Sotheby's specialist, said, "Glass can be a whimsical market."
A few years ago two scholars, Claudia Brown and Donald Rabiner, tried to explain the prejudice against post-Ming Chinese glass. In "Clear as Crystal, Red as Flame: Later Chinese Glass," a catalogue for a 1990 exhibition at the China Institute in America, they wrote, "Particular disdain has long been reserved for 'late' Chinese art, that is, works of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)."
Ms. Brown, curator of Asian art at the Phoenix Art Museum, and Mr. Rabiner, an art history professor at Arizona State University who died in 1992, explained: "The obvious merits of Qing-period jade, enamel, lacquer and glass were sadly obscured by the belief that 'late' is but a euphemism for decadent, representing at best the triumph of technique over good design, and more commonly bearing witness to a notable decline in workmanship."
A coming show at Alvin Lo Oriental Art Limited, a gallery at 5 East 57th Street in Manhattan, may challenge such attitudes. Mr. Lo, whose father, P. C. Lu, was a renowned Hong Kong dealer, has been collecting glass for 15 years. On Sept. 14 he is opening an exhibition titled "18th Century: The Golden Age of Peking Glass," which includes 18 pieces, ranging from monochrome examples in egg yolk yellow, ruby red and opaline green with simple shapes (what is called "scholar's taste") to highly decorative pieces with multicolored glass overlays.
The Lo exhibition is timed to coincide with Asia Week in New York, a major period of sales of Oriental antiques. The Doyle sale is on Sept. 13. The "Art of Pacific Asia" show runs from Sept. 15 through 18. Sotheby's sale is on Sept. 15 and includes several pieces of later Chinese glass. Lot 10, for example, is a pair of 19th-century yellow jars with covers.
"Jars with covers always seem popular with people, because they like the shape," Mr. Godfrey said. "What is also compelling is the color. Yellow is the most sought after because it is the color associated with the Chinese Imperial household."
One lot at Sotheby's is a brush washer. Mr. Godfrey called it "a typical scholar's object, in that it is more subtle, simple and less complex." The estimates for the glass range from $2,000 to $10,000.
Christie's "Fine Chinese Furniture, Ceramics and Works of Art" sale on Sept. 16 will have little glass, except for a handful of small bottles.
Mr. Lo uses the popular term Peking glass because people associate Chinese glass with the Imperial Palace workshop and the commercial glass houses of Beijing. In fact the Chinese have made glass since about 700 B.C. It is just that glass apparently did not rate royal patronage until 300 years ago.
In 1696 the second Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi (1662-1722), established a glass house within the palace workshops, apparently after learning that a German missionary in Beijing, Kilian Stumpf (1655-1720), knew how to construct kilns, formulate glass batches and work the materials into forms.
The founding of the imperial workshop was "an event that would profoundly affect the history of Chinese glass for at least a century," Ms. Brown and Mr. Rabiner wrote. "Imperial patronage greatly increased the status of this material, whose principal function had long been the economical imitation of jade and other hard stones."
The palace workshops grew productive and glass became very fashionable, both inside the court and out. Mr. Stumpf's influence over the forms the glass took was short-lived. As Ms. Brown and Mr. Rabiner wrote in the Phoenix Art Museum catalogue for the 1987 show "Chinese Glass of the Qing Dynasty: 1644-1911": "However much technical assistance the European craftsmen may have lent, few surviving pieces of Chinese glass owe a discernible debt to European styles." What happened in fact was just the opposite. By the time of the Qianlong Empire (1736-1795), the Chinese were making glass in the shapes of traditional Chinese pots, vases, dragon-handled cups, even statues of horses.
"Glassmaking had long encompassed the imitation of hard stones," the catalogue continues, "but now, working side by side with lacquerers, enamelers and jade craftsmen, glassmen took inspiration from other crafts."
In the Lo exhibition, there are a pair of opaque green glass cups decorated with bas relief carvings of lotus leaves, birds, and flowering branches. Mr. Lo said that the carved glass cups were made to imitate carved jadeite. "Jadeite was always very expensive; it was a precious material," Mr. Lo said. "Peking glass was made to look like jade, lapis lazuli, turquoise and rose quartz. It imitated rubies, sapphires and emeralds."
Collecting Chinese glass can be a tricky enterprise. "I don't sell it because it's so easy to copy," said Ralph Chait, a veteran Manhattan dealer in Chinese art.
Mr. Lo concurred. "You have to buy from a reputable source," he said. "Some of the marks on glass are very deceiving. They could be from the imperial glass works, but they could also be marks added in the 20th century. To make matters worse, there are genuine pieces that have no marks. You have to have a basic understanding of what pieces would have been marked, and which would not."
Mr. Lo warned that there are fakes on the market. "In the early 1980's, when I started dealing in 18th-century glass, prices were so low that it wasn't worth faking," he said. "When prices shot up in the late 1980's, I began to see decorative pieces with marks that shouldn't have had any marks. The Chinese do a very good job at imitating old Peking glass."
Mr. Lo's prices range from $8,500 to $150,000 (for an unusual pair of glass horses). The show is to continue through Sept. 24.

HEADLINE: Don't Jettison Russia Just Yet

BYLINE: By Boris Nemtsov and Ian Bremmer; Boris Nemtsov is a former First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia. Ian Bremmer is a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute and president of Eurasia Group.

 BODY:
With the year 2000 bringing presidential elections in both the United States and Russia, the emerging scandal over the possible laundering of billions of dollars from Russia through the Bank of New York has, predictably, already prompted a politically tinged search for scapegoats. And in both countries, the leading culprits are the same -- the Democrats and the "democrats."
In Russia, President Boris Yeltsin's administration, through inept governance and suspected corruption, has managed to give reform a bad name. The opposition, frustrated in its efforts to break Mr. Yeltsin's power, has taken to blaming "democrats" and their accomplices in the West for the country's many troubles. 
 In the United States, the problem is different, but the tactic of the opposition is the same. A strong economy, victory in Kosovo and the nagging suspicion that Monicagate may have helped more than hurt the Democrats have left the Republicans in a quandary: how to set upon the Clinton record without seeming priggish, pharisaical and small? The answer of the moment seems to be to focus on the Administration's fascination with and support for a limping Russia, particularly the prominent role of Vice President Al Gore.
Is this the end of the entente between the United States and Russia? Should the West continue to provide aid? Won't International Monetary Fund dollars end up in the hands of Russian mobsters?
Before we write off the relationship, we should remember that the Russian economy is moving very slowly to a free market. The billions of dollars that have left Russia in the past decade will never come back if Western governments bury their heads in the sand, and they will come back only if and when Russia becomes an integrated part of the global economy.
Western governments should recognize this and focus spending where it can make the greatest difference. The West could finance institutional support through Western nongovernmental organizations -- NGO's -- and multinational corporations operating in Russia, keeping money out of the hands of the corrupt elite while providing the intellectual and physical infrastructure of a market-based economy. The I.M.F. could take the money earmarked for defending the ruble and use it to finance a micro-loan program aimed at building a middle class, creating a tax base so that the Government can meet it debt obligations (finally putting the horse in front of the cart). Russia's Soviet-era debt could and should be forgiven.
But at the same time, there must be accountability. The I.M.F. has made clear that it hasn't the ability to follow money once it goes overseas. The American and Russian intelligence communities should form a joint investigative body to track Western money -- through Russia, through the West and through offshore sources.
Yuri Skuratov, who was dismissed as Russian Prosecutor General earlier this year after pressing an investigation of Mr. Yeltsin's inner circle, has said that the Russians will not cooperate in such an effort. Certainly there is little reason for President Yeltsin to initiate it. But if an official proposal comes to Moscow from the Clinton Administration, it would be politically difficult for Mr. Yeltsin to say no.
The investigation now under way in the United States will, it is hoped, determine where the money that went through the Bank of New York came from. Our theory is that Russia's ill-fated treasury bills -- the G.K.O.'s -- will account for much of it.
The bills were canceled after the fiscal crisis in August 1998, but convertibility continued for several months. Russia's elites knew that they needed to get their money out fast, and as insiders they knew exactly what to do. Insider trading is deplorable, especially given its compounding effect on the long list of ills brought upon Russia's economy by its oligarchs. But there is a big difference between the politically savvy flight of capital and money laundering. Russia simply doesn't have the institutions in place to regulate these transactions properly. This should be a priority for the future.
All of this is very different from the allegations of corruption involving those in and around the Yeltsin family. Here America's role must be carefully balanced. The United States has been remiss by supporting the first democratically elected head of the Russian state instead of the processes and institutions of democracy. The corruption allegations surrounding the Yeltsin family should be discussed frankly and with vigilance. This does not mean Russian reform is at an end.
We should keep our heads about us. Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, has stated that in its initial scrutiny of the Bank of New York case, the I.M.F. has found no indication that loan money was involved. Russia's relationship with the West is much more important than presidential politics in either country. Let's not blame the D/democrats for that.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Refinancing Helps Co-op Despite Penalty Payment

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
Windsor Park, a robust 1,822-unit co-op apartment complex in Bayside, Queens, has embarked on an aggressive refinancing plan to free cash to make improvements and bring long-term financial stability to the enclave of 20 six-story red-brick buildings.
Last month, the co-op, set on 46 acres along 73d Avenue and Bell Boulevard, arranged with its lender, the Republic National Bank, to refinance its underlying mortgage, increasing it to $40 million from $29 million for 15 years. At the same time, the co-op locked in an interest rate of 7.07 percent, down from the 8.43 percent it now pays, days before rates moved upward. The new loan is to close in two weeks, said Robert P. Corso Jr., director of the mortgage brokerage division at Insignia Residential Group, which manages Windsor Park and represented the co-op in the refinancing. 
 Mr. Corso said the new loan would give the co-op enough money to pay off an existing $4.5 million construction loan, invest $3.5 million more to complete a continuing renovation program and establish a $300,000 reserve fund. But crucial to the refinancing, he said, is that it will let the co-op shift into the new loan a $2.7 million prepayment penalty for retiring the old balloon mortgage three years before it was to expire. Making the prepayment penalty a part of the new mortgage will allow the co-op to amortize that payment over 30 years, minimizing the financial impact on the corporation.
Windsor Park, which has one- to three-bedroom apartments of 650 to 1,400 square feet, is late to the refinancing trend. Many co-ops have already refinanced to take advantage of lower interest rates, which are still reasonable though they have risen a full percentage point since last November, said Ellen Bitton, president of the Park Avenue Mortgage Group, a Manhattan mortgage broker. The refinancing market is not as strong as it was in the last two years, but it is still active, she added.
Greg Carlson, president of the Federation of New York Cooperatives, said that some co-ops like Windsor Park that faced large prepayment penalties had hesitated to plunge into refinancing. "Sometimes it pays for them to refinance and take advantage of lower rates, but sometimes it simply doesn't," he said.
Lawrence R. Vitelli, senior vice president of the Insignia Residential Group, added, "Boards do not always readily see the benefit in paying a large sum of money today for a lower rate tomorrow."
He said that for Windsor Park, which wanted to complete a renovation program it started three years ago, the debate was whether to raise the needed funds for the work through a special assessment on shareholders, take out another construction loan at a high interest rate or refinance. What persuaded the board to refinance, Mr. Vitelli added, is that the new underlying mortgage, the result of three months of negotiations, is structured so it will not significantly increase the co-op's $12 million annual operating budget.
Meanwhile, he said, the monthly maintenance costs that co-op owners pay, which range from $325 to $930, will remain unchanged, and the owners will get a onetime tax deduction for their pro rata share of the prepayment penalty. For example, the tax reduction on a typical 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment will be $1,700, he said.
"It's an insurance policy," Larry Kinitsky, president of the co-op board at Windsor Park, said of the new loan. As part of the co-op's long-term strategic plan, the stability of a 15-year low-interest-rate mortgage coupled with the added improvements "will keep Windsor Park ahead of the financial curve and take it where it needs to be to remain competitive," he said. And it will also help increase the value and marketability of the apartments for unit owners, he said.
Windsor Park was converted from a rental to a co-op in 1986. Since then, even when the residential market fizzled in the late 1980's, it remained a financially viable upper-middle-income co-op where residents own 80 percent of the apartments. Of the remaining 20 percent of the units, which are owned by a Manhattan investment group, most are rented for $600 to $1,750 a month.
Still, owners watched the prices of their units plummet by up to 50 percent at the nadir of the recession in the early 1990's, with little upward movement through the first half of this decade, as the co-op market outside the plusher Manhattan neighborhoods remained dormant. But as the overall housing market has improved, prices for co-ops in Queens have risen by about 5 percent a year for the last five years, said Mr. Carlson, the president of the co-op federation, who also heads a real estate brokerage bearing his name in Forest Hills, Queens.
While sales have picked up, prices in many co-op buildings have not yet rebounded to where they were at the time of conversion, he said. "But in some of the better buildings in the better neighborhoods, units are selling for close to their original prices and in a few instances exceeding them," he added.
At Windsor Park, two-bedroom units that sold for an average of $75,000 two years ago are now selling for $115,000, Mr. Vitelli said. The added hope of the refinancing and, in turn, the renovation program, he said, is that those prices will rise 15 to 20 percent more, bringing the value of the units back to at least their original prices.
The $3.5 million renovation program calls for completing capital improvements, like installing new heating systems and roofs, as well as making cosmetic upgrades to the complex. They include refurbishing the lobbies and hallways in the buildings as well as enhancing the landscaping of the grounds of the community, whose amenities include outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts, which have already been improved. The work will take place over the next 18 months, Mr. Kinitsky, the board president, said.

HSBC's Deal For Republic To Be Delayed

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings P.L.C. said today that its pending $10.3 billion acquisition of the Republic New York Corporation would be delayed because of an investigation of Republic's securities unit.
United States and Japanese officials are investigating whether the securities unit inflated the net asset value of an investment fund owned by large institutional investors in Japan, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
 Republic, the holding company for the Republic National Bank of New York, declined to comment on the investigation. In a statement, it said that it was cooperating with investigators and that it had suspended the chief executive of the unit, James Edward Sweeney. Republic also said that it had replaced the manager of the futures department.
HSBC, which announced on May 10 that it would pay $72 a share for Republic, said in a statement today that it hoped to close the deal but that "as a result of this investigation, it may take longer than originally anticipated to complete the regulatory process."
HSBC, Britain's largest bank, said it was waiting for more details from Republic and investigators before completing the deal.
"Everyone wants to know what kind of exposure is involved and if it is material and all of the rest," said Richard Beck, a spokesman for HSBC in London. "We have to wait for Republic to update us with new information."
Shares of Republic fell 10.4 percent, or $7.185, to $62.1875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In London, shares of HSBC fell 2.6 percent, to 7.46, or $12.03.
Analysts said they expected that the purchase would be completed but were concerned that it might drag on for several months. The two companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of this month.
"It's unlucky timing for HSBC," said Simon Samuels, a banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in London. Indeed, earlier this week, talks between HSBC and the South Korean Government for HSBC to take control of Seoulbank fell apart.
Despite the problems that Republic might face, "the industrial logic of the deal is very compelling," Mr. Samuels added.
"It is likely that it will delay the deal but not scuttle it," he said.
The investigation stems from an inspection by Japanese regulators of a Tokyo office that is affiliated with a client of Republic's securities unit. Though Republic did not identify the client, Bloomberg News said today that the client was Princeton Economics International, a New Jersey company. Princeton Economics owns Cresvale International Ltd., which specializes in brokering and underwriting equities and bonds in Japan.
In May, Japanese regulators made an unannounced audit of Cresvale's Tokyo operations as part of a wider scrutiny of foreign securities firms.
Officials at Princeton Economics could not be reached for comment.
The chairman of Princeton Economics is Martin Armstrong, who is one of the largest individual traders of silver futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. He is also involved in currency hedging in Asia.
Mr. Sweeney, who headed the Republic securities unit, had had previous run-ins with regulators. In February, he agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission a $25,000 fine over accusations that the unit had paid rebates to an investment advisory firm. In settling with the S.E.C., the Republic unit and Mr. Sweeney neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

HEADLINE: Ford Reports Surprisingly Strong Sales For August

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales in August were even higher than expected, making last month the best August ever for auto sales in the United States and the best month in the 1990's after adjusting for seasonal variations in demand.
Ford posted an 8.1 percent increase in sales compared with the period a year earlier. Car sales leaped 19.2 percent, with the introduction of new models and the purchase of Volvo's car business. Sales of light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans -- climbed seven-tenths of a percent. 
 The rise in light-truck sales was particularly surprising because Ford sold an large number of light trucks in August 1998, when a strike against General Motors just ended.
Ward's Auto Info Bank, a market research service in Southfield, Mich., calculated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales in August was 17.76 million cars and light trucks. That made August sales the fourth-highest ever in seasonally adjusted terms, only trailing September 1986, September 1985 and December 1986. The expiration in the mid-1980's of tax deductions for certain car loan expenses produced a brief but unsustainable spike in sales as consumers raced to take advantage of the old rules.
August is traditionally a slow month in the auto industry. The actual number of automobiles sold in August this year was fewer than in May or June, but the seasonal adjustments for the May and June sales made those numbers look weaker than last month's sales.
Auto executives attribute the brisk sales to rising household incomes, soaring stock and real estate prices, low unemployment, strong consumer confidence, fairly flat prices for new autos and the introduction of innovative vehicles like the Lexus RX-300, which is a cross between a car and a sport utility vehicle.
Some auto analysts have expressed concern that rebates and other incentives may be contributing considerably to the boom in sales. But that view is beginning to shift.
"I'm beginning to believe there's something more structural going on," as rising incomes outpace increases in vehicle prices, making automobiles more affordable, said John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch. "I don't get the impression incentives changed a lot from July to August."
Sport utility vehicle sales reached their highest level ever in August, according to Ward's. "Consumer demand for S.U.V.'s has outpaced every other segment every year of this decade, and we believe this trend will continue," said Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service.
The acquisition in March of Volvo Cars accounted for less than half of Ford's improvement in car sales. Even without the acquisition, Ford's car sales rose 12.57 percent compared with those in the month a year earlier; if Volvo is counted in both years, car sales rose 12.47 percent. The introduction of the Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type sports sedans this summer and the earlier introduction of the completely redesigned Mercury Cougar have helped Ford, as have lower prices on the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans.
DaimlerChrysler, G.M., Toyota, Honda, VW and several smaller auto makers all announced robust August sales on Wednesday; Nissan posted slightly lower sales. G.M.'s car and light truck market share in August was 29.8 percent, barely falling short of the company's goal of a minimum of 30 percent.
Today, BMW said that, like Ford, it had enjoyed its best August ever. BMW's sales jumped 31.5 percent compared with those in the month a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Continues Its Retreat, Falling Another 95 Points

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Stock prices resumed their late-summer swoon yesterday, under the cloud of a hyperactive economy and nervousness over whether the Federal Reserve will decide to raise short-term interest rates again to keep inflation at bay.
Bracing for the Government's report today on the August job market, traders had to contend with word that the automotive industry sold cars and trucks last month at the fastest pace since December 1986 and with a warning by Edward Kelley, a Federal Reserve policy maker, that it was "premature" to rule out a third rate increase. 
 What is more Government reports that manufacturing orders rose by a rapid 2.1 percent last month, jobless claims stayed below the key 300,000 level, and that growth of productivity in the second quarter slowed to an annual rate of six-tenths of a percent depicted a growing economy with a risk of inflation ahead.
 "The compass continues to point in one direction," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. "People are increasingly worried that the Fed is not on hold."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.67 points, or 0.87 percent, to 10,843.21, nearly erasing Wednesday's rally and making it five losing sessions out of six since it set a record at 11,326.04 on Aug. 25.
The Dow's decline was in line with an 11.96 point, or 0.9 percent, drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which closed at 1,319.11. The Nasdaq composite did a little better, losing six-tenths of 1 percent, or 16.56 points to close at 2,734.24, even through it is heavily weighted with expensive high-technology stocks that are especially sensitive to rates.
"Interest rates going up puts a lot of burden on price-earnings multiples" and on financial stocks, said Paul McManus, research director at Independence Investment Associates in Boston.
J. P. Morgan, down 3 11/16, to 125 15/16, and American Express, down 3 1/8 to 135 7/8, placed first and third, respectively, in contributing to the skid in the Dow industrials. Sears, Roebuck, which slumped 3 11/16 to 33 1/2 after warning of a profits shortfall, was the second-biggest drag.
While 20 of the Dow's 30 stocks fell, these three issues accounted for 55 percent of the total drop. Analysts attributed a late rebound in the Dow, which had been down as much as 205 points at one stage, to traders covering short positions, which represent the sales of borrowed stocks, and to the activation of buy programs.
On the New York Stock Exchange, an unusually high total of 2,078 issues declined, while 874 advanced, a ragged performance that added to the general sense of market deterioration. Stocks making new 52-week lows, moreover, outnumbered those making new highs by more than five to one -- 118 to 22.
At the same time, analysts noted that activity remained on the light side, with 687.14 million shares changing hands on the Big Board, compared with 697.1 million during Wednesday's rally.
Other retailing stocks were hit along with Sears yesterday, reflecting fears of higher rates and a slowdown of torrid consumer spending. Dayton Hudson fell 1 5/8, to 56 5/8, J. C. Penney 1 11/16, to 36 7/16, and Best Buy 10 1/2, to 61 7/16, after personal-computer promotions failed to lift the company's quarterly sales as high as many had hoped. Wal-Mart, one of the few merchants to buck the trend, rose 1 1/16, to 45 11/16.
Republic New York tumbled 7 3/16, to 62 3/16, after disclosing governmental investigations of a client that in turn prompted HSBC Holdings to say this might delay its takeover of Republic.
Technology stocks were caught in the general downdraft but few of the losses were big. Rambus, however, slid 4 3/4, to 90 1/2, after Intel said it would use a less expensive competing memory-chip technology in response to demand by computer makers. Intel gained 1 7/8, to 85 5/16 to make the biggest positive impact on the S.& P. 500.
Stocks in major European markets fell by 1.25 to 2.5 percent, while Japan fell about 1 percent. Brazil's Bovespa, however, advanced nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Challenges for Boeing After Union Approves Pact

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
The Boeing Company's largest union voted overwhelmingly Wednesday night to accept a three-year contract, averting a strike that would have dealt a blow to Boeing's efforts to recover from a financial downturn.
Of the votes cast by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 44,300 of Boeing's 207,000 employees, 86 percent, or 26,842, were for the contract. A simple majority was required for passage. 
 Both the union and the company hailed the results, which headed off what would have been the third walkout by the machinists in the last 10 years. "With this contract, the company and the union must move forward together to capture productivity gains and significantly improve the company's financial performance and growth," said Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman.
That Boeing still faces large challenges was made evident yesterday, when the company announced that it was taking a $225 million charge in the third quarter after losing crucial campaigns to sell the F-15 jet fighter to Greece and Israel.
Earlier this year, Boeing announced a $45 million charge and layoffs of 7,000 workers in St. Louis after Greece chose the F-16 made by the Lockheed Martin Corporation over the F-15. The company said that the additional charge reflected money it had invested in parts for 24 fighters it hoped to sell to Israel, which also chose to buy the F-16 instead.
Boeing said in a statement that "there is a limited near-term market" for the F-15, though it hopes that the United States Air Force will order some this year, keeping the production line active for possible future sales.
The company also said that the latest charge and the new labor contract, which the company and the union said would make the machinists the best-paid workers in the aerospace industry, would not affect the existing estimates of future profits.
Analysts were uncertain whether the charge, which amounts to 17 cents a share, meant that they should lower their earnings estimates for this year, which average $2 a share, according to First Call.
"It could be that what Boeing is telling us is that somewhere else in the company there is another $225 million that we didn't tell you about," said Joseph F. Campbell, a managing director at Lehman Brothers.
Boeing has exceeded Wall Street expectations in each of the last two quarters. But those expectations are much diminished in the wake of production turmoil that began two years ago at Boeing's flagship passenger jet division. That has resulted in lackluster profits for the company at a time when demand for its jets has been at a record high.
Boeing plans to deliver a record 620 commercial airplanes this year but promises profit margins of just 5 percent on projected revenue of $58 billion. Some analysts and investors think that Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman, felt he had little choice but to give the machinists what they wanted because a strike would have disrupted the company's delicate financial recovery.
"This is a company that has come off a two-year disaster and doesn't want to upset Wall Street expectations," said Steve Binder, an aerospace analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
The new contract raises hourly wages for machinists nearly 16 percent over three years, to an average of $24.35 an hour. The contract also raises retirement benefits 25 percent and contains a one-time 10 percent bonus that amounts to an average of $4,400 a worker.
In addition, Boeing abandoned an attempt to introduce weekend shifts that would have reduced overtime payments, and it failed to get the union to agree to have its members help shoulder the cost of health insurance. The company also agreed not to lay off any workers as a result of a decision to contract out some work to other manufacturers.
Analysts and investors were not too concerned about the increased wages, a large portion of which will be passed on to Boeing's airline customers in the form of escalation clauses in their sales contracts. But they worried that by giving in to the union on the issue of weekend work and subcontracting, Mr. Condit had forsaken two important tools the company needed to increase its efficiency as he has promised to do.
"On the surface this pact seems to limit Boeing's ability to achieve large productivity gains," Mr. Binder said.
The union, on the other hand, had exactly the opposite concerns. While the leaders strongly endorsed the new contract, which Boeing submitted early on Saturday, they were disappointed that they did not get more firm job guarantees from the company.
An opposition faction within the union picked up on that theme and campaigned against ratification, complaining that the negotiators did not secure strong enough guarantees of job security and did not win cost-of-living increases for retirees.
But in the end, most union members thought that the offer was the best deal they were going to get without enduring a costly walkout.

HEADLINE: Data on Jobs And Factories Raise Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The nation's factories are humming and jobs appear to be plentiful, new Government data released today showed, adding to investor fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again.
Reports on manufacturing orders, jobless claims and productivity depicted the economy as growing at a solid clip but led some economists to warn of potential higher inflation. 
 Orders for factory-made goods rose by 2.1 percent in July, the fastest pace this year, the Commerce Department said. The Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits stayed below the key 300,000 level for the sixth consecutive week, signaling a strong job market.
Separately, though, the Labor Department said the growth of worker productivity, which is considered crucial to holding down inflation in a strong economy, slowed abruptly in the second quarter while labor costs shot up.
"The picture that is forming about the economy is that growth is going to remain strong and that we may have already seen the best news on inflation," said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C. "In that kind of environment, it is likely that interest rates are going to increase."
Although the manufacturing orders and productivity numbers were viewed as rather backward-looking reports with the third quarter already nearing completion, they contributed to sell-offs on Wall Street yesterday. Another important factor was a Fed official's interview with the wire service Market News Service Inc. The official, Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor, was quoted as saying it was premature to assume that the Fed would wait until next year to raise interest rates again.
The Commerce Department's report on factory orders was the latest in a string of reports indicating that the manufacturing sector is on the mend after taking a severe beating in the last couple of years because of export-related problems.
"Manufacturing has gone from being at the back end of economic growth toward the front end," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh.
The Labor Department's productivity report showed that output per worker hour outside the farm sector rose at a revised annual rate of just six-tenths of a percent in the April-June quarter. The department had previously estimated growth at 1.3 percent. The second quarter's rate was much weaker than the 3.6 percent productivity growth rate recorded in the first quarter.
Rising productivity can help keep inflation low by allowing businesses to increase their output of goods and services without having to incur higher labor costs.
Over the last few years, productivity has been strong, but the second quarter was an exception to that trend. As a consequence, unit-labor costs in that quarter rose 4.5 percent, the fastest increase in more than five years. In the first quarter, labor costs rose eight-tenths of a percent. Most economists expect productivity, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter, to bounce back.

HEADLINE: Labor Day Drivers to Pay More for Gas Than in '98

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
As Americans indulge in the last great driving binge of summer, they are paying an average of 22 cents a gallon more for gasoline than they were around Labor Day of 1998, the Department of Energy says.
The average retail price for regular unleaded gasoline was $1.23 cents a gallon as of Monday, compared with $1.01 on Aug. 31, 1998, the department's Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. 
 Gasoline prices, which as recently as February were at an average of 90 to 92 cents a gallon, have risen 12 cents a gallon since June. The increases are being felt everywhere, although for a variety of reasons gasoline continues to be most expensive in the Far West and least expensive in the Southeast.
The American Automobile Association said that as of last week the average per-gallon price for unleaded gasoline in New Jersey was $1.17, compared with $1.32 in New York State and $1.37 in Connecticut.
In any event, the higher prices are not keeping people at home -- the Automobile Association expects nearly 35 million Americans to travel 100 or more miles this weekend -- but they have produced grumblings at the pump.
"They know that we have to use our cars, have to get to work," Daniella Gobert complained the other day as she gassed her 1985 Oldsmobile in San Francisco, where the price of regular unleaded has soared to more than $1.50 a gallon and the premium price is flirting with $2. "I don't believe we're getting gas for cheap, if that's what they're saying."
By "they," Ms. Gobert and legions of fellow complainers mean the big oil companies. And, yes, the oil industry says gasoline is still a bargain.
To Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron U.S.A., the complaints reflect two misconceptions. "One is that gasoline prices are high," Mr. Libbey said, "and the other is that we control all that. If we controlled them, they'd stay up. But they go up, and they go down."
The Automobile Association said the average price for self-service regular unleaded gasoline has simply returned to its levels of August 1996 and August 1997. The Automobile Association gets its data from the Oil Price Information Service newsletter, whose figures, because of sampling methods and timing, were slightly different from the Energy Department's. The association said the average increase from a year ago was about 18 cents.
Discrepancies notwithstanding, the trend is unmistakable, and people who work in or follow the oil industry offered several reasons. For one, prices often rise before a summer holiday, when demand goes up. More important, the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on March 23 to cut the production of crude oil by 3 percent effective April 1. And the cartel persuaded Norway, Mexico, Oman and Russian, four oil exporters that do not belong to O.P.E.C., to go along.
The O.P.E.C. countries were reacting to an abundance of crude oil that had driven down prices. Last December, American refiners paid just under $10 a barrel for crude oil, the lowest price price since the Great Depression when adjusted for inflation, according to Ron Planting, an American Petroleum Institute expert on gasoline-price fluctuations.
By June, United States refiners were paying $16 a barrel. The effect was being passed along the fuel chain, to American drivers. Now, crude oil sells for about $20 a barrel.
There has been grumbling even in Georgia where, despite the price upsurge, self-service unleaded gasoline cost only $1.09 a gallon in late August, the lowest average price in the country. "I don't like it," said Gregg Richey, who was gassing up in Atlanta. "Gas is a major expense in Atlanta, where you're commuting long distances."
One reason why Georgia has low prices is its tax of only 7.5 cents a gallon, the lowest state levy in the country. New Jersey's state tax on gasoline is 14.5 cents a gallon, New York's is 29.8 cents and Connecticut's is 32 cents, the highest in the country. (The Federal tax is 18.4 cents.)
California's state gasoline tax is 18 cents a gallon, and there is an additional sales tax of 7 cents a gallon. Californians pay some of the highest prices anywhere: $1.55 a gallon for self-service regular unleaded, according to the Automobile Association. Only Oregon, which has a state tax of 24 cents and like New Jersey does not allow self-service, had a higher average per-gallon price in late August, $1.56.
California's strict air-quality rules, which demand cleaner-burning gasoline that costs more to refine, also keep prices high.
Thomas F. Hogarty, an adjunct professor of economics at Virginia Technical Institute who has studied the petroleum industry for many years, said Asia's renewed economic prosperity, and the greater oil consumption that goes with it, have pushed up crude oil prices. So have several recent refinery fires and pipeline accidents in the Far West, which curtailed supplies in the region and reduced the oil available to other areas.
The American Petroleum Institute and the oil companies insist that gasoline is inexpensive compared with the price of the many others things people need. The Consumer Price Index supports their argument.
According to the index, the cost of a wide range of goods and services used in everyday life rose by two-thirds from a base period of 1982-84 to July 1999. In other words, a shopping basket of goods that cost $100 about 15 years ago would have cost $166.70 in July. But the price of gasoline was only 1.9 percent higher in actual dollars than it was about 15 years ago. The same amount of gasoline that cost $10 then would have cost $10.19 in July 1999.
Professor Hogarty thinks prices will remain fairly stable and could even decline again, as they typically do after a big travel holiday. Historically, he said, O.P.E.C. has had trouble keeping discipline among its members, some of whom (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait) have warred upon one another. If individual members cheat and produce more oil, there could be another glut.
On the other hand, he said, another war in the Middle East could send prices skyrocketing, or perhaps something closer to home: "God forbid a huge hurricane should hit some refineries along the Gulf Coast."

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Strong August Sales, but Sears Spoils Mood

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Attracted by trendy fashion items like inflatable dorm room furniture and embroidered blue jeans, back-to-school shoppers helped propel retailers to another strong month in August.
Sales in stores open at least a year, a crucial industry measurement, rose 5.1 percent in August, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index. While strong, the growth was a little slower than the torrid pace of the first half of this year. Analysts said the numbers indicated the beginning of a consumer slowdown, but nothing severe. "We have gone from a boom to what you might describe as the next notch down," said Richard Burner, chief United States economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But the fundamentals are still very good." 
 George Strachan, vice president for retail investment research with Goldman, Sachs & Company, agreed with that view. "Right now, we are running among the best results in 20 years if you take out last year's exceptional numbers," he said. "The consumer is still very healthy."
Despite the overall good news, shares of most retailers ended the day down, largely driven by unexpected bad news from Sears, Roebuck & Company. The retailer reported August sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent, but also said yesterday that it was lowering earnings expectations for the third quarter to a range of 63 cents to 67 cents a share. Analysts had expected Sears to earn 82 cents a share, according to a survey by the First Call Corporation. Shares of Sears fell $3.6875, to a 52-week low of $33.50.
The company, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., attributed the decline in earnings to softness in apparel sales and lower-than-expected margins because of heavy price- cutting. "We are selling a lot of merchandise, but not at full price," a spokeswoman for Sears, Peggy Palter, said. "Even new products were coming in and being promoted very quickly."
Analysts said the problems at Sears were not a reflection of a slowing economy, but a confirmation of the company's longstanding problems. The lowered estimate was announced in conjunction with a shake-up of top management.
Alan J. Lacy, who is president of Sears Credit, will also oversee the company's home services and E-commerce businesses. Julian C. Day, who has been chief financial officer since March, was named to the newly created position of executive vice president and chief operating officer responsible for finance as well as logistics and information technology. Mr. Lacy and Mr. Day will join Arthur C. Martinez, the Sears chairman and chief executive, in a newly formed office of the chief executive.
Also, Robert L. Mettler, the head of merchandising, resigned.
Several other department stores also fared poorly in August. The J. C. Penney Company reported that sales in stores open a year declined 3.2 percent, a slide that was greater than anticipated. Similarly, Mervyn's, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, had a slightly larger-than-expected decline in sales.
The discounters, which have done well throughout the yearlong shopping boom, seemed to get even stronger as the rest of the retail sector pulled back a bit. "The dichotomy just got exacerbated for August," said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers. "The consumer recognizes that in the price-value equation, value just got more important."
Wal-Mart Stores posted a substantial 8.7 percent gain, on top of a very strong 7.6 percent increase in sales in August 1998. At Target, the discount unit that accounts for more than 75 percent of Dayton Hudson sales, sales climbed 6.9 percent, propelling the parent company's sales up 4.9 percent.
Susan Eich, a Dayton Hudson spokeswoman, said the fashionable discounter had done particularly well in some home furnishings, like the Furry Cousin It Lamp, for the college-bound set, but that sales for younger children were still to come. "Ten years ago, a mom would do one big trip," Ms. Eich said. "Now a lot of parents are waiting until their kids are in school and seeing what other children are wearing."
Quick-and-easy fashion statements were also on the minds of consumers. Specialty chains did well this month.The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation was up 9 percent in August. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. rose 24 percent, on top of a 28.4 percent sales gain in August 1998.
In what is turning out to be the turnaround story of the year, Limited Inc., whose subsidiaries include Express, Lane Bryant and Lerner and which owns 80 percent of Intimate Brands, parent of Victoria's Secret, posted an impressive company-wide gain of 12 percent.
The real disappointment in the specialty store category came from Gap Inc. Although the company posted respectable sales growth of 8 percent, that number was powered by explosive returns at its Banana Republic and Old Navy divisions. Gap stores, which account for some 40 percent to 45 percent of the parent's revenue, actually had declines in sales of as much as 7 percent, while sales jumped by as much as 17 percent at Banana Republic and 19 percent at Old Navy.
"The weakness was in the Gap core business of basics," said Warren Hashagen, senior vice president for international finance. "The fashion business was stronger than expected, but we just did not have enough merchandise." He said Gap was working on "adjusting the assortment" for the rest of the season.
Shares of Gap have been down in recent months, but analysts are confident the chain will work through its problems and they have great faith in the track record of its chief executive, Millard S. Drexler. "I give management the benefit of the doubt because the Gap has been most adept at creating and re-creating brands," said Maura Hunter Byrne, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.

Jets Pare Uncertainties to Just One Spot

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Measurably stronger than they were a year ago, the Jets go into their final preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings on Friday night ready to show off the offense and defense that will start the season against the New England Patriots on Sept. 12.
But there is an interesting difference between this Jets lineup and the one from last year's exhibition finale against the Chicago Bears. While the 1999 Jets seem to have everything in place on the starting unit, last year's backup quarterback was better. 
 Remember? It was Vinny Testaverde. Glenn Foley was the starter. On Friday night, Rick Mirer will get a long opportunity to impress Coach Bill Parcells, who is now looking for a backup to Testaverde. Mirer could play almost a full half in his competition against Ray Lucas.
Except for positions farther down the depth chart, though, and the vagaries of injury, the Jets have rarely been so strong as the exhibition season draws to a close.
Against the Bears a year ago, Parcells was still not sure about his rookie free safety, Kevin Williams. Indeed, Williams did not last as a starter, and three players manned the position. Now the former Pro Bowler Steve Atwater is there.
At left guard a year ago, Parcells had his weekly second-guessing about the journeyman Todd Burger. Every week, he virtually threatened Burger with unemployment. Even during the final week of preseason, Parcells shifted Burger to right guard. Finally, when the season came to a close, Burger was let go.
Now an inexperienced left tackle, Kerry Jenkins, is at left guard. He is, however, a significantly more athletic and bigger player.
There was yet another player Parcells was unclear about last summer: place-kicker John Hall. Parcells brought in Brett Conway to challenge him, but Hall won the job, and his place-kicking improved during the season. Last Saturday against the Giants, though, he missed an extra point, prompting Parcells to say that a kicker should go through an entire year without missing an extra point.
Still, the strong-footed Hall will remain, unless Parcells completely loses confidence in him.
Friday night's Meadowlands fans will, however, see a shift in defense compared with last year.
Then, Pepper Johnson was the middle linebacker, and James Farrior and Mo Lewis manned the outside spots in a three-man alignment. The recently arrived Bryan Cox was not yet ready to become a major member of the team. When he did, his presence helped persuade the Jets to switch to a four-linebacker alignment.
That is in place now. Cox is on the inside, where his relative lack of speed is not a handicap. And while Marvin Jones -- who did not play last year because of knee surgery -- may be out Friday night with a sprained ankle, he should be back for the opener. Farrior will share an outside spot with Roman Phifer while Lewis is back in the position where he earned a spot in the Pro Bowl.
All the first-stringers will play at least a half against the Vikings, the highest-scoring team in National Football League history last season. Will next week's difficult opening games affect the way players are used or the play-calling against Minnesota?
The Jets play a rare home opener against the Patriots, while the Vikings visit the team that upset them in the National Conference championship game, the Atlanta Falcons.
Parcells has said that the Jets have not unveiled much of the offense they will take into the regular season. And with Mirer performing in two dozen plays after being a Jet less than two weeks, it is unlikely there will be much variety from the backup quarterback.
Even during Lucas's 4-for-4 passing in a smart 14-play drive against the Giants, he was not called upon to display the wide range of the offense. So despite being in such good shape, the Jets remain with a loaded question: Everyone knows their offense is outstanding, but would it be that good with Mirer or Lucas running the show?
A year ago, it didn't seem to matter as much. Foley had had a good preseason and Testaverde was sharp as well.
 
EXTRA POINTS
Both teams' coaches yield nothing in preseason. BILL PARCELLS's 44-16 won-lost mark with the Giants, the Patriots and the Jets is believed to be the best exhibition mark of any coach with 10 years in the league. DENNIS GREEN's Vikings are 23-11 since he took over in 1992. Both teams are 2-1 this year. . . . Clubs will cut their rosters from 65 to 53 by Monday. Parcells is still wondering about injured players he has not seen enough of: wide receiver CHRIS BRAZZLE, linebacker CASEY DAILEY and F-back BLAKE SPENCE. Any veteran who is on the roster for the opening game has to be paid for the entire season if he is cut. Thus, the emotional tug-of-war between Coach Parcells and General Manager Parcells continues into the weekend and beyond.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Time to Hold All Umpires Accountable

BYLINE: By Jack Curry

 BODY:
The four men strolled onto the field at Yankee Stadium, three clad in red shirts and one wearing a blue shirt, looking as anonymous as beer vendors. They toiled for almost four hours, were in proper position, performed as if they cared and were consistent. Besides Paul O'Neill's routine outburst, no one complained about the umpires, which is what should happen every day.
It is unfortunate that 22 major league umpires stopped working yesterday because it is unfortunate whenever anyone loses his job. There are emotional stories from suddenly unemployed people about sick family members, mortgage payments and children's tuition, whether they are umpires who resigned, truck drivers who angered the boss, or waiters who were laid off because their restaurant failed. No one revels in anyone else's plight. 
 But there is a positive that could and should emerge from the silly labor strategy that resulted in one-third of the umpires being released. The umpires have been humbled. They learned in an emphatic manner that they are not the Ken Griffey Jr.'s of their profession. They can be replaced.
"There are a smattering of guys who have the attitude, 'You can't do that to me,' " Joe Torre admitted before yesterday's game. "I don't like that. Any time you think you're bigger than the game, you're not good for the game."
It would be worthwhile if baseball instituted an evaluation system in which umpires were judged and held accountable for their work, like almost every employee in America. Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president for baseball operations, wants all umpires to be monitored as one group by Major League Baseball next season.
There should be no more laziness on shots sprayed around the park, no more inconsistencies on the strike zone, no more baiting of players by moving toward them to invite confrontation, and no more Tony Gwynn-like physiques. If these changes are made, the umpires will enhance their reputations and the game. The game is what matters, on the field, where the Yankees pounded the Athletics, 9-3, yesterday.
"My goal long term has been for baseball to have a group of umpires who are well respected for training, expertise and integrity," Alderson said. "We want our umpires to be regarded as the best officials in the world. Right now, that's not the way they're perceived."
Perception often becomes reality. While it is unfair to characterize all umpires as inferior, all it takes is one umpire's incompetence for an entire crew to be branded. If one ump does not run into the outfield on a sinking liner inches off the grass, all four look sluggish.
"If you're not going to care about it, take it home," Andy Pettitte said flatly. "It's too bad it affected people's livelihoods. But if anything good comes out of this, maybe it'll be an evaluation system. All we're asking for is effort."
Richie Phillips, the embattled head of the umpires' union, has said that baseball does not care about the game because it accepted the resignations of umpires with more than 20 years of experience. That is an easy remark for a desperate man to utter, but it is untrue.
Alderson cares. He thinks umpires should be supervised more strictly, wants to include off-season training and educational seminars as part of their job, and feels the mandated rotation of umpires in the post-season should be replaced by selection on merit. If an umpire is ineffective, Alderson believes, baseball should be permitted to dismiss him, just as in other jobs.
Baseball is trying to develop a computerized simulator that would enable umpires to practice calling strikes the way they are defined in the rule book. That sounds more appealing than the current behavior of some umpires who, one baseball official said, work just a few games each spring at their own discretion and then jump behind the plate rusty in April.
"One of the things I hope we can change is the image of the umpire," John Hirschbeck, one of the umpires who led the anti-Phillips faction, said recently. "The fans need to know we care about getting calls right and hustling on every play."
One umpire told an American League player that umpires who spend 10 years in the minors are like players who do the same and are not talented enough to be promoted. That is highly questionable, because there was little turnover among major league umpires before these resignations. But the umpire insisted his view was accurate and said all of the best umps were already in the majors. So the player asked, "How would we know?" The umpire had no answer.
O'Neill said he felt sorry for the departing umpires, and Mark McGwire was cognizant enough of Frank Pulli's last game on Wednesday night that he flipped him a game ball. It is a difficult period for some, but it is also an important period for baseball to improve the umpiring situation forever and make the game better.
"My feeling is umpires should be held to the same scrutiny as the rest of us," Torre said. "Managers don't do their job, they get fired. Players don't do their job, they go to the minors. Umpires don't do their job, I don't know what happens. I'd like it to be the same. Everybody put in a day's work."

HEADLINE: Bank of New York Dismisses Second Employee in Laundering Case

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

 BODY:
The Bank of New York said yesterday that it had dismissed a second employee involved in its investigation into possible money laundering at the bank.
The employee, Svetlana Kudryav tsev, was discharged for failing to cooperate with the bank's internal investigation into the suspected money laundering, a person close to the inquiry said. The bank refused to elaborate on the ouster. 
 Ms. Kudryavtsev joined the bank in 1994 and was an international bank associate in the Eastern European division in New York, a low level position akin to an administrative assistant, the person close to the investigation said. Ms. Kudryavtsev could not be reached for comment.
She was discharged six days after the bank ousted a vice president in the Eastern European division, Lucy Edwards. Ms. Edwards, who worked in London, was dismissed for "gross misconduct," said a person with direct knowledge of the dismissal, including the falsification of bank records, failure to cooperate with investigators and for never telling the bank that she was married to Peter Berlin.
Mr. Berlin had opened accounts at the bank in the name of a company called Benex. Federal investigators say at least $4.2 billion, and perhaps up to $10 billion, was channeled through Benex accounts at the bank over 18 months starting some time early last year.
Although little is known about Mr. Berlin, investigators say they believe that the money came from criminal activities, political graft and corporate embezzlement in Russia and that it was being laundered for figures in organized crime in Russia. Some of the money was also probably capital flight, Russian executives and American law-enforcement authorities said, secreted out of the country last year, when Russia faced a grave financial crisis and its banks and currency collapsed.
Press reports have speculated that some of the money may have been diverted from loans by the International Monetary Fund or from food-aid programs. But the I.M.F. and the United States Government said they had no hard evidence of that.
Mr. Berlin and his wife, who was born Lydmila Pritzker and emigrated to the United States from Russia more than 20 years ago, lived in the in the New York area until a few years ago, when the bank transferred Ms. Edwards to London.
Neither the bank nor any employees, including the two who were dismissed, have been charged with wrongdoing by legal authorities. According to Reuters, Ms. Edwards issued a statement yesterday through her lawyer in London in which she "strenuously denied" the allegations on which the bank based her ouster. The statement said that Ms. Edwards was "pursuing the remedies available against the bank, and we have notified the bank accordingly."
The statement did not say what the allegations were, and neither has the bank. A lawyer in New York for both Ms. Edwards and her husband, T. Barry Kingham, told Reuters, "Both Peter and Lucy firmly deny any wrongdoing."
Sorting out the exact sources of the money and the extent to which its movement violated any laws will take many months, perhaps years, American officials said. Layers of companies were used to disguise the origins and destinations of the money, and many of the companies were registered in places like the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and Antigua, which have strict bank-secrecy laws and few disclosure requirements.
American law-enforcement officials said the only hope that they had of eventually getting to the bottom of the activity at the bank was with the full cooperation of the Russian Government.
Another senior bank officer whom investigators say they are looking at closely is Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who was in charge of the Eastern European division in New York and worked closely with Ms. Edwards. The bank suspended Ms. Kagalovsky, with pay, after the allegations of money laundering became public on Aug. 19.
Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, a prominent Russian businessman, have denied wrongdoing. She and her husband own a condominium on East 47th Street in Manhattan. Contrary to earlier reports, the apartment has a mortgage, her husband, said last week in an interview in Moscow.

HEADLINE: A Vast Fortune, Liberal Views, a Political Dream

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
From the moment he began thinking about running for the United States Senate from New Jersey, Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, has been attacked by his rivals as too rich to identify with workers, too suburban to care about the urban poor, too Wall Street to understand small-business owners on Main Street.
But in recent weeks, as his campaign for the Democratic nomination has started taking shape, Mr. Corzine has been vigorously promoting himself as a rich but humble guy who can appeal to the party's core constituencies: women, blacks and union workers. 
 Indeed, the positions Mr. Corzine has begun laying out would place him solidly in the liberal wing of his party, roughly the same ideological ground held by his main Democratic competitor, former Gov. Jim Florio, and the man he wants to replace, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who is retiring next year at the end of his third term.
In a lengthy interview last week, Mr. Corzine, of Summit, said he would make health care, education and gun control his priorities in the Senate, and he offered strong liberal prescriptions for each: universal health care; heavy Federal investment in public schools to increase teacher salaries and reduce class sizes, and requiring all gun owners to be licensed and all guns to be registered.
"If we can do it for cars, we should be able to do it with guns," he said.
Mr. Corzine (the last syllable rhymes with "pine"), who is estimated to be worth more than $300 million, said he opposes the Republican plan to cut taxes by $792 billion over 10 years, adding that he sees no reason to reduce either capital gains or estate taxes.
He also made clear that he supports two fundamental positions of the party's liberal wing, the unabridged right to an abortion and protecting affirmative action. He said he opposes the death penalty, though he considers tough mandatory sentences to be good policy.
And while the former investment banker said he would not support repealing the North American Free Trade Act, as labor unions have demanded, he staked out a strong pro-labor position on the minimum wage. Not only would he increase it now, but automatically raise it in the future whenever inflation rose by a certain amount.
"I don't think there should be a political debate every year over whether it should go up," he said.
It is, of course, essential for a political newcomer like Mr. Corzine, 52, who has never run for office before, to establish his credibility with the Democratic Party's core constituencies, who tend to be more liberal than voters in general.
But Mr. Corzine's efforts to stake out strong liberal positions now could pose problems for him if he wins the primary and goes on to face the likely Republican nominee, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. In a general election, he will have to appeal to more centrist and even conservative voters, many of whom may strongly object to his positions on tax cuts, abortion and gun control.
In the interview at his downtown Newark headquarters, Mr. Corzine paused at the description of him as liberal. "I don't look at myself that way," he said. "I call it progressive."
But he said that he has been spending much time meeting with Democratic officials and labor leaders, trying to assure them that he is not some haughty "Wall Street mogul" who is trying to buy the election. As his aides say, he is trying to show that he is more Gray Davis -- the plain vanilla Democrat who was elected governor of California last year -- than Al Checchi, a multimillionaire businessman who spent some $40 million of his own money in losing the same race.
"People expect somebody in pinstripes with an element of arrogance," he said. "I've tried to show I'm sincere about wanting this."
But Mr. Corzine has made clear that he will spend as much of his own fortune as necessary to be competitive. (He is a lukewarm supporter of the Democratic proposals for campaign finance reform, saying the real way to reduce the influence of money on politics is to give candidates free time on television to publicize their positions on issues.)
Already, he has retained several well-known, and high-priced, Democratic consultants, including Robert Shrum to handle the news media, and Doug Schoen to do his polling. He has rented an entire floor in a Newark office building, though he currently has only enough workers to fill a small part of it. And he has vowed to raise at least $100,000 to help the Democrats retake the State Assembly.
Still, with his low-key, soft-spoken manner, Mr. Corzine does not fit the stereotypes of either a rich banker or a slick politician, which may help him bond with individual voters in small group settings. But it is not clear whether his laid-back style will be effective on television or before large groups.
It is also not clear how well Mr. Corzine will handle the stress of running against a rough-and-tumble politician like Mr. Florio.
Reporters have already begun receiving anonymous letters accusing Mr. Corzine of dodging the draft, not voting in some elections and causing thousands of workers to be laid off by engineering mergers and acquisitions.
"I think the most important thing for me to try to do is distinguish myself by holding the high ground," Mr. Corzine said. "On the other hand, if people are trying to throw knock-out punches and hit below the waist, I am going to behave differently."
Mr. Corzine said he thinks Mr. Florio's supporters have already delivered some low blows, particularly by accusing him of joining the Marine Corps Reserve to avoid fighting in Vietnam.
Mr. Corzine said that he did not want to go through the draft because it would have forced him to leave his wife for two years, just after they had moved to Los Angeles, where he was attending graduate school. Joining the Reserve allowed him to live at home, though it also required a longer commitment of six years.
But Mr. Corzine said he objects to being branded a draft dodger because he signed up fully believing that he might be sent to war, and was prepared to fight if called.
"I don't know why anyone would join the Marine Corps to get out of anything," he said. "I was not a big fan of the Vietnam War. But it was never a question of whether I had a responsibility to serve. And that's what has been implied."
Asked how he would differentiate himself from Mr. Florio, Mr. Corzine said he would be a more collegial and less negative leader. "I believe in leadership with a positive vision of what I believe," he said.
Mrs. Whitman, he said, will be vulnerable on several issues, including high property taxes, high auto insurance rates and racial profiling by state troopers. Mr. Corzine has criticized both Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman for not doing more to stop that police practice.
He also questioned Mrs. Whitman's consistency. "I wonder how clear she is on some of the fundamental issues," he said. "I see a stepping back from the pro-choice movement. I see uncertainty with regards to how we handle gun violence."
Asked if he would make Mr. Florio's unpopular decision to raise taxes in 1990 an issue in the primary, Mr. Corzine said no. "I don't want to debate 1990 economic policy when the year 2000 economic policy is what matters," he said.
"In fact, my greatest fear is that a Whitman-Florio debate would be about history," he continued. "I don't think we need that. We need a debate about a rapidly changing society."

$25 Million to Lure Technology Business

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
New York City will create a $25 million fund to invest in start-up technology companies as an incentive for them to come to the city, city officials said yesterday.
Telecommunications, biotechnology, Internet and software companies seeking first-round investments will be eligible for $100,000 to $1.5 million of financing, the city said. The investments will be structured as equity, debt or a combination of the two. 
 The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expects the fund to draw technology companies to New York, boosting the city's revenue and creating jobs for residents.
The city's Economic Development Corporation will review proposals and select the companies to receive financing. The investments will be approved by a seven-member board delegated by the Mayor and the City Council.

HEADLINE: Unsettling the Art World for a Living;
A Critic Resurrects Beauty as a Standard, and Finds It in Unexpected Places

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
The physical boundaries of Dave Hickey's world are clear enough. He lives in a nondescript apartment complex improbably called Country Club Towers, wedged in a triangle made by the Las Vegas Country Club, the Las Vegas Convention Center and the World Trade Center Hotel and Casino, a low-rent gambling hall with a line of faux Grecian statues in the front. He has a sunshine-to-neon, skyline-to-mountain view of that singular slice of the American landscape, the Las Vegas Strip.
But the parameters of Mr. Hickey's intellectual universe seem limitless. His gentle, nicotine-laced drawl drifts effortlessly from Rembrandt to Norman Rockwell, from Jackson Pollock to "Perry Mason," from Willie Nelson to Andy Warhol and back around to Robert Mitchum. He's a writer who learned to make prose by listening to the "long, lapidary lines" of Chet Baker's jazz trumpet, and he's a former Nashville songwriter and musician who once copied out the first 50 pages of "The Great Gatsby" "just to see what it looked like to have good writing come out of your typewriter." 
 In his 59 years he has owned one art gallery and run another, been an editor at Art in America and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, played in a band with Janis Joplin, dropped acid, snorted cocaine, swallowed speed and written short stories about dying old cowpunchers and mystic young gamblers. And now, as a tenured professor of art criticism and theory at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, he is a smiling eminence terrible of the art world, enrapturing admirers with his impassioned defense of beauty and beauty alone as an inherently valid way of judging art without the imprimatur of official authority -- and infuriating all manner of official authority for roughly the same reason.
"You can kind of divide the art world into those people who find that art's closest analogy is with literature and those who find its closest analogy is with music," said Mr. Hickey, a pink, portly figure in black sweater, pants and boots, emitting periodic pleural chuckles between the plumes of nonstop Marlboro Lights at his dining table one weekday morning. "And people like myself, who find it to have been with music, have been radically out of fashion for many years. You know, people are concerned with 'what it means.' I'm much more concerned with what it does." Or as he put it at another point: "I'm not interested in the intentions of artists; I'm interested in consequences."
"The cultural world is divided into those people who look at Raphael as if it's graffiti, and those who look at graffiti as if it's Raphael, and I prefer the latter," he said. "That is, if I address pop culture, I try to bring the full equipment of disciplined criticism. I'm willing to take it seriously." He added: "Having been around both worlds, I really never have found any moral distinctions. The distinction is the audiences they attract."
That attitude has not always won favor with his colleagues in the rarefied world of art academe, who have derided him as Satan and worse for questioning the received canonical wisdom of high art by veering happily into the cul-de-sacs of pop culture. But Mr. Hickey's iconoclasm and the sheer range of his polymath's perception have endeared him to legions of admirers, who have helped make his most recent book, "Air Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy" (Art Issues Press, 1997), a phenomenal success for its genre, with more than 20,000 copies sold. "Dave is the smartest person I've ever known," said his friend Christopher Knight, the Los Angeles Times art critic. "I'll say that without qualification." Then why has he so incensed some peers? Mr. Hickey's critics variously disdain his insistence that pop culture and high culture equally deserve critical inquiry, take umbrage at what they see as his unfair attacks on the academic establishment and admittedly envy his graceful prose style. But perhaps the crux of the criticism is that by trumpeting beauty as a theoretically objective and spontaneous universal gauge of art, Mr. Hickey is a retrograde.
Like John Ruskin and other Victorians, he chooses to overlook the view that beauty may be merely what the ruling economic and social elites say it is. In the process, his adversaries argue, he substitutes his own bad-boy outsider judgments for those of narrow-minded art professionals.
Amelia Jones, an associate professor of art history at the University of California, Riverside, calls such hubris unforgivable. "With the revival of an abstract notion of beauty, we return not only to Ruskin," she said, "but also by implication to the imperialist and exclusionary logic of cultural value that gave Ruskin and his contemporaries their social authority as arbiters of taste." Ms. Jones, the author or editor of several books on 20th-century art, was writing in a recent issue of X-tra, a Los Angeles-based art journal.
Similar intellectual debates bubble in fields from law to philosophy, and as Mr. Knight said of the anti-Hickey voices, "if Dave's right, they're way wrong.
"There is a huge academic industry that is predicated on all kinds of things that Dave opposes and does not believe in, like the whole politically correct routine of the last 10 years," Mr. Knight added. "That is something that drives Dave crazy, and a lot of his writing has been about trying to pull the rug out from under those ideas of academic norms. As Dave says, art is about the specificity of experience, and governments are about establishing norms which exclude."
Mr. Hickey's latest heresy -- though one endorsed by a roster of other art heavies -- is his celebratory essay on Norman Rockwell in the catalogue for an exhibition of the artist's work organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge in Massachusetts and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. It opens at the High on Nov. 6 and is scheduled to wind up two years later at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. In his optimistic essay, "The Kids Are All Right," Mr. Hickey parses Rockwell's "After the Prom," a highly formalized portrait of teen-agers on a date after World War II. In the canvas a smiling soda jerk sniffs the girl's gardenia corsage, and a grizzled Air Force veteran on the next stool casts a wry glance.
Mr. Hickey compares Rockwell's skills of composition to those of artists like Fragonard and David, and he discerns a spirit of tolerance and permissiveness in pictures more often seen as confining. He imagines, for instance, the prom couple grown up -- his chronological contemporaries -- "sitting around the campfire in some commune in New Mexico trying to recapture the golden glow of that night at the soda fountain."
"The interesting thing from a theoretical point of view about Rockwell is that in the history of artists' reputations, artists gain a kind of public vogue and then they're institutionalized, and the work goes into museums and it goes into books and the reputation survives there," Mr. Hickey said by way of explaining his own appreciation for "an exquisite maker of pictures."
"Now Rockwell never achieved that level of institutionalization, but for 30, 40 years after his prime, he still remains a creature in the public's imagination, you know, profoundly influential. The opening scene of every science-fiction movie in the world is a Rockwell scene. If you look at 'Independence Day' or anything like that, it's like, 'Here's Norman Rockwell and heeeere come the aliens!' Spielberg couldn't exist without Rockwell."
Mr. Hickey's own life has not been Rockwellian. He grew up bouncing between Texas and California, the son of a man who made his living setting up distribution warehouses for General Motors but loved to play jazz saxophone and clarinet. He committed suicide when his son was 11. His mother was a Marxist economics professor at Texas Christian University and "a part-time rapacious entrepreneur" who ran a family flower shop. Young Dave attended 13 grammar schools, left home early and entered Southern Methodist University in Dallas at age 15, majoring in engineering "principally because the engineering school was across the street from the Kappa Sig house and it was extremely convenient."
After earning an undergraduate degree in English from Texas Christian, he enrolled as a graduate student in linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin for much of the 1960's. "What I was doing was telling myself that I was a serious graduate student and what I was really doing was not being drafted," he says now. "The day that I turned 26 and was ineligible for the draft, I was totally amazed at the way my enthusiasm for an academic career seemed to dissolve." He and his first wife, Mary Jane Taylor, opened a gallery in Austin called A Clean Well-Lighted Place, representing young contemporary artists. He eventually he wound up in Manhattan, managing the Reese Palley Gallery in SoHo.
About a decade ago -- many late nights, freelance articles and a couple of relationships later -- he traded his vagabond life for health insurance as a faculty member at Nevada and marriage to Libby Lumpkin, an art scholar who recently stepped down as curator of Stephen A. Wynn's new collection at the Bellagio casino and hotel in Las Vegas. She is to join her husband on the university faculty next year. Mr. Hickey says he chose Las Vegas because he could eat at all hours of the night and he finds release in its lingering frontier air, describing it gleefully as "Dodge City built by Jews and Italians."
He is less thrilled with academic bureaucracy, acknowledging that he has been unable to fulfill his dream of having "some guy come up to me and say, 'Tony Two Fingers Tattaglia, dean of fine arts!' " Instead, he says, "Universities are universities."
It is clear that Mr. Hickey does not suffer fools, and for all his roguish charm in conversation, he leaves little doubt that he would be hard to live with.
"He's an incredibly interesting person to edit," said Gary Kornblau, his friend and editor at Art Issues. "I wouldn't call it easy." Mr. Hickey says his pet peeve is the "growing hegemony of the presumption that there needs to be consensus" in the world of high art.
"Being an art critic is one of the few professions in which one is actually paid for one's eccentricity, and paid to be disagreeable," he said. "In other words, if two art critics agree, there's no real reason for one of them to be there." He is galled by the idea "that there's a right-thinking world in art," adding, "I mean, most of us get into art to get out of that world."
He said: "I'm not a public servant. The presumption that you're a public servant and therefore you have certain obligations -- I mean, I'm an art critic, you know. I certainly strive to be elusive. And in a sense, the fact that you're doing this article means that my effectiveness is waning, simply because the curve has caught up with me."

HEADLINE: Labor Goes to Capitalism's Citadel, and the Sky Doesn't Fall

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The head of a movement that has often been the nemesis of business -- the labor movement -- did an unlikely thing in an unlikely place yesterday. He rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
Why did John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., put aside thoughts of class struggle and enter the hallowed halls of capitalism? 
 "We like to do what's counterintuitive," said Denise Mitchell, the communications director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.. "We've been delivering a lot of messages to corporate America about improving wages, health care and pensions, and we've also delivered messages about ways that all of us can cooperate more. We thought we might as well be where they are, if we're going to get their attention."
Some traders joked that perhaps Mr. Sweeney ought to be invited back to ring the opening bell every day because the stock market had a big day yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 235.24 points, or 2.17 percent.
The idea to invite Mr. Sweeney came from Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who has long believed in building bridges to many segments of the community. One reason he invited Mr. Sweeney, union and exchange officials said, was that the 600 runners, clerks and reporters of stock trades at the exchange are unionized. They are members of Local 153 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union, and not surprisingly, the union's president, Michael Goodwin, stood with Mr. Sweeney as he rang the bell.
They were enthusiastically applauded by the many union members working on the exchange floor. Afterward Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Goodwin toured the floor with Mr. Grasso, who was once a member of Local 153.
"I felt a little unusual being there," Mr. Goodwin said. "It's the first time in history that an American labor leader rang the opening bell. It's because Dick Grasso and the New York Stock Exchange have a new respect for the labor movement due to the movement's resurgence under John Sweeney."
But a stock exchange spokesman had a simpler explanation. "We did this in honor of Labor Day," the spokesman said, adding that Mr. Grasso was also mindful of the billions of dollars in pension funds controlled by labor unions.
One reason that stocks soared, however, did not exactly delight Mr. Sweeney: the Labor Department reported yesterday that job growth had slowed.
"That was the unfortunate part," said Mr. Goodwin, whose view of the news, as befits a labor leader, differed sharply from the interpretation prevailing on Wall Street. Many investors were heartened by the job slowdown on the theory that as a result, the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again this year in an effort to slow the economy.

HEADLINE: Moving-Madness Holiday In Nation's College Capital

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Every year, right around now, Boston finds its capillaries badly clogged by the bright, orange-striped bulks of what residents believe must be the greatest convergence of U-Hauls in the country.
At least one rental truck, driven by a heedless student, inevitably smashes its top into one of the low-clearance underpasses that booby trap roads along the Charles River. 
 "When the first one hits, we say, 'They're back!' " said Gary Larivee, president of the U-Haul Company of Massachusetts.
And the long-suffering neighbors of the city's nearly 90,000 students -- who give Boston its youthful intellectual flavor and make up almost one-sixth of its population -- are reminded yet again of why it is not only a blessing but also sometimes a curse to live in the college capital of the country.
Sometimes, said Eva Webster, a neighborhood advocate in the South Brighton section of Boston, a pocket of particularly heavy student presence, "it feels like it's some kind of sci-fi movie where everyone over the age of 25 is dead."
Until Labor Day weekend is over, only foolhardy motorists venture into student-filled neighborhoods like Allston-Brighton, Kenmore Square and the Fenway, and the nearby cities of Cambridge and Somerville, or those who do not mind sitting patiently as sweating young people empty the back maws of Ryder and Penske and Budget trucks. The drivers must also be ready to skirt the curb-side mounds of crumbling sofas, dead plants, beer-stained carpets and folded cardboard boxes.
"It's really like a swarm of bees coming in," said James Cahill, director of the code-enforcement police, who watch for trash violations. "And they do their thing and all of a sudden it's over. It's just an amazing influx in such a short span of time."
The city tries hard to maintain control. It shifts virtually all of its garbage code-enforcers to student neighborhoods around now, and has been issuing $300 tickets right and left, perhaps 100 a day, to landlords who let their trash get out of hand.
Mayor Thomas M. Menino warned landlords this week about trash disposal, declaring: "Every year, we welcome back the students to the city of Boston. But I don't want their return to be a nightmare for the people who live in the neighborhoods."
Too late, some in the neighborhoods say. The Allston-Brighton area, where an estimated 15,000 students live in four square miles, gets to looking like "a hurricane scene, with none of the houses destroyed but with debris everywhere," said Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association.
True, it will mostly pass in a week or so. But this time of the year, despite all the rosy appeal of the fresh, excited faces flooding town, also serves to highlight the problems that such a giant student population poses for a city, problems serious enough to merit a University-Community Relations Committee on the Boston City Council.
When the committee held a public meeting several months ago, said Brian Honan, its chairman, about 300 people came, compared with the usual 5 or 10 on other issues.
The total student population in Boston is estimated at 135,000, but some students do not live in the city itself; in the greater Boston area, students number approximately 250,000.
Boston proper has 32 colleges and universities, which generate an estimated $3.1 billion a year in spending. There are 33 more colleges in the suburbs.
"The students are really a double-edged sword in our neighborhood," Mr. Honan said of Allston-Brighton. "They shop and use the goods and services, so they provide an economic backbone with the tremendous buying power they have. But oftentimes their schedules do not necessarily jibe with those of people who have to get up at 6:30 in the morning to get to an office downtown."
The tension goes beyond schedules. The real estate market in Boston is blazing, and students' willingness to live like sardines and pool their rent money helps drive prices up. Their very numbers, too, increase demand and raise prices.
Then there is the problem of their transience: they have a reputation for being indifferent toward neighborhood esthetics and good relations, at least, compared with long-term residents, and their density can create garbage and parking problems. Transience also means less interest in pressuring City Hall for physical improvements.
"We have all the symptoms of extreme gentrification with nothing to show for it," said Ms. Webster, head of the Aberdeen and Reservoir Civic Association. "We are gentrified in terms of price, minus the usual quality of life."
As local institutions like Boston University and Boston College have grown over recent years, the city has been pressing them to build more housing for their undergraduate students. The results have been mixed. Boston University is completing a dormitory for more than 800 students; Harvard has just promised 288 new apartments for its graduate students, and other building plans are in the works. But universities tend to get more excited about adding new academic buildings than dormitories.
When they are asked to build housing, Mr. Honan said, "the typical response is that we're landlocked or don't have any more places to build buildings."
"But then we turn around," he said, "and they're building science buildings, academic buildings, new pools and gyms and stadiums."
City officials do say that the colleges' efforts to rein in bad student behavior off-campus have noticeably improved in recent years. Many issue instructions about everything from trash to late-night noise. The police, too, have learned the trick of arresting a few disorderly students at the start of the school year, and getting the message across, the officials say.
Of course, from the students' point of view, moving day is no picnic, either.
"Getting a U-Haul in this town was like the worst experience I've ever had," said Chris Lucca, a senior at Wentworth Institute of Technology. "You call to get one, and they tell you they're booked up two months in advance."
Other students reported that truck rental clerks simply laughed when they called this week.
Moving can get a bit, er, boisterous, too.
At times, Mr. Cahill of the code-enforcement police said, "you'll find things hanging in trees -- newspaper or clothing -- when they're cleaning out an apartment, but that's few and far between."
As for the apartment he was vacating the other day, Chip Baskerville, a Boston College student, said: "It's destroyed. There's like four different kinds of cereal on the floor."

Stanley Alexander Weigel, a retired Federal judge who had ordered California to improve living conditions in prisons and, earlier in his career, had defended professors dismissed for refusing to take a loyalty oath, died on Wednesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 93.
Mr. Weigel was considered a tough judge with a short fuse, but he was also known for his independence and his courage to render decisions regardless of their popularity. 
 He began his career in 1928 in San Francisco, handling antitrust cases. But in 1949 he took on a civil liberties case that many other lawyers had shunned because of its political implications.
Thirty-one professors had been dismissed by the University of California for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge. Mr. Weigel sued the university on behalf of the professors and won their reinstatement with back pay in 1952 when the California Supreme Court declared that a loyalty oath violated the State Constitution.
About that time, Mr. Weigel became friends with Pierre Salinger, the journalist and confidant of the Kennedy family. After Senator John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, Mr. Salinger took Mr. Weigel to meet Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was screening candidates for judicial appointments.
Mr. Weigel, who had served on the national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union. was a registered Republican.
In 1962, President Kennedy appointed Mr. Weigel to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
One case over which Judge Weigel presided began in the early 1970's when inmates in the maximum-security units at the aging San Quentin and Folsom prisons sued, claiming that living conditions were inhumane. The case would continue until 1984 when Judge Weigel ordered the State of California to make improvements.
The judge was also known for his leniency in sentencing draft resisters during the Vietnam War. While other judges would often send those convicted of dodging the draft to prison, Judge Weigel would routinely sentence them to community service or probation.
Stanley Weigel was born in Helena, Mont. He graduated from Stanford University in 1926 and from Stanford Law School two years later. He practiced law for two years before becoming a partner in the firm of Landels, Weigel & Ripley, now Landels Ripley & Diamond, representing corporations in antitrust issues.
Mr. Weigel also served two years as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II.
Another highly charged issue before Judge Weigel grew out of the eviction of tenants whose homes stood in the way of the Yerba Buena urban renewal project proposed by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.
In 1970, Judge Weigel blocked the replacement of the low-income apartments with hotels and tourist attractions.
He ruled that the developers had not done enough to find replacement housing for the displaced tenants, a decision that dismayed much of San Francisco's political and business community. In 1973, Judge Weigel worked out a settlement in which the tenants were provided new homes.
Judge Weigel reached senior status in 1982 but continued to hear cases until two years ago.
He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Anne Kauffman Weigel; a daughter, Susan Weigel Pasternak, of Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.
In a 1995 interview with The Recorder, a legal newspaper in San Francisco, Judge Weigel related how the Salinger-Kennedy connection landed him in Robert Kennedy's office and on the bench.
"Robert Kennedy was wearing a turtleneck sweater and had a football and threw it at me as I walked in the door, and I caught it," he recalled. "That's how I became a Federal judge."

HEADLINE: Indifferent to a Planet in Pain

BYLINE: By Bill McKibben; Bill McKibben is the author of "The End of Nature," which will be reissued this month in an updated 10th-anniversary edition.

DATELINE: JOHNSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
As the hot sun sets on this long, odd summer, you might try staring into the nighttime sky. Several times in the last few months, observers in the lower 48 have seen "noctilucent clouds," which develop about 50 miles above the earth's surface -- clouds so high that they reflect the sun's rays long after nightfall.
They're spectacular -- and they're also out of place. These odd clouds belong in far northern and southern latitudes, but global warming seems to be driving them toward the Equator. The same carbon dioxide that warms the lower atmosphere cools the next layer -- the mesosphere -- causing the clouds to form. 
 Sightings as far south as Colorado are a big event, according to Gary Thomas, a professor at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. "While they are a beautiful phenomenon," Professor Thomas told National Geographic's on-line magazine, "these clouds may be a message from Mother Nature that we are upsetting the equilibrium of the atmosphere."
Ten years ago, global warming was a strong hypothesis. Now, after a decade of intensive research, scientists around the world have formed an ironclad consensus that we are heating the planet. Almost daily some new piece of evidence appears; the weekly editions of the journals Science and Nature make "The Blair Witch Project" look like "The Baby-Sitters Club." Forget the piddling drought and heat wave that withered lawns and fields across the Northeast this summer. Consider the real news:
Spring comes a week earlier across the Northern Hemisphere than it did just 30 years ago. Severe rainstorms have grown by almost 20 percent, precisely what you'd expect on a planet where warmer air can carry more water vapor. A Navy sonar survey conducted this summer shows that the Arctic ice sheet is in many places 40 inches thinner than its normal 10 feet. Warmer waters have bleached coral reefs around the globe. Glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising.
The question is not what we should do. Though it's far too late to prevent global warming, it takes no special insight to deduce the policies that would slow it down. Stiff increases in the price of fossil fuels would quickly bring a new generation of renewable energy technologies to the fore. Raising fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks would end the trend to ever-bigger sport utility vehicles. And focused diplomacy and foreign aid could keep developing nations from sliding into our bad habits.
No, the question is why we've done so little. In 1992, President George Bush promised the world that the United States would emit no more carbon dioxide in 2000 than it had in 1990. The Clinton Administration instead watched with little apparent concern as our emissions surged more than 10 percent. Congress refuses even to consider the baby step represented by the 1997 Kyoto accords, which would return us to 1990 levels by 2010. The issue barely even crops up in the Presidential campaigns.
The reason, I think, is that we don't yet feel viscerally the wrongness of what we're doing -- not just the very rational fears about what it will be like to live in a superheated world but, even more, the simple shock that we've grown so large we can dominate everything. Earthquakes and volcanoes are the only "natural disasters" left. Everything that happens above the surface comes at least in part from us, from our appetites and our economies.
I used to wonder why my parents' generation had been so blind to the wrongness of segregation; they were people of good conscience, so why had inertia ruled for so long? Now I think I understand better. It took the emotional shock of seeing police dogs rip the flesh of protesters for white people to really understand the day-to-day corrosiveness of Jim Crow.
We need that same gut understanding of our environmental situation if we are to take the giant steps we must take soon. Go outside: try to understand that the sun beating down, the rain pouring down, the wind blowing by are all now human artifacts. We don't live on the planet we were born on. We live on a new, poorer, simpler planet, and we continue to impoverish it with every ounce of oil and pound of coal that we burn.
In retrospect it will be clear. A hundred years from now, people may well remember the 1990's not as the decade of the Internet's spread or the Dow's ascension but as the years when global temperatures began spiking upward -- as the years when rain and wind and ice and sea water began irrefutably to reflect the power and heedlessness of our species. But how bad it will get depends on how deeply and how quickly we can feel.
It depends on whether we're still capable of shock.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Ostrich That Roared;
Did Malaysia, Its Head in the Sand, Duck the Asian Crisis?

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Sept. 3

 BODY:
If you had not visited this city of dreamy minarets and dazzling skyscrapers before last week, you might wonder whether the Asian crisis ever happened.
On Tuesday, Malaysia's leaders dedicated the Petronas Twin Towers, a futuristic colossus that is the world's tallest building. As fireworks blazed and laser beams pierced the night skies, the Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, declared, "We need something to express our towering ambition." 
 Malaysia did suffer a humbling economic collapse, of course, as the half-empty towers attest. But with the country now showing signs of a robust recovery, Dr. Mahathir is exuding victory and vindication.
Unlike its neighbors, Malaysia chose to fend off the Asian typhoon by boarding up its windows. Drawing the wrath of the free-market West, it imposed sweeping controls on its capital markets -- suspending offshore trading in its currency and locking foreign capital in the country for a year.
Dr. Mahathir says the moves protected Malaysia from the predations of foreign currency traders. Without controls, he says, the traders would have caused wild swings in the currency, which could have decimated the economy and ignited social unrest in this multiracial society. Business people here initially balked, but most now rally around the Prime Minister.
"We did not implode as a society; there were no mass riots on the streets, as in Indonesia," said Francis Yeoh, an ethnic Chinese tycoon who is one of Malaysia's richest men. "It is not half-vindication, it is full vindication."
On Wednesday, Malaysia relaxed its rules on the repatriation of capital. Now, as foreign investors weigh whether to pour money back into Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir's policy is getting another hearing. Economists, fund managers, business people and even officials at the International Monetary Fund acknowledge that Dr. Mahathir appears to have won his risky gamble.
To be sure, most economists and policy makers still view capital controls with deep skepticism. They say that shutting off markets and freezing currencies can strangle investment and cause damaging distortions.
Hubert Neiss, director of Asia-Pacific operations at the I.M.F., said at a seminar in Tokyo this week that Malaysia's recovery had little to do with the controls. But he also said Malaysia should not be condemned for the move.
Other economists say Dr. Mahathir has proved that controls can be useful in dire situations.
"There was always a case for capital controls in principle during a crisis," said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wrote an influential article defending controls in Fortune magazine on the eve of Malaysia's announcement.
"The argument was that they were impractical -- that they would inevitably screw up the real economy," he said. "What Malaysia has shown is that they are actually more workable than everyone claimed."
Certainly, Malaysia's performance has confounded skeptics, who predicted the controls would deplete reserves and stop the economy in its tracks. After contracting 6.7 percent last year, Malaysia's gross domestic product rose 4.1 percent in the second quarter. The country's reserves, far from diminishing, have shot up 60 percent, to $32 billion, since August 1998.
"If you do not like or trust statistics, just visit the shops and restaurants," said a defiant Dr. Mahathir in a speech here this week. "Only, give yourself a little extra time -- because I am afraid the traffic jams have come back."
The Prime Minister also noted that relatively little capital has flowed out of the country since the controls were relaxed -- defying those who had said that Malaysia would be hit by wholesale capital flight on Sept. 1.
Critics say, however, that his arguments have a few holes. Thailand and Korea are rebounding even more quickly than Malaysia, despite having left their markets open and allowing their currencies to fluctuate. And while billions of dollars of foreign capital have not stampeded out of the country, that is partly because most of it had fled before Malaysia imposed the controls.
So the question remains: Was Malaysia smart or lucky?
"They got lucky because they put the controls on just as pressure lifted off the other regional currencies," said David N. Devine, a director at Overlook, an investment fund based in Hong Kong.
If the currencies in Thailand, Korea and Indonesia had continued to fall after Malaysia had imposed its controls, Mr. Devine said, Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, would have been overvalued. Such a situation would have undercut the country's exports and created a black market in ringgit.
In fact, the opposite happened. Because the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah rose while the ringgit was fixed to the United States dollar at 3.8 to the dollar, Malaysia's currency became relatively cheap. That made Malaysia's exports -- led by computers and peripherals -- extremely competitive.
"The country's exports were plummeting until August 1998," said P. K. Basu, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Singapore. "They stabilized in August and started roaring in September."
Critics said Malaysia had permanently alienated foreign funds -- the same people who bankrolled its economic development by pouring money into the country for much of the 1990's. And there are some investors who say they plan to steer clear of Malaysia, regardless of its newly relaxed rules.
"Essentially, you've got a Government that makes its own rules," said Henry Lee, the managing director of Hendale Asia, an investment fund in Hong Kong. "We've exited because we see a lot of problems there."
But an informal survey of regional money managers in Asia indicates that more people may think like Mr. Devine of Overlook. He said he would put money back in Malaysia, provided he could earn a decent return. "My view is that the investment community has a short memory," he said.
In any event, it is not clear that Malaysia even wants short-term capital to return. As part of its new rules, it instituted a tax on investment profits that heavily favors foreigners who leave their money in the country for at least a year. And Dr. Mahathir is hardly putting out the welcome mat.
"I know some foreign fund managers are pessimistic, but to me, it doesn't matter very much," he said after his speech.
Foreign companies with operations in Malaysia, like Intel and Dell Computer, have not been harmed by the controls. They were exempt from the bans on moving money in and out of the country. In fact, some executives say the ringgit's fixed-exchange rate made it a bit easier to do planning.
When Dr. Mahathir imposed the controls, he said they would give the country desperately needed breathing space to repair its economy. There was, and is, plenty to do: many of Malaysia's banks are insolvent. And its corporations are a catalogue of dubious business practices, prospering on their connections to politicians and plowing billions of dollars into reckless projects.
The state oil company, Petronas, spent $800 million to build the Petronas Twin Towers. Although they were completed in 1996, they are only now attracting tenants. Petronas is also the lead investor in Putrajaya, Malaysia's new capital city. A pet project of Dr. Mahathir, the city is being built from scratch for $5.2 billion in a palm plantation south of Kuala Lumpur.
While Malaysia has made a few strides -- whittling down the number of bad loans in its banks to a creditable 12.8 percent of the total loan portfolio -- analysts here said Dr. Mahathir's record as a reformer is paltry.
"He has abused this window of opportunity to save his cronies, rather than undertaking the reforms that are necessary," said K. S. Jomo, a political economist at the University of Malaya.
Professor Jomo is particularly critical of a recently announced plan to consolidate Malaysia's 21 commercial banks, 25 finance companies and 12 merchant banks into 6 large banking groups. The mergers favor bankers allied with Daim Zainuddin, the powerful Finance Minister, while punishing those friendly with the ousted Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
Malaysia's economic policy has been accompanied by Draconian political moves from the beginning. Dr. Mahathir dismissed Mr. Anwar, his heir apparent, the day after he announced the controls. Mr. Anwar, who had opposed the measures, was subsequently sentenced to six years in jail on corruption charges that his defenders say were trumped up. He is now standing trial on a charge of sodomy, which he denies.
Dr. Mahathir's heavy-handed treatment of his former protege unleashed a storm of protest in this normally placid country. While the street protests were not deadly as in Indonesia, they gave birth to the most serious opposition movement the Prime Minister has faced in his 18 years in power.
The protests also echoed abroad. In a report issued this week, Amnesty International, the human rights group, said, "Step by step, the Malaysian Government has undermined constitutional protection, weakened key institutions and put in place an array of restrictive laws that stifle public debate and dissent."
Dr. Mahathir responded by asking why Amnesty International did not investigate the behavior of currency traders. Such sarcasm is typical of the 73-year-old Prime Minister, who seems to delight in thumbing his nose at the global political and financial establishment.
In his speech, Dr. Mahathir reserved his most acerbic lines for the International Monetary Fund. He said the fund had worsened the crisis in Thailand, Korea and Indonesia by insisting on high interest rates and deep cuts in government spending. By shunning the I.M.F., he said Malaysia had avoided impoverishing its people and handing over its corporate crown jewels to foreigners.
"We have been able to achieve what others have achieved," Dr. Mahathir said, "without having to sell our family silver and precious heirlooms; without having to auction off our precious corporations to foreigners at fire-sale prices; and without having to bend or bow to anyone."
For all of Dr. Mahathir's claims, he has not swayed his neighbors. Thailand, Korea and Indonesia have left their markets open. Few Asian leaders even seem in the mood to debate the issue. The Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research group here, had hoped to draw officials from the region to a symposium this week on capital controls. Most declined the invitation.
If Dr. Mahathir was trying to be the pied piper of the emerging markets, however, it was scarcely evident in his remarks.
"We were and are fortunate that no one has followed or said they intend to follow Malaysia's example," he declared. "A heretic can be tolerated. But a heresy cannot."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate in August Again Dipped to a 29-Year Low;
Labor Market Was Tight but Wages Barely Rose

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Despite the Federal Reserve's recent attempts to cool the American economy, the temperature is still pretty hot.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the nation's jobless rate in August dipped once again, to 4.2 percent, the 29-year low first reached in March. 
 Employers added 124,000 workers to their payrolls on top of the 338,000 added in July. And a host of other measures -- from hours worked to the fraction of Americans who hold jobs -- showed that the labor market continued to boom.
"The labor market is tight and getting tighter," said Paul Kasriel, chief United States economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.
Economists at the Labor Department cautioned that both August and July payroll numbers were distorted because many factories and businesses that normally close in July to retool and allow workers to go on vacation did not do so this year. Since seasonal adjustment did not capture that departure from past patterns, hiring looked stronger in July and weaker in August than was actually the case.
"If you look at July and August together," said Tom Nardone, chief of labor statistics, "everything looks like it did earlier in the year."
Wall Street, which had been bracing for signs that the economy was even hotter, took comfort in the facts that the August payroll increase was not as large as expected and even more in the absence of any sign that wages were taking off.
Hourly pay rose a mere 2 cents in August, to $13.30. Pay had jumped 10 cents between May and July, frightening investors and helping prompt the Fed to raise rates twice this summer. But it is now just 3.5 percent higher than a year ago, an increase comfortably within the range of the last few years.
"This substantially alleviates concerns about another Fed tightening," said Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "We thought we were seeing an acceleration in wages, but now it appears that maybe we're not."
Investors celebrated with stock and bond rallies. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2.17 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index had its largest one-day point gain ever, 108.87 points, or 3.98 percent. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell from 6.13 to 6.03.
Employers have been expanding payrolls faster in the last two months than in the first half of the year, by 231,000 a month compared with 210,000 a month. That suggests that the economy has picked up steam since the spring when growth slowed to a mere 1.8 percent annual rate as a sharp widening of the trade deficit trimmed the nation's production of goods and services. A raft of recent reports, meanwhile, point to robust demand for everything from houses and cars to factory orders to exports.
"Nobody in his right mind would lower their G.D.P. estimate on the basis of today's jobs report," said Mr. McKelvey, who estimates that the economy is growing at more than a 3.5 percent rate this summer. "If anything, you could argue that you should raise it."
That leaves the Fed more or less in the same bind it has been in all year; namely, having to justify rate increases at a time when, despite rapid growth and a tight labor market, there is little evidence that inflation is breaking out -- especially at the consumer level.
Most of last month's hiring, as usual, took place in the services area, which already employs the bulk of America's work force. Service companies added 219,000 new jobs, only slightly fewer than the monthly average for the last year. Nearly 50,000 of those jobs sprouted in business services, many in computer and data processing. Hiring was strong at brokerage firms, doctors' offices, hospitals, law firms and all sorts of entertainment businesses, from movie theaters to amusement parks. But despite help-wanted signs in many stores, retailers hardly added to their head count. Retailers had added 99,000 workers to their payrolls in July. And while auto dealers and furniture stores kept on hiring, fast-food chains and other restaurants reduced the number of workers.
In the otherwise robust job market, there were some glaring weak spots. Despite numerous signs -- from rising materials prices to stronger orders and higher production -- that manufacturing was on the mend as economies in Asia and Europe recover and exports pick up, factory employment shrank by a sharp 63,000, more than reversing July's gain of 51,000. But Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cautioned against reading too much into the August drop. "The pace of manufacturing job losses has been much slower over the past two months than during the first half of the year," she said. Makers of cars, furniture, primary metals and electrical equipment all expanded payrolls.
Another soft spot was construction, which shed 29,000 jobs in August. Essentially, the number of construction jobs is no higher than at the start of the summer. Last summer, by contrast, 70,000 construction workers were added to payrolls. It is not clear, though, whether higher interest rates are crimping the demand for new houses, office buildings and roads. Hiring was exceptionally strong all winter and spring and shortages of both skilled workers and construction materials may be the problem.
The labor market continues to pull in workers who have historically suffered from high unemployment rates. Unemployment among blacks, Hispanics, women and workers with high school educations or less are all at or near historic lows. The Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes not just those who are job hunting but also those who have stopped looking, has fallen sharply from a year ago. And employment growth is outpacing labor force growth by a wider margin than last year.
"The reserves are dwindling," Mr. Kasriel said. "We're calling them up. That's good for people who are working and want to work. But we're running out of workers."
There is every reason to expect the labor market to stay tight. Businesses say they anticipate adding to their head counts. "Hiring plans are strong for the fall," said Terry Hueneke, executive vice president at Manpower Inc., one of the nation's biggest employment services companies and the sponsor of a quarterly hiring survey. "It appears to be fairly well across the board."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS -- Jobless Rate in August Again Dipped to a 29-Year Low;
Markets Rally, Reflecting Hope on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Financial markets made a volatile about-face yesterday, as stocks and bonds rallied on the news that the economy generated fewer new jobs than expected last month.
The news that only 124,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in August, well below the 215,000 Wall Street had forecast, allowed many investors to think that the Federal Reserve might not have to raise interest rates again this year in an effort to slow down the economy. 
 The central bank has already raised its target twice by a quarter of a percentage point. The second move, on Aug. 24, helped push long-term interest rates back over 6 percent, as investors suddenly began to worry that more Fed rate increases were in the offing because the economy was not slowing down enough.
But with such broad uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and inflation, it is impossible to say that this new mood will not change just as quickly again, especially if other economic data for August are stronger. Since Federal Reserve officials indicated in May that they were going to raise their short-term interest rate target, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone through five distinct selloffs and rallies and may now be entering its sixth.
"Is this another in the series of relief rallies after some ugly days over the summer, or is there some new fundamental news in the jobs report?" asked Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "I think it is a relief rally," he said.
The stock market followed the bond market higher yesterday. And the rally in both markets helped lift the dollar, which has been sliding recently, against the euro and the Japanese yen.
In below-average trading volume of 663 million shares, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 235.24 points, or 2.17 percent, to 11,078.45. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 38.13 points, or 2.89 percent, to 1,357.24. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 108.87 points, or 3.98 percent, to 2,843.11. It was the largest one-day point gain for the Nasdaq ever.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond leapt immediately after the release of the jobs report at 8:30 A.M and finished a pre-holiday half-day of trading up 1 17/32, to 101 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.01 percent, down from 6.13 percent Thursday.
The yield on the 30-year bond has crossed the 6 percent level more than a dozen times since June.
The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed interest rate moves, rose 6/32, and the yield dropped to 5.62 percent, from 5.72 percent.
The dollar, which was helped by the rush of foreign investors back into the bond and stock markets, rose to 110.05 against the Japanese yen, from 109.11 Thursday. The euro, the 11-country European currency, fell against the dollar. It finished at $1.0612, down from $1.0686.
Financial stocks, helped by the sharp decline in interest rates, and the shares of computer companies led the stock market higher, with J. P.Morgan up 7 7/8, to 133 13/16; American Express rising 6 1/8, to 142; Microsoft increasing 4 1/16, to 95 7/8, and Intel jumping 4, to 89 5/16.
While the fear of higher interest rates is making investors wary about the outlook for the stock market, the improved prospects for corporate earnings are keeping the major indexes near the top of their recent trading ranges.
The resilience of the market is exhibited in the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average is now just 247 points below its recrd high, while the Nasdaq index, with yesterday's surge, is just 21 points from matching its record, which was set on July 16.
Although the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its earnings in the third quarter would fall below expectations, it appears that growth in earnings for all companies in the last two quarters of the year will be quite strong. Coke's stock dropped 2 1/8 on the news, to 57 3/8.
A key reason for the strong corporate earnings is that the growth comparisons are to the last two quarters of 1998, when the global financial turmoil set off by the devaluation of the Russian ruble devastated the profits of many companies, including banks and brokerage houses. According to First Call/Thomson Financial, operating earnings of the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index are expected to rise 21.2 percent in the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30, and 21.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
One reason yesterday's investor relief might not last is that the August jobs figures, according to some analysts, are not as weak as they look. Job growth was lower than expected, but combined with the 338,000 new jobs created in July, the pace for growth is still strong. For the year the average is just under 230,000 a month, barely below the average of 249,000 a month for all of last year.
While there are economists who think the economy is showing signs of slowing, Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, says he thinks it is growing at a 4 percent pace in the third quarter, up from the 1.8 percent growth in the second.
If this is the case, the economy has probably not slowed enough from the 5 percent pace for the six months through March to satisfy the Federal Reserve.
"I continue to think the economy is very strong and inflation pressures are rising," Mr. Berner said.
But he acknowledged that some of his competitors think that the economy is slowing down. "There is a real vigorous debate going on about the growth and inflation outlook," he said. The August jobs data, he said, "will fuel the slowdown school" and "will give the Fed some breathing room and the market some breathing room." Fed policy makers are scheduled to hold their next meeting on Oct. 5.
One big question is whether this uncertainty about the outlook for the economy might keep the stock market contained in its current trading range in the near future even though the major indexes are so near their highs. Since the Dow breeched 11,000 on May 3, it has set five new highs. But reaching the latest record, 11,326.04 on Aug. 25, only added 2.8 percent to the Dow.

HEADLINE: Just How Uniform Must Uniforms Be?;
For Many Public School Students, It's a Struggle to Mesh The New Dress Codes With Their Own Sense of Style

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
Chanel Gilpin stood unsmiling as her mother cooed how cute she looked in her new school uniform: a blue, pleated jumper with a short-sleeved yellow shirt.
Chanel, who is in the fifth grade, was not upset about the jumper, which basically resembled a barrel with straps, but about the yellow shirt. She wanted to wear white. But only boys at Public School 9 in Brooklyn are allowed to wear white, her mother, Cynthia Malcolm, explained the other day while shopping at Cookie's, a children's clothing store in downtown Brooklyn that specializes in school uniforms. 
 "I agree with uniforms," said Mrs. Malcolm, a 42-year-old native of Jamaica who grew up wearing school uniforms. "Kids talk about name brands, but not everyone can afford them."
So while many New York City schoolchildren hunted for trendy cargo pants, wide-cuffed jeans and long skirts to wear when school reopens on Thursday, scores of students like Chanel looked through racks of button-down shirts, khakis and jumpers.
Under a Board of Education policy passed in March 1998, students at public elementary schools are required to wear uniforms beginning this fall unless their schools have chosen to opt out of the policy. Each school has broad discretion to create a uniform tailored to its own tastes. Parents at participating schools can submit a written request for an individual exemption for their child.
While students who fail to meet the uniform requirements cannot be suspended or sent home, they may be supplied with a reprimand or a loaner. To induce students to conform, some schools will provide banners and certificates for classes that have 100 percent compliance for a week, or offer pizza parties for those that comply for a month, said Philip Russo, a spokesman for the board.
So far, 163 of the city's 672 elementary schools have agreed to participate, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the board. But additional schools may join before Nov. 1, the deadline to notify board officials, she said. Schools that opt out of the program generally do so because of strong parental resistance.
William C. Thompson Jr., president of the board, who spearheaded the dress code effort, said he expected more than half of the city's elementary schools to have a uniform policy in place this school year. Last year, more than 300 schools participated in the program voluntarily, he said.
"I think it's safe to say that about 70 percent of the schools will participate," he said. "Our strong anecdotal experience is even where youngsters were at first resistant, they come to like them a great deal after they become required."
For parents like Chanel's mother, the new policy translates into savings. Mrs. Malcolm, an unemployed mother of three, hopes to get a job working in a school cafeteria this fall. She said she was pleased to get a break on the cost of clothes: uniform prices range from about $40 to about $100 for a complete outfit, according to a report by the city's Consumer Affairs Department that was released last week. Students are allowed to buy their clothes from any store as long as they fit their school's guidelines.
For other parents, the dress code saves them the headache of monitoring what their children are wearing to school. The mother of 8-year-old Sheena Fray prefers skirts, but Sheena's 16-year-old sister, Tracy, found a way to skirt that issue. While their mother sat at home, they picked out a pair of "skorts," a combination of a short skirt and shorts, and a cardigan. Tracy was prepared to take the heat.
"I don't think she will mind," Tracy said, admiring the outfit. "I know what it's like to wear a uniform, and I want Sheena to be comfortable."
Sheena, who lives in Canarsie and is a student at P.S. 244 in Flatbush, stood next to her sister looking pleased.
But in a city that defies uniformity, there are bound to be protesters. Robert Jackson, a longtime member of Community School Board 6 in Washington Heights, said that his 12-year-old daughter, Sumaya, would not participate in P.S. 187's uniform policy because students should be free of dress code restrictions.
"I'm not in favor of them, but if the wishes of the parents are that they want their kids to wear uniforms, then that's fine," he said. "If you look at the reasons for uniforms -- school pride, discipline, order and to avoid competition -- we don't have those same issues and concerns."
Sumaya, a self-described fashion plate who loves platforms, T-shirts and bell-bottoms, is grateful for the reprieve. As a student entering the eighth grade, she wants to be free to express herself.
"Everyone's different in their own way," she said. "Some people don't like looking the same as others. They like to look differently, so they wear other things."
Mr. Thompson, of course, disagrees with the Jacksons. He pushed the uniform proposal after visiting an increasing number of city schools that allowed uniforms but did not require them. Administrators cited the reports from schools across the country with dress codes: attendance was up, disciplinary problems were down and students seemed more attuned to their studies.
Educators in Long Beach, Calif., the first district in the country to adopt a mandatory policy, in 1994, say they are convinced that uniforms have had a positive influence on their 70,000 students, though no independent research confirms a link between uniforms and academic achievement.
"School uniforms bespeak authority," Carl A. Cohn, the Superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School System for eight years, said last week. "This is a system where the adults are still in charge. If you listen to anecdotal information from teachers, youngsters come to school more focused on the business of learning. That has to be a healthy sign."
Daniel J. Lipsman, 54, a retired high school and college teacher who lives in Washington Heights, filed a lawsuit last year to prevent his 11-year-old daughter, Angela, a student at P.S. 187, from even having to opt out of the policy. But the suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan claiming a violation of civil rights, was dismissed. Mr. Lipsman has filed an appeal.
Angela, in a telephone interview last week, argued that case: "Everyone is entitled to their rights, including kids. I don't think children should have to wear uniforms. If they want to wear them, fine. I don't think they should be forced to against their will. I will not wear one."
New York City, following the lead of cities like Long Beach, essentially hoped to avoid civil liberties challenges by giving parents the opportunity to opt out of the uniform policy. Just hours before the board voted, it took the "mandatory" out of the uniform policy.
"He lost the case right off the bat; he had no standing," Mr. Thompson said of Mr. Lipsman's suit. "The judge's comments were relatively strong as he talked about the benefits, even as he saw it, of a uniform policy."
The new dress code has prompted some stores around the city to devote a corner of their space to uniforms, as others stock up on dress code mainstays like white shirts and jumpers. But where the battle lines between parents and their children were once drawn over items like skin-tight jeans or extra-short skirts, they are now drawn over cotton-blend shirts with Peter Pan collars -- not exactly the first choice of a 9-year-old.
At the same time, uniform styles are not quite as staid as in the past. Cookies at the Fulton Mall, kente cloth jumpers were hung next to A-line skirts and skorts. Downstairs, in the boy's department, gray and black slacks hung neatly from racks.
Carolyn Bevans, the mother of three sons who attend P.S. 161 in Crown Heights, had her hands full the other day as they loped through the store while she looked for school emblems to sew on uniforms she bought the week before. Dorian, 9, Andre, 8, and Jordan, 6, said they were excited about the prospect of wearing uniforms of blue pants and yellow shirts.
"I like uniforms," said Dorian, who is entering the fifth grade. "They save my mother money."

Once Again, Coca-Cola Predicts Lower Earnings
Shares of Coca-Cola fell $2.125, to $57.375, after the soft-drink company confirmed Wall Street's fears that near-term profits will suffer, as improving unit volume remains a challenge for the rest of this year. Citing the lingering impact of halted sales in parts of Europe this summer, as well as sluggishness in other markets, Coke said unit case volume in the third quarter would increase only at a low single-digit rate. Analysts figure the increase to be about 2 percent, which is down slightly from the 3 percent to 4 percent they had originally estimated.
As a result, the company lowered earnings expectations by 3 cents to 5 cents a share. Including the product recall in Europe, which will account for 2 cents to 3 cents against earnings, third-quarter profits may be as low as 31 cents a share, in contrast to the 36 cents analysts had been expecting.

HEADLINE: State Election a Test for Germany's Governing Left

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: SAARBRUCKEN, Germany, Sept. 1

 BODY:
This gritty town is the home of Oskar Lafontaine, Germany's former Finance Minister, and of a slogan he coined that has proved less ephemeral than his brief tenure in the Government: "The heart beats on the left, and it's not yet listed on the stock exchange."
Mr. Lafontaine has gone, from Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's Government and from German politics. But in this coal and steel producing area with a strong labor union tradition, the conviction that Social Democracy must stand for solidarity, for workers' rights, for the downtrodden and for a comprehensive welfare state lives on. 
 So strongly, in fact, that the small Saarland region, which holds a critical state election on Sunday, has become an unlikely focus of the identity crisis of Mr. Schroder's 136-year-old Social Democratic Party and of the ideological battles of the European left as a whole.
Broadly, the left in Europe has been casting around for a new identity that draws a distinction between a "market economy," now generally endorsed, and a "market society," an expression widely used to denote an unacceptable European surrender to what is perceived as American capitalist excess.
But how business-friendly the left should be remains in dispute.
"America has a different culture, with less solidarity, and we do not want such social Darwinism in Germany," said Reinhard Klimmt, Mr. Lafontaine's Social Democratic successor as Governor of the region. "My heart, like my predecessor's, beats on the left, but I am afraid that Mr. Schroder's beats everywhere."
The Chancellor's policies have certainly veered this way and that since he took office almost a year ago. But lately he has appeared determined to steer the Social Democrats away from their proud roots in the German labor movement toward the entrepreneurial enthusiasms of Britain's New Labor.
In the last month, Mr. Schroder rejected calls for a wealth tax, clamped down on social security, said the state's 49 percent share of the economy must be slashed and proclaimed that the 40-year-old program defining Social Democracy's aims must be rewritten.
"For the new politics to succeed, it must promote a go-ahead mentality and a new entrepreneurial spirit at all levels of society," Mr. Schroder wrote recently in a paper on the so-called third way of a revamped left that he co-signed with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
It is to that sort of language, with its whiff of a business consultant's jargon and its remoteness from the factory floor, that Mr. Klimmt, 57, has objected. He has focused his campaign on the themes of social justice still dear to the French Socialist Party and praises old ideals of Social Democracy.
"People talk of high tech," Mr. Klimmt declared to a meeting of union leaders this week. "Well, there is high tech in coal and steel production, too. What is forgotten today is that behind all the computers there are people, and we are here to defend the rights of those people."
The applause was enthusiastic. But Mr. Klimmt is in a fierce struggle for his political life, running neck and neck with a Christian Democratic candidate, Peter Muller, 43, who has declared roundly that the Saarland coal industry, which employs about 11,000 people, must be closed.
"We have to confront the truth," said Udo Recktenwald, Mr. Muller's spokesman. "The German coal industry is uncompetitive and will die. What we should be worrying about is insuring that the children of these miners have jobs in telecommunications and service industries."
The Social Democrats won comfortably here in 1994, taking 49.4 percent of the vote to the Christian Democrats' 38.5. Mr. Klimtt's difficulties reflect several factors: the poor start of Mr. Schroder's Government, anger at Mr. Lafontaine for abandoning politics and the frustrations of a region that is uncertain of its economic future.
In many ways the Saarland is a microcosm of Germany's economic problems. It has deep-rooted coal and steel industries in which employment has already fallen to a combined total of about 20,000 from 120,000 a decade ago. There is an unemployment rate of 17 percent in the city of Saarbrucken, and there are nascent software and technology industries whose outlook could not be further removed from the hulking factories of old.
But of course, it was precisely the workers in the old heavy industries who long provided a bedrock of the Social Democratic Party. How the party can modernize while not alienating that core support remains its central dilemma -- to which Mr. Schroder and Mr. Klimmt offer sharply differing answers.
"I don't like Schroder's slogan of 'the new middle,' " Mr. Klimmt said. "I like innovation with social justice. Of course, we must encourage new businesses. But we must also raise wages in line with productivity, maintain pensions and not cut the budget too hard. It's fine to say, 'Let the best man win,' but we must also help the loser."
The specter of people stripped of their dignity by an uncontrolled global market seems to lie close to the heart of Saarland Social Democracy. But in fact, the Saarland has adapted considerably in the last decade, rapidly developing a car and auto-parts industry to replace some of the jobs lost in steel and coal. At the same time, a highly successful software company called IDS Scheer, which employs more than 800 people, has led a push into high-tech industries.
Drive westward out of Saarbrucken and the difficulty of this transformation -- still far from complete and uncertain of success -- becomes clear. The rusted pipes and brick chimneys of abandoned steelworks and mines seem to stand in massive rebuke to the brisk, silent activity of the offices at the Saarbrucken Innovation and Technology Center.
Here, IDS has its headquarters. "Germany's problem is that we are too deep in the old industries and not good enough in finance, computers, services," said August-Wilhelm Scheer, the company's chief executive and a member of the so-called future team of Mr. Muller, the Christian Democratic candidate. "Here, we have great technology thousands of meters beneath the earth mining an outdated product."
The coal industry is destined to consume more than $2 billion in subsidies by 2005. But Mr. Klimmt insists it has a future, saying contracts already signed with power plants will cover all production until 2010.
The real issue, of course, is far wider than coal. It is the pace of change, the place of traditional industries and the viability of the social-market model of consensus and mediation with unions that served Germany so well for most of the period since World War II. The Saarland election will hinge on those questions.
They are issues on which Mr. Schroder and Mr. Klimmt differ. Where the Saarland candidate sees the death of old socialist values, the Chancellor sees the possible birth of a more deregulated Germany that alone will create the jobs that must be found if Mr. Schroder is to stand a chance of re-election.
Despite their differences, the Chancellor has given guarded support to his party's candidate because the loss of the state would severely weaken the party in the upper house of Parliament. But if Mr. Klimmt wins, the tensions within the party may worsen.
"We are desperately stretched as a party, and our identity is unclear," said Hajo Hoffmann, the Social Democratic Mayor of Saarbrucken.
"A basic problem," he said, "is that Tony Blair has managed to combine new technology with emotion and so make it seem exciting, while we have not found a personality big enough to bind the modernizing center and the old guard beneath a single reformist banner."

HEADLINE: Financial Engineering in the Clinton House Deal

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The package that the cash-strapped First Family will use to buy a $1.7 million house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is a clever and unusual piece of financial engineering designed to avoid tax and other pitfalls, real estate and financial specialists said today.
The deal calls for Terry McAuliffe, President Clinton's chief political fund-raiser, to personally supply $1.35 million in collateral that the lender, Bankers Trust Private Banking, could seize should the Clintons fail to make payments on a house costing more than three times what a Presidential salary could support. 
 Some private analysts said they were struck by what a good deal it appeared to be for the Clintons -- even though the bank itself, with whom three Clinton Administration aides or friends have had ties, seemed to have not been particularly generous.
For one thing, Bankers Trust, which was acquired in June by Deutsche Bank, would not want to have to explain to examiners an ostensibly uneconomic loan to a couple with negative net worth because of $5.5 million in legal debts, a sum that far exceeds their assets of about $1.5 million.
Nor would it be content to use only the house itself for collateral because of the public black eye it would certainly suffer in the unlikely, but imaginable, event it should ever have to foreclose. Banks and most other lenders generally find foreclosure a terrible hassle that they try to avoid whenever possible.
"They never make a loan they intend on collecting by selling the collateral after they've foreclosed," said James F. Smith, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.
And although some people initially raised their eyebrows at the seemingly low interest rate, which was calculated at 6.52 percent, they agreed that while this would have been a concession for a conventional 30-year mortgage, it was about the going rate for the first phase of a five-year loan adjustable every six months. But the Clinton loan is a jumbo loan, an extra large one that normally carries a rate that is one-eighth to one-half point higher.
In providing additional details today, the White House said that Mr. McAuliffe's $1.35 million in collateral would consist of cash, rather than what some had presumed would be Treasury securities. Mr. McAuliffe's money would go into an account at Bankers Trust, and he rather than the Clintons would receive the interest.
The Clintons are to supply $350,000 for the down payment, drawn from their blind trust, an amount just above the 20 percent of purchase-price minimum that excuses the couple from paying many hundreds of dollars a month in mortgage insurance to protect the lender. The Clintons will be making their own monthly payments.
By putting up cash rather than making a guarantee or by co-signing, Mr. McAuliffe avoids either party's having to bare their financial souls. "There's the ability to remain discreet," said Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. "It saves them from any disclosure."
The White House also called the mortgage an existing bank product, not something invented for them. Many major banks have special units, like Bankers Trust Private Banking, that cater to the carriage trade and often accommodate situations like that of the Clintons.
Although political opponents may contend that something of economic value -- the use of Mr. McAuliffe's cash collateral -- is being conferred on the Clintons, tax specialists said they doubted that this would result in taxable income even if the McAuliffe collateral were taken to pay off the mortgage. But this might well be considered a gift, which would raise the issue of improper payment to a Federal official.
The contingent nature of the money's deployment also exempts it from Government disclosure rules, the White House said, declaring that the Office of Government Ethics agreed with its position.
It could not be immediately learned whether any of the President's onetime aides or Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a close friend, helped in setting up the transaction.
Mr. Jordan is a former director of Bankers Trust. The current vice chairman, Eugene Ludwig, served as Comptroller of the Currency. And Frank N. Newman, who was Deputy Treasury Secretary, became chief executive of Bankers Trust after leaving Washington. Mr. Newman, who oversaw the sale of the bank, retired with a $100 million severance package.
At least one group came forward today to denounce the deal.
"He's the President of the United States and someone is doing a million-dollar favor to him to help him with his personal financial needs," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a policy body seeking to overhaul the campaign finance system. "That creates an appearance problem, a potential conflict problem, and it's a dangerous kind of act."

HEADLINE: ISRAEL AND P.L.O., WITH HELP OF U.S., REACH AN ACCORD

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Israel and the Palestinians, prodded by the presence of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, reached a crucial agreement tonight that envisions finalizing the borders between them and resolving the future of Jerusalem in one year.
Ms. Albright announced the agreement in Gaza City at the offices of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who stood at her side. The accord also calls for the completion of a land-for-security agreement signed last fall in Wye, Md., which had been stalled until the coming to office of the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak. 
 The central element of the new agreement is a plan to negotiate a conceptual "framework" for a permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians by Feb. 15, 2000, and the conclusion of detailed talks by next September.
The agreement called on both sides to refrain from taking unilateral action, which is understood to mean that the Palestinians will not declare statehood before a peace accord is reached and that Israel will not build new settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Mr. Arafat repeatedly declared in the last year that if no agreement was reached by May 2000 -- the date on which the original Oslo agreements were to conclude with a final settlement -- he would declare a Palestinian state then.
Today's agreement did not explicitly describe what sort of Palestinian entity would be established at the end of the process, leaving that to the negotiations.
On the land-for-security aspects of the Wye agreement, the Israelis agreed to cede control over 11 percent of the West Bank in three stages -- in September, November and January -- one American official said. Israel has already withdrawn from 27 percent of the West Bank.
The last major hurdle in the negotiations was the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails. In the end, Mr. Arafat abandoned his demand for 400, and accepted Israel's offer to release 350, a senior Israeli official said. Israel resisted releasing Palestinians "with blood on their hands."
After an intensive display of Middle East brinkmanship in the last several days, the agreement tonight came after the American envoy for the Middle East, Dennis Ross, spent the day with the Israelis working on the language of the deal, and after the document was taken to Mr. Arafat by Ms. Albright.
In Washington, President Clinton hailed the agreement, saying, "It shows that when both sides are willing to work together, their fundamental requirements can be met, confidence can be built and the process can move forward."
A signing ceremony was scheduled for Saturday night, after the end of the Jewish Sabbath, for Ms. Albright, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and the Palestinian and Israeli leaders at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik on the Sinai coast.
Speaking in a stifling hot reception room at Mr. Arafat's headquarters in Gaza City, with her back to a huge painting of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Ms. Albright praised both sides for working to reach a forward-looking agreement.
The arrival of the Secretary of State, who spent three and a half hours with Mr. Barak in the early morning, gave the two sides a deadline to work against, and her presence prodded them to overcome the last obstacles.
Ms. Albright stressed that she was not a mediator, perhaps not even a facilitator. "Maybe I was just the handmaiden," she said.
The announcement tonight gives Ms. Albright a boost as she travels to Syria on Saturday to meet with the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, in an effort to persuade him to restart negotiations with the Israelis that broke off three years ago.
Mr. Barak has expressed eagerness to settle with Syria, but Mr. Assad's apparent initial enthusiasm when the Israeli Prime Minister first took office appears to have waned. With a successful Israeli-Palestinian negotiation in hand, Ms. Albright will be hoping that Mr. Assad does not want to be left in the cold.
The central conflict in negotiating the modifications to the Wye accords has been the competing longer-term aim of Mr. Barak and the shorter-term goal of Mr. Arafat.
For Mr. Arafat, getting the transfer of West Bank land from Israeli to Palestinian control has been an essential short-term goal. It was pledged in the Wye agreement but was stalled by the former Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Arafat can show his people that with the new land and prisoner release, some progress has been made with the Israelis.
For Mr. Barak, the relinquishing of 11 percent more of the West Bank was not as enticing as getting the start of a process that will determine the permanent relationship between Israel and Palestinians and help shape an overall peace agreement that covers Syria and Lebanon.
The start of "final status" talks means dealing with the biggest problems of all: the status of Jerusalem, the return of refugees and the permanent boundaries of Israel in regard to the Palestinians.
A key element of the accord completed tonight is the Feb. 15 target date for a framework -- something like a declaration of principles -- for the final-status agreement. The details of the framework would be completed by September.
Mr. Arafat had been reluctant to set the February date, fearing that if such a framework was agreed upon early in the new year, Mr. Barak would feel free to turn his attention away from the Palestinian relationship and look instead toward negotiating with Syria.
Another sticking point, apparently one of the last, was Mr. Arafat's desire to be able to take such unilateral action as threatening to declare a state. He used this threat as leverage earlier this year: By pledging to delay the declaration of a Palestinian state last May, he won a promise from President Clinton that he would call a summit meeting of Middle East leaders within a year.
Without being specific, a member of Mr. Arafat's cabinet, Nabil Shaath, the minister of planning, said tonight that the Americans had been helpful to the Palestinians on this matter in "letters of assurance."
Israeli officials indicated tonight that the redeployment of Israeli troops would begin within 10 days. Two further redeployments would take place on Nov. 15 and Jan. 20, they said.
These moves would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full or partial Palestinian control.
The release of 200 Palestinian prisoners would also take place within the next 10 days with another 150 released in early October, they said.
A member of the Israeli Prime Minister's office, Haim Ramon, said today that the dispute on how many Palestinian prisoners would be released was settled on Thursday when the Israelis told Ms. Albright that they would not agree to the Palestinian demands for 400 released prisoners instead of the 350 offered by Israel.
"We said we would release 200 in September and 150 in October and in the future will consider more," Mr. Ramon said. If the Palestinians did not accept the offer, the Israelis had threatened to release only 102 prisoners, the number the Israelis said was required under the original Wye accords.
The question of the number of prisoners had become highly charged because the Israelis said they would not release Palestinians charged with killing Israelis.
After the signing of the agreement on Saturday, work is set to start on opening safe-passage routes across Israel that will allow Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza, a move intended to enhance economic development in both places. As well, construction of a seaport in Gaza, which was called for in the Wye agreement but not begun, will also start.
The talks for the framework agreement on the final-status issues are to begin at once, American officials said.
The February date for reaching a framework is ambitious, officials said. But by focusing on an early date, an American official said it was hoped to focus both sides on the final outcome of how Israel and the Palestinian lands would be shaped. Israeli officials said the framework would also serve to defuse the threat of a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood.
The agreement to work toward final status within a definitive time frame changes the focus from incremental deals -- which is the essential nature of the Wye accords -- to what is expected to be the final round of negotiations that will end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis.
"We began the incremental road in 1993, but everyone has been positioning for the endgame," said David Makovsky, executive editor of The Jerusalem Post. "Six years later, it looks like we're finally there."

Umpires Ponder a Future With and Without Work

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The umpiring crew that worked the game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago yesterday was a shell of its former self. Jerry Meals was the lone remnant. Larry Poncino and Gary Darling were no longer working, a result of the umpires' mass resignation movement, and Steve Rippley was in Florida deciding whether he would end his career, too.
"I announced my retirement yesterday," Rippley said. "They haven't taken it yet. They're giving me time to think about it." 
 Rippley, a 17-year National League veteran, said he was contemplating retirement because he was disheartened over the loss of 22 of his colleagues, concerned about the ramifications of that action for him and fearful that the economic package available to him if he retires now will not exist four months from now.
His state of mind was not an unexpected aftermath of the National and American Leagues' termination of 22 umpires, who resigned as part of their union's bargaining strategy and then, to their surprise, had their resignations accepted. The umpires who support the union leader Richie Phillips, Rippley among them, are angry with Major League Baseball and the umpires who abandoned the resignation strategy, blaming them for their colleagues' unemployment -- even though the 22 lost their jobs because of the strategy designed by Phillips.
"Why am I retiring?" the 45-year-old Rippley said, repeating a question. "In support of the 22 guys who got fired. I can also see down the road that my workload will be overloaded because there's no one left to work. They're not going to let the new guys they hired work post-season play, or a lot of important games in the next month. Who's going to get overloaded? The senior guys."
Rippley, chief of his crew, said he also expected umpires to be "on the street" as of Jan. 1. Their contract expires the day before, and the umpires believe they will be locked out.
"I know what I have in my hand right now if I retire; I don't know what's in the bush," he said by telephone from South Florida. "Come Jan. 1, I don't know if I'll have a paycheck; I don't know what my benefits will be. Everything becomes a jump ball Jan. 1. I could be on the streets. I may be one of the guys who's not hired back."
Rippley, whose salary under the umpires' pay scale is $155,000, would receive at least $300,000 in severance if he walked away from the job now or after the season. If he stayed and worked the post-season, he would earn additional money.
Rippley denied that he receives money from Pilot Air Freight, a Philadelphia shipping company that Phillips operates. Other umpires included him on a list of seven umpires that they said were on Pilot's payroll. Terry Tata, an N.L. umpire who has lost his job, was also named, and he, too, denied being on the payroll.
Rippley and Tata accused umpires from the anti-Phillips faction of disseminating false information. "The people who are spreading it can't prove it and they shouldn't be saying it," Rippley said. "Their rumor is because we sit on the union board they're slipping us this money, paying us $20,000, so we keep Richie as our lawyer. There are some people who have done p.r. work, speaking engagements and such, for Pilot. There's some compensation for that."
The schism between the two factions, divided mostly along league lines, is only growing deeper. "I don't see how the two groups can fit back together again," Rippley said. "We have to get back together, but I can't even fathom what's going to happen if we're in the same room."
Although some baseball people had suggested that some of the 22 umpires could be rehired next season, if crews were expanded from four to five, an official said last night that the idea of five-man crews has been abandoned. Another official said it was possible that two or three of the 22 umpires could be rehired.
Meanwhile, Rippley planned to spend the weekend deciding whether to head for Milwaukee and his next scheduled assignment Tuesday or into early retirement.

 The History of Coffee
 and How It Transformed Our World.
 By Mark Pendergrast.
 Illustrated. 520 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $27.50. 
 Caffeine is the most widely taken psychoactive drug on earth, and coffee is its foremost delivery system. That got my attention, along with the fact that the United States is Caffeine Country -- 90 percent of us imbibe caffeine in one drink or another -- but not until I read all 520 pages of Mark Pendergrast's encyclopedic coffee epic did I realize how powerful the coffee image has been even beyond its caffeine component.
In the 1930's, while 98 percent of American families were coffee drinkers -- including 15 percent of children between 6 and 16 years of age and 4 percent of children under 6 -- my family swigged only Postum and Sanka. We believed C. W. Post's warnings that caffeine disintegrated brain tissue by attacking the pneumogastric nerve. At the same time we were completely addicted to "Amos 'n' Andy," Major Bowes, the "Maxwell House Show Boat," Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy; all our favorite radio stars were sponsored by Big Coffee.
As I romanced to "Let's have another cup of coffee, and let's have another piece of pie," behind my every dream was an advertiser, pushing. "Every businessman wants a product that is habit-forming," wrote the Maxwell House adman Bill Benton, of Benton & Bowles. "That's why cigarettes, Coca-Cola and coffee do so well." And that's why the history of advertising can be equated with any of these habit-formers and why the history of coffee is a natural follow-up for the author who earlier wrote "For God, Country and Coca-Cola."
However, coffee is an even better model than Coke of the way in which social, economic and political forces interact globally whenever addiction is aroused, whether for tobacco, sugar, diamonds, gold, pepper, petroleum, cocaine or caffeine. No surprise there, but what is surprising is how early coffee was commodified in the Americas and how much the violent history of Latin America is still tied to the lure of the coffee bean.
Once the bean migrated from its native Abyssinia (Ethiopia) into Yemen, probably in the sixth century A.D., the coffee habit conquered Arab traders, Ottoman emperors, the courts of Europe and finally the colonists of the Americas. Europe's habit was sustained on the backs of New World slaves, both native and imported. Early in the 19th century, coffee supplanted sugar on the vast plantations of Brazil. Even after Brazil revoked slavery in 1888, it relied on indentured peonage. Coffee was grown wherever labor was cheap -- in Central America, Africa and the Dutch East Indies. Where the bean was planted, so too were the seeds of revolt.
The boom-and-bust cycles endemic to this commodity were established as early as 1823, when European speculators, gambling that war between France and Spain would close overseas trade, bought up Brazilian beans and went bankrupt when war was avoided. "The modern era had commenced," Pendergrast writes. Henceforth coffee's price would swing wildly as a result of speculation, politics, weather and the hazards of war.
Coffee, in other words, is an organic commodity subject to drought and disease, to over- and underproduction and to hoarding and dumping through coffee syndicates, speculators, commodity brokers and government-supported quota systems and price supports. Because the picked green bean, long before it is brewed, must be heavily processed (depulped, fermented, roasted and ground), growers, harvesters, roasters and marketers all have their hands in the till. Coffee, as one grower complained a century ago, "is the most speculative business in the world."
Pioneers of the United States coffee industry saw that the way to make money was to do their own roasting, invent packaging to keep roasted grounds fresh, use cheaper beans as needed, buy up competitors ruthlessly and advertise endlessly. Happily, Pendergrast puts a human face on the shenanigans of the coffee barons, detailing a remarkable cast of American eccentrics in the wars between the big roasters of the last century -- Folger's, Hills Brothers, MJB, Maxwell House, Chase & Sanborn, A.& P. -- and the giant corporations of this one. An ironist as well as a moralist, Pendergrast notes the interlocking of delivery systems after Philip Morris moved into the coffee business by buying General Foods and after Coca-Cola merged with Duncan Foods.
From such Byzantine intertwining no coffee purist or anti-caffeinist is safe. But quality begins with the bean. Robusta, the commodity bean of Brazil, is hardy but rough on the palate. Arabica, the finest bean, is far more delicate in flavor but harder to grow in the mountainous regions of Jamaica, Hawaii, Costa Rica and Kenya. Naturally, Arabica costs more.
The coffee industry produced its own backlash when a new generation ignored cost for other values, like social justice, ecology and -- of all things -- taste. Earlier heroes like William Black, who founded his own brand, Chock Full o' Nuts, in New York in the 1950's, and Alfred Peet, who dark-roasted his own quality beans at Peet's Coffee and Tea in Berkeley, Calif., in the 60's, were followed by the trio of college boys in Seattle in the 70's who started Starbucks. True to market patterns, after the founders sold the company in the 80's to their former marketer, the specialty brand went national and then international, Starbucking all of America and now moving into Japan.
Today we Americans drink less coffee than we did in the 30's, but we are drinking and brewing it better. We no longer boil grounds campfire style or percolate them genteel style in the pot. And we have a taster's dream choice of beans, roasts, grinds and brewing equipment. Even our lingo has changed -- from "Gimme a cuppa joe" to "Give me an iced short schizo skinny hazelnut cappuccino with wings." (Translation: a small iced hazelnut coffee with one shot of regular and one of decaf, plus skim milk with foam, to go.)
With wit and humor, Pendergrast has served up a rich blend of anecdote, character study, market analysis and social history. And while the reader sometimes needs a caffeine jolt when too much raw data and too little structuring clog the brew, still everything you ought to know about coffee is here: even how to make it. Measure two tablespoons of freshly roasted and ground coffee per six ounces of not-quite-boiled water and steep four to five minutes.

THE PEKING LETTER
 A Novel of the Chinese Civil War.
 By Seymour Topping.
 300 pp. New York:
 A Cornelia and Michael Bessie Book/Public Affairs. $25. 
 ON the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Seymour Topping has written "The Peking Letter," a novel that weaves together the intrigue of China's civil war with discussions of ancient Taoist philosophy and personal integrity. Topping, a former managing editor of The New York Times, comes to this material in the best way: He covered the war for The Associated Press. He has firsthand knowledge not just of the big battles and the ideological conflicts but of the small and telling details that other writers would never find in the course of traditional research.
The book opens as Eric Jensen, a Taoist scholar, is kicked out of his living quarters in Peking (Topping uses Wade-Giles romanization in keeping with the era of the story) for having sex with one of the residents. He soon falls in love with Lilian, a Chinese medical student and revolutionary, who engages him in conversation about his love of the city, his political views and his loyalty. Jensen has all the right answers and is soon enlisted to carry a letter, which outlines a Communist plan for the surrender of Peking, to the American ambassador in Nanking. (In an author's note, Topping explains that while the conversations between the Chinese and American historical characters are fictitious, their substance reflects the actual views of those personages.) Along the way, the C.I.A. blackmails Jensen into joining its own clandestine operation to get the inside scoop on the Communists.
Topping's Peking is peopled by foreigners who've fallen in love more with the idea than the reality of the place. For them it's much better to be a secretary living in a luxurious apartment and eating caviar out of kilo glass jars than to go "back to sharing a crummy apartment in Washington with another State Department broad," or to be a young diplomat enjoying a live-in prostitute and picking up antiques on the cheap than working as a salesman in a clothing shop in Des Moines. For these characters -- as it was for many foreigners who lived in China in those days -- the civil war is an inconvenience in lives that otherwise are as far from mainstream America as possible. At the same time, these people aren't above lecturing the Chinese on the virtues of democracy, mom and apple pie.
This paradox isn't lost on the Chinese. As one character who spent time in the United States points out: "When we deal with the British or the French or the Japanese they make no secret they act out of self-interest. But you Americans wrap yourselves in your morality and insist you are befriending us . . . that you know what's best for China." Even Jensen, for all his good will, eventually sees himself like the United States: "a well-intentioned giant, blundering about the Middle Kingdom and suffering from unrequited love."
In Jensen's defense, he does a little more than blunder. He finds himself at the decisive battle of Huai-Hai, saves Peking from destruction by carrying another letter back to that city and beds a good number of women. (Although Jensen proclaims undying love for the beautiful Lilian, he has a James Bondian notion of a relationship. But this -- along with a plethora of characters who appear only to become cannon fodder a couple of pages later -- may be an accurate portrayal of the times rather than an old-fashioned male fantasy.)
Although Topping is writing about events a half-century ago, many of the issues are very much in the headlines today. The arguments over democracy and Communism may, in fact, be even more germane now as China grapples with its free-market economy, the United States holds its annual debate over China's most-favored-nation status and the two countries continue to struggle with their mutual feelings of distrust. The activists of Topping's China, who carry placards that read "Protest Government Brutality" and "No More American Interference" could just as easily be students seen on a Beijing street today, only today's students wear Nike cross-trainers and Gap T-shirts, and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's witch hunt can be seen in much of today's China bashing. Meanwhile, every major American manufacturer, media conglomerate and service provider is trying to figure out how to break into the world's largest market. Topping has shown in the way only a veteran reporter can that the infatuation -- or, conversely, the xenophobic distrust -- Americans have always felt for China is just another instance where the more things change, the more they remain the same.

Exploring the Amazon, Without the Machete

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
PSSST! Pssst! Lady . . . excuse me. . . . "
A wiry, 40-ish man in jeans and baseball cap ambled over to where I was sitting, on a bench in a plaza in Manaus, Brazil. I stiffened, expecting a shady proposition -- perhaps a black-market currency exchange, or a deal on a "gold" wristwatch. Manaus, a hot, steamy city of nearly two million people surrounded by Amazon rain forest, is something of a Brazilian Wild West town. From its 19th-century days as a raffish river port swelled by money of rubber barons, to its modern incarnation as a tax-free trade zone, Manaus has lured fortune seekers and adventurers from all over the world. 
 I was in Manaus for adventure, too. The city, 1,770 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, is near the juncture of the Amazon -- or Rio Solimoes, as it is also known in this region -- and one of its giant tributaries, the Rio Negro. With no other major city within 600 miles, it is the jumping-off point for excursions into the rain forest. It is also the best place to catch one of the public riverboats that make the five-day journey downriver to Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon. I flew to Manaus in June, when the Amazon is at its highest, and conditions for boat travel are excellent. My plan was to spend a few days on a jungle trip out of Manaus -- the first part of a 21-day trip that would take me 800 miles down the Amazon.
But first I had to figure out what to do about the guy in the baseball cap. He drew closer, and I could see he held something in his palm. Jewelry for sale?
It was a business card: Claudio Gonzaga, Registered Jungle Tour Guide. "Maybe you are interested in a trip up the Rio Negro?"
I suppressed a chuckle -- while traveling, I've been offered a lot things on city streets, but never a jungle trek -- and declined Mr. Gonzaga's offer. Just 30 minutes before, I'd arranged for a trip with another jungle tour company called Swallows and Amazons, run by Mark Aitchison, an American expatriate, and his wife, Tania, a Brazilian.
There are dozens of tour companies and even more independent guides operating out of Manaus. Some offer boat trips, others offer a package that includes a stay in a jungle hotel and guided fishing, trekking or camping. Many of the companies have Web sites, and before I left I checked them out. For a single person, the all-inclusive packages were pricey -- $140 to $160 a day.
I felt sure I'd be able to negotiate a better deal in Manaus. Brazil's currency, the real, had been devalued in January, and now traded at almost half its former rate relative to the dollar. I also figured that my solo status, a disadvantage as an advance customer, might work in my favor on the spot. On a group tour, there's almost always room for one more. If I found a tour operator who'd already set up a group, I could hop on as a last-minute extra -- gravy for the tour operator, savings for me.
It took exactly an hour after I unpacked in the Best Western in downtown Manaus to find such a situation. Mr. Aitchison had a tour leaving the next morning, which I could join for three days. It sounded good -- there were only six other travelers booked, two Americans and four Brazilians, and the Brazilians would be along for the first day only. I liked the fact that the trip combined river travel in a gaiola, a typical Amazon small wooden motorboat, with trekking, as well as canoe excursions on the narrow jungle waterways called igarapes. On the first day, we'd cruise the basic tourist sites nearby, like the Encontro das Aguas (where the black waters of the Rio Negro feed into the brownish Amazon, creating dramatic swirling patterns on the surface), and visit the celebrated Ariau Jungle Tower, a luxury hotel on stilts in the forest. The next two days' program included canoeing, bird-watching, fishing and a forest hike. Overnights were at the Over Look Lodge, Mr. Aitchison's lodge, upriver.
Mr. Aitchison offered me a price of $100 a day, including guides, transportation and all meals and activities, which was less than what I'd seen on any Web site. Still, I hesitated, wondering if perhaps I should spend the rest of my day comparison shopping at other operators in Manaus. The time factor decided it for me -- I hadn't seen many foreign tourists at my hotel, or in my brief stroll around town to visit Manaus's only real tourist attraction -- the magnificent 19th-century opera house, the Teatro Amazonas, inlaid with Italian marble and rife with elaborate plasterwork and wood carvings. I doubted I'd be lucky enough to hook up with a group taking off the very next day. Also, it was hot -- Manaus is only a few degrees off the equator -- and I was eager to get out on the river. So I signed on.
What would an Amazon jungle trip be like? Before I'd left home, I tried to anticipate the experience by dipping into travel literature. From my reading, I'd spun a scenario that had me thwacking through thick vines with a machete, stepping carefully over pythons, avoiding exotic diseases, and occasionally stopping to chat with an earnest bespectacled eco-advocate. My neighbor, Steven, had traveled down the Amazon 15 years ago, and when I asked him about it, he immediately regaled me with more about the habits of leeches than I wanted to know. Shuddering, I packed my mosquito net and three brands of insect repellent. The four Brazilian women, well-to-do grandmothers from Sao Paulo, had packed their hair spray and diamonds.
"La floresta, que maravilhosa!" said Lydia, gesturing dramatically with her polished nails toward the bank of the Amazon. I smiled, and so did the two Americans from Indiana, both schoolteachers, both named Cathy. I hadn't expected an Amazon trip to be so genteel, and from their expressions -- and their gear of cargo pants and T-shirts -- I guessed the Cathys hadn't, either.
ON the other hand, we weren't complaining as we sat down to a tasty lunch, prepared by the boat's cook, of stewed tambaqui (a rich, meaty Amazon fish), vegetables, salad and fresh papaya. Our boat chugged briskly upriver, and a cool breeze wafted across the deck. There wasn't a mosquito, leech or eco-advocate in sight.
There's a well-worn tourist track on trips from Manaus, and for the first day of the excursion, we hit all the stops. Our little boat jockeyed for position among the other tour boats at the "meeting of the waters," where pink river dolphins reliably leap. (They didn't disappoint us.) We docked on a tiny sandbar at a hut where locals sold key rings, blowguns and other gewgaws, and where tame monkeys and sloths stretched across the wooden-plank dock. We left our boat and took a motorized canoe to a quiet lagoon where the famous Amazon giant waterlilies grow -- several canoes were already there, with a video crew. We toured (for an exorbitant $9 a head) the grandiose -- and mostly empty -- Ariau Jungle Tower hotel and tramped through the $1,000-a-night Cosmica Suite where Bill Gates had stayed during his visit last year. It was a room that boasted a 360-degree view of the forest and amenities ranging from a dartboard to a Barcalounger. Finally, our little boat pulled up at a riverbank with thick forest behind it.
"Now we get ready for a short jungle walk," said our Brazilian guide, Conrado Jose Farias.
The Cathys and I dug into our bags for the insect repellent. So did the Brazilian women -- except for Lydia. Reaching into her purse, she pulled out a mirror and flame-red lipstick and proceeded to apply it carefully.
As it turned out, Lydia made the right move. We encountered no mosquitoes on the little trail. But the women snapped dozens of pictures of each other "in the jungle" to show their grandchildren.
As a student of tourism anthropology, and a fan of tourist kitsch, I was glad to have experienced Amazon Lite. I was eager to go beyond it, however, and therefore felt pleased when our group dwindled the next morning to just the Cathys and me.
As we packed up our gear in the Over Look Lodge -- a simple bunkhouse with single and double rooms and shared bath-showers, I saw Conrado smile and relax now that he had fewer charges. A muscular, crew-cut young man with military bearing, Conrado told me he'd been a cadet in jungle training before a back injury sidelined him. At breakfast on shipboard, Conrado laid out the day's itinerary like a platoon sergeant: canoe trip, bird-watching, more canoe in a different spot, piranha fishing and moonlight alligator catching.
Conrado promised a thrill-packed day, and he delivered. The gaiola took us up the Amazon, which because of its much higher oxygen level and high fish population has more wildlife than the Rio Negro. Transferring to a motorless canoe, we paddled silently on the igarapes that led into the forest. Because of the high water, our canoe floated at treetop level, close to where the animals live.
Conrado soon spotted a couple of sloths. We paddled closer, and I pulled out my binoculars and was thrilled when I saw that the two sloths were four -- there were two babies, each clinging to its mother's fur.
The intoxicating silence was broken by the call of unfamiliar birds and the sleek whoosh of our canoe moving through water. The silliness of yesterday's tourist track faded away, replaced by the gravity of the real equatorial forest, astonishing in its diversity and fecundity. I was glad to have lucked into a knowledgeable and fit guide like Conrado, since every turn of our canoe led to a thicket of vegetation that appeared exactly like what we'd left behind. To venture here without a competent guide, I realized, is absolutely nuts.
At last, we pulled up into what Conrado said was a good spot to catch piranhas, which we could give to the cook for dinner (they are unlikely to make dinner out of you unless you swim with a school that's particularly famished). Excited, the Cathys and I grabbed poles strung with a simple nylon line, divvied up some raw meat and secured it to the hooks. "Jiggle the line, like this," Conrado demonstrated, working up a froth in the water. We followed suit. Nothing. We jiggled again.
Suddenly, my line went taut -- a catch! I pulled in the pole, but the line went loose again. I checked the hook, and the meat was gone. Then Cathy felt a bite -- same deal, slack line, empty hook. This went on for an hour, at the end of which the score was piranhas 8, humans 0.
Conrado was not happy. That evening, after dinner on the big boat, he told us to get ready for a canoe excursion. Paddling furiously out into a lagoon, he began to shine his flashlight into the thickets. From one of them, two orange lights shone back. Quickly Conrado paddled over and, in one swift motion, pulled a caiman (a small alligator) from the murky water with his bare hands. Triumphantly, he held it up in the moonlight; it dangled helplessly for a moment, silhouetted against the sky, until he chortled and tossed it back.
I came to the Amazon with nature on my mind, intrigued by the thought of encountering wild animals at every turn. What I learned in my three days on the rivers is that animals like their privacy. We spent hours quietly searching, only to spy a handful of sloths and monkeys (although the bird-watching was excellent). But though animal life was uncooperative, the people living on the Amazon were friendly and numerous.
AS our guides explained, these Amazon dwellers, who are known as caboclos, are descendants of the original indigenous people and the Portuguese colonists. Over centuries, the caboclos have developed a culture combining elements of European and Indian heritage.
As we traveled the river, we met caboclos everywhere -- passing in canoes with hardwood logs stacked and ready to take to market, fishing in narrow streams, tending their crops of manioc (cassava, an Amazon staple) along the riverbanks. The opportunity to meet them and observe their life up close turned out to be the unexpected highlight.
Senhor Luis, a grave, sun-weathered farmer in his 80's, invited us to climb up his dock and into his fine wood house, which bore a For Sale sign. Proudly, he showed me around the place, which he'd built himself. The windows had sliding shutters that glided in hand-chiseled grooves. Mango and guava trees shaded the yard. On the other side of the property was a shed and equipment to grind manioc into the flour that is a staple of the Amazon diet. A small boat, also for sale, hugged the shore. I took this all in -- the land, the fruit, waterfront property -- and my New York real estate gene did the rest.
I asked Senhor Luis the price. Five thousand cash, he replied.
Only five thousand! I thought about this on the two-hour trip downriver back to Manaus. I calculated what it might cost to dig a well and install running water, and put on a new aluminum roof. Finally I could contain myself no longer. When we returned to the Over Look Lodge, where I was going to catch a boat back to Manaus, I asked Mark Aitchison, who was riding back with us, whether Senhor Luis was asking a fair price for the property.
He looked at me and laughed. "Well, if Senhor Luis owned it, it would be a great deal," he said, explaining that almost all the riverfront land here belonged to Brazil's army, and the caboclos squatted there (with the military's tacit permission).
So much for my fantasy of an Amazon summer home. Perhaps I'd find a less shaky real estate opportunity somewhere downriver. I had 800 more miles to explore.
 
The bottom line
 I spent $439 for hotel, meals and activities during my four nights and five days in Manaus and the surrounding rain forest.
 
Getting There
I booked my flights through BR Online Travel, (305) 379-0005, a Miami-based air ticket consolidator that specializes in Brazil. My itinerary on Varig -- New York to Manaus via Miami, return to New York from Belem via Miami, and a side excursion between Belem and the city of Sao Luis -- cost $1,058, about $800 less than the lowest fare quote directly from the airline.
 
Accommodations and Dining
At www.travelocity.com, I reserved a single room at the Best Western, 217 Rua Marcilio Dias, telephone (55-92) 622-2844, fax (55-92) 622-2576, for $57 for my first night in Manaus. After my jungle excursion, I stayed another night at the Best Western, and my rate mysteriously dropped to $52. The price includes the traditional Brazilian breakfast buffet -- an enormous selection of fruits, breads, cheeses and fresh juices. The Best Western is clean and well kept with somewhat drab but spacious air-conditioned rooms (insist on a high floor with a city view) in a safe and central neighborhood.
Dining choices in Manaus are limited. The Best Western serves a superb lunch buffet for $6.50. On my trip with Swallows and Amazons, I ate three meals a day of fresh fish, free-range chicken and local fruits and vegetables, expertly prepared and included in my daily rate.
 
Getting Around
Manaus is crawling with tour operators and independent guides. Before arriving in Brazil, I consulted the Lonely Planet Guide to Brazil and the Passport South American Handbook, two excellent sources.
I also found descriptions of hotel packages and guided tours on line -- www.zfnet.com/manaus, in Portuguese, has a directory of state-approved tour operators. The Web sites gave a sense of current rates.
Swallows and Amazons, 189 Rua Quintino Bocaiuva, (55-92) 622-1246, Web site www.overlookinn.com/ swallows.html, is recommended by my guidebooks. It is run by Mark Aitchison and his wife, Tania. Their tours combine boat and canoe travel with land trekking and stays at the Over Look Lodge, about 35 miles upriver on the Rio Negro from Manaus. My three-day, two-night trip included a boat excursion to popular nearby tourist sites like the Encontro das Aguas and the Ariau Jungle Tower Hotel, wildlife- and bird-watching, a canoe excursion through small streams off the Rio Negro, and two short hikes in the rain forest. The price, $100 a day, included overnight accommodations in the simple lodge, and all meals. I found their guides and staff to be professional and knowledgeable.
 
What to See
Entry to the opera house in Manaus, Praca Sao Sebastiao, Centro, telephone (55-92) 234-0508, is about $2.50, including a tour in English.

Serena on Tap

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
The Chelsea Hotel sprawls along 23d Street like a seedy lament to the Age of Innocence, when this part of Manhattan was "uptown" and Lillian Russell was the girl of the hour. Built in 1883 as a co-op, with a pink Victorian facade and lacy balconies, the Chelsea did not open its doors as a hotel until 1905.
Since then, the likes of Mark Twain, Sarah Bernhardt and O. Henry have bedded down on Chelsea sheets. Here, Thomas Wolfe wrote "You Can't Go Home Again"; Arthur Clarke, "2001 -- A Space Odyssey," and William Burroughs, "Naked Lunch." In its slow shamble toward bohemia, the historic landmark played host not only to the wannabes and down-and-outs but also to Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and Dylan Thomas, the Welsh poet who took his last drink in Room 205, then slipped into a coma and died. Andy Warhol's most glittering superstar (and "Chelsea Girl"), Viva, made the place her home for 30-odd years. And Sid Vicious enhanced the Chelsea Myth when, in 1978, the punk rocker stabbed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen to death in Room 100. 
 Yet the miracle of the Chelsea is that, homicidal maniacs notwithstanding, eccentrics and artists alike have always found sanctuary within its walls. The managing owner, Stanley Bard, has said he never wants the Chelsea to turn into just "a place to make money." So it is all the more curious that he leased the Chelsea's unfinished basement to the fashion world's premier caterer, Serena Bass. In partnership with her son Sam Shaffer, Bass will open Serena, a chic little bar and lounge, on Sept. 9.
Now, a hot saloon could certainly burn away some of the hotel's recent tarnish, but the idea of very thin people lining up in very expensive dresses to push through Serena's heavy wrought-iron door, drink cosmopolitans under her tin palm trees, recline on pillows made by a top London designer (Bass's sister, Gaynor Churchward) and munch on root-vegetable pancakes (her niece Minnie Driver's favorite) seems almost antithetical to the Chelsea spirit. But Bard is not worried. "Serena fits," he insists.
She is 53 years old but a convincing 30-something from a distance. All ash-blond pixie, can-do affability and high-voltage drive, she is preparing herself for a photo shoot in the office above her West 13th Street catering kitchen and is too busy putting on a face -- kohl eyes and blood-red lipstick -- to have much time for guile.
"With Mortimer's down, everybody is dying for a place to go," she gushes. "Peter Duchin and Brooke Hayward call me every day, every day! Renny Reynolds, the florist? He's helped me so much. Alexa Hampton, you know, Mark Hampton's daughter, we couldn't have done it without her! None of them can wait until we open! And all Sam's friends, the young artists and models, are so eager!" Stacking the evidence in favor of success, Bass has neither the time nor the inclination to consider the possibility of failure.
At the moment she is basking in maternal triumph. "People tell me it must be hard -- I say it's easier," she says of her partnership with Sam, who majored in economics at Tufts, worked in marketing at Details magazine and learned the bar business at Ian Schrager's hotel Morgans. "At the end of the day we call and say: 'Sorry I was such a. . . .' 'Sorry I was such a. . . ."'
Bass grew up in Brighton, England, so disgusted by the pigs' feet and headcheese that her stepmother served that she ate only cheese omelets. At 16, she headed for Swinging London, where she was swept away by David Shaffer, a young doctor with a taste for fine food and fancy friends, including Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller from "Beyond the Fringe." In short order, the couple married and had two sons. (Joe, 30, is a dermatologist.) And Bass, a quick study, went from scrambling eggs to whipping up pheasant with cr<heart>me Calvados. (It didn't hurt that she lived around the corner and drew inspiration from a gourmet shop owned by the British food writer Elizabeth David.)
In 1977, the Shaffers arrived in New York. "And we entertained everybody -- my husband was very taken with it all," Bass says, adding that she herself was much more smitten with the artists and writers she met in the hallways of the Chelsea Hotel, where the family lived while renovating their brownstone in Greenwich Village.
When the marriage broke up five years later -- Shaffer subsequently married Anna Wintour, of Vogue -- Bass started catering to support herself. (She has been divorced twice.) "She's incredibly talented," says her friend Brooke Hayward. "Serena has a homespun quality, a natural design sense and a weird eccentricity, which makes her unique."
Bass, who is hoping that Serena will be to Chelsea what Elaine's is to the Upper East Side, says there is no other watering hole where people of all ages can socialize. "People my age are going to feel comfortable here, and the younger people will have someplace pretty to go." Her nine-month renovation, costing $500,000, has turned a once-dank and rodent-replete dungeon into a handsome colonialist cocoon whose cinnabar-colored walls exude sensuality. The first room, a cafe, features marble tables, 50's-style sconces and raw silk and faux-suede banquettes. Through an archway is the hexagonal bar, with a red-and-green-striped daybed under the window and banquettes against the far wall. The third room, a dark, opulent lounge, features green velvet banquettes, Indian cushions and Chinese lanterns. "My plan," Bass says, "is that you meet in the cafe, see who you like, move that person into the bar and get drunk, then move into the den and" -- either eat some of her marvelous tandoori chicken and shrimp ceviche or, as she puts it -- make out."
Which is O.K. by Laura Kirar, designer of the stylish restaurant Fressen, who joined a gaggle of natty creative types, among them the songwriters Danny Keough and Angela McCluskey, at a preview party recently. "You can walk in here and picture your favorite rock star fitting in," Kirar says. "It's great. A little trash, a little rock-and-roll."
As opening night approaches, the would-be doyenne is serene, befitting her name. After all, Kwan Lau, the Feng Shui master, came by the other day. "He positioned the cash register and blessed the whole place and said that everything is perfect."

Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook the vegetables, one at a time, covering the skillet and allowing them to cook in their own juices until they are just soft, about 3 to 5 minutes each. As they are cooked, transfer the vegetables to one large bowl.
2. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook 1 minute. Stir in the flour. Add the onion mixture to the bowl with the root vegetables. Add the salt, pepper and cayenne and mix well. Add the eggs. Toss until thoroughly mixed.
3. Wash out the skillet and place it over medium heat. Add the oil. Form the vegetable mixture into small cakes about 3 inches in diameter and add them to the skillet. (Do not crowd; you will need at least 2 batches.) Cook the cakes, turning once, until they are nicely browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Continue cooking until all the vegetable mixture has been used. Serve hot with tomato or mango chutney.
Yield: 12 to 15 pancakes.
 
Ecuadorean Ceviche
 
 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning
 6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
 2 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
 6 very ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded
 1/4 cup ketchup
 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
 3 small red onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced
 Freshly ground pepper to taste
 3 strips bacon, diced
 1 1/2 cups dried corn (see note).

 1. In a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add the seafood seasoning, 2 tablespoons of the lime juice and 1 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Add the shrimp and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the shrimp and liquid to a large bowl. Set aside.
2. Place the tomatoes in the container of a blender and puree. Transfer puree to a bowl and add the remaining 4 tablespoons lime juice, the ketchup and cilantro and stir until combined. Stir in the onions. Pour this mixture over the shrimp and liquid and stir until combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill at least 2 hours.
3. Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add the bacon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is crispy and has rendered its fat, 6 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and reserve for another use. Add the dried corn to the skillet and cook, stirring, until the corn is browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and sprinkle with salt.
4. When the ceviche is chilled, spoon it into bowls. (Leftover liquid can be put to another use or discarded.) Garnish with toasted corn and serve.
Yield: 8 appetizer servings.

Chocolate Tres Leches
 
 For the cake:
 5 large eggs, separated
 1 cup sugar
 1 cup cocoa powder
 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 1/3 cup milk
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
 1 cup evaporated milk
 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
 3/4 cup heavy cream
 1 tablespoon light rum
 
 For the meringue topping:
 1 cup sugar
 3 egg whites
 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar.
1. To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter a 10-inch round cake pan. Place the yolks and 3/4cup of the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together the cocoa, flour, baking powder and salt. When yolks are fluffy, use a large spoon to fold the milk and 1/2teaspoon of the vanilla into them, then fold in the cocoa mixture.
2. In a clean bowl with a clean beater, beat the egg whites until frothy. Beat in the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/4cup sugar, beating until the whites are glossy and firm. Fold the whites into the cocoa mixture. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 to 50 minutes.
3. Remove the cake from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack. Then unmold it onto a deep platter. Pierce the top all over with the tines of a fork. In a bowl, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream, rum and remaining teaspoon of vanilla. Pour the mixture over the cake, spooning the milk that puddles on the platter on top of the cake, little by little, until all is absorbed.
4. Meanwhile, make the meringue topping. In a small heavy saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of water and all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Place over high heat, cover and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the cover and continue cooking until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 239 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes.
5. While the sugar syrup is cooking, place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer and begin beating. When soft peaks form, beat in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Continue beating the whites until stiff peaks form.
6. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches the correct temperature, with the beater running, begin pouring the hot syrup very slowly into the whites. Continue beating until the mixer bowl no longer feels warm, about 10 minutes.
7. Wipe the edges of the platter. Using a small spatula, spread the meringue over the top and sides of the cake. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
Yield: 10 servings.

HEADLINE: Desperate to Seem 16

BYLINE: By Lynn Hirschberg; Lynn Hirschberg is a contributing writer for the magazine. Her last article was about Michael Ovitz.

 BODY:
Every morning, nikki bokal, an aspiring actress, walks a block from her home high in the canyons of Los Angeles, looks out upon the city and greets it. "I look at the view, and I say hello," she says on a morning in July, as she drives her enormous black GMC Yukon to her manager's office on Sunset Boulevard. "Sometimes I'm in a rush, and I just say, 'Hi, city.' Sometimes I look at it and cry. Mostly the city makes me happy, so I say: 'Hello, city. One day you will be mine."'
Nikki, who says she is 23, is dressed, as she usually is, in something tight and something pink. Today she's wearing pink Miu Miu cowboy boots and form-fitting pink pants topped by a black T-shirt that spells out "Hustler" in sparkly letters. Nikki has lived in L.A. for only a little more than a year, but in that time, she has appeared in two commercials for Mercedes-Benz directed by Michael Bay, best known for last summer's noisy action film "Armageddon"; a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, in which she played a runaway teen-ager who has sex with the hero, and a couple of small independent films. Last February, during what is called pilot season, she went on two or three auditions a day for television shows geared toward the teen-age audience, and she was cast in a pilot for MTV about a rock-and-roll plastic surgeon, but the show did not make the fall schedule. "I went up for the blond roles," Nikki says, shaking her now brunet shoulder-length hair. She feels her former hair color ("I am a natural blond," she says) may have hampered her success during pilot season. 
 "I would go to an audition," Nikki continues, "and there'd be 35 girls there, and they all looked the same. We were all blond, we were all around the same height and we all had the same body. I decided, Why not make a change?" She shrugs. In Hollywood, they always look to repeat the proven, and the most popular actresses on television today are very young and brunet. There is Katie Holmes, who stars as a high-schooler on "Dawson's Creek," and Jennifer Love Hewitt, who starred for several years as a teen-ager on Fox's "Party of Five" and will star this fall in a spinoff of that show called "Time of Your Life." "Everybody wants Katie Holmes or Jennifer Love Hewitt," Nikki says. "Those girls have brown hair. And those girls are stars."
All of a sudden, it is that easy. Teen-agers are big business in the entertainment industry. Never has there been so much opportunity for the young and the hungry. Consider James Van Der Beek of "Dawson's Creek," a show that was first shown on the Warner Brothers' Network (WB) two seasons ago and became an instant sensation among teen-age viewers. Most people older than, say, 21 have perhaps never heard of James Van Der Beek, who, like Holmes, plays a high-school student on the show, even though he is 22 years old. But the movie Van Der Beek made after the show caught on, "Varsity Blues," earned $17.5 million in its opening weekend last January, thanks to the support of teen-age girls who flock to almost anything that centers on boys and love and high school. Van Der Beek is now a bankable Hollywood star.
"Dawson's Creek" didn't start the boom; it probably began with Baz Luhrmann's 1996 hip-L.A.-youth version of, as it was called, "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet" (which starred Leonardo DiCaprio). When entertainment executives talk about this boom -- and at times it seems they talk about little else -- they attribute it simply to what they call "the Demographic." The teen-age children of the baby-boom generation happen to form the largest audience of teen-agers in history. Hollywood, of course, has always cared about the young, but it is the numbers that have made teen-agers a late-90's obsession. There is a huge viewership, spearheaded by teen-age girls, who will pretty much see or watch anything as long as the actors and actresses look like teen-agers too.
"It's getting to the point where agencies don't want to sign anyone over 22," says Brian Swardstrom, a partner at the Endeavor Agency. He is joking -- a little. He represents James Van Der Beek. "It's understandable. There are young actors who were complete unknowns two years ago, who are making $3 million a movie today." Young actors like Heath Ledger and Brad Renfro and Barry Watson -- actors whose names may hardly be recognized by adults.
Networks are convinced that the teen-age audience is a highly desirable niche mostly because advertisers think so -- boys and girls are making many of their own consumer choices before they are out of puberty, and advertisers want to reach them. ("Advertisers love to think that they are branding their products in the minds of young viewers," says Lee Gabler, the agent who heads the Creative Artists Agency's television department.) And the networks are hoping that by attracting new 14-year-old viewers, they will halt the slip in network viewership and maybe lock in future adult TV watchers.
Fox had the idea first. When the network began in 1987, it focused on the young (in those days, defined broadly as 18- to 34-year-old viewers), but Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox, wanted a full-service network, and there was a conscious decision to widen the programming spectrum. When Garth Ancier, who had been at Fox in the early days, became president of entertainment of the fledgling WB network, he concentrated on youth-niche programming and drove the content down to meet the new teen-age boom. "It was a decision born out of necessity," Ancier, now entertainment president of NBC, explains. "There was a clear shot underneath the big three networks who have to do broad-based programming. Our target was 12 to 34, and our competitors couldn't really hit that target. And the younger half of that demographic is very attractive to advertisers."
With shows like "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer," "Felicity" and "Dawson's Creek," WB has become the network to copy. This past spring, some 30 TV pilots, out of a total of roughly 110 produced by the networks, were constructed around teen-age characters. That's a lot of roles to fill. "It's difficult to cast these shows," Ancier says. "For one thing, you almost never have high-school-age actors and actresses playing high-school students." There just aren't many 14- or 15-year-olds who can act. At the same time, there aren't that many 20-year-olds who can act -- or look 14 or 15. "You really have to beat the bushes to find talent," Ancier says.
The new fall teen shows are virtually all one-hour dramas -- sitcoms built around teen-agers don't seem to work. These new shows come in two types: either they are set in a high school and revolve around popular versus unpopular girls or they unfold in a big family (like the successful WB show "7th Heaven") with at least two of the children in high school and at least one of them a Katie Holmes clone. The Katie Holmes type is a throwback to the 50's: she is a smart girl next door (as opposed to the babe-o-rama blondes). In a 90's twist, though, she might have sex, but only if she's really in love.
"I thought all this would kind of fizzle out," says Kevin Williamson, who created "Dawson's Creek" and wrote the first two "Scream" movies, which also helped fuel the boom. "But there is a real audience out there. They don't want to see Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson. They want their own stars like Leo."
Williamson's work has a distinct style: his characters are acutely self-aware and able to verbally pinpoint infinitesimal shifts in their angst-filled lives. Although "Dawson's" is full of soap-opera twists -- Dad dates a younger woman, buildings burn, kids drink too much and there's sex, sex, sex -- the main action concerns the quartet of characters announcing their feelings in a second-by-second breakdown that is breathtaking in its narcissism. "The dialogue and the show speak to a confused teen-age audience," Williamson says. "And I happen to love that time of life."
It's a fantasy version of youth, complete with witty comebacks and enormous sexual confidence. But clearly it sells. "It is a fact that teen-age girls watch high-school shows and teen-age boys watch wrestling -- which is why this season you'll see a lot of high-school shows and wrestling," says a network president who says he is embarrassed by this development. "Show me a show that works, and I'll show you a hundred look-alikes."
The look-alikes, of course, need their own stars. Which is why Hollywood is filled just now with would-be Lana Turners -- or would be Katie Holmeses, anyway.
When Nikki Bokal, an only child of affluent, divorced parents, moved to L.A. from New York 14 months ago, the teen boom in TV was just starting. "I knew I had to move to California," Nikki says, turning into the parking garage of her manager's office building. "It was a moment." For an actress starting out, Nikki has a lot of people: a manager, a commercial agent, a modeling agent. And C.A.A., the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, is "hip-pocketing" her, which means the agency is doing things for her but has not officially added her to its roster.
"It's all about getting noticed," she says. "I go to parties, and I always try to write my name on something. Like, they'll have a bulletin board, and I'll get a piece of paper and write: 'Great party! Love, Nikki,' and I'll pin it up." Nikki smiles. She has beautiful teeth. "I want to be remembered," Nikki says.
The first step for most young actors is a manager. Unlike agents, they more readily sign unknowns and often specialize in young talent. Some managers even have their teen-age clients live at their homes. Nikki found her manager, Stephanie Simon, through an executive at MTV. Nikki calls her manager's office five, six times a day. Today, she's here to pick up a new cell phone from one of her manager's assistants. There's nothing particularly wrong with her old phone, but this new one is red, white and blue and has a zillion features. "Anything to be different," she says. "But how will people find me?"
The assistant starts to explain call forwarding, but Nikki is distracted. She cuts him off, bounds into Simon's office and starts asking her about "Coyote Ugly," a movie being cast that Nikki is convinced will make her famous.
"It's my big dream," Nikki says. "Coyote Ugly," which is based on a story that ran in GQ, is about four young girls who work in a bar in New York but dream of being stars. The producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, is casting only unknowns as his four girls, and Nikki wants to play Rachel, who is a struggling actress, or Violet, who is a singer-songwriter. "It'll be huge," Nikki says. "The girls are supposed to be 17 to 21. They saw me for the part, and it went really well, but I'm waiting to hear. . . ."
Simon, who has heard this all before, nods and then calms Nikki down by mentioning other projects. She's up for the part of a new love interest for Dawson on "Dawson's Creek." "They like you so much," says Simon. "It would be a four-episode guarantee with the possibility of becoming a recurring character."
Nikki laughs. "I almost blew it," she giggles. "They didn't know if I was cute or not because I had my hair back in a ponytail and no makeup on. When they called me back, I wore my Wonderbra and this black tank top and high heels, and I looked like the seductress that they wanted."
Simon smiles. "There's still 'Happy Campers,"' she says. "Happy Campers" is a movie about camp counselors that will star Brad Renfro, who, along with Devon Sawa, is one of the teen-age idols you cast when you would rather cast Leo.
"And what about 'Sugar and Spice'?" Nikki asks. This movie is about high-school girls who become bank robbers (for a good cause -- one of their clique is going to have a baby).
"I think they're still casting," Simon says. "We'll check."
Nikki, who looks at times as if she is old enough to be attending her 10th high-school reunion, seems concerned. "Do you think I looked younger when I was blond?" she asks Simon.
"I think you look beautiful, Nikki," Simon says reassuringly. Nikki beams. "Thanks," she says, staring at her red, white and blue phone. "When do I get my new number?" she asks. "I want this phone to ring and you to say, 'Nikki, you got the part."' Nikki laughs. "I'm super-super-close on 'Coyote Ugly,"' she says, almost to herself. "Super-super-close."
"Oh, you know Nikki," says Taryn Manning, who turned 20 last November but looks around 15, which is the age of the character she plays on "Get Real," a show that will be on Fox in the fall. "Nikki knows everyone, and we met through friends, but we don't go up for the same parts. Except, maybe, 'Coyote Ugly.' They've seen everyone on that."
Taryn, who is small and wiry, is wearing black jeans and a blue bandanna tied around her chest as a shirt. Her shoulders and stomach are tan and bare and her eyelids are covered in silver glitter that has fallen onto her cheeks. She is dressed for an audition of sorts -- a general meeting with Judd Payne, an executive who works for Steve Tisch, the producer who won an Oscar for "Forrest Gump." Taryn has never heard of him. She's not even sure what producers really do. She's only been in L.A. for nine months.
"I have a really competitive side to me," she says. "I want this so bad." Taryn grew up in a trailer park in Arizona with her mother, who was a dancer, and her father, an itinerant musician who died when Taryn was 15. She was accepted at a special high school for dance in Long Beach, which is an hour south of L.A. She was good. She won competitions for roller-skating and for karate and was the lead in nearly every school musical show. "I always knew I had something," she says. "I'm edgy and I'm funky, no matter if I have on a sundress with a bow in my hair or jeans or boots. I'm small, but I have edge. That's unusual."
By sending out photographs, Taryn got an agent right away and then a manager named Scott Karp. Within six months, she traded up to a bigger agency, Innovative Artists, which pushed her for every youth-oriented pilot last February. It was so fast. Taryn was chosen for three shows, winding up with a recurring role on six episodes of "Get Real," a family show built around the three teen-agers in the house. Taryn plays a neighbor who has a romance with the youngest son. "I'm 20 and he really is 15," she says. "I think we kiss. I'll probably be his first kiss."
Last week, Taryn quit her part-time job at a Mexican restaurant. When an actor signs a contract for a pilot, his or her agent negotiates a fee for six and a half years, with 5 percent bumps for every year. The lowest amount for a series regular would be roughly $5,000 an episode. Taryn is dazzled by the money. "My mom said, 'You're crazy to quit your job."' Taryn laughs. "And I said, 'Maybe I'm crazy, but Mom, I'm going to be a movie star soon." Taryn smiles. "I get to go up for everything," she says. "I don't ever play over 18. People ask me if I'm 14, and that's so great. So many actresses in their 20's say to me, You are so lucky -- there's nothing for us."
A few days ago, Taryn read for the part of Pixel, a counselor in "Happy Campers," which was written by Daniel Waters, who wrote the teen cult classic "Heathers." Taryn read three scenes. In one, Pixel crawls into the bunk bed of another female counselor and kisses her. ("Pixel! I didn't know you were a lesbian," the shocked counselor says. "I didn't know I had to declare a major," replies Pixel.) The second scene was Pixel teaching the campers how to do a striptease ("Unbutton your pants"), and the third scene was between Pixel and a male counselor with whom she has been having an affair. ("Omigod," exclaims Pixel, "I gave you the ultimate male fantasy -- sex with nothing on the side." Wounded, the male counselor says, "But I like you." Pixel says, "Well, are we gonna do it or what, because I haven't packed yet.")
Talking abut Pixel, Taryn says, "It's such an ideal little part." She is not bothered by the sexual content. If she were, she might have a hard time finding work. On the TV show "Popular," to be seen this fall on the WB network, one female character, ostensibly a high-school sophomore, worries about whether it seems too forward to bring the condoms on her date with her boyfriend. In the pilot for "Manchester Prep," a show modeled on the teen film "Cruel Intentions," a teen-age girl walks into her stepbrother's shower and appraises his genitals.
When Taryn meets Payne, the executive with Tisch, he leads her into a small office and compliments her on her "reel," a four-scene videotape of her performances that her manager has sent over. Tisch is developing a few films that might be right for Taryn; the most interesting is "Last Train to Memphis," based on Peter Guralnick's book about Elvis Presley's early years. "It's sort of a teen movie," Payne says. "We've been out to Leonardo DiCaprio for a long time."
Taryn would play Elvis's girlfriend in high school. "It's not a huge part, but it might be good," Payne explains.
Taryn hasn't read the book, but she's excited. "Leo, huh?" she says, rather slyly.
"Yes," says Payne. "We'll bring you in to read, but by then you may not want to. You might be famous already."
Taryn smiles. "Like Elvis?" she asks, flirting. "Like Elvis," says Payne.
It is a breezy Monday night around 10 p.m., and Taryn and her roommate, Paloma Fierro, who is also an aspiring actress, are driving Paloma's little white Toyota to Dublin's, a theme-park version of an Irish bar on Sunset Strip. Monday nights are the unofficial industry night at Dublin's, and the upstairs bar area is reserved for the young. Nikki comes here sometimes -- there is a Polaroid of her at Dublin's in her purse -- but tonight she's at a celebrity hockey event: a guy she has a crush on is playing.
"The girl with the list thinks I'm famous," whispers Taryn, who is wearing a dress with bloomerlike pants. As expected, the girl with the list nods and lets Paloma and Taryn past, not checking to see if they are 21, which they are not. "Word has it that Leo comes here on Mondays," Taryn says. "Or that he used to."
Inside, at a corner table, Shane West is standing with a group of guys. He is blond and is wearing the uniform of a young male in Hollywood: baggy jeans, tight white undershirt, leather jacket. Shane is strikingly handsome. "What a cutie," Taryn says, brushing past. "And I'm picky." Shane and Taryn have never met, but she knows his girlfriend, who is playing pool across the room when Taryn spots her. "That girl has been with every guy in the place," Taryn sniffs. "Shane West could do a lot better."
Shane is kind of celebrating tonight. Last week, he wrapped his first starring role in a movie, a comedy called "I'll Be You" based loosely on "Cyrano de Bergerac," and this afternoon, he finished the first day of rehearsal on his new TV show, "Once and Again," which was created by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz and is one of the more highly touted new shows this fall. Zwick and Herskovitz were the creators of "Thirtysomething" and also produced "My So-Called Life," which was not a ratings success but propelled the careers of Claire Danes and Jared Leto, two of the first teen-age stars of this generation. "I didn't like 'My So-Called Life,"' says Shane, who just turned 21 and plays a troubled high-school jock on "Once and Again." "And I was too young to have seen 'Thirtysomething."'
Shane takes a deep sip from his Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola. The waitress knows him, and she keeps showing up with free drinks for Shane and his seven actor buddies, one of whom is Colin Hanks, the teen-age son of Tom. All these guys are working: Colin is on "Roswell," a new teen-alien drama on WB; Brandon Quinn is in "Big Wolf on Campus," a Fox Family Network show about a crime-fighting werewolf; Manu Intiraymi plays the geek friend in "I'll Be You," and so on. There are even more opportunities for boys in this youthquake than girls. "Everyone wants you for everything," Shane says matter-of-factly. "And I end up passing a lot. I'm picky. 'I'll Be You' will probably be my last teen movie. I don't think I want to do another one. I don't want to get stuck."
Manu, who is tall and has very clear eyes, smirks, as if to say, We may not have a choice. "The goal for all of us it to become like a Leo or a Johnny Depp," he says. "They've transcended the teen-movie genre. We don't want to do stupid movies, but we do want to work. You have to weigh opportunity versus quality." Manu swigs some beer. "For me, opportunity still wins."
Shane, who is not really listening, throws an arm around Manu's shoulder. Manu is reading for the part of a geeky counselor in "Happy Campers" tomorrow, a script that Shane rejected. It hasn't always been this easy to say no. When he first moved to L.A. nearly five years ago, from the Southern California town of Norwalk, Shane couldn't get work. He was living at his manager's house and struggled for two years. But that's behind him now. "It's like a dream," he says to no one in particular. But it's not a dream so much as a well-placed bet. "Economics have created this youth boom," Josh Lieberman, Shane West's agent, had told me. "The margin of profit for a film made with five unknowns is greater than a film with an actor who may or may not have had a hit and costs $10 million."
Shane wanders off to check on his girlfriend. They've been going out for three months. Last year, Shane dated the actress Rachel Leigh Cook, who looks like a baby Winona Ryder, for seven months. Shane's current girlfriend refuses to let Shane rent Cook's big-screen hit, "She's All That." "It's a problem that I'm working so much and my girlfriend isn't," Shane confides. "She's a little older, around 28, and it's hard. She's beautiful, but she doesn't look like a high-school girl."
Taryn and Paloma walk past Shane's crowded table on their way to the dance floor. A mutual acquaintance stops them and introduces Taryn to Shane, who is polite but just so slightly snobby. He's a star, and she's an unknown. It's a high-school moment for 20-year-olds, with Shane playing the most popular, cutest boy and Taryn as the pretty but slightly awkward girl. It could be a movie. It is a movie.
Four days later, after the evening at Dublin's, Shane breaks up with his girlfriend. "I was losing my focus," he explains over the phone. "I could tell it was only a matter of time before the topic of marriage would be raised, and I felt like right now I needed to be single." He pauses, then asks: "Do you know Jessica Alba? She's a very cute girl. I helped her pick up her car once. We were hanging around this apartment building, and she needed help with her car. Last week, somebody promised to give her my phone number. Do you know her? Could you tell her hello?"
Jessica Alba, who is 18, will star as Max, a genetically enhanced teen-ager, in "Dark Angel," a TV drama by James Cameron and Charles Eglee set in the year 2020 and scheduled as a midseason replacement show sometime early next year. The "Dark Angel" story line: As a small child, Max escaped from a research facility, and now the government is trying to find her as she searches for her past. "The character is the surrogate for the adolescent audience," says Eglee, who won an Emmy for "N.Y.P.D. Blue" and is the executive producer of "Dark Angel." "Max feels a little like a Frankenstein, but how many kids that age don't feel like a Frankenstein?"
This is Cameron's first project since the enormous success of "Titanic" and his first TV show ever. He and Eglee saw 1,000 girls for the part of Max before they chose Jessica Alba. They originally wanted a black girl, but Jessica's ethnic-mix beauty knocked them out. "And she could really act," Eglee says. "You can get caught up in the magic of these incredible creatures coming in, but they have to be able to act. There was tremendous pressure during casting. We'd be done with the auditions, and the casting agents would say, 'If you want this girl, you have to make a deal right away.' That's when I realized this teen thing had really gone crazy."
Jessica, who has been acting steadily since she was 12, said at first she didn't want to do a TV show. She has skin the color of coffee with cream and beautiful almond eyes. She is sitting on the patio of the restaurant Orso, eating pizza for lunch. She is wearing jeans and a rose-colored, intricately wrinkled Issey Miyake top. After co-starring last year in the teen-movie hit "Never Been Kissed," she got several offers but was wary of getting stuck in the teen-age genre. "They were calling me for everything," she says, and then adds diplomatically: "I'm so lucky that the teens are in demand. But I don't really want to be part of that. People blow up, and you're so overexposed, and then what do you do? I am young, and I don't need to compromise. So I didn't work for eight months, which is the longest I've ever gone. I just had the faith that I was waiting for something really great."
During her time off, Jessica and her best friend, who is also named Jessica, Jessica Moe, would hang out together. On New Year's Eve, they went to a party thrown by Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore. The Jessicas are a study in counterpoint: Alba is dark and exotic; Moe, who is 16, is blond and blue-eyed. (Moe wants to be an actress too. She recently landed a car commercial, which means she can get her Screen Actors Guild card.) At the New Year's party, the Jessicas began dancing together. Both girls still live with their parents in a suburb 45 minutes outside of L.A., so they are not really in the scene. "Here were these beautiful girls dancing together," says an agent at C.A.A. who saw them that night. "They cleared the floor. It was every man's fantasy."
The story went around that Jim Cameron heard about the dancing and said, "Get me that girl." Jessica doesn't think so. "I think I heard that the casting agent told my agent that we were dancing together," says Jessica, sounding amused. ("Oh, yes," says Jane Berliner, Alba's agent at C.A.A. "Whenever they dance, the calls pour in.") "But I don't think our dancing had anything to do with 'Dark Angel."'
Since its premise is original, "Dark Angel" has an opportunity to push, at least a little, the boundaries of the genre. "That's why I did it," Jessica explains. "And also I think it won't just appeal to girls."
"What are you saying?" says Jessica Moe, who has just come back from getting her cousin's car washed. Moe has pinned up her blond hair with butterfly barrettes and is wearing sky-blue corduroy jeans and a cropped pink T-shirt that shows off her belly.
"Have you eaten?" Jessica asks, offering Moe some pizza. Then, to me, she says: "I have to train with Jim Cameron's trainer five days a week for 'Dark Angel,' and we work out together. Moe watches my back." Jessica pauses. "Did you talk to your agent?" she asks.
Moe nods, looking a bit dejected.
"Your agent doesn't send you out on anything," Jessica says. "She's rude. The trouble is, you just don't look 17."
Moe laughs. "Yeah," she says, "older guys are always asking me, 'How old are you?"'
Jessica laughs. "Your problem is you look 25," she says. "What are you going to do? The girl's got boobs and you can't escape them." The girls crack up.
"But it'll happen," Jessica says reassuringly. Moe nods and gets ready to leave the restaurant. "You just have to be seen. Once they see you, it'll be all over."
They all know Nikki at La Scala, an Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. She is here two or three days a week, always walking in through the kitchen ("like in 'Goodfellas,"' she says), always ordering her usual, a vegetarian chopped salad with extra tomatoes. She's been a vegetarian since childhood, when, she says, she read that Brooke Shields, then a teen-age model, ate no meat.
Today, as always, La Scala's hostess, who is teaching Nikki French, guides her to a coveted booth. Nikki is wearing a magenta nylon half-slip and a white backless top that ties like a halter. As she walks to her booth, she says hello to an overly tanned man that she recognizes. "You look pretty," the man says. Nikki smiles big and curtsies slightly.
Nikki has just come from a screening of "Liberty Heights," a Barry Levinson film set in Baltimore in the 50's. The movie is about the clash between the WASP, Jewish and black communities, as seen through the eyes of a Jewish boy, played by Ben Foster, one of the more serious of the teen-age leading men. Shane West is in "Liberty Heights," playing the cute best friend of the principal WASP, but it is Foster's movie. "I love Ben," Nikki says. "Last week, we were at a party together singing karaoke. And I love Adrien" -- Brody, who plays Foster's older brother in the film and was in Spike Lee's "Summer of Sam." "We are so close! He is best friends with my ex-boyfriend, Alex, who was the guy in that Levi's ad in the elevator. Adrien is so great. He came to my birthday party at Indochine. I wore a black Calvin Klein dress with my hair pulled back. It was really pretty. I was still blond. This hair is so much better. As a brunette, I feel . . . Latin."
Back when she was a blonde, Nikki auditioned for the role of the goddess WASP in "Liberty Heights." The part went to a Grace Kelly-like model named Carolyn Murphy, who is now considered one to watch. "It was between her and me," Nikki says. "Sometimes I'll be so close to getting something, and they'll say: 'We love Nikki. Her read was amazing, and she's going to be a huge star, but she doesn't have the right look.' And I'm like, Are you kidding me?" She pauses. "Did you think Carolyn Murphy's eyes looked really blue? I think she used those drops from England that make your eyes look superblue."
The salad arrives, and Nikki digs in. "It was between me and that girl in 'American Pie,"' Nikki continues. "You know, the foreign exchange student who takes her clothes off. I would have made them rewrite the part. I don't believe in nudity. I mean, it's one thing if I'm in a David Lynch movie or if I'm working opposite De Niro and Martin Scorsese is directing, but a bubble-gum movie about a bunch of high-school kids -- that's not acting to me. I don't want to be the cute young girl who takes her top off."
Maybe that is why, like so many young actors and actresses, Nikki is writing a script. "It's about my ex-boyfriend, a hairdresser," Nikki explains between bites. "It's about sex and love and romance, and right now I'm meeting with writers to find someone who can help me finish it. There's a great part for me." She giggles. "I get to play me!"
This week, Nikki has gone on some general auditions, and this afternoon, she's seeing a producer about an independent, yet-to-be-set-up movie called "The Meyersons." She still hasn't heard back on the part in "Dawson's Creek," but she has met with her acting coach about a role in a short film called "The Four Faces of God." "I'm still waiting to hear about 'Coyote Ugly,"' she says. "I'm so close on that."
I'd read that morning in Daily Variety that an actress named Piper Perabo was cast in "Coyote Ugly" in the part of Violet, the aspiring songwriter who works in the bar. When I tentatively mention this to Nikki, she shouts, "You are kidding!" She drops her fork and starts searching for her cell phone in her cavernous Prada bag. "I can't believe this," she says. "I have to call Stephanie. That was my part."
Nikki can't find her phone -- she's left it in the car -- and she is so upset that she just stares for a while. Then she asks, "Do you know how old this girl is?"
It is a Saturday night, and Taryn is calling Nikki. "It's getting to the point where I can't stand to be around her," she says as she taps out Nikki's number. Taryn is sitting on the couch in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with Paloma. It's a modern building deep in Hollywood, but they've decorated it with a certain boho flair. The living room is furnished with a big overstuffed purple chair they found in the trash, and an Indian bedspread covers the sofa. Two kittens play in the corner of the room, and there are scented candles everywhere. Taryn, who is wearing bell-bottomed, high-waisted jeans and a yellow T-shirt, bought a 34-inch TV with a check from one of the pilots she did. But the cable isn't hooked up, and they use the set only to watch movies and tapes of "The Simpsons."
"Nikki told me to keep in touch, so I'm keeping in touch," says Taryn. "I think Nikki's going to this party at the Playboy mansion tonight." Paloma is due home soon from her full-time waitress job at Kings Road Cafe, an actor-writer hangout on Beverly, and Taryn isn't sure what her plans are for the evening. "But Nikki would never invite me," Taryn continues. "No way."
She calls, and Nikki tells Taryn that she's staying in, that she doesn't want to go to the Playboy mansion after all.
"I don't think she was invited," Taryn says, hanging up. "'Cause if you're invited to that party, you go." Taryn laughs. "Especially if you're Nikki. Then you really go. The other night, we went to a bar, and she was fluttering around, making her rounds. I just hope it gets her work."
Taryn has another call. There is an actor who wants to take her out, but she doesn't want a boyfriend. "Not until I'm famous," she says. "Because then I get to choose."
She gets up, walks to the TV and slips in a videocassette of a dance competition she won in high school. Her routine is elaborate: one part cheerleading, one part classic ballet turns and leaps. She is an excellent dancer. "All these colleges approached me for scholarships when we won," she says. "But I said, No, I'm going to be an actress."
In a few days, Taryn's going to audition for an independent film called "A Time for Dancing." She would play a 16-year-old dancer whose best friend, also a dancer, is dying of cancer. "It's a part any girl my age would kill to play," Taryn says. "It has so many layers."
The front door opens, and Paloma, dressed in her work uniform of black jeans, a tight black T-shirt and green tennis shoes, plops down on the living-room floor. She looks exhausted. Her 21st birthday is in 10 days and she's frustrated that her acting career is nowhere. Taryn arranged for her to meet with her agent, but they weren't interested in signing Paloma.
"And she's so funny, she should do comedy," says Taryn.
Paloma looks blank. "I'm a voluptuous type girl," she says, rather forlornly. "I see actors and actresses at my job all day long, and I hear what they're talking about, and I know that I'm just as good, but I never get to go out on anything.
"I'm going to change," she says, getting up. She walks into her bedroom, which is decorated in shades of green. (Taryn's room has a leopard theme.)
"She cries," says Taryn, staring after her. "She sees all the scripts I have at home, and she's so talented, and she cries." Taryn walks down the hall toward Paloma's room. "If only you looked 15," Taryn says, standing in her doorway. She is half-joking, trying to cheer Paloma up.
"I'm just too old," Paloma says. "I'm 21, and that's just too old."
Jessica Alba could have gone to the wrap party for Shane West's movie, "I'll Be You," but she didn't want to go. "I'd go to say hello to Shane, but I know what that party's going to be like," says Jessica, who is with Jessica Moe at one of their favorite places, a Middle Eastern restaurant that has a belly dancer on the weekends. They were invited to the Playboy party and the "American Pie" premiere, but in the last month they have gone to only one Hollywood event, a small birthday party for Jessica Alba's agent. "I've seen a lot," says Jessica, sounding much older than 18. "And I think, Do you want to be hyped for three seconds, or is it about the work? It's really hard when success comes fast, but I've been to those premieres, and they're only interested in you if you're somebody. Now they tell me, 'You'll be the next big thing.' I don't pay attention. I don't. I can't." She pauses. "If I'm going to be in this forever, I don't need to blow up right now."
And yet she is going to be on the cover of Details, and magazines ranging from Teen People to GQ to Vanity Fair are calling her manager with interview requests. "It's embarrassing," Jessica says. "I'm just trying to do great work. I talk to actors my age, and they are all writing a script or comparing themselves to Brando, and I want to say: 'You're a 20-year-old ex-model. Shut your face!"' Moe laughs. She listens hard to Jessica, whose years of experience have made her wary. Both girls study acting at the Atlantic Theater Company, a school founded by David Mamet and the actor William H. Macy. Two summers ago, Jessica went by herself to a six-week intensive acting program run by Atlantic Theater in Vermont. "It was an eye-opener," she says. "Out here, everyone just wants you to be natural, natural, natural. There's no emphasis on training. But only a very few actors are naturals. You have to study. It's not enough to be cute."
For the most part, teen actors are not expected to have much acting ability. Mostly, it's geared to looks. Do you look young? Can you play sexy? Will little girls like you? If you turn out to be talented at acting, that's nice too, but it's not the primary criterion. "Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor," says Scott Karp, who manages Taryn Manning, "but he's not getting $20 million a movie because he's a great actor, but because he's a teen idol."
Another day, another pink outfit, and Nikki is running late for her postponed meeting on "The Meyersons," a dark comedy about a messed-up family. "It sounds great," says Nikki, sounding cheerful. "I don't even know what the part is. I have to check my messages." She is trying to park, trying to dial, trying to check her hair in the rear-view mirror. It is a lot. "You know," she says, "I auditioned for the new Bond girl. They said I'm too young, maybe in five years. I said, 'In five years, I won't be doing this."'
Nikki laughs. Then, pleased with her appearance ("Do you like this shirt?" she asks, adjusting the neckline of her Daisy Mae-type top), she gets out of the car. She can't recall the name of the production company and flirts her way past the security guard at the desk. Eventually, she remembers, and Sandi Richter, the producer of the film, greets Nikki and takes her into a large, empty conference room. "I'm excited about 'The Morrisons,"' Nikki begins.
"It's 'The Meyersons,"' Richter corrects.
Nikki giggles.
"I like the brunette," Richter says.
"Do you?" Nikki says. "You know, I'm a blond baby."
"C'mon," says Richter.
"No, no, it's natural," Nikki says.
They discuss Nikki's work and the script she is writing ("There's sex and love and money, and it's great") and then Richter describes "The Meyersons."
"It's a sort of hip, raunchy social satire that takes place over one week," he says. "There are three sons, and each is in a different situation."
Nikki nods. "So what's my role?" she asks.
"The high-school tramp has an affair with the husband," Richter says. "And then there's a nice college girl who's dating one of the sons. If Woody Allen did 'Happiness,' it would be this movie."
Nikki stares a second. "I can play high school," she says. "I always play the bad girls."
Richter nods and says, "Well, it depends who we get to play the father. The high-school girl has to be a real Lolita."
Nikki leans forward. "That sounds good," she says.
"The movie is young," Richter says. "Did you see 'American Pie'?"
Nikki winces. "It was between me and that girl who played the foreign exchange student."
Richter sympathizes. "Next time," he says, "I can tell you're going to do very well."
Nikki absorbs the compliment. "That's what I hear!" she sings, sensing the meeting is over. "That's what they say!"
There are six messages waiting on Nikki's phone when she leaves the meeting. She has two commercial auditions, and her agent has called to say she is not right for "Happy Campers."
"I'm still waiting to hear about 'Dawson's Creek,"' Nikki says, walking to her car. "And hopefully I'm going back in on 'Coyote Ugly."' Her manager also arranged a meeting for her with the people doing "Jack & Jill," a 20-something TV show that will be on WB in the fall. "It's so cute," says Nikki. "Jack is a girl, and Jill is a guy, and they live in Manhattan."
After some searching, she finds her car and calls her manager. "Tell Stephanie 'The Meyersons' went really well," she tells the assistant. "I think they really liked me."
Tonight, Nikki plans to go to the Whiskey, a bar where she'll meet Chris Barish, whose father, Keith, was co-founder Planet Hollywood, which intends to declare bankruptcy. "I think Chris has a crush on me," Nikki says. "And everyone says, Don't you want a boyfriend? I'm always, like, No, I don't want a boyfriend. And besides, a lot of guys are afraid of me. I'm very independent, and guys don't like that. I want to be single until the stereotype of Mr. Big comes along. Mr. Big will add to me. These other guys take away." Nikki pauses. "Maybe my Mr. Big is being the star of a movie," she sighs. "Work is better than any guy."
There is a happy ending. Or at least, true to the genre, the ending is predictable. Shane West is busy shooting his TV show. "In this episode," he says, calling from the car, "I defend my sister and blow up at my father." Through a third party, he has invited Jessica Alba to a barbecue at a mutual friend's house, but she wasn't sure she and Moe would go. They're still training as many as five days a week, and they've been hanging out with members of the U.C.L.A. football team. "They're rad guys," Jessica says. Moe is looking for a new agent. "She's too beautiful not to get seen," says Jessica. "It's only a matter of when."
After only two auditions, Taryn landed her first starring role, in the movie "A Time for Dancing." Paloma was happy for her, but her own prospects look dim. "I can't believe it," says Taryn. "I've been in L.A. for less than a year and I've already gotten my first lead in a movie." When she called Nikki to tell her the good news, Nikki countered with news of her own: she was cast as Maureen, "a sharp, feisty girl in her early 20's" on "Jack & Jill." It's a guest role on one episode, but it's a shot.
This is all happening so fast, it's hard to know how it will end up in, say, five years, when the teen-age audience is edging up in their 20's. No doubt the money will follow the Demographic. Maybe Jessica or Taryn or Nikki will become a star. Maybe one of them will marry a dentist.
Nobody is looking that far ahead. Well, actually Shane West is. "This is just the beginning," he assures me. "I don't think I'll really peak until I'm 30." He pauses. "Like it or not, you're looking at the future."

BYLINE: By Robert Wright

 BODY:
Suppose you had just spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build and launch a satellite and were planning to recoup the investment by selling the satellite's pictures. Chances are you would be pretty good at thinking up reasons that someone might want to buy images from outer space. At any rate, John Copple is.
Copple is the C.E.O. of Space Imaging, whose Ikonos satellite -- assuming the Sept. 24 launch goes as planned -- will offer the finest-grained pictures ever sold on the open market. "Where do I want to park the boat?" asks Copple, who is not, actually, in a boat, but is imagining himself in the shoes of a data-poor sports fisherman. "I want to fish where there's a lot of underbrush underneath the water, so the fish population has a lot of food." The solution is obvious. Ikonos "can see into the water quite a ways." 
 Fishing is not the only endeavor now plagued by primitive uncertainty. There's also hiking. But by taking a "3-D fly-through of Yellowstone Park," you could choose the most scenic trail before leaving home. Or maybe you're in the real-estate market, scouring the hills for choice acreage. Or you're in the swimming pool business, combing the city for affluent addresses with large backyards but no pools. Or you're a farmer who wants to use "multispectral" imagery to see which crops are in distress before they visibly falter.
There is, however, one use of Ikonos imagery that Copple does not bring up -- and that, when pressed, he plays down. It's the use for which reconnaissance satellites were invented four decades ago: reconnaissance. Vipin Gupta, a remote-sensing expert at Sandia National Laboratories, is more voluble on the subject. "In the short term, make no mistake, they're marketing for defense and intelligence applications," he says of Space Imaging and the several competing companies that plan to enter the high-resolution imaging business. "Governments have been willing to pay big money for this kind of data."
This is what makes Ikonos a geopolitical milestone. Able to discern objects only a few feet wide -- to see at "one-meter resolution" -- it will give presidents, generals and assorted political actors around the globe a kind of power once confined to elite nations.
This democratization is not universally celebrated. Among the ambivalent: high-tech nations, like Israel, with low-tech enemies, and sole-remaining-superpowers accustomed to kicking around tinhorn dictators. If Saddam Hussein had got his hands on good satellite imagery during the Persian Gulf war, Iraq could have anticipated Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's famous "left hook" maneuver and turned it into a bit less of a cakewalk.
Faced with such prospects, the United States is struggling to preserve a strategic edge. Some approaches are peaceful, like denying commercial licenses for certain types of imagery or reserving the legal right to exercise emergency "shutter control" over American-owned satellites -- that is, reserving the right to blind a satellite company's customers. Other approaches are not so peaceful, like developing a ground-based laser that could convert satellites -- including those that belong to American companies -- into insensate hunks of warm metal in time of national peril. According to a report issued last year by the United States Space Command, America must be able to assert the "control of space" whenever necessary.
That's one view. Another view is that everyone should calm down. In this view, the "age of transparency," as the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke has called it, will be a wonderful thing. In his 1987 novel, "2061: Odyssey Three," Clarke envisioned a time when, with everyone keeping an eye on everyone else, surprise attacks would be impossible and war among great powers unthinkable.
For the policy doctrine in search of Washington credibility, being championed by a science-fiction writer is not necessarily an asset. But a measured version of the Clarke scenario is now being used by some Washington policy analysts. "Symmetrical transparency will be a good thing in the long run for peace," says Ann Florini of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
So why isn't transparency being hailed by more people in Government? Because, Florini says, they don't get paid to think about the long run. They're in the business of day-to-day crisis control -- handling the Husseins of the world, struggling for tactical advantage. "They're in the habit of fighting this fire right now, and it's easier to fight this fire right now if you have control over the information flow."
So, as Ikonos awaits its debut, there is disagreement over what to worry about. In some parts of Government, the worry is that the era signaled by Ikonos will be bad for national security and world peace. In some think tanks, the worry is that this attitude could itself be bad for national security and world peace -- that the United States will spend its time trying vainly to forestall the age of transparency rather than shaping it to benign ends.
What everyone agrees on is that things are going to change. The era of commercially available high-resolution satellite imagery has been falsely proclaimed for years. Launches have been delayed and delayed again -- or, worse still, have failed. In fact, an earlier Ikonos, launched in April, never reached orbit, thanks to a faulty rocket. But with Ikonos ready to go and two comparable commercial satellites due up in space in 2000, the age of transparency now seems sure to dawn one way or another. Within a year, "we're going to see takeoff finally occur -- for better or worse," says John Baker, formerly of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and now a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation.
If Ikonos gets up and running, it will hardly be the first satellite offering salable pictures. But its one-meter-resolution images will be unique. Unlike the 10-meter images available from the French SPOT satellites and the 5-meter images available from India, the pictures from Ikonos will get analysts close enough to discern missile launchers and tanks and distinguish between fighter planes and bombers. Moreover, unlike the two-meter images sold by Russia, the Ikonos images aren't hobbled by Sputnik-era technology. The Russians still parachute their film to earth; under ideal conditions a picture is available nine days after it is shot, and the wait has been known to take months. Space Imaging, under ideal circumstances, can get a preliminary image out 30 minutes after the shutter snaps. Five-day-old images will qualify as archival and sell for $30 to $300 per square mile of mapped surface on the company's Web site.
This combination of clarity and speed is what gives American military planners the creeps. And the combination will grow only more pervasive. Ikonos, circling the globe on a north-south axis twice a day, and swiveling east to west from its 420-mile-high perch, will render the average piece of turf visible once every three days. If Space Imaging's two American competitors, Orbital Imaging Corporation and Earthwatch, stay on their launch schedules, visibility could reach once a day within a year.
American attempts to forestall transparency will have to contend with the force that confounds various national policies these days -- global competition. Consider a restraint that Congress, with State Department support, has placed on satellites launched by American companies: it is now illegal to take high-resolution pictures of Israel. Naturally, this makes American satellites less attractive to some customers (Israeli businesses, certainly). So does the general uncertainty spawned by the Clinton Administration's elastic shutter-control rules, which give the Government the power to shut down satellites not just to protect "national security" but also when "international obligations or foreign policy interests may be compromised." Eventually, you would expect satellite entrepreneurs to avoid these liabilities by incorporating in hands-off places like the Cayman Islands.
Sure enough, by next year, if all goes according to plan, one-meter images will be available from West Indian Space Ltd., a Cayman Islands company. (It is a joint venture involving an American company and Israel Aircraft Industries, which is owned by the same Israeli Government that successfully lobbied to fetter high-resolution American satellites. If you would like energetic elaboration on this paradox, contact lobbyists from American satellite companies.)
And so it will go. In the long run, the more the American Government tries to control commercial satellites, the fewer American commercial satellites there will be to control. In the fall of 1997, Orbital Imaging asked permission to sell data from a planned "hyperspectral" satellite, Orb View-4. Such a satellite could detect camouflage, help find underground minerals and maybe even sense genetically distinct strains of corn and other crops (in which case, agribusinesses like Monsanto might use it to hunt down farmers planting bootlegged copies of proprietary seed). Finally, in April, the Administration rendered a verdict: yes, Orbital can sell hyperspectral images, but currently only at 24-meter resolution, not at Orb View's 8-meter capacity. Expect the next hyperspectral satellite to come from a more laissez-faire nation.
In an especially vigorous exercise in futility, the United States has tried to impede the launch of a foreign commercial satellite. The Canadian company Macdonald Dettwiler expected NASA to launch its three-meter-resolution radar satellite, Radarsat-2, which was slated to make its debut in 2002. But radar satellites can see through clouds and at night, something the Pentagon has said it doesn't want just anybody to be able to do at resolutions finer than five meters. Early this year, NASA started balking at handling the launch. So the Canadians, not surprisingly, have started exploring the possibility of a European launch.
The coming age of transparency has received so little attention in Washington policy circles that to speak of a conventional wisdom is premature. Still, there is a small community of transparency ponderers, and their discourse to date, when synthesized and stripped of bothersome academic caveats and qualifications, yields a few basic generalizations.
Rule No. 1 is almost self-evident: as transparency is imposed on all nations from above, closed societies, like North Korea, have more secrets to lose than open societies, like our own. This rule hasn't kept American officials from worrying. At a conference on remote sensing earlier this year, a speaker from the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates U.S. spy satellites and weighs in on commercial satellite licensing (along with the C.I.A. and the State, Defense and Commerce Departments), warned that "soon Hezbollah and Osama bin Laden are going to have access to a one-meter image of -- you pick it -- the state Capitol at Albany, N.Y., the White House, the Congress, the Pentagon."
Actually, if Osama bin Laden wants an overhead view of the Pentagon, he should check out the Web site of the National Reconnaissance Office. Among the images at nro.odci.gov is a nice satellite shot of the building from Government archives. It's not at one-meter resolution, but crisper shots taken from airplanes are available at Washington souvenir stores.
Besides, most terrorists would just as soon blow up a bus station as a Federal building -- and they deliver bombs by car, not plane. "A terrorist doesn't need satellite imagery," says Bhupendra Jasani, a remote-sensing expert at Kings College, in London. For the most part, "terrorists just want to create chaos."
Granted, terrorists may eventually be able to send smart missiles or smart bombs by combining overhead pictures with data from global-positioning satellites. But whether the target is the Pentagon, the White House or your house, getting the overhead pictures will be the easy part, with or without Ikonos. All in all, then, it seems safe to enunciate Rule No. 2: the coming generation of high-resolution commercial satellites won't be a big boon for terrorists.
That is why the people trying to wrap their minds around the age of transparency are giving most of their thought to war between nations. One result is Rule No. 3: in your classic nuclear standoff, symmetrical transparency can lessen the chances of war.
"I've been in satellite imagery since 1962," says Brian Gordon, who used to work for the Defense Intelligence Agency and whose company, Direct Information Access Corporation, analyzes pictures for Space Imaging and its competitors. "I've seen the effect of our knowing what the Soviets were doing and vice versa." After Soviet and American spy satellites went aloft in the early 1960's, "paranoia diminished."
To put the logic in a contemporary setting: if Pakistan knows that India isn't mobilizing an assault and India knows the same about Pakistan, then, in theory, neither trigger finger will get defensively itchy, and if each side knows that the other side is watching, both will indeed be less likely to mobilize an assault.
Of course, if satellites gave you a clear view of your enemy's missiles, you might start thinking you could wipe them out with a pre-emptive strike -- that a nuclear war would be "winnable." Still, various real-world factors would make it hard to put much faith in such a strategy. For example, for all you know your victim might "launch on warning" and retaliate as soon as your missiles were seen heading over the border.
For this and other reasons, it remains highly unlikely that a rational leader would gamble on a first strike. So long as that is true, what starts nuclear wars isn't a nation deciding to attack, but rather a nation wrongly perceiving that it is under attack. And if warped perception is the problem, accurate information, capably interpreted, is part of the solution.
In the realm of conventional war, alas, warped perception isn't the only problem. Conventional wars are winnable, a first strike thus rational and high-resolution targeting data potentially dangerous. Before invading Kuwait, Saddam Hussein bought imagery from the French SPOT satellites -- a measly 10-meter resolution, but better than nothing. (France cut off Hussein's access before the allied invasion.)
Of course, satellites can also help deter aggression, since troops massing on borders are vivid from above. Hence Rule No. 4: when it comes to conventional war, there are no simple rules. Transparency can plausibly be a tool for good or ill.
Even here, though, good may have an edge. Consider the Spratly Islands, in the South China Sea. They are a place of perpetual argument among a half-dozen nations over who owns which chunk of land. China has done some stealthy construction work in a part of the Spratly Islands known (no kidding) as Mischief Reef, ostensibly to provide shelters for its fishermen. Last year the Philippine Government, another Spratly disputant, took aerial photos and noticed some oddities about this particular fishing-shelter-refurbishing project: new barrackslike structures and satellite receivers. And were those platforms by any chance gun emplacements?
The big question is whether China would have been less assertive had it known it was going to be on candid camera. As it happens, a partial answer was provided late last year by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, irrepressible Republican of California. The Congressman used a Philippine Government plane to fly over and take pictures of Chinese ships in the region. According to The Manila Times, China -- having caught wind of the photo op -- withdrew its major combat ships, though Rohrabacher did get pictures of several remaining vessels.
Unfortunately for world peace, Rohrabacher can't spend all his time in a plane circling the Spratly Islands. But half a dozen high-resolution satellites could have the same effect.
Satellites have other advantages over airplanes, notes Baker, the policy analyst; he plans to use Ikonos imagery to test the hypothesis that commercial satellites could stabilize the Spratly Islands. Satellites aren't intrusive -- they can legally pass over anyone's territory, which means that they don't start incidents that start wars.
Baker is guardedly optimistic about transparency. Though it can help bad guys as well as good guys, it makes surprise harder, and the typical war's inaugural surprise comes from the aggressor, not the victim. Of course, history is full of examples in which evidence of threatening maneuvers went unseen or misinterpreted or unpublicized. Witness America's lack of alarm over Iraqi troops poised to invade Kuwait. Or its inability to anticipate India's nuclear test last year. Or its apparent failure to make waves about China's Spratly constructions, which it presumably saw. (The best U.S. spy satellites have resolutions measured in inches.)
But that's the point. In the age of transparency, vigilance won't rest solely on the shoulders of a Government that may or may not notice warning signs, may or may not interpret them correctly, may or may not choose to publicize them. For starters, there will be television networks and magazines to publicize fresh satellite imagery. There will also be issue-oriented groups eager to air data that further their cause. In the case of the Spratly Islands, the conservative Heritage Foundation played this role, happily posting Rohrabacher's photos at www.heritage.org. Every issue has its Heritage Foundation, some nongovernmental actor -- corporate, nonprofit, whatever -- that wants to advertise misbehavior and might pay for the privilege. Armed with satellite shots, the Sierra Club could become a de facto enforcer of environmental treaties -- or at least an aggressive embarrasser of noncompliant nations.
In a way, it's just another step toward a global village. As the science-fiction writer David Brin stressed in his nonfiction book, "The Transparent Society," people in traditional villages know one another's business, and it is precisely this lack of privacy that keeps them on good behavior. (Happily, the satellites that keep national leaders feeling naked before the world won't have the same effect on the average citizen. Your neighbors can use a one-meter-resolution satellite to see if there's a swimming pool in your backyard, but they can't see who has been swimming there.)
All told, there seems to be grounds for formulating Rule No. 5: the age of transparency is a plus. Over time, it should help victims more than aggressors, prevent more wars than it starts and do an especially good job preventing nuclear wars. In this view -- the view of the transparency enthusiast -- the coming generation of commercial high-resolution satellites will become a vital global resource, a precious celestial membrane that could save the human species from itself.
You will search American space policy in vain for the phrase "precious celestial membrane," or for any grand plan to unite with other nations to protect outer space. The stated goal of the United States is to control space: to insure that America has the ability both to protect its own space assets and to destroy those of any other country.
This doctrine was spelled out last year in the report issued by the United States Space Command. It is a visionary tract that justifies itself in cosmic historical terms. "As sea commerce advanced in the 18th and 19th centuries," the report observes, "nations formed navies to project power and to protect and enhance their commercial interests. Similarly, during the westward expansion of the continental United States, military outposts and cavalry emerged to protect our wagon trains, settlements and railroads." And as outer space is commercialized . . . well, you get the picture.
Not noted in this manifesto is one big difference between sea and land on the one hand and space on the other. Space will increasingly house lots of sensitive satellites whose disruption might trigger the apocalypse; so turning it into a battlefield could be bad news.
This conclusion doesn't depend on your buying Rule No. 5. Even if the growing reliance on eyes in the sky isn't a net plus, the fact remains that the reliance is growing. And one thing everyone agrees on is that in a nuclear world, sudden widespread blindness is bad. It makes people edgy.
In some contexts, the Clinton Administration appreciates this logic. This New Year's Eve, as Y2K dawns, computer glitches could stop the flow of satellite data to various nations. The Administration plans to gather officials from Russia, and perhaps from other nuclear powers, at a "Center for Y2K Strategic Stability" in Colorado Springs, Colo. There the United States will share data coming in from its own Y2K-compliant systems. The idea is that it is in America's interest to keep sudden blindness from afflicting other nations in time of peace.
Presumably, if this is in America's interest on Jan. 1, 2000, it will be in America's interest thereafter -- an observation that raises some doubts about current policy. To wit: maybe the continued American development of antisatellite weapons (ASAT's), by spurring an arms race, could expose the world's satellites to catastrophic disruption. Maybe it would be a good idea to quit while we're ahead, or at least while we're not behind, if other nations will agree not even to enter the race.
Granted, verifying compliance with such a pledge would be tricky, to say the least. But that's no excuse for ignoring the problem, which seems to be the Administration's current frame of mind. The value and feasibility of an ASAT treaty -- whether a ban on the weapons themselves or (more feasibly) a ban on testing them -- is getting zero study in the arms control agency at the State Department.
In one sense, antisatellite weapons are no big deal. They are just one tool in the "space control" arsenal, along with tactics like bombing satellite dishes and jamming satellites. Indeed, the White House itself, recognizing that such weapons are a messy form of space control, deems them a tool of last resort and keeps the ASAT program alive partly in deference to Congress's Buck Rogers coalition, starring the Republican Senators Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Jon Kyl of Arizona.
Still, antisatellite weapons, however faint their profile in the space-control arsenal, serve as a sharp symbol of failure -- the failure to acknowledge the basic drift of things these days. With satellites, as with economics and so much else, a nation's sovereign control of its destiny is increasingly impractical, so control must be found in cooperation.
This isn't left-wing woolly-minded one-worldism. Well, actually, it is. But its core logic isn't exclusively left wing. Living testament to this fact is Henry Sokolski, a former adviser to Dan Quayle and now executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center. Sokolski is squeamish about transparency, bullish on antisatellite weapons and all for shutter control. But he realizes that unilateral shutter control is a futile game. Hence his woolly-minded multilateralist scheme: to forge an agreement with other nations under which we blind our satellites for them and they blind their satellites for us. One for all and all for one.
Nothing necessarily wrong with that. Even the average leftish transparency enthusiast realizes that there will be more wars, that some of those wars will be just and that during a just war symmetrical transparency is unfortunate. So most observers -- left, right and center -- accept that in wartime the United States would pull what strings it could peacefully and legitimately pull. And most think it would be nice to arrange in advance for coordinated string pulling -- something the Administration is just starting to explore.
But for the leftish transparency enthusiast, this would be only the beginning of the multilateralist schemes. There would also be a continuing and comprehensive version of the Y2K strategic-stability center: a place where analysts from, say, India and Pakistan could confront one another with alarming images and request explanation, as well as consult with third-party analysts. Such crisis control centers -- long advocated by Jasani, of Kings College -- will grow more important as the Matt Drudges of the world start publishing ambiguous satellite images along with alarmist half-baked analysis.
Some leftish schemes would include a concerted supranational effort to protect the whole satellite system from any one disruptive nation. If that meant surrendering America's prerogative to blind satellites unilaterally by shutter control, so be it. The idea is that the overall gain of preventing sudden apocalypse-inducing outages would dwarf the tactical edge lost in particular cases.
Actually, the United States could well lose that prerogative anyway. Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, has asked, What exactly is the difference between a satellite picture and regular photographs -- you know, the pictures that the First Amendment gives newspapers the right to publish regardless of the Pentagon's opinion of them? If her argument winds up in court and prevails there, the Government's broad criteria for shutter control will be history; in order to close a satellite's eyes, the White House will have to argue that there is a "clear and present danger" to national security -- and show it to a judge.
If the courts deem remote sensing a First Amendment issue, it isn't just shutter control that could suffer. After all, blowing up satellites is an equally effective means of hampering this particular form of free speech. And that includes foreign satellites, if they have American customers. It could be that a few years from now part of America's current strategic doctrine -- the unilateral "control of space" -- will be seen as unconstitutional. Not to mention a bad idea.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 9-5-99: The Ethicist;
A Taxing Dilemma

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
A woman cleans houses for several people. One withholds taxes; the others do not. But that lone tax form covers so little pay that she fears the I.R.S. will figure out she's also working off the books. She doesn't want to abandon the employer in question, and with a child to feed, she also needs her undocumented income. She doesn't want to get into trouble with the law. What can she do?
When New York City offers corporations multimillion-dollar tax breaks to do nothing and the Federal tax code is the least progressive it has been in decades (making it ever more possible for a housekeeper and Bill Gates to pay the same rate), it would be churlish to chide someone so hard-working and modestly paid. However, while working off the books might be justified ethically, working on the books is actually a better policy financially, thanks to the Earned Income Credit and the Child Tax Credit. And that means that the employer who files taxes is the one looking out for the housecleaner's best interests. 
 Say the woman in question cleans five houses a week at $60 a pop. That comes to about $3,000 from each employer, or a total of $15,000, a year. "Just considering Federal taxes, with one child and an income of $15,000, the housecleaner would owe nothing -- that's a $500 tax, less the $500 child credit," says Jim Weikart of Weikart Tax Associates. "Her E.I.C. will be $1,600 -- and that's not just taken off her taxes. She gets to keep any money left over -- in this case, the full amount, $1,600. Now, if her employer withheld her share of Social Security, she would owe $1,147.50 there, which the E.I.C. would cover. In fact, it nets the housecleaner about a $450 refund."
The employer's filing does put the housecleaner on the I.R.S. radar, but it also means more money in her pocket, and it does her good in other ways. It earns her Social Security coverage when she gets older, protects her and her child if she becomes disabled and makes her eligible for unemployment compensation. And it rescues her from the perilous position of breaking the law. So instead of worrying about whether she should abandon that employer, she would be better off trying to encourage the others to follow that lead.
What's more, Weikart points out that it may be easier than the woman thinks to persuade them to change their ways. "Many household employers want to do the right thing," he says, "but have had bad experiences with government. But recently these procedures have been streamlined, and it's much easier to comply."
And if the woman is lucky enough to clean for clients who aspire to seats on the Supreme Court, persuading them to file should be easier still.

The Baseball Treasures He Just Can't Part With

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW; Ira Berkow is a sports columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE nearly 80,000 items of baseball memorabilia -- from the gorgeously historic to the madly esoteric -- that filled the comfortable home of Barry Halper in Livingston, N.J., have mostly been packed up and shipped out. About 20 percent of his collection was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame, where a wing named for this collector non pareil has been built. Most of the rest of the collection will be sold at a weeklong auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan, begining on Sept. 23, which, according to Sotheby's, has a chance to break the house record of $34.4 million set by the sale of the Jackie Kennedy Onassis estate.
But in Mr. Halper's home, some things remain the same. He was unable to part with some items of value, for sentimental reasons. He was also unable to part with some items of perhaps little economic value, for the same heart-plucking reasons. He has held on to books and photographs signed "To my friend, Barry Halper" from the likes of Joe DiMaggio and George Brett, a lock of Babe Ruth's hair, a rubber glove once used by a doctor to examine Mickey Mantle, to name a few. 
 In Mr. Halper's spacious den, which is sectioned off into four rooms, are empty glass cases and barren areas on the walls. No longer can one peer into the window in one part of the wood paneling and see, with a flick of a switch, 1,053 baseball uniforms come rolling past on a dry cleaner's carousel. Many of the uniforms are signed; they include those worn by Cap Anson for the 1888 Chicago White Stockings, Jim Thorpe for the 1918 New York Giants and Jackie Robinson when he played for Kansas City of the Negro leagues in 1946; others belonged to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays and Pete Rose. (About the only things left on the carousel are a few of Mr. Halper's seldom worn suits and some dresses that belong to his wife, Sharon.)
Gone from his home, as well as from warehouses where the rest of his collection was kept, are the baseball treasures he compiled over a half century. Mr. Halper, now 60, began his quest when he was 8 years old and continued it through his years as a partner in the family's wholesale paper business, now defunct, in New Jersey. He went about collecting with a determination, a passion, sometimes with an obsession that some people might reserve for, say, a different kind of amour.
The list of what he has got rid of is staggering. Gone are the myriad baseball gloves and shoes and caps and bats. One bat, for example, bore the signature of Earl Averill, the Hall of Fame outfielder, who signed it for Mr. Halper a month before his death. Gone, too, are the mountains of signed baseballs and photographs and rarest of baseball cards and letters and contracts and trophies. And, alas, gone as well is the first issue of Playboy Magazine, published in 1953, with Marilyn Monroe on the cover and in the centerfold. Mr. Halper asked her husband, Joe DiMaggio, to autograph the cover. He agreed but only on the condition that Mr. Halper not show it in DiMaggio's lifetime.
"When I was going through my collection," Mr. Halper recalled, "I said to my wife and sons, Steven and Jason, 'I'll have to keep this contract of Babe Ruth's from the Red Sox in 1918, and I have to keep this ball and that bat . . . ' And they said, 'If you're going to keep all those things, you might as well start a new collection,' and so I let most of it go."
Mr. Halper had suffered a stroke a few years ago -- he has recovered almost fully -- and decided that it could create financial chaos for his family if he left the collection as it was. "And I didn't want a fire sale," he said. So he went about looking for a home for it, and wound up with the current arrangements.
Matt Robbins, a spokesman for Sotheby's, conservatively estimated that the sale would yield $10 million. "I would hardly be surprised, however, if it surpassed our record auction," he said, referring to the Onassis sale. Another indication of the worth of the Halper collection was a $42 million appraisal from an insurance company.
STILL hanging on the wall in Mr. Halper's basement, however, is a framed letter from 1932 that reads: "In all my years in baseball I have received many requests of autographs, balls, bats, equipment, but you are the first person to ask for some of my hair. Therefore I feel I am obligated to comply with such a request at least once. You will find enclosed an envelope containing some of my hair. I don't know what you're going to do with it, but I hope you enjoy it. Good luck with your collection. Sincerely, Babe Ruth."
Inside the frame is a lock of the Babe's hair, dark brown with a few strands of gray. A note beside it reads, "I guarantee that the enclosed hair is my own, Babe Ruth." The note was addressed not to Barry Halper but to Matthew Ward, a memorabilia collector from Ruth's time with whom Mr. Halper would have obviously identified.
Mr. Halper, whose hair remains as thick and dark as Ruth's and whose stocky build, in sport jacket and tie, is a scaled-down version of the old slugger's, walked around his den, stopping at various places to point out to a visitor what wasn't there and explaining why he had kept what he had. As he did so, one could sense the enthusiasm for what was essentially his life's work and the bitter-sweet feeling he had about parting with much of his collection. (While understanding of her husband's obsession, Sharon Halper was not reluctant to see the collection go. "She's not much of a baseball fan," Mr. Halper said. "Besides, I think all the mildew in the house was getting to her.")
"What I kept are some items that I felt personally about," Mr. Halper said. Many of the objects he kept are associated with the Yankees. He owns 2 percent of the team, enough to enable him to sit in the box of the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, when attending games. (One thing he held on to is a felt yarmulke with the red-white-and-blue Yankee logo sewn into it. A letter accompanying it describes it as a gift to Mr. Halper from Mr. Steinbrenner.)
From a shelf in the office of his den he pulled off a silver nail-file case bearing the initials "GHR," for "George Herman Ruth." "I rub this for good luck when I'm watching Yankee games," he said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." He also has the Babe's tweezers, hand mirror, shoe brush, hair brush and glass tooth-brush case, all monogrammed.
In a glass case nearby, he has a handful of baseball bats autographed to him, including one from some 30 years ago that reads: "To Barry -- the No. 1 collector from the No. 1 home run king. Best always, Roger Maris."
Mr. Halper pointed out an empty spot in the case where the Averill bat once stood. He recalled how he had acquired it: He had been attending the 1983 All-Star game in Chicago on the 50th anniversary of the first major-league all-star game, in which Averill had played. "I saw him in the hotel lobby after the game," Mr. Halper said, "and he was looking very sickly. He said he'd sign the bat tomorrow. I thought that if he made it to tomorrow it would be a miracle. I just about begged him to do it now, and we went to his room, where he signed it.
"The next morning I came down to the lobby, and there's a big commotion. Averill was leaving the hotel in an ambulance, and died shortly after. I don't want to be callous, but I did get lucky."
On another shelf Mr. Halper has also kept high school yearbooks of famous players (a 1963 yearbook from Scottsdale, Ariz., includes a senior named Jim Palmer, star baseball and basketball player, as well a junior varsity basketball player listed as "Danny Quail," who later became Vice President of the United States and who himself had at least one moment of shaky spelling).
A framed cover of a record album on a wall is titled "My Favorite Hits, Mickey Mantle." It is inscribed with Mantle's own peculiar brand of spelling, "To Barry -- You should here me sing! Mickey Mantle."
Mr. Halper, pausing to look at the album cover, smiled. He had become friends with Mantle, as well as with DiMaggio and other ball players. Many came to his home not only to look at his remarkable collection but also to eat at the table of Sharon Halper, who is known for her Italian dishes. (Her shrimp fra diavolo over linguini was a particular favorite of DiMaggio's.)
"Mickey had a great sense of humor, sometimes a bizarre one," said Mr. Halper. "I was in Dallas shortly before he died, and he was holding a news conference to discuss his liver cancer. He saw me and hollered, 'Hey, Barry, do you want to buy my liver?' "
"Mickey knew that I had Ty Cobb's dentures," Mr. Halper added, with a laugh. "Maybe he was trying to be helpful." Mr. Halper wasn't interested in Mantle's liver, but he did covet the scalpel used in the liver-transplant operation. The surgeon said he could not be sure which one he had used, but Mantle had another idea. A few weeks later Mr. Halper received a Federal Express package, and when he opened it he found a plastic glove, with a note: "This is the glove from my hemmorid exam. Mickey Mantle."
Mr. Halper framed the glove in a glass butterfly case but discreetly tucked it in a drawer. "What should I do?" asked Mr. Halper. "Throw it away?"
Hanging from a peg in Mr. Halper's den office, meanwhile, is another glove, but this one an actual baseball glove, which also bears Mantle's name. In the Sotheby catalogue for the Halper collection, a glove worn by Mickey Mantle, "circa 1960," is listed at $10,000 to $20,000. And what is this one worth?
"Nothing," Mr. Halper said. "It's my glove. It just happens to be a Mantle model. But it's from the days I played softball."

A Queens Factory Is Born Again, as a Church

 BODY:
THE new New York Presbyterian Church, which officially opens on Sept. 18, is as striking a piece of architecture as those we once had to go to Los Angeles to see. Situated in Sunnyside, Queens, the church can claim a place on the small list of projects that are helping to lift New York architecture out of its long creative slump.
The building was designed by Doug Garofalo, Greg Lynn and Michael McInturf, three whiz kids of the computer generation who live and work in three different cities -- Los Angeles, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio -- and who practice together in an office somewhere in cyberspace. For this trio, design is a paperless enterprise, aided by software originally developed for automobile styling and movie animation, and conducted with the playfulness of a video game. These people are wired. 
 Computers have long been standard equipment in architectural offices, but few architects have tried to exploit the potential of software as an expressive medium. Wes Jones, the Los Angeles-based architect, has used the term blobmeisters to describe architects who are pursuing this potential today. Conventional (so-called orthogonal) buildings are typically rendered by plans and elevations, two kinds of two-dimensional drawing. Blobs, on the other hand, are rendered as three-dimensional computer models, like those we see for cars, bodies or molecular structures. By collapsing plan and elevation into a single three-dimensional form, the computer model encourages architects to break out of orthogonal, right-angled space. Instead, they can manipulate all dimensions at once. Space becomes as plastic as a hunk of Silly Putty. It can be pinched, rotated, kneaded, stretched, cut into sections, shattered or left to ooze. The computer model displays the impact of each manipulation on the whole.
Blobmeisters use software the way modernists used structure: as a springboard for form. By way of explanation, Lynn says that a movie like "Antz" came about not because a director wanted to make a movie about insects, but because a technician discovered that a particular computer program was effective at depicting animated bugs. At the Presbyterian Church, the architects used a program called Alias, developed for movie animation and industrial design. They have combined new blob elements with the box form of an older, existing structure to produce a hybrid design, or para-building -- an addition that radically transforms what came before.
Founded in 1970, the Presbyterian Church of New York has a rapidly growing congregation whose members are mostly of Korean descent. In addition to the religious services held in the sanctuary, the new building's largest space, the church functions as a social and educational center for the Korean community. The new building, which cost $10 million, contains 80 classrooms, a banquet hall-cafeteria with seating for 1,000, a wedding chapel, day care center, library and medical clinic. As an expression of faith, parishioners fasted one day each week while their church was in construction.
The church's physical context is almost lyrically gritty, flat and gray, an area dominated by used-car lots, warehouses, factories and chain super stores. Grand Opening, pennants fluttering, Nobody Beats Our Prices: a Northern Boulevard version of Ed Ruscha. Across the street from the church, Long Island Rail Road trains zip by on an overpass. Beyond, the leafy streets of Sunnyside emphasize the nearby urban grit. Into this sliced-up, wrong-side-of-the-tracks setting, Garofalo, Lynn and McInturf have introduced chop-shop architecture: an assemblage of old and new industrial parts.
The original structure was built in 1932 for the Knickerbocker Laundry Factory, a commercial firm that held the franchise for cleaning Yankee uniforms. A local landmark, the precast concrete Art Deco edifice later housed a perfume factory. The church retains the laundry's street facade, though its curving Deco surface, once white, has been painted black. The architects call it the Shroud.
In the original building, a two-story industrial shed lay behind the Deco facade. For the remodeling, the architects have added a new structural framework that doubles the height of the shed. They have sheared away three of the existing walls -- chop, chop -- and replaced them with new ones: two finished with a purple-gray stucco, the third made of translucent fiberglass panels inset with clear glass windows.
Blobmeister forms often resemble horror movie monsters. Earlier this year, Lynn presented an installation in Vienna called "The Tingler," after the old William Castle movie about a centipede-like parasite. For the church, he and his partners have invented a form they call Nestor, so named because it is composed of trapezoidal shapes that appear to nest inside one another, like a stack of baskets laid on its side. Nestor is not an object, but a form, a spatial void that is used to define different areas on the top two floors of the church. Imagine it as the hollow cavity of a Jurassic fossil.
Nestor's form is reptilian, with a serrated surface that recalls a lizard's hide. The form is only partly visible from outside, in a series of zinc-clad, folded canopies that cascade down the northern facade of the building, sheltering an exterior fire stair of poured concrete. Admirers of 50's sculpture may see a resemblance of these canopies to the work of Seymour Lipton. Inside the shed, Nestor contains the church's main space, the sanctuary, with seating for more than 2,500 parishioners. The capacity is roughly that of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Lynn and McInturf both worked in the New York office of Peter Eisenman and make no effort to cover their tracks. We have seen lots of work from the generation after Frank Gehry, but it's a novelty to see second-generation Eisenman, particularly in New York, where the mentor himself has built only a humble fire station, and that some years back. There are people who break out in hives whenever Eisenman's name comes up, but the Presbyterian Church may persuade them to reconsider. The younger architects give us Eisenmanesque forms without the Hate me! Hate me! provocation. That loss is a gain all around.
For the convention center in Columbus, Ohio, Eisenman designed "snakes," curving shapes that turned the roof into a so-called fifth facade. Lodged within the Presbyterian Church are what the architects call tubes: three vertical corridors that contain entrances, hallways, stairs and elevators and provide circulation throughout the building.
Shroud, shed, Nestor, tubes: these are the basic components of the church's organizing system, and it is helpful to keep them in mind, because it's not immediately apparent that a system is in operation. The tubes, for example, overlap as they weave through the structure. The overlapping areas are sometimes, but not always, articulated by ceiling soffits and by the color of the linoleum flooring. The building's undulating roof corresponds to Nestor's bulging contour just below. The canopies are not, as one might think, arbitrarily sculpted shapes, but Nestor's serrated western edge.
The sanctuary is the most impressive interior to be built in New York in many years. The room's ceiling (Nestor's inner hide) serves an acoustical function but is mainly an experiment in folded planes, a device long associated with Eisenman. The space is asymmetrical, with angled banks of seating that violate the traditional arrangement around a central axis. The effect is not weird or Caligariesque. Rather, the asymmetry makes the space more fluid, its vast size less overwhelming. Chop-chop: a glass wall slices through the sanctuary along its northern edge, allowing natural light into the space and dissolving any sense of confinement.
Other fine moments: a magnificent processional staircase that leads from the main entrance lobby to the sanctuary two floors above; the most dramatic feature within the tubes, the stair curves and narrows slightly as it rises, the deviations accented by strips of neon lighting overhead. The black asphalt parking lot, surrounded by white concrete walls, that sets the church off like an industrial velvet matte. The fixtures and furnishings brought in by the church itself -- lots of wood, vases with scrolls on them -- that help draw the place into the vernacular. The view of the church from Northern Boulevard: a free-falling image, pure formal play, the zinc-covered canopies reverberate across the northern facade like tolling bells.
Shortcomings in blob architecture might be called glitches, blips or crashes. The Presbyterian Church has a few. Stairs. In the balcony aisle, and an exterior stair near the parking lot, the treads are too long. You have to hop-skip, leading first left foot, then right. This rhythm is boring and distracts from the irregular geometries of the space. Such discomforts can be found in many conventional buildings, but it's screwy when formalist architecture does not work with the geometry of human form.
The funereal palette: purple gray; black; mauve. The architects say that their adaptive reuse replaces the laundering of dirty uniforms with the cleansing of tarnished souls. A lovely conceit. Why the mourning dress? One senses the strain of young architects trying to look sober beyond their years.
Wasted space. The upper landing of the outdoor fire stair, sheltered beneath the topmost canopy, is a wonderful space, perhaps the best in the building, with views of the Manhattan skyline and the sanctuary inside. A perfect place for a garden of contemplation. Fire codes permitting, the entire staircase, and the spaces beneath it, would benefit from landscaping. Software-driven design should maximize what chat rooms cannot provide: habitable public space for integrated bodies, minds and souls; physical proximity; tactility; the here as well as the now.
The glitches do not, however, diminish the stature of this work, as both a fulfillment of historical forces and as a preview of things to come. Half a century ago, the British historian John Summerson said that architects should "learn to study not merely minimum requirements, but maximum possibilities; to learn not only how to economize space but how to be extravagant with it; to study the overtones of architecture and the geometrical discipline of space as space; to learn not only to use space but to play with space."
The words come from an address Summerson delivered to the Architectural Association in London in 1947. He was responding to the impact on architecture of modern communications technology. Radio, television and telephone, Summerson thought, had relieved architects of the need to create imposing public symbols of social cohesion. This had liberated them to focus on space, an element media could not supplant.
Half a century later, however, communications technology has gone far toward capturing the spatial dimension. The culture now lives more imaginatively in simulated spaces -- blue screen backgrounds, VR, SimCity -- than in those created by architectural means. Obviously, Garofalo, Lynn and McInturf are not opposed to this development. In fact, their cyberspatial mode of working may be more revolutionary than their design. They have dealt with displacement by incorporating new media into their method. The church is a natural extension of the process the architects used to design it. That process caused three architects to reconfigure the spatial relationships between them. The church amplifies those relationships in architectural terms.
IT would be odd if the computer did not set off a spatial revision comparable to that sparked by Brunelleschi's development of linear perspective in 15th-century Florence. Indeed, blob architecture undermines the enduring authority of perspectival space. While blob architecture has its Baroque aspects, its twists on axis, symmetry and procession violate classical norms. In Queens, the classically symmetrical Deco facade accentuates the anti-classicism of the addition.
It was fitting that this project was commissioned by a church. Faith is supra-rational, like mountain climbing. Believers throw a line up into the unknown and we haul ourselves skyward, and it's only when we have done this quite a bit that we know that faith works: we can look back and see how high we have climbed. Architecture works the same way. Architects may have no idea what's up there, but they throw the line anyway, and when this happens often enough, a history of architecture is revealed. The New York Presbyterian Church signifies a new stage of ascent.

In San Jose, Hopes for a More Livable Downtown

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
TWO high-density residential developments, one a rental building and the other a condominium project, are the latest expressions of a 20-year effort to create a vital downtown in the largest city in Silicon Valley.
The projects represent the city's attempt to introduce new housing into a thinly populated urban center. With 900,000 people, San Jose is the third-largest city in California, but less than 1 percent of its residents live downtown. 
 With the completion of the new apartment and condominium complexes, the city will have built only a quarter of the 8,000 units it hopes to complete by 2010, when it expects the population of downtown San Jose to have swollen to 19,000, from 6,585 today.
City leaders hope that the two new projects, with 424 housing units, and projects with 1,200 more housing units in the planning stage will bring hundreds of new residents into the downtown area, where extensive redevelopment has already brought new office buildings, parks, cultural venues and historic preservation activity.
Many of those new developments were either created by or heavily subsidized by the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, which is sprucing up the downtown area to compete with better-established office locations throughout suburban Santa Clara County -- the region popularly known as Silicon Valley.
Despite being the largest urban center in Santa Clara County, downtown San Jose is still coming from behind in the competition for high-tech tenants in Silicon Valley. Smaller, more suburban cities like Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Mountain View and Cupertino have been the main beneficiaries of the phenomenal expansion of computer and Internet-related companies.
Until World War II, San Jose was an unremarkable farming community whose greatest distinction was being the seat of Santa Clara County. Surrounded by fruit orchards, the city was a center for the canning of pears, prunes, cherries and apricots. After the war, it grew as a bedroom community for the region's computer- and defense-related businesses. In the 1950's, city officials saw homebuilding and annexation as sources of growth, and the city expanded by 47 square miles during that decade.
The small downtown area was suffering from the loss of major employers, however, many of them leaving for the suburbs. And it sustained a severe symbolic loss in 1954, when the city government left downtown for peripheral neighborhoods. The image of a depressed downtown became even more dismal in the 1960's, when entire blocks of aging buildings were bulldozed in the name of urban renewal.
Dennis Korabiak, downtown coordinator for the Redevelopment Agency, recalled the dismay he felt when walking through downtown in 1982, shortly after joining the organization. "I walked down First Street and said, 'What have I got myself into?' " he recalled. "It was that bad."
AT the time, San Jose was just starting a long-term redevelopment program, funded principally by a portion of the property taxes levied on newer, suburban-style business parks on the city's northern and southern edges. The success of those business parks provides downtown San Jose with the richest flow of tax increment financing available to any California city, about $90 million annually, Mr. Korabiak said. (In tax increment financing, a portion of property tax revenues is used for redevelopment.)
In recent years, the Redevelopment Agency has assisted or provided partial funding for so many downtown projects that it would be only a slight exaggeration to say that San Jose's new downtown is the agency's creation.
Among the projects that the agency assisted are the Children's Discovery Museum, the San Jose Arena, the San Jose Convention Center, the San Jose Repertory Theater, the Tech Museum of Innovation, the Biblioteca/Youth Center and the Mexican Cultural Heritage Gardens. It also helped restore the Civic Auditorium.
The city has also provided big subsidies to businesses willing to relocate downtown. Adobe Systems, the software maker, moved into a new downtown building in 1994 after receiving a $35 million subsidy from the city. (Much of the subsidy paid for a parking garage.)
The Redevelopment Agency has also paid for most of an extensive landscaping program that has turned the banks of the Guadalupe River into a 20-mile regional park. The riverfront was a selling point for the Adobe deal, according to Mr. Korabiak, who added that the riverfront is now so popular that the city no longer provides incentives to companies willing to relocate along it.
The single most ambitious project of the Redevelopment Agency is the San Jose Civic Plaza, a seven-block redevelopment project that would bring City Hall back to downtown San Jose, together with a new Symphony Hall, a new elementary school, a renovated supermarket, a multitiered public parking structure and 50 housing units. The City Council approved the project in June.
But downtown housing remains an unrealized ambition. Elsewhere in Santa Clara County and in San Jose, the expansion of computer-related businesses has stimulated home development and prices. At the end of July, existing single-family houses in San Jose were selling for an average of $400,657, while condominiums were selling for an average of $228,576, according to the Santa Clara County Association of Realtors. In 1994, the average single-family house sold for $238,258; the average condominium price was $150,575.
Downtown, the 104-unit Paseo Villas condominium complex, currently under construction, is being built by Goldrich & Kest Inc. of Los Angeles with the assistance of the Redevelopment Agency. The agency contributed the land and is a partner in the venture. Completion is expected next March.
Although the developer has not yet set prices for the units, comparable condominiums in the area are selling for $250 to $300 a square foot, "which is not that high for the area," according to Mr. Korabiak. The condos, all two-bedrooms, will range from 1,600 to 1,900 square feet.
The 320-unit apartment complex, known as 101 San Fernando, is being built by Forest City Enterprises Inc. of Cleveland. Completion is expected in fall 2000. Rents have not been announced, although city officials say they expect the apartments to rent for about $1.85 per square foot. The apartments will range from a 421-square-foot studio to a 1,390-square-foot three-bedroom. The city agency assisted the project by buying the land from the developer and leasing it back for 55 years, which gave the developer cash to build the project.
"You have a lot of people with well-paying jobs looking for places to live that are closer to where they work," said Greg Anderson, vice president for development at Forest City, "and we are responding to that with this project."
The city allowed the developer to build up to 107 units per acre, making 101 San Fernando the densest housing project ever built in downtown San Jose, and possibly in the entire city.
"These are densities that are comparable to those in Berlin and Vienna," said Daniel Solomon, a San Francisco-based architect who designed the complex. With the high densities, civic leaders can concentrate housing in certain areas of downtown to create a natural customer base for neighborhood merchants.
The architect and the city collaborated to produce a design for the apartment building that would not seem imposing or impersonal, Mr. Solomon said. He provided seven separate entrances to the building, each with its own small courtyard. In this way, the large building resembles a row of smaller courtyard apartment buildings.
The multiple entrances of 101 San Fernando also have an urban design role: the street is enlivened with doorways, rather than deadened by impenetrable walls.
Housing is the "final ingredient" needed to make downtown San Jose successful, Mr. Anderson said. The city has "done a lot, and the downtown has hotels and restaurants, it has night life, and the retail is coming along."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 3-Story Addition at Bleecker and Sixth;
'Little' School Grows Bigger

 BODY:
A school house it is. And red, too. But little?
While the addition to the Little Red School House at Bleecker Street and the Avenue of the Americas has only three stories and a basement, it was a colossal undertaking for the parents and alumni of the 78-year-old progressive school, which prides itself on its socio-economic diversity. 
 "It's not just a new building," said Eve Stuart, the chairwoman of the board. "It's a new school."
The red-brick structure adjoins and links the existing lower school at 196 Bleecker Street, built in 1920 as a mission of the First Presbyterian Church, and the middle school at Nos. 200 and 202, two 19th-century row houses. It stands in what was the school's courtyard, overlooking a triangular slice of park bearing an official sign: "Little Red Square."
The building is to be ready for the beginning of school next Thursday. Construction costs are about $3 million, financed by an Industrial Development Agency bond. Some $2.2 million has been raised in a $4 million campaign to provide tuition aid, new technology and furnishings and to reduce the strain on the operating budget in retiring the bond.
The architects are David Piscuskas, a Little Red parent; Juergen Riehm and Carmen Lenzi of 1100 Architect (so called because its first office was in Room 1100 at 225 Lafayette Street).
"This building creates a hub," Mr. Riehm said. "It connects buildings that were disconnected into a campus." Because the other buildings had different floor levels, an expensive elevator was required with front and rear doors capable of stopping at eight different points in its four-story trip.
Small as it is, the new building is full of surprises. The middle school art studio on the third floor, which replaces a basement classroom, has a peaked skylight reaching a height of 13 feet. Under a broad expanse of sky and through the veil of a sycamore tree outside, one can see the steeple of Our Lady of Pompeii Roman Catholic Church nearby.
The 100-seat cafeteria in the basement has a clerestory window that makes it seem more luminous than most underground halls -- at least on a sunny summer afternoon. It is also distinguished by an undulating ceiling of ash-wood louvers.
And though the courtyard was lost, there is a 575-square-foot outdoor play area on a roof deck. The speckled rubber safety tiles make a squishy-crunchy sound under foot -- a child's delight.

HEADLINE: Mercy College Head Extends Her Hand

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
LUCIE LAPOVSKY is an educator on a mission: to enrich the economy with untapped talent from an unlikely source -- the ranks of students that other colleges often turn away.
As Mercy College's newest president, Dr. Lapovsky, the former chief financial officer for Goucher College in Towson, Md., recently took up residence in a spacious office overlooking the Hudson River here -- along with a sprawling collection of paperweights brought with her from her previous job. "I want them close by," she said of the colorful glass objects. "They encourage me to keep dreaming." 
 One recent morning shortly before the fall semester began, Dr. Lapovsky took time to discuss those dreams and describe the nontraditional students she has staked her career on. Among others, the students include dropouts, troublemakers, the offspring of families with no tradition of higher education, students with little or no money for college courses and those who work during the day and have little time for the usual social activities associated with college life.
"Among this group," she said, "lie society's hidden jewels."
An economist by training (she earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Maryland in 1981), Dr. Lapovsky said she was motivated less by ivory tower philosophies and esoteric social theories than by dollars and cents and statistical realities. Describing herself as an educator with the dream of giving students a helping hand in the world, she said that that did not necessarily mean she was a bleeding-heart liberal or do-gooder.
"I'm just a very practical, reality-oriented person," she said. "The fact is that if we don't nurture students like these, we run the risk of a society of haves and have-nots, where only the elite run the country and there is no middle class."
Even though one of its primary goals is to attract nontraditional students, the college does not have an open-admissions policy, which accepts all applicants. Mercy tests incoming students to weed out those who do not have the basic skills necessary for college-level courses, accepting about 70 percent of students who apply.
A decade ago, by serving students with weaker academic credentials, Mercy cashed in on an overlooked college population in the late 1980's and early 90's and headed off bankruptcy, Dr. Jay Sexter, the former president said then. Dr. Sexter is stepping down to teach psychology, most likely, at Mercy College.
Enrollment at Mercy College was 4,800 in 1990; it was up by 46 percent, to 7,000, four years later, under Dr. Sexter's direction. He increased enrollment through new program offerings. It now has an enrollment of 9,500 students, among them 1,500 graduate students.
The college, which has a $68 million yearly budget, relies mostly on tuition for its income, said Edward (Ted) Dunn, chairman of the Mercy College board of trustees and a former Mayor of Rye. In addition to balancing its budget now, it also maintains a surplus.
In a unanimous vote in April, the trustees elected Dr. Lapovsky the eighth president, and Mr. Dunn said that he hoped that under her tutelage, the college would become "less tuition dependent" and significantly increase its present $20 million endowment.
Recently named one of Maryland's Top 100 Women by the Maryland Daily Record, a business journal published in Baltimore, Dr. Lapovsky, also taught economics at Goucher, from which she graduated in 1972. Before her appointment as chief financial officer of Goucher, she was a special assistant to the president at the University of Maryland at College Park. She has also held administrative posts at the Maryland Higher Education Commission.
She writes for college and university professional publications and lectures extensively around the country about college tuition pricing policies. Dr. Lapovsky serves as treasurer of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and is chairwoman of the National Association of College and University Business Officer's Financial Aid Advisory Committee.
She is the mother of three children, 15, 18 and 20. Her husband, David, is an executive vice president for a media research firm.
Mercy -- an independent, coeducational institution with its main campus here and branches in White Plains, Yorktown and the Bronx -- offers more than 80 undergraduate and 25 graduate programs. Its graduate school offers master's degree study in acupuncture and Oriental medical, physical and occupational therapy, nursing and speech therapy, among other fields of study.
Tuition at the four-year college and graduate school is $8,000 a year, compared with yearly tuition at institutions like Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, where tuition is $24,810 a year.
Mercy College also suffers from an image problem -- an issue that most Mercy insiders choose to sidestep. To date the college has kept a low profile in the community, offering little in the way of cultural activities like poetry readings and concerts to outsiders -- a situation that Dr. Lapovsky said she wants to change.
"Let's just say we don't have an image yet," she said. "A lot of people aren't even aware that we exist."
The vice chairman of the trustees, Richard Rosenblatt, agreed, saying that although he lived barely a block from the college, "For years I didn't know about it."
Job recruiters, however, know it well, returning each year to draw teachers, industry workers and other skilled graduates into the labor force, Mr. Dunn said.
So far, though, it is a college with only a modest list of famous alumni -- "Obviously not a Cornell or a Columbia or an N.Y.U." is the way that Barbara W. Flynn, an Assistant State Education Commissioner described it.
Still it has attracted the attention of some well-known students -- like Mookie Wilson, a former first baseman with the New York Mets in the 1980's who graduated from Mercy in 1996. Mr. Wilson was 33 credits shy of graduating from the University of South Carolina when he was signed to play professional baseball; his famous single produced a series-winning run in the 1986 World Series. Then when he was 40 and retired from professional baseball, he received a bachelor's degree in behavioral science at Mercy College's 58th commencement.
Another well-known alumnus is Walter Anderson, editor in chief of Parade Magazine, author and Clinton appointee to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Mr. Anderson graduated in 1972 and later became a member of the Horatio Alger Association -- the "poor boy who makes good club," he said.
Mr. Anderson, a trustee emeritus of Mercy and chairman of its board for eight years, dropped out of high school at 16, entered the Marines and returned to graduate as a valedictorian first from Westchester Community College and then Mercy College.
Joan Demarest Wolf, author of more than 15 historical novels, graduated in 1965. And Wesley Walker, a former All-Pro wide receiver with the New York Jets, graduated with the class of '88.
In Westchester, Donald W. Ferraro, the police chief of Scarsdale, received his bachelor's degree from Mercy College in 1974. And Michael Mosca, chief of police in Mount Vernon, got a bachelor's degree in 1997 and a master's degree in organizational leadership the next year.
This fall, students like Susanna Seifu of Ethiopia, Kara Alverson from Saratoga, Angel Santiago from the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and Jordan Ray from Southampton are hoping they will add to Mercy's College list of distinguished graduates.
Ms. Seifu, 27, was living in Stockholm before she came to Mercy to study journalism. Ms. Alverson, 24, is studying for a master's degree in school counseling. Like many of the other students, they work on campus during the day to pay for tuition and attend classes at night.
Mr. Santiago, who is 23 and majoring in English, described himself as a "typical kid from New York City who did a lot of bad things" and is now the first in his family to attend college. He hopes to become a writer. Mr. Ray is also 23, majoring in English and planning to become a writer. "Like Angel," he said, "I did not leave myself a lot of opportunities when I was growing up." Mr. Ray earns his tuition working as a secretary in Dr. Lapovsky's office and covers his room and board by serving as a student in charge in one of the college's dormitories.
In January, the magazine Black Enterprise named Mercy College the fifth best regional college offering a liberal arts education to black students. Based on enrollment percentages, the State University of New York in Westbury was first, Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., second, the University of Houston third and Marymount Manhattan College fourth.
About 27 percent of Mercy College students are black, 34 percent Hispanic and 33 percent white.
In the Kaplan/Newsweek College Catalog 2000, a new guide to campuses deemed exceptional by high school guidance counselors, three Westchester County colleges are listed. Sarah Lawrence College is cited for its strong liberal arts education and for the individual academic attention students receive. Manhattanville College in Purchase was cited for liberal arts studies and an overseas study program. Pace University in White Plains was noted for offering credit for on-the-job experience.
In U.S. News & World Report's most recent guide to top colleges, Purchase was one of the North's top-ranked liberal arts schools, and Manhattanville was cited as one of the nation's most diverse campuses. The top college overall was California Institute of Technology, which surpassed Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University, last year's winners.
The rankings were based on, among other things, Scholastic Achievement Test scores, the percentage of freshmen who go on to graduate, faculty pay, class size and student-faculty ratio.
Mercy College, which was founded in 1950 as a junior college under the auspices of the Sisters of Mercy, became a four-year college offering programs leading to a bachelor's degree 11 years later. In 1969, its board of trustees agreed that the college should become independent and nonsectarian. It employs 156 full-time and more than 500 part-time faculty members.

HEADLINE: Teacher Glut, Substitute Gap

BYLINE: By ALLAN RICHTER 

 BODY:
WHEN Tara Edwards set out to land a Long Island teaching job this spring, she circulated 78 resumes and won interviews with four school districts. This week, with the taste of postage glue gone, the 22-year-old West Babylon resident will begin her first paid teaching post -- as a full-time substitute in a Copiague elementary school.
Ms. Edwards, who graduated from SUNY Oneonta, will earn no health benefits in the provisional post. And her $85 daily take will be only $10 more than the Copiague Union Free School District pays its more transient substitutes. But she counts herself fortunate. Only a quarter of the 20,000 teachers churned out annually by New York universities find jobs in the state, and Long Island teaching posts are among the most coveted. 
 "Just to have your resume looked at is an accomplishment," Ms. Edwards said.
Yet against all conventional wisdom, the supply from that large reservoir doesn't seem to be meeting the Island's intense demand for substitute teachers. Some said the shortage could disrupt classes and drain school budgets if left unchecked.
"When you have a revolving door and you're not even certain that you can cover a class with a certified person or who that person might be, it inevitably takes a toll on the continuity and quality of education," said Candee Swenson, president of the Suffolk County Council of Superintendents.
In the past year, at least 40 of the Island's 126 school districts have adopted measures to attract more substitute teachers, Dr. Swenson said. Some districts are offering their first pay raises to substitutes in years. Others have hired more certified teachers to work as full-time substitutes.
Two factors have contributed to the shortage of substitute teachers: a healthy local economy and notoriously low daily salaries for substitutes.
"People have more employment options in this economy, and that applies particularly to substitutes and other temporary workers," said Gary Huth, a state Labor Department economist.
One of the more dramatic pay increases was enacted in the Longwood Central School District, where Dr. Swenson is superintendent. Math and science substitutes who earned $65 a day will earn $100 a day this year. Substitutes in less-strained subject areas will draw $75 a day.
On Long Island, substitute teachers on average earn $75 a day, according to a survey of 92 districts earlier this year by the Copiague district. Half the districts said they employed full-time substitutes, but only a quarter of the districts that employ permanent substitutes said they offer them health insurance or other benefits.
"It's more attractive for people to come work for us if we can say to them we can guarantee you an assignment every day," said Terry Bouton, executive personnel director at the Northport-East Northport district. The district employs permanent substitutes in its high school and is bringing full-time substitutes into its elementary and middle schools for the first time this year.
State law allows a school district to hire uncertified substitutes for a total of 40 days each year. But two-thirds of the districts responding to the Copiague survey said they hired only substitutes who had state teaching certification.
The Western Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services has been under pressure to boost daily pay rates because its teachers must be certified in the special-education programs it provides to 18 districts, said Jennifer Sneed, the agency's executive personnel director. In July, the agency's board increased the daily rate by $5, to $70. It also cut in half the 40 days that substitutes had to be on board to qualify for another $5 raise.
Demand for substitutes has also grown because the state's new, tougher educational standards has induced more teachers to take time away from class to attend training sessions and to score the new standardized tests. Sandy Rosenberg, personnel director at the Kings Park district, said last year's fourth-grade tests jolted the district's teaching staff.
"We had to send 18 teachers out for two days in the fourth grade alone, and that's just one example," Ms. Rosenberg said. "All the other districts had the same constraints and that's why we couldn't get subs; we were all sharing them."
Over the summer, Kings Park interviewed candidates to fill 22 permanent substitute positions -- up from 10 two years ago -- that it will need this year to continue accommodating the state requirements, Ms. Rosenberg said.
Roseanne DeFabio, an assistant commissioner at the state Education Department, said she expected the teacher absences spurred by the fourth-grade tests to abate.
"I don't think there will be that great a demand for that many absences as the years go on and people become used to the test," Ms. DeFabio said. "The scoring will go more easily and there won't be as much need for training days."
The Copiague district has decided to double its permanent substitute roster to 10 in the new school year rather than raise its $75 daily substitute rate.
"We kicked around whether it be worth it to increase the pay another $5 or $10," said Charles Leunig, the district's personnel director. "The conclusion we reached was we would simply be spending the additional money on the people we already have, that it wouldn't necessarily bring us more people. We'd be throwing our money away and unfortunately we can't put out a giant increase and make it $100 a day, which would conceivably have an impact."
The Riverhead district reached a similar conclusion, but too late. In the last school year, the district raised its daily substitute rate from $65 to $75 -- its first substitute pay increase in at least five years -- but administrators said the effort attracted few new substitutes.
Now the Riverhead district is counting on permanent substitutes and is considering other solutions, such as dismissing students early on staff development days.
But David Carlson, the district's finance manager, said that he expects Riverhead to continue to face substitute shortages for at least several years as the district moves its permanent substitutes into staff teaching posts with benefits -- precisely the goal that motivates teachers to take the full-time substitute jobs.
Some teachers are skeptical. Alyssa Brodie, 24, had substituted in Long Island districts for six months when she turned down a permanent substitute post. "My thought was it would be a good foot in the door, but there were no benefits, no job security, and it's not your own classroom so it doesn't even look good on your resume," she said.
Instead she took a job teaching elementary school in New York City for two years. It is that experience, she believes, that helped her win the job she will start this week: teaching fourth grade in Hewlett.
"I didn't get this job because I was a substitute teacher," she said.

HEADLINE: From Here to There and Back

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
A QUARTER of a century after Westchester County took charge of the area's bus routes, the system is said to be one of the most cost effective in the state but has been able to do little to get people out of their cars.
The Bee-Line System, as it is known, operates as a public-private partnership and carries about 30 million passengers a year, or 100,000 rides a day, making it the 35th largest system in the United States. While the County Transportation Department says that every commuter who switches from driving a car to public transit saves 200 gallons of gas a year and eases the region's congestion and pollution, most of Westchester's residents have still not found public transportation the way to get from there to here. And, officials say, they probably never will. 
 "Most of us in suburbia drive our own private cars, but the bus system is essential," said George S. Latimer, a Democrat from Rye and chairman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators. "When I was a kid growing up in Mount Vernon in the early 1960's and we had just one car, the bus system was a life line. Today I don't personally need the bus system, but that doesn't mean there aren't people who do need it. And the constituency that does need it is one whose voice isn't always heard."
The county's Department of Transportation says 14 percent of Westchester residents ride the Bee-Line system, with 70 percent of them depending on the system for their transportation needs, usually as a way to get to work. A department analysis of ridership shows that 70 percent of the riders earn less than $35,000 a year, 51 percent are black, 26 percent white and 10 percent Hispanic and 48 percent are between 25 and 44.
"There are a lot of class issues, but these could be overcome,"said Maureen M. Morgan of Ossining, a past president of Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, an environmental group, and herself an avid supporter of public transportation. "Overall, the more critical aspect of the bus system is its perception and the perception of its riders. The majority of bus stops are just pieces of dirt and there is a negative message that this gives to riders and nonriders. There are many people who won't take the bus because it's just so uncomfortable to stand in the rain and wait for a bus."
Interviews with those actively involved with the bus system or longtime observers of it suggest that apart from the fare ($1.40) there is general satisfaction with the bus system in the southern part of the county. The Board of Legislators last year rejected a proposal from County Executive Andrew J. Spano to raise the fare a dime.
There also seems to be a general consensus that many routes in northern Westchester are not economically feasible, since residents there do not use the buses enough.
Back when Mr. Latimer rode the bus as a teen-ager, there was no centralized county system. Instead, recalled Dr. Sal Prezioso, who has held various paid and voluntary jobs in county government for decades: "We had 40 bus lines in the mid-1950's. Then if you went from one village to another, you needed another bus. People were screaming like the devil."
All this began to change in the closing days of the administration of the late County Executive Edwin G. Michaelian, and in the early days of the administration of his successor, Alfred B. DelBello, who took office in 1974. Mr. DelBello was influenced by several things: a new state law that gave counties the authority to control buses, generous reimbursement from the Federal and state governments to counties that bought buses (as much as 95 percent) and the continued acquisition by Liberty Lines of Yonkers of a number of other private bus companies. Instead of going in the direction of Nassau County and taking over the buses and running the system as a public entity, Mr. DelBello created a public-private bus system.
Under that relationship, still in effect today, the county government buys and owns the buses, which it leases to the private bus companies for a nominal fee. The private companies operate the buses on routes determined by the county (now 34 regular routes, plus special routes like express service to Manhattan), collecting fares determined by the county. In return, the county guarantees the private companies a certain profit. Today, the Department of Transportation has four contractors (Liberty being the largest), operates more than 350, and has the Paratransit system, a door-to-door reservation system for the disabled, which uses an additional 54 vans that serve 3,700 riders. Besides the four contractors, there are also two separate contractors that provide services under the Paratransit system.
"What we have today is good to a degree," said Dr. Prezioso, who headed the Westchester 2000 Task Force, a citizens group appointed in the late 1980's by Andrew P. O'Rourke, who was then the County Executive, to look into the county's needs for the millennium. "While people in the upper part of the county -- including me in Pound Ridge -- don't benefit much, the southern people do. At the time the system was created, the mission was that we would take care of the inner cities. They were dying and people were screaming about the need for public transportation and about traffic."
Mr. DelBello, who is now in private law practice, said: "It's an excellent system. It has always run at less cost per passenger mile than other systems."
Jerry D'Amore, president of Liberty Lines, said that the county system has the lowest cost in the region: 37 cents a passenger mile and $1.97 a trip compared with 51 cents and $2.62, respectively, for the Nassau County system. With the fare for a single trip $1.40 and quantity discounts available for regular riders, the county government must rely on state and county subsidies to meet expenses. As projected in the county's 1999 budget, bus operations (regular bus service and the paratransit system for the disabled) will have a net cost to county taxpayers of about $10 million this year -- an amount that represents about 1.5 percent of the county tax levy. Officials like Marvin V. Church, the county's Transportation Commissioner, remain concerned that the number could go higher in future years because the Federal Government has stopped all bus subsidy funds and the state has been decreasing its bus subsidies. "We have a very unstable state funding mechanism," he said.
The department is therefore studying the routes to determine which are the most used. For example, Route 84, from Putnam to Westchester, was eliminated in June, based on an analysis that showed it had 40 round-trip riders and cost $400,000 a year to operate. In addition, the department is focusing efforts on attracting new riders on special routes. As outlined by Mr. Church, here are some of the initiatives and plans:
*Beginning Tuesday, with $600,000 in funds from the state, the county is starting a one-year experimental route from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt State Park in Yorktown to the White Plains Trans Center. The nonstop route, with four round trips each day, hopes to attract people to White Plains and possibly to a connecting bus route on nearby Central Avenue that travels to Manhattan. Parking at the park is free and for the first month, so, too, will be the bus rides, said Susan Tolchin, director of communications for the county. The county received permission from the state to allow the buses on the Taconic State Parkway, something that had been forbidden.
*With welfare to work programs required of the county government, the bus system will work with the county's Department of Social Services to develop programs that should help former welfare recipients. Possibilities include day care at some central sites near railroad stations that serve as bus stops.
*The County Transportation Department is looking into running more reverse-commute buses, which would take people from Manhattan to Westchester at rush hour, as well as expanding bus service to serve commuters from the train stations.
*The department says it would like to have better communications with developers who are considering offices in the county so that before they commit to a certain area they have investigated the feasibility of bus routes for their employees.
For information about the county's Bee-Line bus routes, the number to call is 682-2020.

HEADLINE: Q&A/M. Jody Rell;
The Job of Lieutenant Governor Is Good Fit for This Republican

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S 105th Lieutenant Governor, M. Jody Rell, is the first Republican woman to hold the position. She laughs at all the speculations and "what ifs" concerning her future. What if Texas Gov. George W. Bush wins the Presidency and what if Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland joins his administration? The Lieutenant Governor would automatically inherit the seat in that scenario. She deflects the questions about running for seat by pointing out that Mr. Rowland enjoys being governor, there are no term limits in Connecticut, it is premature to discuss the elections and she would very much like to see him run again. 
 What if he decided not to? Finally, she said: "If he chooses not to, I am the kind of person who looks at an opportunity and never says 'no' to an opportunity if it is something I want to do. Right now I'm very happy doing the job of Lieutenant Governor."
She comes to the office with 10 years' experience as a Representative from the 107th District, Bethel and Brookfield where she still lives with her husband, Louis, a retired airline pilot.
Recently she met to discuss the Lieutenant Governor's job and her plans for the next year. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. What does the Lieutenant Governor do?
A. By the powers of the State Constitution the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor in the event that the Governor is incapacitated or goes out of state. He sends me a letter each time he goes out of state to say he will be away from this date and time to this date and time. Our Governor has a great sense of humor and the first time he sent one of these letters he wrote a little postscript that said "Stay away from the notch."
 T. Clark Hall, the Republican Lieutenant Governor under Gov. Thomas Meskill, decided with his sense of humor he would invade Massachusetts and reclaim the notch. The notch is the little part on the top of the state that is cut out and belongs to Massachusetts. So while the Governor was away I made up a copy of a newspaper with a mock headline that said, "Rell vows to take back the notch."
Q. What does the Lieutenant Governor do with the legislature?
A. The other role is to preside over the State Senate. Connecticut is one of many states that have that role. As the president I have the power to break a tie vote. That is a constitutional power given to the Lieutenant Governor. I have done it on a couple of occasions, mostly on procedural matters.
It's more important now because in the first two years of the administration there was a Republican controlled Senate with a 19-17 margin. Now it is 17-19 the other way with the Democrats in the majority. Not everything they do up there is a partisan vote.
I think if there is one thing I am known for in the Senate it is the ability to be fair and to preside with an even hand. I have ruled equally against the Republicans and Democrats in breaking tie votes. Having had to break those ties I have never felt any remorse or regret.
Q. Does the Governor ask you to take on special tasks?
A. The Governor is asking me to head up a new study of technology for our public schools, universities and libraries. This group will basically get a handle on where we are, what's available and help to research what we can do to bring us into the new age. Frankly, I would like to think of Connecticut as being the shining star in this new technology. That's a challenge I'm looking forward to.
Q. Are you leading other projects?
A. The Governor asked me to chair a group to put together an economic revitalization plan for the City of Hartford. The Governor also said not to give him recommendations of anything that would simply be put on the shelf to gather dust. We've seen enough of those over the years and that was not the plan of action here. We reviewed the outstanding plans for development for the City of Hartford. We interviewed an awful lot of people about great plans and things they wanted to see done. We came to consensus. We met for about eight months. We came up with what we have since referred to as the six pillars of progress.
They are: The sports center complex, the much talked about stadium, the convention center, the parking garages or new parking facilities, the downtown higher education piece for the Community Technical College to oversee. That's the one that's probably going to come to the forefront first. Then there's a cleanup of some of the vacant buildings and vacant lots to ready them for development. Some of this is already taking place. I think Hartford is poised to see, as the Governor is fond of saying, "the cranes in the air and the shovel in the ground."
Q. Any other responsibilities?
A. One of the things that we are starting is called Connecticut Treasures. We are going to solicit from various organizations, like the Lions and Kiwanis, their Connecticut treasures, someone they would like to recognize. We would like to offer the Lieutenant Governor's recognition of a Connecticut treasure. We are not sure if we are going to do a citation or some other sort of presentation. It doesn't have to be a person, it could be a club or an organization. We are starting by sending out forms to Kiwanis Clubs and those types of organizations. We will put the forms in libraries and town halls. We would like to do this at least once a month.
Q. One of your biggest jobs is overseeing distribution decisions involving the Tobacco Settlement Agreements, about $3.6 billion over 25 years. How is that going?
A. The Governor has asked me to look at the tobacco settlement dollars that the state would anticipate seeing from the settlement and how best to use them. I met with the Commissioners of Public Health, Mental Health, Public Safety, a whole host of legislators and many others on what is the best use of this money. We need to do something to educate our youth on the dangers of smoking. We also hope to do as much as possible for those who have suffered the ravages of smoking. It's multifaceted. Connecticut has the unfortunate distinction of having the youngest age of children who start to smoke in the first place. That is age 11.
For the Department of Public Safety we would like to have more money for enforcement. You cannot sell cigarettes to those under age 18 but people don't pay attention to that. Enforcement needs to be increased.
Cessation programs need to be supported. Insurance companies may not pay for the nicotine patch, for example, and yet that may be the most effective way for someone to kick the habit.
People may be in nursing homes because of ill health due to years of smoking. Who is paying for that? Where do we get the money from? Who helps out?
When we looked at how best to spend all this money we broke it down into different categories. We also said one of the things you have to do is put money aside in a trust fund. Down the road we are going to be able to pay for the programs we are putting in place now. Nobody had the best idea of how to spend all that money immediately. I'm always a little bit cautious. So we took an immediate $20 million and set up a trust fund.
We earmarked $5 million for a media campaign, cessation programs, advertising and to set up a panel of 14 members who will actually help in future distribution of additional dollars.
Q. Do you miss your lack of privacy?
A. People think you have somebody do everything for you and forget you are a normal person. I go grocery shopping. I do laundry. Once, early on a Sunday morning I was grocery shopping and there was only one other lady and me. We both got to the checkout line. She asked me, "Has anyone ever told you look like the Lieutenant Governor?" And I said "No, she's better looking than I am." She started to laugh. Then she saw the car in the parking lot and saw my license plate. It says "L Rell," my husband's license plate. She said, "Oh you are Jody Rell! I didn't mean to bother you." I really don't mind.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. William V. Costanzo;
Overseeing a World of Films and Talk

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
LEAVE your popcorn money home when you go to the Friday Night Film Series at Westchester Community College. It is definitely not part of the evening that Dr. William V. Costanzo, an English professor who runs the series, has in store for moviegoers.
Rather, the series at the college in Valhalla, entering its 35th season this month, will offer premovie refreshments, and then the agenda calls for serious film watching and animated discussions about what was seen. 
 A resident of Mount Kisco, Dr. Constanzo, 54, teaches literature, composition writing and film classes and has headed the film series since 1991. This year's offerings, which begin on Sept. 17 and end on Oct. 29, and their respective country of origin are "Central Station," Brazil; "The Apple," Iran; "Night of Cabiria," Italy; "Sherlock Jr.," the United States (a silent Buster Keaton film); "Underground," Serbia, and "Tango," Spain. Subscriptions for the series are $30 or $24 for older residents and can be reserved by calling 785-6700. Tickets for a single film are $6 ($5 for the elderly). Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Constanzo:
Q. What got you interested in film?
A. I discovered film when I began teaching, partly through my students and partly because I was given an opportunity to teach a film class the first year I was here. And I just became enthralled. I saw 364 movies that year. I was down in the city watching all the new wave movies and the South American movies and the Eastern European movies, and it just opened up a whole new world to me. I think what I liked about it was that expansive quality. You could just enter into completely different worlds.
Q. More so than with books?
A. In a way, yes. I always talk about this with my students -- what you miss when you are watching movies and not reading books and how much of the imaginative work of reading is given on the screen. You see the face, you cannot see anyone but that face. A movie is more of an immersive experience because there are sounds and visual elements that surround you in a film, and I like that.
There is a social dimension to being in a theater with other people being told the same story. In my literature classes, where we go back to Homer and to Anglo-Saxon times, we notice that storytelling has taken different form at different times. In Homer's time you passed the story down by word of mouth. And then there were epics passed down and recited at occasions where people got together and part of the experience was listening to the same story together and laughing and sharing tears, that sense of community.
Reading is essentially a solitary activity. Movies have restored some of that shared story listening, and I think that's important and why people come to our series. I love to stay at the end and hear what other people's perceptions are.
Q. How has the Film Series changed since you took it over?
A. I enjoy being in touch with the audience. So I began giving little introductory talks. People were coming up to me and felt a connection to me and the film. So I introduced discussions. Stanley Feingold, who headed this before me, had them occasionally, and I think that's what I enjoy the most. A 10-minute talk to introduce the film and there is an hour before when people are assembling for refreshments, and I like that sense of being part of the film community. I chat with the regular subscribers and meet some of the new people.
Q. How many people attend?
A. We have seats for just under 400, and I'd say about 300, 350 people come.
Q. People of all ages?
A. All ages but most of the people take advantage of the senior discount, so we have a very mature audience of people who are retired, who, I think, see this as an alternative to the multiplex phenomenon. They see it as a place to meet their friends week after week and discuss the latest movie they've seen and discuss the next one.
Q. What kind of movies do you personally like? Or do you like to call them films?
A. I do like movies and I like film and I sometimes appreciate cinema. I particularly enjoy international films and the classics. And that's mostly what I show. There is a phenomenon recently that I think has to do with the popularity of the movie "Life Is Beautiful," which was popular despite the fact that it's a subtitled film. I think we're seeing more and more theaters carrying subtitled films.
And I think that's part of a larger phenomenon. Every once in a while the Italians will make a really great, popular film, like "Cinema Paradiso," or "Il Postino." But I think it's part of the global village, as McLuhan called it, and the international economy and the sort of multicultural nation that we've become. There is more of an interest in other cultures. And more of a curiosity of how people live in other parts of the world.
Q. Curiosity by people of all ages, or more mature people?
A. I see more and more young people coming to our series, and it's often a new experience for them, and they're delighted. And also I see them coming to films like Buster Keaton's. Last season we showed "The General," and when we have silent films we always have live musical accompaniment. That's one of the highlights. Lee Erwin comes up on the train from New York once a year and sits down at his Steinway, and he plays original music to accompany the action. He goes way back. He studied the organ in Paris, and he created the original scores for all the Buster Keaton movies. So when he comes, he's a master and people adore him. And it's a real treat for people who have never seen a silent movie before. He'll be here again this season. We're doing "Sherlock Jr.", which is the movie where Buster Keaton jumps into the movie screen and becomes part of the movie.
There is another phenomenon. I think as we reach the 100th anniversary of the history of movies we're much more conscious of preserving our heritage as literature of the 20th and 21st centuries. So there has been a lot of attention to the classics and refurbishing them. We're showing "Nights of Cabiria," which was redone last year with a new print and subtitles you can read, a new sound track, and they've restored one of the sequences that was censored by the Roman Catholic Church when it came out in 1957.
Q. What do you think of the state of popular movies at this point. Are they too oriented toward making a quick buck?
A. For many years I adjudicated a New York young filmmakers program, and I got a chance to see a lot of what young filmmakers were making, and I think they begin by imitating. And what they imitate is the technique of movie making -- because young people don't have that much to say.
They haven't lived much of a life. But they have a wonderful visual sense. They have been honed on all those wonderful video games and television shows. So they have technique in search of something to say. As they get older, they learn to make connections between more and more things in their lives but there certainly is a great interest now in independent filmmaking -- there is an explosion. It's partly because it's easier to make films and to get them distributed. You can distribute your movie now on the Internet. It's a little scary, too.
Q. Who do you admire of American filmmakers. Spielberg for his imagination?
A. Spielberg is an interesting example of someone who has matured. He began with wonderfully crafted films, and his movies were very successful because he really understood American audiences. And as he got older he began going into deeper subjects -- the Holocaust, black America. So we'll probably see that with a lot of other independent filmmakers as well.
Quentin Tarantino is a big hero among my students. His movies are scary, filled with quirky acts of violence, and I think older audiences don't respond to that. This is always one of the debates that come up when you have both younger and older audiences together.
Younger people see a lot of screen violence as part of the choreography of cinema. They don't see it as aspects of violence connected to real people and real suffering, and it doesn't bother them. The same is true of what is called adult language. A lot of older people are disturbed by the profanity of some movies. But for kids, it's just filler words.

HEADLINE: As Economy Continues Surge, Sailors' Dreams Turn to Yachts

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
LAST winter, when Ray Kish went looking for a new sailboat to replace the 25-foot Catalina he had sailed for 12 years in a Pennsylvania lake, he knew he wanted a bigger boat, but all he had intended to buy was a 30-footer.
But Mr. Kish didn't like the way the cabin of the 30-foot model was laid out, so instead, last April he and his wife, Bonnie, bought a Catalina 42, which he described as "our summer home." 
 The single-mast sloop, Marketeer, is 14 feet wide at the beam, and has a full galley, two bathrooms and three staterooms. It is packed with electronic gear, including radar, a depth finder, and an auto-pilot. Mr. and Mrs. Kish have spent every free hour this summer on board, sometimes just relaxing at the dock at Captain's Cove marina in Bridgeport or sailing off for a weekend or a week to to visit Block Island and Martha's Vineyard.
"At the age of 55, you only go around once," Mr. Kish explained. "I know many people my age who never had the opportunity to live out their dream."
This summer, more people are living out their dreams along the Connecticut shoreline than ever before. The repeal of a 10 percent luxury tax, low interest rates and a strong economy have combined to push boat sales to the boom levels of the mid-1980's.
Boats of every size and for every corner of the market have sold well, but for vessels large enough and sufficiently well appointed to be called yachts, the difference has been the most dramatic. Salesmen have reported shortages of both new and used boats at the top end of the market, those costing more than $100,000, and marinas are hard-pressed to find dock space for them.
These large vessels are as costly as a vacation house, and often more luxurious, so Mr. Kish's metaphor is no exaggeration. He purchased his boat second-hand and declined to say what it cost, but noted that a new Catalina 42 like his would cost around $200,000.
His neighbor at the end of the next dock, Michael Lenihan, wanted to live aboard his boat, and he wanted to live well. If Mr. Kish's sailboat is a vacation home, Mr. Lenihan's Carver 42 aft-cabin motor yacht, Wild Thing, is, he said, "like a floating, very elaborate apartment in Manhattan."
Mr. Lenihan's boat has two salons, two staterooms, a bridge, a full-sized refrigerator in the galley, and three-zone air conditioning and heating. He also declined to say what he paid for his boat, which was purchased second-hand, but noted that a new Carver 42 costs around a half-million dollars.
He is a pilot for United Airlines who flies Boeing 747's from New York to Tokyo and back, a job that keeps him busy only six to nine days a month.
The rest of the time he travels around the Sound, visiting the many harbors and often tying up in Newport, R.I., where a friend of his owns a restaurant.
"You can get more out of life living on a boat," he said, sounding very relaxed.
Dan Brewster, a retired engineer from Westport whose Monterey 33 express cruiser, Judy's Joy, is docked near Mr. Lenihan's boat.
"He just travel around and see what we can see," Mr. Brewster explained.
What they see along the shorelines and islands of Southern New England, New York and Long Island is considered by some boaters to be one of the most congenial places for shoreline cruising in the United States.
"We've got some of the best cruising areas in the country," said Grant Westerson, executive director of the Connecticut Marine Trades Association. "You can touch three states in an afternoon if you plan your trip carefully."
Although he said he had no statistics and the Department of Environmental Protection couldn't furnish any, either, Mr. Westerson said boat sales have been climbing steadily for three years. "We've probably seen, over the last three years, a 60 percent increase," he said.
One of the chief reasons is Congress's repeal in 1993 of a 10 percent luxury tax on boats costing more than $100,000 that had stalled the luxury boat business severely after it was passed in the late-1980's.
Combined with the recession that occurred then, the tax drove many boat manufacturers out of business.
With few boats being built and even fewer being sold earlier in the decade, there is now a shortage of fairly new, large second-hand sailboats and powerboats for sale.
"Five- or six-year-old boats are like hen's teeth," said Mr. Westerson. "You can't find any. Boat brokers are having as much trouble getting boats to sell as new boat dealers are."
Jeff Marshall, owner of Sailing Specialties in Groton, which sells new and used sailboats, said every size boat, from nine-foot boats to 60-foot luxury yachts, sell almost immediately if they are in good condition. He said the boom was related mostly to the good economy.
"People are confident in the economy, interest rates are low and people are more willing to spend on a luxury," he said.
For someone to buy a boat, Mr. Kish said banks will loan the purchase price at 7.5 percent interest with no money down. He said the Federal Government also allows the owner to write off the interest payments just like mortgage interest, and Connecticut charges no property tax on them.
Jim Gardella, who operates Cove Marina and Norwalk Boat Sales in Norwalk, said his marina was full and dock space was very tight. "This is the first year our marina has no docks available since 1990, '91," he said.
A mainstay of the top end of the market for Mr. Gardella is the Ocean Alexander 42, which is comparable to Mr. Lenihan's Wild Thing.
"Every time we get one in we sell it," he said.
His son, Rob Gardella, showed off a new Ocean Alexander 42 while workers installed hardware and fittings. The boat has a salon with a parquet wood floor, a galley with a microwave/convection oven, and two staterooms, one with a queen-size bed. It also has radar, a global positioning satellite system and an auto-pilot device, which allows the owner to program its course and let the boat pilot itself.
"You can steer with your mouse and your laptop computer," he said. "That's the new thing."
The younger Mr. Gardella said the old term "cabin cruiser" is obsolete. The 42-foot Ocean Alexander is classified as a trawler, characterized by a conservative design, extended cruising range, and live-aboard furnishings. Norwalk Boat Sales was offering it for $446,125.
Smaller vessels with sleeker, more modern designs, that are faster but have shorter cruising ranges and less luxurious cabins, are known as express cruisers. Large vessels, 50 feet or longer, that are bigger, wider, and faster than trawlers are classified as flush-deck motor yachts. A 68-foot Ocean Alexander model costs nearly $2 million. Many of these yachts will be on display at the Norwalk Boat Show, Sept. 23-26, at Cove Marina.
Albin Marine Inc. makes diesel-powered cruising boats ranging from 28 feet to 39 feet long, and from $100,000 to $250,000 in price. The boats are made in Rhode Island, and the company is headquartered in Greenwich.
The company's owner, Fred Peters, said his sales are backlogged.
In the last three years, Mr. Peters said his sales have grown by 50 percent. He said he thought the growth had more to do with the improved economy than with the repeal of the tax. When people have money, they spend it.
"A boat is like a summer house," he said.
Still, like many other people in the boating industry, Mr. Peters spoke bitterly about the luxury tax. "Our industry was singled out," he said. "Trips to Hawaii were not singled out."
At Captain's Cove, Mr. Brewster said it took a while to get used to his 33-foot boat. Just last year he had bought a 23-foot boat, but "when I had the opportunity to retire early, my wife said, 'That boat is not going to do it.' " There were some tricks to learn to maneuver the new boat, 10 feet longer, into a dock slip.
Mr. Lenihan said he has already decided he wants a bigger motor yacht, a 55-footer with three staterooms, so he can entertain more guests and use one of the staterooms as a home office.
He had owned sailboats before, but he is very happy to own a powerboat instead. At age 40, he has grown tired of raising and lowering sails all the time.
"I'm done with that," he said. "All I want to raise and lower is my beer."

To the Editor:
 I agree with Mr. Shere that it is time to return Pacifica stations to the communities that paid for them, and that the Pacifica board should step down. But much of the rest of Mr. Shere's thinking is inconsistent, politically naive and contemptuous of the very communities he refers to. 
 He writes that "the powerful transmitter at the commercial frequency of 94.1 megahertz is wasted on Pacifica as it now operates, and they would be right to sell it and use the money to encourage the development of a number of smaller stations, locally programmed, locally responsible, locally administered."
I am all for the development of small, locally administered stations, but I reject the assumption embedded in Mr. Shere's statement that local communities do not deserve, and should not administrate, a powerful transmitter.
Currently, 99.9 percent of the nation's powerful transmitters are given over to corporate propaganda, commercial pandering, religious indoctrination, unquestioned government pronouncements, context-less ahistorical soundbite news and ill-informed loudmouth talk show hosts. And all of it floats in a sea of musical offerings from media conglomerates that serve the mission of increasing their owners' wealth and influence. That's the real waste!
To think that small local stations alone can adequately grapple with the issues of our time is to ignore what has happened to the world since the 1960's. There are few purely local issues anymore. Globalization of the economy and transnational corporate domination of media and politics force local communities to make common cause across borders just to maintain their autonomy. Residents of a town in rural America are likely to find themselves in a struggle to prevent their home from being turned into a repository for another state's, or another country's, nuclear waste. Farmers in the United States must engage in dialogue with farmers in Britain and India to prevent the contamination of their crops by the products of transnational biotech firms. And residents of a tiny Pacific island will see their homeland submerged unless they can stop countries thousands of miles away from disgorging greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Far from being a waste, Pacifica radio is an antidote to the alienation and passivity fostered by the way mainstream media present news. Recent events have shown that only open, accountable administration of this national treasure can guard against its seizure for corrupt or self-serving purposes.

HEADLINE: Counselors Move In and Then Tune In

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
ON a recent summer evening the haze had almost given way to darkness and 11-year-old twin brothers Brian and Byron Faulks were hanging out in one of the courtyards at the Farnam Courts Housing development in New Haven.
Not far away the nightly drug deals were just getting started, and groups of teen-agers clung together. One brazen young teen-ager with tattoos on both arms walked by with what appeared to be a handgun sticking out of his pocket. 
 But 20-year-old Pierre Gouborn stood near the twins and reminded them to stay away from trouble. It was a theme Mr. Gouborn, a former drug dealer himself, had touched on repeatedly throughout the summer while working as a counselor in a special year-round program serving 1,200 children in Connecticut's low-income communities.
Mr. Gouborn was among a group of college counselors who were spending the summer living in vacant apartments at the housing project so they could work both day and night with many of the young children. The nonprofit program, which was established in New Haven in 1992, is called Leadership, Education and Athletics in Partnership, or LEAP, and it is now in five of Connecticut's largest cities, including New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, New London and Waterbury.
"It's tough because these kids are growing up in such hopeless and impoverished conditions and they see dealers making big money and driving shiny new cars. I know what that's like because it happened to me," said Mr. Gouborn, who grew up in the Fairhaven section of the city.
Now an advertising major at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., Mr. Gouborn talks about how he left the drug trade several years ago after watching so many of his friends and relatives be killed.
That's something Margaret Sawyer, a Yale University senior who grew up in a Cleveland suburb, never faced. Ms. Sawyer spent this summer as a counselor working with young girls.
"It's been an amazing, eye-opening experience for me that I don't think would have been as powerful if I hadn't been actually living here," said Ms. Sawyer, gathered recently for a strategy session with several other LEAP counselors in one of the apartments the program provides for them throughout the summer.
The counselors -- sitting on old, gray couches, dirty and torn, placed on patches of musky, light brown carpet -- were living in conditions similar to many of the project's 218 families.
"The girls we work with are facing the temptations of teen-age sexuality that leads many of them into single motherhood by the time they are 14 or 15, as well all the drugs and violence they see on an almost daily basis," she said. "We try to help them by showing there is another way, that through education and social participation, they don't have to be resigned to this kind of life."
Helping inner-city children is what motivated Brad Williams after he arrived at Yale University from Little Rock, Ark., in 1992. He began working as one of the first counselors in the LEAP program, which had just begun. The program is financed by individual donors and foundations like the Kellogg Foundation as well as Federal grants and state grants.
Moses Nelson, then 9 years old, was one of the first pupils Mr. Williams worked with. Moses was born with the congenital white hair and skin pigment condition known as albinism.
Mr. Williams was a freshman majoring in psychology, economics and political science, and Moses was a special-education fourth-grader already pegged as a problem child with serious emotional and behavioral difficulties, and a bad attitude that stemmed in part from being constantly teased by his peers.
"I knew there was a lot more to him than what people could see at that point, and the more I worked with him the more I discovered what an incredible mind he had," Mr. Williams said. "As I gained his trust and worked to improve his reading and social skills, he began to thrive."
Now, Mr. Williams is executive director of LEAP, which has grown into a multifaceted year-round educational and social enrichment program with an emphasis on reading and literacy that is helping children in Connecticut's most impoverished inner-cities.
Moses now works with younger children between 7-14 and is one of the most popular high school counselors in the program.
"Before I met Brad and got involved in LEAP, I felt that I didn't fit in anywhere and I hated school," said Moses, a 16-year-old junior at Hill House High School and president of the Dixwell Community Center Youth Council. "When I was 9, I desperately needed a role model, and Brad inspired me to keep trying and never give up."
There are more than 125 college counselors in the program matched with the same number of high school counselors, and their job is to help poor children improve their reading and writing skills, and to develop a bond as mentors to help influence the youngsters about life choices as much as about academics.
"When the children see you are so committed that you're even willing to live in their neighborhood and work with them after hours, they take what you're trying to do a lot more seriously and open up in ways that would be impossible without that component," said Damian Arrington of Pittsburgh, a junior majoring in elementary education at South Carolina State University who has also spent the summer living at the Farnam housing project.
Mr. Arrington said he was getting the opportunity to "learn so much more about" his chosen occupation as an educator through real-life experiences "than by just sitting in a classroom or reading a textbook."
That was one of the goals of the nonprofit program's founder when it was established in one New Haven neighborhood seven years ago. Anne Tyler Calabresi, wife of the Federal judge and former Yale Law School dean, Guido Calabresi, said she wanted the program to help two entirely groups of young people.
"My vision was that this program could be a springboard to help children in cities throughout the state, and at the same time provide college and high school students with invaluable real-life experience for future careers in education, social work and whatever else they might want to pursue," Mrs. Calabresi said.
The children are encouraged to read aloud to their peers, engage in Internet-based computer technology projects, learn to resolve conflict, reflect on their lives in journals, take overnight camping trips and travel in groups to cities such as Washington, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Toronto.
During the summer, public schools are used during the morning where 100 students are divided into groups of eight, where counselors work on both academics and engage the students in frank discussions about what's going on in their lives.
Educators say the program is making their job easier.
"The program not only reinforces the goals and missions of the New Haven Board of Education, it enhances and enriches the lives of children every day of the year through real-life experiences like trips to cities around the country," said Leroy C. Williams, principal of Roberto Clemente School in the Hill section of the city and one of five LEAP sites in New Haven.
"It's one thing to teach our pupils about the way the government works in Washington, but LEAP actually takes them there and shows them," Mr. Williams said.

HEADLINE: From Bungalows to Nouveau Chateaus, It's a Bang-Up Year for Knock-Downs

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: LOVELADIES

 BODY:
FOR the last decade or so, when Long Beach Islanders wanted to show off a distinctive house, they would take visitors to the 100 block of Long Beach Boulevard here and point them toward the unusual residence known, for obvious reasons, as the "Pyramid House."
But time moves quickly by the shifting sands at the Jersey Shore. A flurry of dollars has showered community and many other Shore towns, and it is snowing under even some landmarks. 
 "The Pyramid House, that is going bye-bye," said Gail Cook, the owner of HCH Real Estate in neighboring Harvey Cedars. "People bought it and it's coming down. President Nixon rented that house. All the ships at sea used that as a landmark. I'm sure the new house there will be gorgeous. Things are just changing at the Shore and little will be able to stop it."
There is little doubt that 1999 has been a bang-up -- or rather, a knock-down, build-up -- year in seashore real estate. Longtime observers say that from Long Beach Island to Cape May, they have never seen anything like the amount of homes being bought and demolished, only to be replaced by mansions.
"It's to the point now where people buy a four-bedroom, three-bath 15-year-old home and just mow it down with the furniture in it," said John Tracy, the building official in Avalon's construction department. "In the past, there might have been open land, or at least people would be happy with the house they bought. But there is clearly a lot of stock market money out there and people willing to spend it."
In 1995, a good year by most economic standards, Avalon issued only 20 demolition permits for house construction. This year, the borough matched that by March 1. In neighboring Stone Harbor, records show the first million-dollar property sold in 1995, and only one other house in that borough sold for more than $700,000. This year, by contrast, after four years of negligible inflation, 13 houses sold for more than $700,000 by May, and one of them for more than $3 million.
But even that seems a pittance only a few months later. One home in the dunes in Avalon is being offered for sale at $8 million; it has two pools and its expansive tropical architecture makes it look like a Miami Beach hotel. On Long Beach Island, one realtor, Benee Scola has a bayfront, six-bedroom property for sale here for $5,950,000.
"The bayfront is as good as the ocean these days," Ms. Scola said. "On the ocean, you have a limited outdoor space on which you can build. On the bay, you can have a tennis court, gardens, decks, a dock, whatever. People spend this kind of money, they want a great quality of life."
Yet this rising quality of life and its accompanying surge in expensive home building at the seashore is altering the quality of life.
"It is changing the complexion of these towns,' said David Swift, president of Citizens for Historic Preservation, a two-year-old Ocean City group that says it is opposed to rampant development in Shore communities. "People came here originally because it exuded a certain charm. Families came back summer after summer, people from all walks of life. Now it is becoming increasingly dense and expensive. How long will people be able to pay $3,500, $4,500 a week to rent?"
Mr. Swift, who has lived in Ocean City since moving there from Philadelphia in 1972, organized his group early last year when he noticed many of his favorite houses in town being torn down for what he said were monstrosities. He called for a demonstration in front of one of them on a cold day in January. In one sense, the demonstration was unsuccessful because the house was demolished anyway. But he also got 2,000 signatures on a petition in hopes of saving it, and since then his group has filed suit against the Ocean City government to stop the destruction of a circa 1885 lifesaving station at Fourth and Atlantic Avenues where developers want to erect three duplexes.
"The town just wants the additional ratables, but they forget about the stresses on things like the sewer system," Mr. Swift said."And the issue of the character of the town is very important. There will come a time when the economy is not so good, and then these places may well be abandoned. That will be doubly sad."
In the meantime, the tearing down and building up goes on apace. Ocean City alone issued 209 demolition and building permits in 1998 -- the largest number of any town in the state -- and another 102 by June of this year.
"Suppliers are getting short on materials and it is increasingly difficult to find qualified help in all areas right now," said David Fabbri, of Fabbri Builders in Vineland, which does home and commercial construction at the Shore. His prize right now is a huge frame house with a three-story turret that will provide an unobstructed ocean view a block from the beach on 100th Street in Stone Harbor. He is building it for a family member, "so it will be a little cheaper," but a smaller home nearby sold for $800,000 last year.
"Houses are now tending to be quite grand," Mr. Fabbri said. "Before, they were plain boxes. Now there is attention to every detail. I don't see it changing right now. People have money, as long as the stock market is booming."
Ms. Scola, the Long Beach Island realtor, said this particular building boom is different than the previous one in the mid-1980's in ways that make it seem like it will have more staying power.
"This is being fueled by the leading edge of the baby boomers, those in their 50's who are doing well financially," she said. "They are not looking for just a beach house, but something that maybe 10 years down the road they will retire to. They want central air-conditioning. They want gas heat for the winter. They want every amenity they can get and the old houses they are buying just don't have them.
"Back in the 1980's, too, lots of people were merely into just flipping houses here to make a profit," said Ms. Scola. "You know, they would want to say, I flipped this Shore house over in two months and made $50,000. This isn't a speculation market. It is much healthier this way."
Still, there is the admission among many that this latest spree is likely to change the character of many beach towns.
"There are more and more people here buying something that they feel will be distinctive," said Ms. Cook, the Harvey Cedars realtor. "It's about views, mostly. When the towns were first laid out, homes were built geometrically along a road. You were down at the beach to be at the beach. A water view didn't matter. Now people vie for the view and once they knock down a smaller house, they naturally need a bigger one to get that view."
And as prices go up and up, the average family may well lose even the dream of a beach house of its own.
"A second home transaction for $200,000 minimum, I don't think you can say that is for the common man any more," said Ms. Scola. "To have a beach house in a good town, you have to have done well enough to have discretionary income, it's true. But the lure of the ocean has always been great. We just have to make sure there is a place on the beach for everyone."

HEADLINE: In Cape May County, a Time of Growing Pains

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE

 BODY:
GAIL DWYER, talking about the houses rising across the street from hers in Avalon, displacing the killdeer that used to roost there, wonders whether there will be an inch of green space left. "I took my first steps in Avalon," she said. "They're taking away too much of what people come here for."
On the beach along the other shore of Cape May County, Tim McGarvey of Turnersville, near Philadelphia, remembered aloud when there were just tiny bungalows behind the dunes. His wife, Darlene, said she used to drive down on Route 47 through glorious emptiness. When asked about the prospect of more development, she said, "Where are they going to put it?" 
 People on this sandy southern spit of New Jersey talk wistfully about the past, before the beauty of the place courted subdivisions and cinder-block chain stores. Since the future will only bring more of them, it is already cause for regret.
And this summer, the issue of growth has become combustible as never before, thanks to the convergence of two voluminous land-use plans for Cape May County. One would put in 100 miles of sewer lines, and the other would reconfigure the development allowed under the state's coastal protection law.
Environmental groups statewide have protested both, saying they will permit 50,000 more housing units in the county, which now has about 92,000 homes and 110,000 year-round residents. "It's hard to take a growth chart and see it," said Jody Carrara, project director for the New Jersey Association of Environmental Commissions, "but let your imagination picture 150,000 more people."
The estimate is disputed by developers and many local officials, who contend that the buildable land remaining in the county cannot accommodate anything close to that number.
"There's not that much left," said Grover R. Webber, environmental director of the county health department. "These guys are rattling their sabers, and I don't know what that's all about. It's not going to happen."
Passions are unusually high for debate over a sewer plan and a statute -- the Coastal Area Facility Review Act, called Cafra -- that most voters never heard of. "I've seen more fights coming out of Cape May County in the last two months than in the last decade," said Bill Neil, director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society.
Environmental groups depict a battle to preserve what is left of the New Jersey shore and its water supply, to save a nationally critical bird habitat and to test the state's resolve on containing sprawl. "The implications on the state and national level are just so important because if we lose Cape May we lose New Jersey," said Jeff Tittel, president of the state chapter of the Sierra Club. "It's that much of a symbol. It's one of the last rural counties left, and the last one at the shore."
Judy Jengo, the deputy commissioner of environmental protection who is shepherding the revisions to the coastal review act, scheduled to take effect in December, said they were an especially touchy subject here. "Cape May does seem to be the case study," Ms. Jengo said.
Much of the state is directly affected by the coastal review act, enacted in 1973 to protect a band of waterfront from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to the Raritan Bay. But while other counties have fringes in the review's jurisdiction, almost all of Cape May County is within its sweep.
As such, the county has become a kind of testing ground for Governor Whitman's "smart growth" initiative to rein in sprawl.
THE current rules in the coastal review act require a site-by-site examination of plans for major developments. But the Legislature amended the law six years ago to require new rules consistent with the goals of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, which would restrict building on rural and environmentally sensitive land and direct it to population centers. To that end, the Department of Environmental Protection designated existing development "centers" and four other types of land-use areas, assigning allowable densities for each.
Politically speaking, the department has been forced onto the narrowest of paths between those who say its rules would give away the store to developers and those who say it would chase them away from the Shore.
All along, the rules were attacked by development interests and by State Senator William L. Gormley, Republican of Atlantic County, who maintains that while the Whitman Administration is giving other communities money for open space, it is simply regulating the Shore into submission.
But then many environmental groups, ordinarily reliable advocates of smart growth, also turned against the plan, arguing that it would allow even the most restricted areas to become dotted with new houses.
Their larger complaint, however, is with the limits of the law itself: the coastal review act does not apply to housing developments of fewer than 25 units or commercial projects with fewer than 50 parking spaces. Because of the "Cafra loophole," Ms. Carrara said, "Cape May County is being lost to 24-unit developments."
The critics are gathering allies in the Legislature; Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a Princeton Democrat, expects to announce legislation this week to close the loophole. "Developers are nickel-and-diming the Shore to death in 24-unit spurts," Mr. Gusciora said. "It's a statewide issue. Shore area legislators are always going to be fearful of retaliation from developers. It's going to be up to the inland legislators to push Cafra along. It's our Shore, too."
State Senator Gormley, of course, disagrees. He has repeatedly urged the Governor to change the whole planning process to allow local officials to devise their own shore-protection plans. "Whether people are coming from a sound environmental perspective or a political survival mode, they're not going to submit a map that would subvert the quality of life in the area," the Senator said in a telephone interview. "That would be stupid."
But Ms. Jengo described painstaking groundwork with hundreds of local officials. Even in mapping some of the centers, she said, "we met with them and asked, 'Do you want the lines here, or here?' "
Ms. Jengo also said that while the loophole was "a wild card," the new rules would allow development on only 2 percent of all of Cape May County's land area. "We're protecting vast amounts there," she said.
The department maintains that the change in rules does not affect the total amount of new construction allowed, but others' assessments vary wildly.
The Sierra Club, for example, which has counted up vacant acres in the hundreds of designated centers, predicts that they will undergo unprecedented building booms. But the New Jersey Builders Association has contended that local zoning rules and political opposition in already-developed areas makes them the hardest places to build.
Nancy Wittenberg, the association's director of environmental affairs, also said the department had provided no basis for calculating how much land in the centers was actually buildable. "We don't know whether those centers were drawn to reflect what's on the ground already, or whether they were drawn to accommodate some percentage of growth in the future," Ms. Wittenberg said. "If the boundaries are drawn around what's already there, it leads us to believe the department didn't do any analysis of growth."
In Cape May County, the fight proceeds acre by acre.
Douglas Jewell, a real estate agent and writer who has helped organize local opposition to both the sewer plan and the proposals for the coastal review, has much of the county's building and zoning mapped out in his head. On a driving tour with Ms. Carrara, he traced the path of the proposed sewer lines and pointed out parcels already claimed by developers.
"These wooded areas?" he said at one point in Middle Township. "Sewers are going in. The whole area could be rezoned for retirement communities."
Middle Township, the county's large midsection, is the township expected to develop most quickly, and that is what township officials want. The sewer extensions will bring it up Route 9, through stretches of woods and meadows now dotted with businesses like John's Transmissions and the Chatterbox nursery school.
"This will all be a shopping mall," Mr. Jewell said upon entering his hometown of Swainton. "There are 36 acres, and he can only use 16 acres of it because of wetlands, but he can put in 10 stores."
Up the road are the Stone Harbor Golf Club and the Avalon Golf Club, each of which will build more than 300 housing units when the sewers arrive. They will easily double the number of houses in Swainton.
Mr. Webber at the health department said that under current zoning, the new sewers would enable 2,050 new housing units in Middle Township and only about 600 more in other parts of the county -- altogether, he said, a tiny percentage of the 50,000 new units that environmentalists predict.
Ms. Carrara's objections to new development focus on the water supply -- already, the peninsula's southern tip has a desalinization plant because the aquifers have been drawn down enough to permit saltwater intrusion into wells -- and the prospect of sprawl. "By running sewers up Route 9, you're going directly against the state plan goals," she said.
For many reasons, the sewer plan, which must be approved by the Board of Freeholders and then by the Department of Environmental Protection, has brought emotional responses. A hearing six weeks ago lasted more than four hours and drew more than 200 people. Some represented groups like the Audubon Society and the League of Women Voters (both opposed), some were residents complaining of being left out of the plan, and many were citizens dismayed by the prospect of new building.
"There were people in tears testifying," Mr. Jewell said. "There were people who had never spoken in public before. They were shaking. It's not just a few. It's everybody pleading with the freeholders, don't do this to our county."
On their drive, Mr. Jewell and Ms. Carrara noted that the county has areas in need of redevelopment, notably the Wildwoods. In Villas, a densely built neighborhood of bungalows along the bay, Mr. Jewell pointed to tattered properties, some of which he said he had sold for as little as $40,000, that were excellent candidates for teardowns.
"This area could keep the real estate industry busy for 50 years," he said. "There's plenty of money to be made here."
Environmentalists predict that the industry will be kept busy one way or another. "People are going to say, 'I've had enough of East Orange or Bergen County.' " Mr. Jewell said. "They're going to want to come here for the Shore life."
When faced with complaints about an imminent population boom, he said, many local officials are dismissive. "They say, 'Oh, come on, do you really think they're going to put in 50,000 new housing units?' Well, some of us think it's going to be 70,000."
The Sierra Club maintains that under the proposed development regulations, Cape May County could grow by at least 65,000 housing units in 20 years.
"If you build it, they will come," Mr. Tittel said. "The only limiting factor is infrastructure, and if you put it in you'll get growth. Cape May is a desirable place. It's got beach, open space, bay, places to sail and play golf. They're going to market Cape May the way they marketed Myrtle Beach. You say, oh, Victorian homes, the beaches, and then it becomes a land rush. Then all those forecasts based on current trends are out the window."
The county's estimates of growth are far lower: It projects an increase in the year-round population from about 110,000 now to 140,000 in 2020. "The economy is booming now, and Cape May County isn't," said James J. Smith, the planning director. "We're growing, but we're not booming."
He said nearly two-thirds of the county consists of wetlands, which will always be protected, and that publicly owned property like the large Federal wildlife refuges makes up much of the rest. Finally, a big swath in the county's northwest corner is in the Pinelands.
Still, Mr. Smith said that while it would take many more decades than they predicted, the environmentalists' figures on residential growth could eventually be realized. "Is 50,000 new housing units realistic?" he said. "Yeah, maybe."
To builders, it does not look so possible. Jonathan Sachar, who is working on his third subdivision project, puzzled over the planning department's estimate that Lower Township could accommodate more than 8,000 new homes. "There are only about 1,000 acres available now," Mr. Sachar said, "and that means 1,000 houses."
Mr. Sachar has done a lot of scouting for acres. He knows many farmers in the township, having grown up in the area, and they are the principal owners of buildable land.
Mr. Sachar, who became a builder after practicing land-use law in Cape May, said much of the land was off-limits not only because of the coastal building regulations but because of other waterfront-development requirements and sewer restrictions.
He said he did not absolutely oppose the proposed new rules but argued that they penalized the farmers whose land would be devalued. "If you want to preserve property," he said, "do it the old-fashioned way: buy it. It's amazing how many people are calling me now who really don't want to see their land developed but are panicking because they see the value sucking away."
The upshot is that "they're putting in development applications right and left," he said. "In a way, the state is forcing development."
Mr. Sachar is about to start putting roads in for his Egret's Walk development, 24 houses in Lower Township. He bought 180 acres for $750,000 two years ago, sold 120 acres to the Nature Conservancy and carved the rest into lots that will sell for $70,000 to $140,000.
AS he leaned against his pickup truck and surveyed the property, which borders a wide, peaceful marsh, he said he would preserve tree lines and keep wide buffer areas. "This is the lesser of what could have happened here," he said.
If people are filling up developments like Mr. Sachar's, it is largely because prices for the scarce remaining land on the barrier islands have reached dizzying levels. Barbara Boeshe, a real estate broker who is also chairwoman of the county planning board, said a friend recently decided to move his house to a small lot in Town Bank, on the bay side of the peninsula, that he bought for $12,000. By contrast, she said, a lot on dune ground in Avalon cost more than $300,000, or $2 million an acre.
Gail Dwyer, who lost the nesting birds across the street to new construction, described Avalon's new houses as "monsters."
"What do people need to live in those for?" said Ms. Dwyer, who works as a legal secretary. "I'm sorry to say it, but it's showing off. It's not like these people have 10 kids. I don't know where all the money's coming from."
On the county's bay side, a few big houses are appearing, too. Most are on the dunes, in the densely built bungalow villages from North Cape May to Villas.
Valma Zak, an 80-year-old widow who spends summers in her white dunefront cottage in Villas, frowned as she pointed out the houses on either side, both of which had been expanded beyond recognition.
"I don't like any of the big things, really," Mrs. Zak said. "I used to get breezes from both sides, and they cut off the air."
Mrs. Zak and her husband bought the cottage 47 years ago for $6,000 -- she said the bungalows a few blocks inland could be had for $1,800 -- and said she had no intention of changing it now.
But around her, more homeowners are building up and out. And for them, there is a gleaming new Home Depot not far away, just off Route 9.

Next Governor's Challenge: Keeping Things Neighborly

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
Things for the next governor of New Jersey to think about: The economy. Federal clean air regulations. School financing. Prison crowding. Urban development. And the neighbors, with their vexing, competing casinos.
In the early part of the decade, New Jersey's relations with its neighbors were marked by a fretful vigilance over every dime's worth of economic development. Luring another back-office operation from Wall Street was a triumph, losing another manufacturing concern to South Carolina -- or South America -- a tragedy. New York and New Jersey would periodically vow to stop trying to pirate each other's businesses, but cooperation was hard on an empty economic stomach. 
 But it is easier for a big family to get along when all the cousins drive Cadillacs.
Last week, Governor Whitman's Council of Economic Advisors reported the strongest economy in 25 years, and Joseph Seneca, the chairman of the council, said he had never been so optimistic. And while the rising economic tide reduced the cross-border squabbling, Governor Whitman, who was elected governor a year before both Republican counterparts -- George Pataki of New York and John Rowland of Connecticut -- has managed to play out her role as the pathfinder for her peers in the region. As a result, this has been a period of good feeling between New Jersey and its neighboring states.
"I'm a Whitman Republican," Governor Rowland said when he was running on a platform of lower taxes and smaller government in Connecticut So did Mr. Pataki in New York.
Sure, there will always be the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to squabble over, because both states own it and families always fight about the family business. But aside from that, prosperity and matching political philosophies have gone a long way toward making things neighborly for years now.
So how will these friends handle the looming problem of casinos? Governor Whitman has always jealously guarded the primacy of Atlantic City as the East Coast's premier gambling town. Any other town in the state that tried to think out loud about developing its own casinos, whether Asbury Park or Wildwood along the shore, or the Great Gorge resort area on the New York border, have been sharply rebuffed by the Whitman Administration with the warning that one big casino center is enough, thank you.
Now the Mohawk Indians are trying to organize a casino at an old Catskills harness track in Monticello, just 75 miles from New York City and the thousands of Atlantic City visitors who live there. So far, the governor has been politely silent on the matter of a competing casino closer to New York City (Atlantic City sits about 150 miles south of Manhattan), but New Jersey has not been silent. Senator Robert Torricelli, New Jersey's outspoken Democrat, has taken up the task of lobbying the Clinton Administration to put roadblocks in the way of any such a development, most recently by asking the Department of the Interior to require approval from the New York Legislature before any land can be transferred to the Indians for gambling purposes. Seen in the recent history of good feeling among fellow Republican governors, Mr. Torricelli is just the person to try to interfere in New York's business. He is a Democrat, after all, and so he can defend New Jersey's casino interests without the state's Republican governor having to utter a contrary word to her Republican friend in Albany.
Just how sensitive the casino issue is became clear last week, when Mr. Pataki fired back to Mr. Torricelli at a news conference: "I just think it's wrong that he's trying to intervene in affairs that are strictly between New York state and the Federal government on behalf of interests in the state of New Jersey. He should let New Yorkers and the Federal government deal with issues affecting New York."
Backers of the proposed Indian casino in Monticello have also taken out newspaper advertisements attacking Mr. Torricelli as a crony of Donald Trump, who is one of Atlantic City's biggest casino landlords.
The ads do not lie, but they do not tell the whole story. As for defending Atlantic City from competition, Mr. Torricelli is also Governor Whitman's crony. It is just that with Mrs. Whitman being such good friends with Mr. Pataki and all, nobody has to come right out and say it. Not yet, at least. But it's something for the next governor to worry about.

MUSEUM MILE
Shofar Decorating Followed by a Mass Toot
The Jewish Museum's fall season of family programs is opening on Thursday with the fourth annual Shofar Festival, an afternoon of learning and laughing for people of all ages. 
 The shofar is an ancient musical instrument that is sounded in synagogues as part of Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur services. Developed by early Hebrews, it is made from the horn of an animal, usually a ram.
To begin the festival, children can decorate plastic shofars that really work, and later in the day the shofars can be trumpeted in a parade around the museum. The parade concludes with a museumwide sounding of all the shofars, and a contest for sustaining the longest blast.
For children too young to toot (ages 2 to 4) there will be a sing-along and story hour featuring stories about Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year, which will begin at sundown on Friday.
Shofar Festival, Thursday 3:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue at 92d Street; free with museum admission: adults, $8; students and people over 65, $5.50; children under 12, free; (212) 423-3200.
 
MIDTOWN
Daylong Brazilian Festival With Food and Samba
All things Brazilian will be celebrated today in a daylong party in the city's Little Brazil, on 46th Street between Madison Avenue and Broadway.

HEADLINE: HOUSING;
$35 Million for Atlantic City Housing

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
What Mayor James Whelan describes as arguably the worst neighborhood in Atlantic City sits right next to the pride of the city's redevelopment efforts, the Northeast Inlet area where hundreds of new housing units have been constructed along grassy lanes and modern streets in the last decade to create an economically and racially integrated neighborhood.
Now, the deteriorating neighborhood, where the Shore Park and Shore Terrace housing developments are situated, is set to be demolished and rebuilt with a federal Housing and Urban Development grant announced last week. 
 "Hundreds of millions of dollars has gone into the Northeast Inlet for nice homes and Gardner's Basin, which is a thriving tourist attraction with a restaurant, shops, tour boats, and the new Ocean Life Center," said Louis Toscano, senior policy advisor to the Mayor. "The impediment to some people moving there or going there to visit the waterfront has been some of them don't want to go through the neighborhood of the projects next door."
The grant to Atlantic City, as well as another $35 million grant to Newark, were announced last week by Andrew M. Cuomo, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In all, grants of $571 million were made to 21 cities nationwide, out of 80 that asked for a total of $1.8 billion to demolish deteriorating public housing, said Jodi Bennett, a spokesman for Senator Robert Torricelli.
In Atlantic City, the money, along with at least an equal amount from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, will be used to build 600 townhouses that will be rented or sold, some below market value. The new housing will be made available to the 214 families now living in the low-rise public housing apartments on the site. Temporary relocation costs for the public housing residents will be paid for by HUD.
"This will complete the transformation of an entire area of the city," Mr. Toscano said.
The board of education will build a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school on the site and a Boys and Girls Club is nearly complete. It is not known when construction of the houses will start. Overall, some $192 million in public and private money is expected to be invested in redevelopment of the area where the public housing apartments now stand.
In Newark, the HUD money will be used to demolish the Stella Wright housing project. Built in 1959, it is the last remaining high-rise public housing project in the city. The site will be redeveloped with 750 homes and townhouses for low- and moderate-income residents.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RICHMOND HILL;
An Indo-Caribbean Bazaar, But Some Yearn for the Gap

BYLINE: By RAMIN P. JALESHGARI 

 BODY:
For Jai Ramoutar, a tourist from Trinidad, a trip to Liberty Avenue is not what New York City is all about. The 20-block strip is packed with West Indian markets, sari palaces and shops selling roti, the tortillalike bread stuffed with curried meat and vegetables. Rather, Mr. Ramoutar said over his dinner at the Hot and Spicy Roti Shop, Liberty Avenue is too much like home.
That could change if Agenda 21, a neighborhood economic and community development group, succeeds in its plans to create a merchant cooperative, spruce up the strip and attract mainstream chain stores. 
 The plan has its critics and supporters among owners of the existing stores, which are supported mainly by Indo-Caribbeans, the neighborhood's largest ethnic group. Indo-Caribbeans are descendants of immigrants from India who settled in Suriname, Trinidad and Guyana during the 19th century. Like West Indians of African descent, they tended to settle in Flatbush, Brooklyn, until about 10 years ago, when they splintered off to Richmond Hill.
Raymond Ally, an Agenda 21 co-chairman, voices worry that their numbers will not be enough to keep all the specialty shops in business, "especially since second-generation Indo-Caribbeans are more likely to go to more mainstream stores that have better selections."
Mr. Ally said the first step was to sign up enough merchants by next spring to raise money for the improvements. He envisions repainted columns under the A train, repaired lampposts, improved sanitation and flags that say "Liberty Avenue, the New American Market."
He said the group would also try to persuade roti shops to prepare their fare in a more healthful way, using less oil, leaner meats and whole wheat flour.
But Sandra Ramlakhan, the owner of Hot and Spicy, said her customers, even the non-Caribbean ones, come to eat Trinidadian home cooking. "It is what it is," she said, "and that's what they come for, not an Americanized version of our food."
The plan does have some appeal for the second generation. While her daughter, Charry, likes shopping in the traditional clothing stores, she said, "I wouldn't mind it if there was a Gap here."
Across the street at Ascot Wine and Liquor, most of the customers are Indo-Caribbeans who buy rum from Trinidad and Guyana. "Trying to change the flavor of this neighborhood by mainstreaming isn't a good idea," said Harriet Hendler, an owner. "Why would someone come to this neighborhood if it's just like everywhere else?"
Mr. Ramoutar, the tourist, was skeptical, too. "This area says 'unity' to me," he said, as Indo-Caribbean music filtered into Hot and Spicy from the busy street. "It's the only place in New York where I've seen so many people just like me."

Cars for the Credit-Challenged

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

 BODY:
Mel Farr, a Detroit car dealer, doesn't mind leasing used cars to people with bad credit, as long as they don't mind driving around with a gizmo on the dashboard that keeps their cars from starting if they miss a payment.
Those who lease from Mr. Farr must pay up weekly in order to get a code to punch into the device on the dashboard. Anyone who is late paying can still drive around, but once they turn the car off, they'll find it won't start again. 
 With lobbying help from the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and financial help from Wall Street, Mr. Farr, a former Detroit Lions football player, said he was helping those who otherwise couldn't afford a car. Critics, including Ralph Nader, worry that the devices could prove unsafe, and said the interest rates of up to 25 percent take advantage of the desperate. Mr. Farr counters that the high prices reflect his risk. ROBYN MEREDITH

Tougher Talk for Indonesia

BYLINE: By VIVIENNE WALT 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
MARK BAIRD was picking his way through a tiny lunch. It was barely past noon, but, as the World Bank's new country director in Indonesia, he had already had breakfast at this same Hilton hotel with an Indonesian economist and, later, meetings with a variety of business people and officials. Now he was explaining to a reporter how, in a country jaded by years of bureaucratic bungles, he intended to reshape the image of the World Bank.
"First, the name's got to go," Mr. Baird said with a dry laugh. " 'World' is too grandiose, and for most people, the word 'bank' sounds like we are just here to make money, like every other bank." 
 What Mr. Baird is here to do is supervise the multibillion-dollar bailout of Indonesia's shattered economy, a rescue planned by the bank, the International Monetary Fund and foreign nations. In early August, just as the currency, the rupiah, seemed to be recovering from its 1998 collapse,investigators found that Bank Bali had paid more than $70 million in fees to a company controlled by a top official of the ruling party. Baligate, as the local newspapers labeled the scandal, could scare away investors again.
Mr. Baird, a New Zealander with a master's degree in economics from the University of Canterbury in England and many years of experience at the World Bank, never expected his current job to be easy. He arrived here last March, shortly after the bank, in a startlingly powerful self-criticism, acknowledged that it had ignored widespread Government corruption during the 33-year rule of former President Suharto.
Whether or not the comparison was justified, people here for years associated the World Bank with the Government, says Eric Bjornlund, Indonesia mission director for the Washington-based National Democracy Institute, an American organization that promotes democratic politics. "There was all this money sloshing around," he said, "and here was the World Bank in partnership with Government."
Mr. Baird, 48, says that as an economist for the bank in Jakarta in the late 1980's, he followed the old style. "We prided ourselves on working behind the scenes, with the Government," he said. "We got things done that way. Now, I think we should have spoken out on corruption."
Mr. Baird left Jakarta in 1989, returning to New Zealand to help his own Government introduce economic reforms. Later, he held senior posts at World Bank headquarters in Washington.
When Mr. Baird returned to Jakarta, it was a very different place. Street protests in 1998 had ousted Mr. Suharto. A frenzied democratic election campaign was under way. The economy was in shambles, and the World Bank was determined to hold officials accountable for the use of billions of dollars in foreign aid.
Upon his arrival, Mr. Baird did not head directly downtown, to his offices in the Jakarta Stock Exchange building, or to the Jakarta home where he and his wife and younger daughter would live. Instead, in line with the World Bank's new policy of having its officials experience life below the lofty level of national leaders, he spent a week with a family in a small rural village in Central Java. There, hundreds of miles east of the capital, women in conical hats stoop over the rice paddies, harvesting crops by hand.
"The Government was irrelevant, and the World Bank was totally unknown," he said. "It was darned hard to explain to people what we do. People can't begin to comprehend millions of dollars. They count in terms of hundreds of rupiah" -- pennies, at the current exchange rate.
But the people's curiosity challenged his natural reserve. Crowds followed him even to off-duty appointments. "I had several massages, and people would gather just to see this weird white guy getting a massage," he said. "They would stand around talking and serve coffee."
Even a $700 loan to the village -- minuscule to Mr. Baird, but a fortune to the villagers -- became a lesson in the hurdles faced by the World Bank. "The men haggled over who would deal with the money, and the women came up with five ideas of what to do with it, like opening a restaurant," Mr. Baird said. "It was obvious that development is about more than money; it's about people."
Mr. Baird says some of his recent actions would have been unthinkable for a World Bank functionary 10 years ago. Recently, for example, he told reporters that the bank would consider withdrawing financing if Baligate was not resolved to its satisfaction..
Indeed, Mr. Baird says, Indonesia is a crucial test case of the organization's new willingness to challenge its partners around the world. Ending corruption, he said, has become essential.
He still faces a tough battle convincing some Indonesians of the World Bank's intentions.
"Mark doesn't do much to make the image better," said Wardah Hafidz, the coordinator of the Urban Poor Consortium, a collection of activist groups in Jakarta. Ms. Hafidz and others, accusing the government of corruption and waste, pleaded with Mr. Baird to delay millions of dollars in loans for Government social programs until elected representatives could appoint a new president this fall. Mr. Baird refused, arguing that the loans would provide essential financing so that poor Indonesians could sell their crops and send children to school.
"They say they aren't involved in politics, but that's like saying you're in timber, chopping down trees, but you're not involved with the environment," Ms. Hafidz said. "A bank is a bank."
Which is exactly what fuels Mr. Baird's fantasy of a change in the World Bank's name.

Butcher, Baker, Skyscraper Maker: What America Earns

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and KARL RUSSELL 

 BODY:
HOW do your earnings measure up?
This set of charts allows you, over the Labor Day weekend, to compare the fruits of your labor with the fruits of others in the same line of work, not only in your home city, but in other cities as well. Are you a podiatrist in Chicago? Well, consider moving to Detroit, where the average annual pay for your profession is $94,080, considerably above the $80,020 in Chicago. 
 Such detailed data are being gathered for the first time by the Government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has expanded its wage surveys. Instead of just telling the nation what secretaries, for example, earn in an individual industry -- the hotel industry, for example -- annual wage levels are now available for secretaries across all industries and in 300 cities.
The goal of accumulating all this data is to help the Labor Department's Alien Labor Certification Program determine prevailing pay for a particular occupation in a particular city. By law, employers are required to pay at least the prevailing wage to immigrant workers; now the Government has a new tool for applying the rule.
But beyond keeping pay apace for immigrant workers, the detailed data have other uses. For one, millions of Americans can now compare their pay with the average wages for their occupation -- in their hometowns, in other cities and regions, or across the nation.
And the expanded data are becoming available just as states and cities are taking over programs once operated at the national level. Welfare is one. For the first time, the wages for low-skilled jobs -- those generally available to people shifting from welfare to work -- will be easy to determine. The average pay of a janitor in Kokomo, Ind. -- $29,170 -- is more than double the amount in Wichita Falls, Tex.
"We will be able to judge how people are faring as national programs disappear," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
But beware the shortcomings of the bureau's new survey. How can it be that the highest-paid occupation in New York City is "structural metal worker" -- the people who erect a skyscraper's steel framework? There is no question that great skill is required to walk narrow girders dozens of stories up. Even so, don't investment bankers and white-shoe lawyers earn more?
Well, of course they do. The problem is that the bureau's survey covers only employees who get regular paychecks, with taxes withheld, and qualify for unemployment insurance. That eliminates a whole army of workers, including business owners and partners (the latter is the status of most well-paid lawyers and investment bankers), the self-employed and day laborers.
Another problem is the survey's response rate. Since 1996, the survey has been mailed annually to 400,000 companies, and roughly 30 percent have failed to reply each year.
For lack of enough replies from New York companies, the bureau could not produce reliable wage estimates for salaried physicians, lawyers, judges, top executives and securities brokers.
The annual earnings in these charts are for 1997. The 1998 numbers will be published in December and those for 1999 in December 2000. Meanwhile, says Douglas Himes, a bureau economist who helps to produce the survey, one should add roughly 5 or 6 percent in raises over the last two years to bring the wages up to date.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Salaries in the Biggest Cities"
The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released a study examining the average annual salaries in some 770 job categories around the country, as of 1997. Data were not available for every type of job in each city, because insufficient responses produced a margin of error too high or the quality of the data was poor. The self-employed were excluded. Herer are the highest- and lowest-paying jobs for the 10 largest cities.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Finding the Steam Valve On an Overheated Market

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows by now that the spectacular rise in stock prices has helped to make the economy boom, and that a steep market fall could do a lot of economic damage. So it is natural to want to head off disaster by taking some of the steam out of stock trading. There are tools to do this, but surprisingly, they are rarely mentioned in the public debate. The Federal Reserve even rejects their viability.
For the Fed, inflation is the danger. A rising stock market, in its eyes, is only a contributor to inflation; it makes people feel wealthier, so they spend more, and the stepped-up spending helps to make prices rise. But rising stock prices are not a big danger in themselves. 
 That was the overall message last weekend at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The big economic issues of the day were debated, the main one being inflation and the stock market. The consensus prescription was to fight inflation with higher interest rates, but to leave measures directed at the market idle in the toolbox. Only at the very end did one speaker suggest using one: Try, he said, to dilute the enthusiasm for buying stocks by restricting their purchase on credit.
That was it, a one-minute reference in 10 hours of speeches and discussion -- short shrift for what was once a common practice whenever the stock market got out of line in the first three decades after World War II.
Raising rates to fight inflation does indeed discourage spending on credit. But it is a blunderbuss tactic that also damages the wider economy. And when stocks decline in response to a slowing economy, debt accelerates their fall, as investors hurry to sell and retrieve enough money to cover what they owe.
"Before World War II, big recessions in the United States were triggered by stock market collapses," said Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
Since the war, recessions have often resulted when the Fed miscalculated in raising rates. Now the old danger of a stock market collapse has reappeared, and proposals for dealing with the market directly are surfacing. "The basic idea is to have more than one weapon to deal with what is essentially separate dilemmas," said George Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "One dilemma is inflation and the other is the stock market."
Regulators could tame a possibly overvalued stock market by raising obstacles to speculation. For example, investors could be required to put up more of their own money. Right now, investors can borrow up to half the purchase price of a stock, a "margin" requirement that the Federal Reserve has not changed since 1974. Or, as James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics, argues, a transaction tax on each trade could discourage rapid-fire buying and selling. Introducing a 100 percent capital gains tax on stocks held for less than, say, 90 days would devastate day trading, a big source of speculation. Warren Buffett once proposed such a tax.
Regulatory changes could be useful as well. Companies could be forced to abandon accounting practices that falsely inflate profits (the Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to do this now), and bank examiners could demand stricter standards for lending, particularly to buy stocks.
"The examiners have not been what I would call tough," said Charles Peabody, senior bank analyst at Mitchell Securities. "The regulators have made a lot of speeches about lax lending standards, but I don't get the sense their examiners have followed through."
BUT the Fed's interest-rate approach has wide support on Wall Street, and among economists who are skeptical of the effectiveness of narrower measures. They argue that raising the margin requirement to, say, 70 percent would not stop investors from buying stocks with money raised through home equity loans, for example, or by borrowing abroad.
More philosophically, Federal Reserve officials and their supporters argue against trying to second-guess the judgments of millions of investors. In this era of deregulation, they say, there must be faith in a free market's ability to correct its own shortcomings -- with some well-timed help from the Fed. If stock prices collapse, the Greenspan Fed will lower interest rates quickly and feed money to banks to keep credit -- and the economy -- from "seizing up."
Still, a lot of stock is owned on credit. Federal Reserve statistics show that more than 55 percent of all borrowing in the United States now finds its way to the financial sector, up from roughly 35 percent in 1992, according to the calculations of Jane D'Arista, an economist with the Financial Markets Center, a research group. Much of this money has apparently been borrowed by brokerage firms, insurance companies and the like to invest for their own accounts. "There is a lot more leverage in this market than anyone realizes," Ms. D'Arista said.
And for this reason alone, the moment may have come to use some of the now-shunned alternative tools -- a higher margin requirement, for instance -- to reduce the potential for calamity.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Munis GainingLuster As Yield Gap Narrows

BYLINE: By JOANNE LEGOMSKY 

 BODY:
LESS than two weeks after the Federal Reserve raised its Federal funds target rate by a quarter percentage point, high-quality municipal bonds are still looking extraordinarily attractive relative to plain-vanilla Treasury bonds, experts say.
Last Tuesday, for example, New York's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority priced $225 million of highly rated, general purpose revenue bonds due in 2030 to yield 5.74 percent, or 94 percent of the 6.08 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond. So an investor would give up only a smidgen of yield in return for munis' freedom from taxation. And while that 94 percent figure is less than the 100 percent ratio that munis hit briefly last fall, it is still far above the 85 percent that they have averaged since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
 "It's absurd," said David Kotok, president of Cumberland Advisors, a muni bond manager in Vineland, N.J. "Tax-free yields are nearly equal to those on taxable instruments." He noted that for a taxpayer with a combined state and Federal tax rate of 45 percent, a muni with a 5.8 percent coupon has a tax-equivalent yield of 10.5 percent.
A couple of factors are at play here. The amount of Treasury bonds outstanding has been tapering off and is expected to shrink by $100 billion this year, making them relatively more expensive, compared with most other kinds of debt, according to R. B. Davidson 3d, director of municipal investments at Sanford C. Bernstein. A result, he said, is that "individuals in high tax brackets should move out of Treasuries and into high-grade munis."
Moreover, the robust United States economy has vastly improved the credit quality of most municipal bond jurisdictions, so default risk for high-quality munis is virtually zero, analysts say.
But because of rising supply, the increased credit quality has not come at the expense of higher muni prices. Taking advantage of interest-rate cuts last year, muni bond issuance rose sharply as governments sought to cut borrowing costs.
Demand for munis by institutions, meanwhile, has all but evaporated. "No money has gone into muni bond funds since April," said George Friedlander, fixed-income strategist with Salomon Smith Barney.
The biggest factor weighing down muni prices, however, is the protracted, take-no-prisoners bull market in stocks, said Christopher Dillon, a strategist with J. P. Morgan Securities. Against annual double-digit gains in the stock market, 6 percent yields on munis look puny.
Still, because muni bonds are not subject to the ebb and flow of foreign demand, they have been far more stable investments than Treasuries, said Steven Harrop, a manager with Strong Capital Management. Mr. Kotok added that investors in an index of muni bonds -- say, the Bond Buyer 40 -- at about this time last year would have ridden out the turmoil in global financial markets without experiencing much volatility. He calculated that over the last 115 weeks, 10-year Treasuries were three times as volatile as munis, as measured by their standard deviation.
Those interested only in income might do best to buy individual bonds and hold them to maturity, instead of buying muni bond funds. The strategy allows investors to tailor bond cash flows and maturations to their particular needs.
But if you think muni prices will rise and you want to take advantage of the gain, a fund or managed account might make sense. Mr. Kotok said current prices offered the chance for capital gains of 15 percent or more if, as he expects, muni prices rise enough to push their yields down to 85 percent of that of Treasuries.
Michael Shamosh, fixed-income strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc., said that with rates at their current levels, buying munis yourself makes more sense. "In a 5 percent rate environment, management fees may outweigh the advantages of management expertise, purchasing efficiency and diversification," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: William L. Wilby;
Oppenheimer Global Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
AN avid sailor, William L. Wilby has used maps and compass to navigate a sloop, an Island Packet 40, around the inlets of Chesapeake Bay.
But in navigating the stock markets of the world, Mr. Wilby, manager of the $5.21 billion Oppenheimer Global fund, does not care for maps. "We buy stocks," he said, "not regions or countries." 
 Indeed, Mr. Wilby, 55, a former Federal Reserve economist, has steered clear of the top-down economic analysis favored by many global equity managers when allocating assets around the world. "I'm a theme-based, out-of-favor growth investor," Mr. Wilby said from his office in the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
The approach has produced superior results. Oppenheimer Global returned 20.7 percent, annualized, for the three years ended Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. That compares with 13.7 percent for its peer group of world stock funds, and 19.1 percent for the Morgan Stanley World index, Morningstar said.
Forty-five percent of the fund is invested in Europe, 37 percent in the United States, 10 percent in Asia and the remainder around the globe.
To pick stocks, Mr. Wilby relies on a simple credo: "We like to buy good companies in good businesses at good prices at the right time."
Good businesses often fit into one of his four themes. The first is mass affluence, meaning the rise of the middle class in less-developed countries and the growing numbers of wealthy people in industrialized countries. The second is new technology, which runs the gamut from biotechnology to the Internet. The other themes are the aging of the global population, which leads him to health care and financial services, and corporate restructuring -- the continuing trend of companies to focus on their core businesses by divesting themselves of peripheral operations.
Good businesses usually have strong top-line revenue growth. Unlike many money managers, Mr. Wilby relies more heavily on a company's price-to-revenue ratio than on its price-earnings ratio. "Earnings are much more volatile than revenues, so the price-revenues ratio is a better indicator of when a company is cheap," he said. And he likes when a company's business has strong barriers to entry, he said, "so that the company can maintain its profit margin."
Mr. Wilby aims to buy a stock when few Wall Street analysts are recommending it, though he likes to see salutary corporate developments in the works. "A stock can be cheap, but we want to see a catalyst that will change the market's view of the stock and help us realize its value," he said.
To pick the 85 to 90 stocks in the fund's portfolio, Mr. Wilby consults a list of several hundred perennial favorite stocks that he has developed during his 20 years in the business; he also relies on the Oppenheimer global quantitative model, which covers 30,000 stocks worldwide.
The model screens companies weekly for valuation, earnings growth and relative stock strength, as well as earnings revisions and a proprietary measure he calls "dynamic price-earnings ratios," whose methodology he will not discuss.
HE recently added to his position in Getronics N.V., a Dutch information technology services company. Its recent acquisition of the computer maker Wang Global, he said, "makes Getronics one of the top three players in the world." The catalyst for growth he said, "will be a boom in business re-engineering based on a need to develop E-commerce platforms."
The stock is both a new technology and a restructuring play: "We think the company will divest some of its less profitable businesses and become a pure investment technology consulting company, which is a much higher-margin business," Mr. Wilby said. He originally bought shares in June at an average cost of $37.37; they closed on Friday at 47.70 euros, or $50.8816, which is 2.7 times 1998 revenues per share, about half that of similar companies. And he predicts a three-year earnings growth rate of 40 percent a year.
He also likes Cadence Design Systems, a San Jose, Calif., company that writes software used by semiconductor engineers to create "system on a chip" technology, designed to put the functions of different computer chips on a single microprocessor. Cadence, which Mr. Wilby calls the "leading design automation company in the world," is out of favor because it changed the way it books revenue -- over time instead of up front -- which caused its sales and earnings to drop far below analysts' expectations. But the new accounting, he said, should produce more stable earnings in the long term.
Two factors will drive a new upgrade cycle for design automation tools, he said: the evolving system-on-a chip technology as well as a move to smaller line widths in semiconductor chips. He bought Cadence shares in March at $21; they closed on Friday at $13.8125, or 2.6 times 1998 revenues per share, below that of most software companies. He predicts a three-year earnings growth rate of 35 percent a year.
Mr. Wilby has also added to his holdings of Quintiles Transnational, a Durham, N.C., contract research organization for health care companies. New biotechnology drugs in the next decade, he said, should accelerate demand for Quintiles's services.
The shares fell from their December 1998 peak of $56.875 to a low of $30.25 last month, because of two recent controversial acquisitions that expanded its business into health economics and drug marketing consulting. Mr. Wilby approves of the buying spree. "Their business is data, and they're trying to get a monopoly on the data that affect the economics of drugs," he said, adding that there would be "fantastic synergies."
At $37.875, Quintiles's stock sells for 2.9 times 1998 revenues per share, down from a multiple of 10 in 1996. He sees a three-year earnings growth rate of 32 percent a year.

HEADLINE: Follow the Money, if You Can

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
RELAXING in a plush Manhattan hotel room recently, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most influential businessmen, chatted about theft.
Rampant stealing, Mr. Khodorkovsky conceded, was certainly bad for Russia. "If what we're talking about is sucking the lifeblood out of industry into some personal holdings so that this money will no longer be plowed back into the company, if we word it that way, then yes, it's a huge problem," he said. 
 But, Mr. Khodorkovsky quickly added, that is not his game -- it is the game of politicians, who, he believes, are responsible for the lion's share of corruption in Russia.
As chairman of Rosprom, the holding company for Yukos Oil, Russia's second-biggest oil company, Mr. Khodorkovsky, 35, said he was determined to build an industrial empire as competitive as any Western enterprise. At times, he allowed, that has meant trying to move control of his companies to places outside Russia -- but only to keep the companies out of the hands of corrupt politicians or nettlesome investors, and always with the goal of rebuilding the Russian economy.
Still, Mr. Khodorkovsky, his oil company and another Rosprom business -- Bank Menatep, which is now insolvent -- have been drawn repeatedly into investigations of possible wrongdoing. Russian securities regulators are examining whether Yukos used offshore entities to illegally evade the scrutiny of Russian authorities. Some of his shareholders, including prominent American financiers, have similarly complained in legal filings in Russia that he has spirited away oil profits from Yukos subsidiaries.
Now, the money-laundering investigation of the Bank of New York by United States authorities is examining whether Mr. Khodorkovsky's companies moved funds illegally through the New York bank, authorities say. The Bank of New York examination -- involving at least $4.2 billion and possibly as much as $10 billion -- is the biggest money-laundering investigation in American history and has become a lightning rod for criticism of how the West has carried out foreign policy and conducted business in Russia.
There is no question that the Bank of New York handled banking transactions for Mr. Khodorkovsky's companies, a relationship that he said in a recent interview was legitimate. And no one has charged Mr. Khodorkovsky or his companies with breaking any laws.
His business empire, however, is being scrutinized by investigators looking at the activities of Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice president at the Bank of New York who oversaw the bank's dealings in Russia. Ms. Kagalovsky is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, a former Russian Government official who is now a vice chairman of Yukos and was a vice chairman of Menatep, Mr. Khodorkovsky's bank.
The intersection of Mr. Khodorkovsky's empire with the Bank of New York investigation has drawn attention to the vulnerability of Western institutions that chase lucrative deals while willingly or unwittingly ignoring the freewheeling business practices in many pockets of the global economy.
Graft, of course, is no novelty in Russia. It is as old as the czars and was a hallmark of the old Soviet bureaucracy. But the oceans of Western cash that have washed through Russia in recent years, combined with scandal-plagued efforts to privatize state-owned companies, have created an unprecedented ability for the country's business and political elite to enrich themselves.
At their disposal are secretive offshore concerns, dizzying arrays of subsidiaries and holding companies, bogus bankruptcy procedures and other forms of financial sleight of hand designed to hide money and assets from Russian tax authorities, law enforcement officials and investors.
This financial arsenal allows criminals, politicians and businesses to siphon vast sums of money out of the country. Some of these operations are legal -- but not, many Russians say, in the best interest of their country. Others are of dubious legality. And some are clearly criminal enterprises.
The amount of money siphoned out of Russia illegally in recent years is difficult to quantify, because the Government does not track it closely and because much legitimate cash is sent abroad in search of stable banks. Russia's Interior Ministry estimates that anywhere from $50 billion to $250 billion was transferred out of the country illegally from 1994 to 1998. In a recent report, the credit rating agency Fitch IBCA said $136 billion left the country from 1993 to 1998.
"Russians don't recognize that by cheating someone today, they are hurting themselves in the long run," said Stephen Kotkin, director of the Russian studies program at Princeton University.
Left behind by the plundering are average Russians whose livelihoods and futures are diminished by the ingrained corruption. And the corruption in Russia threatens any Western institution that does business there, including private companies like the Bank of New York and publicly financed lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- especially when such institutions are so focused on raking in easy profits or achieving policy goals that obvious problems are sometimes ignored.
For Russia, the money-laundering investigation at the Bank of New York has further laid bare the real dynamic that has driven events in the country in the last few years.
"The whole political struggle in Russia between 1992 and 1998 was between different groups trying to take control of state assets," said Nodari A. Simonia, deputy director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a Moscow research organization. "It was not about democracy or market reform."
 
Trying to Connect the Dots
Last March, a phalanx of private guards dressed in paramilitary uniforms and toting machine guns were hired by Yukos Oil to block access to a shareholders meeting in Moscow. In response, and fearing that Yukos's managers would use the meeting to tighten their grip on the company and loot it, some investors enlisted the help of the local police. And the police, arriving in an armored vehicle and wearing bulletproof gear, succeeded in postponing the meeting.
The showdown bore little resemblance to the lofty visions of a market economy embraced by reformers who sent Russia on its pell-mell sprint from Communism to capitalism in the early 1990's -- a sprint unencumbered by an adequate regulatory and legal system.
Yukos, a major force in an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people and that is vital to the Russian economy, is swamped in allegations of wrongdoing. Russian securities regulators have begun a criminal investigation of possible theft, stock manipulation and tax scams at the company.
A Yukos spokesman said the criminal investigation was "prejudiced and groundless."
State-owned until 1995, Yukos reported a loss of $79 million last year on revenue of about $4 billion. Mr. Khodorkovsky, who once held a top post in Russia's energy ministry, won control of the company for about $310 million in a privatization auction marred by rigged, low-ball bids.
Much of the criticism of Yukos has been leveled directly at Mr. Khodorkovsky, who vigorously defended his record in a series of lengthy interviews with The New York Times that began late last spring and culminated in a telephone interview from Moscow nine days ago.
"Five years from today, I expect that Yukos's operating efficiency should be no less than any Western company," Mr. Khodorkovsky said through an interpreter. "We've told our shareholders that we are acting in their interests, even if they think we are not."
At once congenial and hard-nosed, Mr. Khodorkovsky bears a long scar on his left forearm from a knife fight on the streets of Moscow, a teen-age memento offset by the expensive suits and Ermenegildo Zegna ties he favors.
The only child of factory workers, Mr. Khodorkovsky was a gifted chemistry and mathematics student who parlayed academic prowess, entrepreneurial zeal and valuable Communist Party connections into a personal-computer business in the late 1980's. The venture, sponsored by the Soviet Government, was so profitable that it helped start Mr. Khodorkovsky on his career as a banker, when he founded Menatep in 1988.
Menatep blossomed after the fall of Communism. But like most large Russian banks, it made questionable loans to related companies or gambled large sums on risky securities. It collapsed last year as Russia's flimsy financial structure came unglued.
Menatep's name has resurfaced in the money-laundering investigation involving the Bank of New York. Money laundering is a catch phrase for the criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them through a sequence of bank accounts so they ultimately look like legitimate profits from legal businesses. The money is then withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
Federal investigators are examining whether Menatep moved funds through the Bank of New York, authorities say, a suspicion fueled by the Kagalovskys' jobs and relationship. Neither of the Kagalovskys has been charged with wrongdoing, and their lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said they never engaged in money laundering.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, in the phone interview late last month, said Menatep has never been found guilty of money laundering, despite repeated investigations in Russia.
"Menatep in its history has never done any money laundering," he said. "Tying Mr. Kagalovsky into this scandal that is raging in the United States seems strange to me."
In a recent statement, Menatep said it "valued the Bank of New York for the high level of service that came with the extraordinary commitment that bank consistently demonstrated to the Russian market."
Indeed, Mr. Khodorkovsky has nothing but praise for Ms. Kagalovsky, whom he considers representative of the new Russians leading their country to a better future.
"Ms. Gurfinkel became very well known in Russia before she married Mr. Kagalovsky," Mr. Khodorkovsky noted. "She was a native Russian who had emigrated to the States and became a U.S. citizen and returned to Russia bringing banks with her."
The Bank of New York, which said it is cooperating with the money-laundering investigation, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. It has declined to comment further on the matter.
 
Business as Usual?
But many banks that avidly pursued business ties with Russia are now scurrying to explain how they actually conducted business there. And Russian regulators and Western investors say Mr. Khodorkovsky is, at a minimum, turning a blind eye to misconduct within his own business empire. Some of the harshest critics say that Yukos may be looting parts of its sprawling operations.
One of the angriest critics is Kenneth B. Dart, the wealthy and reclusive heir to a foam-cup fortune, who gave up his United States citizenship years ago for residence in tax-free havens like Belize. His Russian investment vehicle, Dart Management, has stakes in Yukos subsidiaries and has sued Yukos in Russia, accusing the company and Mr. Khodorkovsky of illegally diverting money, oil and other assets out of Yukos subsidiaries.
Dart Management and other investors in Yukos subsidiaries contend that Mr. Khodorkovsky has shifted billions of dollars from the subsidiaries by selling their oil at artificially low prices to the parent company -- a contention substantiated by evidence of the practice in footnotes to Yukos's own financial statements. The oil is then resold by Yukos at much higher prices to buyers on the open market. Investors say that these windfall profits accrue to Yukos alone -- not to the subsidiaries -- and may even be channeled away from Yukos and into offshore accounts.
"Yukos has failed to make reasonable disclosure of its financial dealings," said Michael Hunter, president of Dart Management, which is based in Summit, N.J. "It is therefore difficult to gather conclusive evidence of where this cash goes.
"Mr. Khodorkovsky surely knows the answer," Mr. Hunter added, "and presumably has his own reasons for his unwillingness to share the answer."
Mr. Khodorkovsky says he has not pilfered money from Yukos or improperly managed its finances. He says oil is transferred at rock-bottom prices between Yukos and its subsidiaries to minimize taxes, a strategy that he said all Russian oil companies use. The Darts' contentions are baseless, he said, part of a campaign by their lawyers to wrest control of Yukos from him. But Mr. Khodorkovsky, who enthusiastically told of a job he once held guarding payrolls armed only with an ax, said he likes a good fight.
"We have teeth, and we know how to bite back," he said.
 
Offshore, and Under Inquiry
To be sure, Dart Management, like most Western investors in Russia, is hardly naive when it comes to the hardball tactics and unsavory realities of doing business there, and the firm has been tough-minded about getting its own way in deals that straddle the globe. But investors are not the only ones complaining about Yukos.
Residents of Tomsk, a Siberian city that is home to Tomskneft, one of Yukos's biggest oil subsidiaries, are also upset. They say Tomskneft, the city's main employer, has been purposefully mismanaged, resulting in the layoffs of tens of thousands of oil workers.
"Tomskneft was one of the few companies in Russia that was profitable, took care of its workers and had very efficient output," said Alexander Yakovlevich, a local director of the Russian Federal Securities Commission, who has lived in Tomsk for all his 51 years.
Mr. Yakovlevich also complains that even as Mr. Khodorkovsky has enriched himself while running Yukos, he explains the layoffs by saying the company's cupboards are bare. "The explanation Khodorkovsky gives for all of this is that there's no money," he said. "But how is that possible?"
One way that Yukos's assets might be disappearing is through the use of offshore shell companies.
Financial documents show that Yukos has established offshore entities in Cyprus, Switzerland, the Caribbean and elsewhere. And, according to corporate documents, arrangements have been made for these entities to receive controlling stakes in Yukos's subsidiaries, a move that investors like the Darts think will solidify Mr. Khodorkovsky's control and allow him too much leeway in managing his oil riches.
Among the offshore entities is Valmet, an investment vehicle located on the Isle of Man, in the Irish Sea. Mr. Khodorkovsky's bank, Menatep, bought a big stake in Valmet a few years ago from the Riggs National Corporation, a Washington bank. Valmet subsequently played a central role in a possible fraud that the Russian Government is now investigating. The Government moved in April to take over a Russian titanium company, Avisma, in which Menatep once had a large stake, saying the metal company's profits were siphoned by Menatep and stashed in Valmet's accounts.
Riggs and Valmet declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.
Mr. Khodorkovsky says the Government's allegations of theft at Avisma are meritless, but he acknowledges that Valmet has been the recipient of some Yukos assets. He says, however, that he does not use companies like Valmet to facilitate theft. On the contrary, he says, he uses his stable of offshore companies to protect his holdings from interlopers like Dart Management or from expropriation by corrupt Government officials in Russia.
Dart, which also once held a stake in Avisma, has also been pulled into the problems surrounding the titanium company. Avisma recently sued Dart and other Western investors in Federal court in Newark, accusing them of diverting profits from the company. Dart representatives say the charges are meritless.
The lawsuit has attracted the attention of Federal investigators examining the Bank of New York.
Bruce S. Marks, a Philadelphia lawyer representing Avisma, said he was contacted recently by Justice Department officials seeking information related to the Bank of New York investigation. While declining to offer details about the agency's query, Mr. Marks said he planned to subpoena the Bank of New York for records pertaining to Valmet. "We believe Bank of New York was in the loop because Menatep was in the loop, and Menatep transacted through Valmet, Mr. Marks said.
Others are interested in Valmet as well. A Swiss Government prosecutor said last week that he is examining Valmet's ties to the Bank of New York.
 
A Daunting Troika
All the interest from law enforcement officials in the dealings of Russian businessmen rankles Mr. Khodorkovsky. In the telephone interview late last month, he suggested that Russian politicians controlled a large portion of the funds being examined for money laundering at the Bank of New York, asserting that the officials sent their money abroad before Russia's financial collapse last year. It is a theory that many Russians, including Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former First Deputy Prime Minister, -- say is extremely credible.
The theory, while perhaps Mr. Khodorkovsky's opening salvo against politicians anxious to investigate his dealings, also points out some difficulties of tackling corruption in Russia.
While wrongdoing in the Russian worlds of politics, business and organized crime is often discussed separately, denizens of these groups typically rub shoulders in their dealings, and this powerful troika presents a tremendous hurdle to meaningful reform. As long as that is the case, few observers of Russia are optimistic about the country's future.
"The problem with Russia is that the Government, business and organized crime are so closely involved with one another that it is very hard to find clean institutions to work with," said R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and now a lawyer in Washington. "Right now, I don't think you can put any real money into Russia without its getting stolen."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
The Clouds Over Freddie And Fannie

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
THIS sounds like an outfit that should have a winning stock: It's one of only seven companies to post double-digit earnings growth every year since 1986; it has the power to borrow billions at rates almost low as the Treasury's; it is excused from paying state or local income tax, and it has posted 1998 profits that approach $900,000 an employee.
And though it is one of the biggest financial institutions in the United States, it is not subject to the capital requirements that apply to banks. 
 This is Fannie Mae, the Government-chartered mortgage company, whose stock price has multiplied nearly 70-fold since it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange 19 years ago.
So why are shares in this money machine down 10.3 percent this year, while major indexes are up 10.4 percent to 29.7 percent? And why is its younger brother, Freddie Mac, which enjoys most of Fannie's advantages, doing even worse, down 14 percent?
Analysts see several reasons for the poor performance, which has pushed Fannie and Freddie shares down to $66.375 and $55.4375, respectively, or about 19 and 18 times this year's earnings. Those are about 70 percent of the price-to-earnings multiple of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, 10 to 20 percentage points less than usual.
The most obvious factor is the climb in interest rates that pushed 30-year conventional mortgages from just under 7 percent at the beginning of the year to more than 8 percent during part of August, although they have retreated a bit since. "They're perceived to be the most rate-sensitive financial stocks," said Thomas E. Hanley, a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read and a financial services analyst.
Fannie Mae's main business is raising money in world capital markets and using it to buy mortgages from banks that originate them; it often packages these loans as securities and sells them to others, recycling the proceeds. It also earns fees from guarantees of mortgage payments, which are viewed by markets as the equivalent of those coming from the Government. Freddie Mac operates similarly but keeps more mortgages it buys in its own portfolio.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profit from the spread between what they pay for money and what they charge. But higher rates generally shrink lending volume and can nearly shut down refinancings. Moreover, borrowers facing higher rates turn increasingly from conventional to adjustable-rate mortgages, which originators are more likely to keep on their own books.
David N. Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management, a money management firm in Jersey City, has been a longtime holder of both stocks and calls the conventional view wrongheaded. "They're extremely interest-sensitive in market perception," he said. "In reality they're not," he added, pointing to the last round of Fed rate increases in 1994 and 1995, when earnings held up better than those of the S. & P. 500. "They hedge their portfolios very well."
But interest rates are only one of the clouds hovering over these formerly stellar stocks. Another is the notion that their huge size has become an impediment to growth -- suggesting a structural decline in profitability and prompting them to look at related fields like writing mortgage insurance.
At the same time, they have been forced to compete more intensely with each other and, recently, with another Government-sponsored body, the Federal Home Loan Banks, whose shares are not traded.
"Fannie and Freddie have been so successful that people are taking seriously the notion that they've become too big," said Michael Hodes, a mortgage finance analyst at Goldman Sachs. The crucial question, Mr. Hodes said, is this: "Should these things continue to be considered growth stocks, given their size?"
Mr. Dreman countered that while there is more competition, "they're still growing fairly rapidly," and long-term growth rates are stable. "These are really growth stocks that the market has hammered badly this year," he said. "These are probably two of the best stocks that a manager could hold."
For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there is also a counterattack from a deep-pocketed alliance of banking and mortgage trade groups called FM Watch. The group formed in June, specifically to head off what it contends is an effort by the two giants to encroach on its members' territories in search of new revenue sources.
FM Watch expresses particular concern about efforts like an advertising campaign that seemed to critics to be aimed at establishing a Fannie Mae consumer brand name, which would naturally be helpful in dealing with the public.
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's actions over the past few years have moved them beyond their unique charters in a way that is more beneficial to their investors than home buyers and taxpayers," FM Watch said in a statement.
Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's president, not only denies interest in consumer markets but has also publicly offered to tattoo on his forehead a statement that the company will not originate loans. That, Fannie Mae notes, is one of the few powers specifically precluded by its charter.
Mr. Raines has also unleashed one of the capital's fiercest lobbying teams to pressure companies and trade groups not to join the FM Watch coalition. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a prime candidate, has held off so far.
Richard Meagley, portfolio manager of the Safeco Equity fund, which owns shares of Fannie Mae, said he did not see either company's profits being hurt by FM Watch in the next five years. But, he said, the group's existence "will keep a lid somewhat on the P/E's of both of them" because of the risk that a political backlash will result in attempts to alter the companies' special status.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Put Away the White Shoes, and Take Off the Blinders

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WITH summer unofficially over come Tuesday, many investors may be hoping that the return to work will also mean a return to the bull market in stocks. Even though August brought a new high for the Dow Jones industrial average, most stocks are still trading well below their highs.
Friday's spectacular leaps in both the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 could indicate that the back-to-work effect will indeed be good for stocks. 
 But such a view makes light of several factors weighing heavily on the markets. Most significant are rising interest rates and a falling dollar. Early signs of increased labor costs and declining productivity at American companies are also concerns.
Over the summer, the Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee twice raised interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point. Each time, investors initially shrugged off the increases, choosing to see them as isolated moves, not part of a longer-term trend. Then economic data would come out showing that economic growth was as strong as ever -- and investors would get jittery again, pushing down stocks.
Now, many bond traders are expecting another increase in rates at the Fed's Oct. 5 meeting. And while most investors have assumed that the Fed will not raise rates after October, for fear of colliding with Year 2000 problems that may arise, a fourth increase is no longer being ruled out.
Under the best circumstances, rising rates create uncertainty in the stock market; at worst, they pummel share prices. Of course, nobody knows which will be the case this fall. But investors who feel certain that the Fed is finished raising interest rates for the year may want to reconsider.
David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, believes that the Fed will raise rates twice more before the year is out, largely because economic growth in the United States will be so powerful. Mr. Jones expects the gross domestic product to be up about 4 percent in the second half, compared with the period last year. "Greenspan has to engage in a series of moves, and he has to leave them open-ended," Mr. Jones said.
Another concern for the stock market is the drift in the dollar, the linchpin of the bull market in stocks since 1995. "When the dollar is rising, we get rising equities and higher valuations," explained Steven C. Wieting, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "When the dollar is collapsing we get higher import prices and higher inflation."
Mr. Wieting does not foresee a disorderly collapse in the dollar. So far, the dollar has been weakest against the Japanese yen, down 11 percent since May.
But any broader weakness in the currency could have a big impact on domestic stock prices, because foreign investors holding American financial assets would likely sell them rather than face further losses resulting from a lower dollar. These investors have been huge participants in our stock and bond markets as global economic crises turned the United States into the world's haven.
Last week's productivity numbers also gave some traders pause. The Labor Department reported that workers' output rose at an annual rate of only 0.6 percent in the second quarter, the smallest gain since the corresponding period in 1998. Unit labor costs, the amount that employers pay in wages and benefits for every item made, rose 4.5 percent in the quarter, the largest increase since early 1994.
On the positive side, rebounding economies overseas will bolster earnings at American corporations. So will a weaker dollar, which makes American goods cheaper for foreigners to buy. But until investors fully understand that rates may go higher this fall, they won't see the risks in the current valuations of stocks.

Arms Control Is Dying. Unless It's Reviving.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BY many measures, international arms control seems to be on the verge of unraveling.
A global treaty banning all nuclear testing is bottled up in the United States Senate. Another pact to reduce the atomic arsenals of Russia and the United States is stalled in the Russian Parliament. 
 Iraq, Iran and North Korea are racing to build new biological, chemical, nuclear weapons or long-range missiles, American intelligence analysts say. Finally worn down by Iraqi non-cooperation, the United Nations has dismantled its efforts even to monitor Iraq's terror-weapons programs. And India and Pakistan are menacing each other with nuclear-tipped missiles.
"We're heading downhill," said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, a group that researches arms control and international security. "All of the major fault lines of nuclear danger are growing."
Why then are many arms control advocates echoing the bullish declaration of Adm. Stansfield Turner, a past director of Central Intelligence: "This is the most opportune moment in the past 40 years for nuclear arms control"?
The answer is simple: Russia, which is still the only country that can claim parity with America's own nuclear arsenal, has serious reasons for wanting to cut back its stock of warheads.
Russia's strategic forces are declining fast and Moscow lacks the money to pay for new systems. It badly wants a new strategic arms reduction agreement, Start 3, that could take both countries down to 1,500 long-range nuclear warheads from more than 6,000 currently; from the Russian point of view, that would at least allow Russia to keep even with the United States despite all its troubles.
PROPONENTS of such a deal argue that it would have advantages for the United States as well: It would shrink the nuclear stockpile of the country that still harbors the single biggest threat to American security, and from which American security officials fear that terrorists may even now be shopping for nuclear material.
And with instability engulfing Russia, including growing public cynicism toward the government, rising corruption with allegations of Russian laundering of billions of dollars through the Bank of New York and the economy shakier than ever, time may be running short to strike a bold new arms deal before both countries hold presidential elections next year, experts say.
"We have a way to secure extremely deep cuts, and make them verifiable and irreversible," said Mr. Krepon. "In return for doing Russia that favor, which is a favor to ourselves, we can get a number of things we want."
But the Administration is proceeding gingerly, still insisting that Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament first ratify the Start 2 treaty, which brings both nations' strategic forces to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads, before seriously negotiating any follow-on pact to further reduce the weaponry.
And even though the cold war is over, the logic of nuclear arms control has detractors. The Pentagon and many conservatives fear that dipping much lower than 3,000 warheads would jeopardize the American nuclear advantage over the rest of the world, and encourage other countries to seek the status of first-tier atomic powers.
Moreover, Washington's insistence that the Russian Parliament act on Start 2 may have backfired, angering many Russian lawmakers who complain of American coercion. "They are trying to portray us as a country unwilling to divest itself of nuclear arms, a kind of nuclear monster that does not want to disarm," Roman Popkovich, chairman of the defense committee of Russia's lower house of Parliament, said last month.
Yet another hurdle is the strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, frayed most recently by the air war in Kosovo. "Things are at such a low level of credibility with Russia right now," said Senator Pete Domenici, a senior Republican from New Mexico. "A lot of work has to be done."
That is why Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the Administration's top Russia expert, plans to fly to Moscow this week to try to smooth out differences in advance of a more important meeting in Washington on Sept. 17 with a Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Georgi Mamedev.
Against long odds, Mr. Talbott is trying to broker a deal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to build a limited national defense against long-range missile attacks -- in exchange, perhaps, for a Start 3 agreement. Russia has long opposed such a shield, fearing it could lead to a broader "Star Wars" space-based defensive system.
But missile defenses are a top foreign-policy priority of Senate Republicans like Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold the nuclear-test ban treaty hostage until President Clinton submits two other treaties that Mr. Helms wants to kill, including amendments to the A.B.M. Treaty.
The Administration's deliberate approach illustrates a shift in the politics of arms control, which became the lifeblood of America's foreign policy during the last half of the cold war, arms control advocates say.
IT was just a few years ago that President Clinton presided over the extension of a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Those accomplishments capped an astonishing 10-year period for American arms control policy that included landmark strategic arms reductions treaties negotiated by President George Bush.
Mr. Clinton, arms control advocates say, has lost the momentum created in his first Administration. Gone is the initiative of President's first four years, they say, replaced by drift and a reluctance to challenge Senate conservatives.
"It's a very timid approach and time is running out," said Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the Arms Control Association, a research and advocacy group. "They've had a failed policy in dealing effectively with the Senate, because of a feeling that a confrontation on this would hurt the rest of their domestic agenda."
If the Administration is to pull off one more arms control victory in its waning months, it can expect little or no help from Senate Republicans, who are moving away from the arms control legacy of the Bush and Reagan Administrations, to push for national missile defenses. "We don't want to unnecessarily antagonize the Russians, but they are not the Soviet Union," said Senator Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. "They're not the threat they once were. The threat is more dispersed now."

HEADLINE: Sacred or Profane, Odd or Mundane, It Has a Trademark

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
BOOM times have a trademarked feel. Literally. It is harder and harder to get through the day without tripping over the little "TM" sign that is the equivalent of a "No Trespassing -- Violators Will Be Prosecuted" sign in an empty swath of New England woods. It is not always clear who owns the property in question, but it is abundantly clear that you don't. Tread on it at your risk.
One of the latest signs of TM-ing, as noted by The New York Observer, popped up at the end of Cindy Adams's gossip column in The New York Post. After years of signing off with the phrase "Only in New York, kids, only in New York," Ms. Adams has applied for a trademark. She has also fenced off the word gossip, at least for use in perfumes and cosmetics. 
 Trademarks flourish in a strong economy, and the boom of the late 1990's has seen an increase in the trademarking of words, images and sounds by at least 10 percent annually in three of the last four years, according to figures from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
This year, the rate of increase (Increase(TM) was registered by the Enrich Corporation for shampoos and nutritional supplements) is turbocharged (Turbocharge(TM) is used by U S West Communications Inc. for its credit-card validation services). If applications continue at the current pace (Pace(TM) -- applied for or registered to more than 250 entities), there will be 25 percent more in 1999 than 1998. One clue to the spike: the words "dot com" figure in 222 pending or registered trademarks on the Government's trademark data base.
Trademarks differ from copyrights, which protect works of creative expression -- books, artwork, music, commuter software and the like. Businesses or individuals register trademarks to establish the source of a product or service. It costs $245 to register a trademark for a single class of goods.
Even trademark is trademarked. Resistance is futile (Paramount Pictures trademarked that Star Trekism for everything from pinball machines to wrapping paper.) As soon as some phrases catch on, they get taken. The comedian Jerry Seinfeld may have put Yadda Yadda Yadda into the vernacular, but Custom Tees Inc., a Connecticut sportswear company, registered it for clothing and shoes.
There is no indication that Mr. Seinfeld objects. The comedian Johnny Carson, however, fought back. It took him 10 years, but a Federal appeals court ruled in 1987 that Here's Johnny Portable Toilets Inc. had violated the star's "right of publicity" and owed him $31,661.96. During the legal proceedings, Mr. Carson trademarked "Heeere's Johnny."
For the record (16 trademarks), newspapers, magazines and news shows have long since protected their features. The "60 Minutes" ticking stopwatch is a trademark, as is the slogan of The New York Times, "All the News That's Fit to Print," and the names of some of its sections like "Circuits" and "House and Home."
Celebrities like Oprah and Madonna have also registered their names. Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. holds dozens of trademarks. Still Diagnostic Hybrids Inc. of Ohio somehow slipped through and got Elvis for use on, of all things, "diagnostic preparations for clinical and medical use."
The roar of the MGM lion has been trademarked. Even skylines. The Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center have all staked claims to their images.
Nothing seems to be sacred. Nearly 500 trademarks on Christmas (from Papa Noel's Cajun Christmas Cap to Special Christmas Brew Beer) have been issued or are pending. Nothing seems to be profane. Six trademark applications have recently been filed for barnyard words that are unprintable in this newspaper. In the world of trademarks, there is little shame (only seven trademarks contain the word shame) and much integrity (the word is part of 279 trademarks).
"Everybody," said Mary A. Donovan, a partner in the law firm of Donovan & Yee, "has realized that there is money to be made." She added, "While I am all for protection of one's intellectual proprietary rights, I think there needs to be some balance so that freedom of expression isn't squashed."
That was the balance that Federal District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell tried to strike in 1985, when he rejected Lucasfilm Ltd.'s claim that political commercials sparring over President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative would dilute the company's trademark if allowed to call S.D.I. "Star Wars."
"These laws do not reach into the realm of public discourse to regulate the use of terms used outside the context of trade," he wrote.
At least, not most places. Maybe only in New York.

HEADLINE: Corruption of Wealth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Aug. 29 Week in Review article on corruption in Turkey observes that "restrictions effectively cut Turkey off from the world, but they also insulated the country against worldwide trends like corruption."
From this there is one inescapable conclusion: a free market encourages profit-seeking at any cost unless it is reined in by rules and regulations. The blind and ideologically motivated downgrading of government in pursuit of economic growth has a hidden cost: neglect of social needs for short-term private advantage. 
 The events in Turkey should teach us that in the face of growing national wealth in the United States, the widening gap between rich and poor and the deterioration of social services like health care and education are our own special brand of corruption.

So Much Work, So Little Time

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
THE much-acclaimed economic expansion, now in its ninth year, has blessed Americans with a cornucopia of good things -- rising incomes, the lowest jobless rate in three decades and Wall Street prices going through the roof. Many Americans have used the good times to renovate their kitchens or take that trip to Tuscany, but others are still finding the boom a lot less satisfying than might be expected.
For many Americans this Labor Day, the sentiment seems to be, we're earning more, but enjoying it less. 
 The reason is simple: too much work. With the economy going like gangbusters and with a labor shortage in much of the country, many Americans are reluctantly clocking 60-hour weeks to do the mountains of work that need to be done -- designing that Web page, getting out that legal brief, finishing those architectural renderings. For many Americans, the 40-hour week has become a fond memory.
Juliet Schor, the Harvard professor who wrote the 1992 book "The Overworked American" (Basic Books), said in an interview that if she were to write a sequel it might be called "The Even More Overworked American." Indeed, a new study by the International Labor Organization found that the number of hours Americans work each year has climbed skyward while working hours in most other industrial countries are falling. This trend has given Americans the dubious distinction of moving into first place in the number of hours worked each year (1,966), surpassing even the Japanese by about 70 hours. On average, Americans work 350 hours more per year (that's almost nine full work weeks) than Europeans.
"There are a lot of things going on," said Professor Schor. "Americans are working harder, which is common when the economy is doing well. And a lot of today's jobs require longer hours: management jobs, professionals working long hours at firms because that's what it takes to succeed in these firms. Some people are working harder because there's a lot of money to be made at the moment. But for a lot of people, excessive working time is a major problem."
This explosion in hours worked has some little-understood pros and some well-known cons. On the positive side, it has helped keep the United States at the head of the pack in productivity. America's economy produces more value per worker per year than any other nation's, enabling the United States to enjoy living standards that make most of the world envious.
In a subtle way, the boom in working hours has also helped keep inflation down. Millions of salaried Americans -- software designers, lawyers, factory managers -- are clocking 50- , 60- and 70-hour work weeks even though on paper they officially work just 40 hours. These workers often do not put in for overtime pay, and the result is that they are making a quiet, below-the-radar contribution to the economy. If a Web site designer puts in a 70-hour week, but is officially working only 40 hours, that helps raise the important gauge of productivity per hour. This, economists say, has contributed to the recent rise in the nation's productivity rate, up 2 percent last year from a sluggish 1 percent per year over the previous two decades. This boost, also fueled by heavy corporate investment in computers, has enabled American industry to keep profits high without having to resort to raising prices.
But talk to a few workers who just punched out after a 12-hour day, and they'll tell you that 60-hour weeks have their downside as well. Auto workers, telephone workers and others are howling about too much overtime, with many workers being forced to put in 15 or 20 extra hours a week. In recent months, many labor negotiations have grown heated over union demands to eliminate mandatory overtime -- something many corporations are loath to do when the 4.2 percent jobless rate makes it hard to find new workers.
Little wonder that recent surveys show many Americans complaining that they do not have enough time to spend with their families. Professor Schor expressed surprise that in a recent poll more than 20 percent of Americans said they would happily accept lower incomes in exchange for working fewer hours. Even as many stressed-out workers are deliberately reducing their hours, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has found that 19 percent of Americans report working more than 49 hours a week, up from 16 percent in 1985.
"A very significant group, roughly a third of the labor force, is working more hours than they want," said Professor Schor. "They are feeling high levels of time pressure and stress. They feel their job interferes with their family life." She said stress is being experienced in particular by baby boom workers.
Probably the biggest reason for workers feeling overextended, economists say, is that in many families the parents, taken together, are working longer hours. The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, has found that together, parents in middle-class families work 3,335 hours per year on average, up from 3,200 a decade ago and just over 3,000 hours two decades ago. That's an increase of eight weeks of work per year since 1979. The main reason for the surge, economists say, is not so much that men are working longer hours, but that women are -- in large part to keep family incomes climbing while hourly wages, after accounting for inflation, have largely stagnated for the past 25 years. Millions of women who used to work part time have moved into full-time jobs.
"Much of the economic gains in the current economic recovery comes from people working more hours, rather than higher hourly wages," said Lawrence Mishel, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute.
The overtime boom has created another source of tensions. Many corporate executives are unhappy about dishing out millions of dollars each week in time-and-a-half pay for overtime. As a result many companies are doing an end run around overtime laws by, for example, hiring thousands of workers as independent contractors who do not have to be paid time-and-a-half for every hour they work over 40.
Sociologists and economists see several factors behind the longer work week. The economy is shifting from manufacturing to services, and service workers do not watch the clock the way manufacturing workers do. Many companies, notably software makers, now emphasize "project" work. Corporate culture demands completing projects by a deadline, often requiring workers to put in 90-hour weeks to finish, say, the latest CD-ROM.
Some economists question whether Americans are working more hours per week, saying the statistics rely too much on workers' own accounts. Many economists also say it has grown harder to measure how many hours people work because of the explosion of beepers and cell phones as well as computers and faxes at home.
"Nowadays you go to a social gathering and you see a lot of people wearing beepers, and at a baseball game you see all these people with their cell phones, in many cases still connected to work," said Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University labor economist. "It's gotten far more difficult to measure where work ends and leisure begins."

Not Doing Better By Doing Good

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
For corporations, it looks like virtue may have to be its own reward after all.
Two Arizona State University West economists examined the popular notion that good corporate citizens -- companies that support local charities, promote diversity, run clean plants and make safe products -- wind up with better bottom lines and higher stock prices than their less altruistic brethren. They found that the best that can be said for doing good is that it doesn't do much harm. 
 The two professors, Donald Siegel and Abagail McWilliams, found no statistically significant difference in 10-year stock price performance between a group of 950 companies selected for good corporate social performance and another of 1,200 randomly selected companies. Nor did any pattern emerge from their study of six years of profitability figures for 524 companies whose social responsibility ratings ranged from saintly to dismal.
"There is simply no relationship between corporate social responsibility and any financial measure of performance," Professor Siegel concluded. So what about all those earlier studies that found bottom-line benefits of benevolence? "The empirical analysis was horrendous," Professor Siegel said, adding that earlier researchers failed to note how often companies that can afford social benevolence are also the ones that can afford to invest heavily in research and development. "The empirical connection is between economic performance and R. & D., not social responsibility."
The study isn't going down well in some quarters. When the authors presented their findings to the Academy of Management last month, "We were accused of being Machiavellian," Professor Siegel said.

The Future Is Made In . . .

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
So I was having lunch the other day with a group of Taiwanese news editors, and I asked them if I could take notes on my computer. As I opened up my laptop, I joked that I hoped they didn't mind that I was using an American Dell Inspiron and not a Taiwanese-made Acer computer. Without missing a beat, the Taiwanese editor on my left said, "Oh, don't worry, your Dell was made here, too." The others laughed. I couldn't resist turning my Dell over and looking at the bottom. It said: "Made in Taiwan."
If you think China would pay a huge price for war with Taiwan today, you can't imagine the price that Taiwan, and the rest of the world, would pay. 
 It is one of those little known facts that PC's and laptops are made in a global supply chain, and Taiwan, and Taiwanese-owned firms in China and Asia, are the key link in that chain. They make the most important parts that go into Dell, Compaq, Acer, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. PC's, as well as into Cisco systems that keep the Internet flowing.
Most U.S. computer firms have moved out of manufacturing. While they assemble computers in the U.S. from parts made in Taiwan, they are increasingly focused on software and Internet technologies. This has left Taiwanese firms as the world's largest supplier of 13 critical computer components. We're talking about cases, screens, microprocessors, hubs, modems, LAN cards, keyboards, monitors, scanners, motherboards, power supplies, CD-ROM's and graphics cards. Many are sole-sourced in Taiwan. Compaq alone will reportedly source $7 billion in PC components out of Taiwan this year.
A war across the Taiwan Straits, coinciding with the Y2K virus -- when demand for replacement computers will be soaring -- would be a human and economic disaster. (Although it would make a great movie plot.)
"The immediate impact would be a shortage of computer products and prices would go up instead of down," said Stanley Shih, the Bill Gates of Taiwan and the chairman of Acer Group. Taiwanese know that this limits how much they can unilaterally pull away from China. Electronic Business News quoted a Compaq spokesman in Taipei as saying, if China really does start to threaten Taiwan, "We will consider a plan to shift our orders from Taiwan to Korea or Japan."
This isn't the only reason Taiwan has to consider China's wishes. Taiwan is great at taking other people's innovations, improving them and then manufacturing them cheaper. The problem is, cheaper labor markets around Asia are catching up to Taiwan in this game. Therefore, to keep its standard of living rising, Taiwan has to move up the computer food chain and start doing its own software and Internet innovation. But for now, Taiwan can't compete with U.S. firms in this area, because they have access to a huge, English-speaking market in North America, full of designers. Designing Internet and software products for that market has great risks but offers great rewards, so thousands of U.S. firms are involved. Taiwan needs its own huge Chinese-speaking market that would offer the same rewards and talent pool for the next generation of software and Internet technologies. It needs China.
"Our democratic system gives us the ability to do anything we want by way of innovation -- the problem is that our market is too small," says Mr. Shih. "So it doesn't encourage people to take innovative risks because the rewards are too small. We have to find a way to have a big market, so China is our hope. Many Taiwanese companies have software centers in China. We have hundreds now, but our plan is to have thousands. Our future technology development depends on leveraging the human resources in China. We need China for brains and we need it for the market -- to be able to justify the risks in developing Internet-enabling technologies and services."
Taiwan's role in the world computer market helps to explain both its self-confidence and its vulnerability. Because it is a democracy, it can attract the best Taiwanese to come home and give them a real culture of innovation. But because it is a democracy next to China, dependent on China and coveted by China, it has to restrain its independence drive.
Taiwan has the winds of history at its back. The Chinese Communist regime has the winds of history in its face. If Taiwan fails to understand that, and rushes toward formal independence, its future will be "Made in China." But if it can be patient and play to its strength, China's future will be "Made in Taiwan."

HEADLINE: Argentine Chief's Tepid Stand Hobbles His Party's Candidate

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 3

 BODY:
It is not the best year to be the presidential candidate of the governing Justicialist Party, with the country sinking into recession, crime soaring and polls showing that voters believe government corruption is rife.
Adding to the problems facing the candidate, Eduardo Duhalde, who is now Governor of Buenos Aires Province, is the ambiguous support, if it can be called that, he is receiving from President Carlos Saul Menem, the party's head. 
 Lagging far behind his competitor, the Buenos Aires Mayor, Fernando de la Rua, in the polls, Mr. Duhalde said last week that the opposition Alianza coalition had a secret plan to devalue the Argentine peso that would destroy the economy. Mr. de la Rua denied that he had devaluation in mind, saying he was committed to Argentina's eight-year-old policy of pegging the peso one-to-one to the American dollar.
It was a typical heated campaign exchange with little import until Mr. Menem said publicly that he believed Mr. de la Rua, putting an end to the rumor and embarrassing Mr. Duhalde.
Trying to recover, Mr. Duhalde assembled all the Justicialist governors and party chiefs at a Buenos Aires convention hall this week to propose an economic plan that would cut the value-added tax from 21 percent to 15 percent, reduce taxes for businesses that suspend planned layoffs, and give subsidies to small and medium-sized businesses. He challenged the opposition to join with the Justicialists to approve the plan before the Oct. 24 election because the country's economy was in jeopardy.
Mr. Menem's initial reaction was decidedly tepid. "It deserves consideration but that's all," he said. "We'll see whether it should be implemented." After party leaders complained that Mr. Menem appeared to be sabotaging the ticket, he grudgingly endorsed the program.
Even more embarrassing to Justicialist leaders have been press reports that Mr. Menem's senior aides and top congressional supporters have called reporters in recent weeks to suggest that Mr. Duhalde would resign as the Justicialist candidate and be replaced by someone with a better chance of winning.
There was nothing to the reports, but they underscored Mr. Duhalde's weakness and the divisions in the party, which has had a stormy history since it was founded by Juan Domingo Peron.
Publicly, Mr. Menem and members of his Cabinet insist that they fully support Mr. Duhalde, a contention many experts contest. "Menem has done all he can to damage Duhalde," said Joaquin Morales Sola, a columnist for the paper La Nacion.
Mr. Menem challenged Mr. Duhalde for the Justicialist nomination for months until the courts and Congress resisted his attempts to overturn a constitutional ban on his running for a third consecutive term.
Mr. Menem has since announced that he would like to return to the presidential palace in 2003, and his aides say he is willing to challenge Mr. Duhalde in a primary to do it.
A poll made public this week by Mora y Araujo and Associates, a respected Argentine polling company, showed Mr. de La Rua, who is running a cautious campaign with little flair, with 48 percent backing to 29 percent for Mr. Duhalde. Domingo Cavallo, the former Economy Minister running on a conservative third-party ticket, received 9 percent.
Media coverage of the campaign has been dominated in recent days by accounts of how the Duhalde forces are trying to regroup and find a winning message. Many articles have been suffused with sarcasm, especially when it became public that Mr. Duhalde's running mate, Senator Ramon Palito Ortega, made a panicked trip to Israel to seek spiritual guidance from a rabbi.
Mr. Duhalde was Vice President during Mr. Menem's first term, but the two have not been close for years. Mr. Duhalde rose in the polls earlier in the year while distancing himself from Mr. Menem's free-market economic policies, but more recently he has had nice things to say about the President as a way to unite the Justicialist Party.
Mr. Menem has said he supports Mr. Duhalde, and embraced him at a recent public meeting. But Mr. Menem continues to tell reporters that if he could have run for re-election, "I would be the best candidate of all."

HEADLINE: Gap Between Rich and Poor Found Substantially Wider

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The gap between rich and poor has grown into an economic chasm so wide that this year the richest 2.7 million Americans, the top 1 percent, will have as many after-tax dollars to spend as the bottom 100 million.
That ratio has more than doubled since 1977, when the top 1 percent had as much as the bottom 49 million, according to new data from the Congressional Budget Office. 
 In dollars, the richest 2.7 million people and the 100 million at the other end of the scale will each have about $620 billion to spend, according to an analysis of the budget office figures. The analysis was done by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit organization in Washington that advocates Federal tax and spending policies that it says would benefit the poor. The analysis, released last night, seems certain to stoke the debate that is about to resume in Washington over projected Federal budget surpluses and possible tax cuts.
The data from the budget office show that income disparity has grown so much that four out of five households, or about 217 million people, are taking home a thinner slice of the economic pie today than in 1977. When adjusted for inflation, as all of the income figures have been, these households' share of national income has fallen to just under 50 percent from 56 percent in 1977.
But among the most prosperous one-fifth of Americans households, or about 54 million people, whose share of the national income grew, that fatter slice of the pie was not sliced evenly. More than 90 percent of the increase is going to the richest 1 percent of households, which this year will average $515,600 in after-tax income, up from $234,700 in 1977.
Since 1993, the economy has lifted the incomes of all of the income groups tracked by the budget office, but the incomes of the richest Americans are rising twice as fast as those of the middle class. In addition, the budget office figures understate the economic power of the richest 1 percent because they exclude deferred forms of income like restricted stock, which have grown rapidly in recent years as companies have expanded their pay plans from senior executives down to store and plant manager levels.
Though the economic pie has grown over the past 22 years, the Congressional Budget Office data show that the poorest one-fifth of households have not shared in this bounty. The average after-tax household income of the poor, adjusted for inflation, has fallen 12 percent since 1977. So the poor not only have a small slice of a big economic pie, but the pie is bigger and their piece is even smaller.
The poorest one-fifth of households will average $8,800 of income this year, down from $10,000 in 1977.
Congressional Republicans have passed legislation to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, legislation that President Clinton has promised to veto, saying it is imprudent and favors the rich.
The Republicans say that a tax cut is justified because Federal tax revenue rose last year to 21.7 percent of the economy, the highest since World War II, and because the Congressional Budget Office anticipates surpluses as far into the future as its projections go.
The Republicans acknowledge that most of their proposed tax cuts will go to taxpayers making $100,000 or more a year, but they say that since these high-income Americans pay 62 percent of Federal income taxes they should get most of the benefits of a tax cut.
"The tax bill's benefits are roughly proportional to the taxes that each taxpayer pays," Bruce Bartlett, a Treasury official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, has written.
President Clinton, who says that budget surpluses may never materialize, wants to pay down the national debt before cutting taxes. He also says that a tax cut should not bestow the bulk of its benefits on the rich, and he wants part of any surplus to finance new programs.
The budget and policy center's report says that one reason the rich are doing so well is the cumulative effect of tax cuts since 1977, when the top Federal income tax bracket was 50 percent, compared with the current 39.6 percent. These tax cuts are worth an average of $40,000 this year to each of the slightly more than one million households that make up the top 1 percent, said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Internal Revenue Service tax return data, not cited in the center's report, show that two-thirds of Americans earned less than $40,000 in 1997.
"Many Americans who make $80,000 a year, $100,000 or $120,000, think of themselves as middle class," Mr. Greenstein said, "but the fact is that while these people are not rich, they are also not in or even near the middle, which is only about $32,000 in after-tax income."
Mr. Greenstein said that under the Republican tax cut plan the richest 1 percent of households would save an average of $32,000 more annually, once all of the proposed cuts were phased in.
The budget and policy center has been sharply critical of the Republican tax cut plan and the idea that those who pay the most in taxes should get the biggest cuts.
Isaac Shapiro, who wrote the report with Mr. Greenstein, called the proposed tax cut plan "wrongheaded" and unfair to both the poor and the middle class.
Mr. Greenstein said he was pleased with one proposal in the Republican plan, a small expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which allows low-income workers to collect up to $3,816 this year in refunds of their Social Security tax and a cash payment that is a form of negative income tax.
A couple with two children does not pay any income tax until their income exceeds $28,000 this year.
That expansion was proposed despite intense criticism of the credit by leading Republicans, notably Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Other data, not cited in the budget and policy center report, also show that the growth in incomes is mostly at the top of the income ladder.
For example, 142,566 Americans reported $1 million or more of adjusted gross income for 1997, nearly two-thirds more than the 86,998 such taxpayers in 1995.
Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose review of two books taking different tacks on the income gap appears in the current issue of the Harvard Business Review, said that the concentration of income growth at the top resulted largely from rules set by Congress.
"Markets are obviously very important in the economy," Professor Levy said, "but they are surrounded by a lot of rules -- rules about how easy it is organize unions and how free trade is -- and those rules are determined by the political process and those rules right now are shaped by money" donated to political candidates.

HEADLINE: Housing for Poorer Neighbors Offends Vail's Rich

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: VAIL, Colo., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Battles over growth bedevil communities throughout the country, but rarely have they generated such fury as they have here in one of Colorado's premier ski resorts.
Objections over plans to build affordable housing for people who work in local hotels, shops and restaurants grew so heated this summer that Mayor Rob Ford decided to quit, two years before his term expires. 
 "At some of the meetings we had, things got so bad that I was uncomfortable without an undercover police officer there to protect me," Mr. Ford said. "At times I thought guys were going to pop me right there in Town Hall."
The conflict is familiar in upscale resort towns. With Vail's winter popularity sagging in recent years because of aging hotels and intense competition from other ski resorts in Colorado and beyond, officials outlined an economic plan to revitalize the town center. The centerpiece is a new Marriott hotel, scheduled for groundbreaking next summer. Other projects are under way.
But new amenities mean more employees. And having more employees means creating living space for them, a daunting challenge in a town that is already 98 percent developed and where homes typically cost $500,000 and more. When workers in resorts like Vail are forced to find cheaper housing many miles away, the long commutes persuade many of them to seek jobs closer to home, causing huge employment needs at the resort during peak season.
To reverse trends that allowed Breckenridge to overtake Vail last year as Colorado's leading ski resort, Mr. Ford and the City Council sought suggestions from the Vail community and later identified about seven sites around town for new housing that would cost under $200,000 per dwelling.
That is when the trouble began, Mr. Ford said.
People living in the area of the planned construction began objecting, he said, fearing that their property values would plummet. Three groups have sued the city, all contending that town officials are violating local tax laws by buying open land for the new housing. One plaintiff, Charles Bernhardt, a carpenter, lives adjacent to a prospective housing site but insisted, in an interview, that his proximity to the site had nothing to do with his decision to sue.
At least lawsuits confront problems in a civil manner, contrary to the demeanor of some other town residents, Mr. Ford said.
"At one Christmas party, one of the Grand Dames of Vail came up and lit into me," he said, without identifying her. "She screamed so loud that spit was going out of her mouth. I couldn't even understand what she was saying."
Other town residents have also made their feelings known, Mr. Ford said. Recounting a conversation with Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary who owns a home in Vail and was the 1996 Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, the Mayor said Mr. Kemp "expressed displeasure" that any new housing might be located near his home.
Not so, Mr. Kemp said in an interview. Describing himself as a strong supporter of affordable housing in Vail, he insisted that he had never spoken with Mr. Ford about the housing issue and called the Mayor "rather disingenuous" for saying that they had talked. "I've never said anything publicly or privately about this," Mr. Kemp said.
Mr. Ford also said John H. Glenn Jr., the former Democratic Senator from Ohio and a Vail homeowner since 1980, complained to officials that some of the housing might be located near him. "It was disgusting," Mr. Ford said of his letter.
Mr. Glenn conceded that his letter was "reasonably tough." But he said his objections were solely based on assurances given when he bought his mountainside condominium that the open area beside it would not be developed. And even now, he added, he did not oppose a housing project on the land so long as it did not block his view of the valley.
"I just thought I was being snookered," Mr. Glenn said. "I thought they were changing the ground rules on me, and I wanted information."
Mr. Ford, 48, said he came to Vail 25 years ago from Michigan for the skiing and never left. He worked as a bartender and hotel clerk and now sells real estate. He was elected to the seven-member City Council in 1995, and in 1997 the Council voted him in as Mayor.
Before the turmoil over affordable housing, he estimated that he skied 75 to 80 days a year. For the last two years, skiing days are down to 30. He plans to step down in November.
"I'm not a politician," he insisted. "I said I would be Mayor because I thought I could address Vail's problems, and I feel I have met the objectives we set out to do.
"But the level of incivility is more than I'm willing to put up with," he said. "I like to ski, then sit down at the bar to drink a beer and not have someone come up to me and complain. I want to go back to skiing and being a nice guy again."

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Gown Tries To Dress Up The Town

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: CANTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
POOR Canton, so close to Canada, so far from any really decent malls. How is it going to get kids to come to college all the way up here?
St. Lawrence University, Canton's biggest employer, worries about those kids and that problem, and it thinks one answer is to get the old farm village to spruce up a bit, put a little modern gloss on the aging Main Street, something Starbucky, maybe, something GAPpy. Anything that -- in the words of Tom Coakley, the university's vice president -- creates a sense of "retail vibrancy." 
 "Retail vibrancy is important for the social atmosphere of a university," said Mr. Coakley as he showed off an example of what he means, the university's new bookstore, whose dark wood and slate-green accents mimic Barnes & Noble right down to the category signs on the bookshelves.
"Shopping is entertainment; these kids have been raised being entertained in malls, and that goes to this atmosphere, but dressed up in a book-oriented, liberal arts environment," he said.
But even a 100-year-old university with 600 well-paid jobs has to tread softly when it comes to telling people up here that they should follow its lead to make Main Street more appealing to prospective students and -- more important, Mr. Coakley believes -- to their parents.
Albany and Syracuse are downstate to people in St. Lawrence County, and New York City, seven hours away by car, may as well be in Virginia. So when the campus basically tells the locals to wash their faces and tuck in their shirts for the visitors, some people get their backs up.
"People in the North Country are very independent, always have been," said Marilyn I. Mintener, a former mayor and the owner of the Pear Tree gift shop on Main. "So sometimes they don't like being told what to do, and maybe the university has been pushing a little."
Sylvia Kingston, owner of Josie's Little Pizzeria, calls the university "the company," and puts the friction down to class. "It's just two different classes of people, the university and everybody else, and they just think differently, and they have different agendas." She paused, then added, "But they bring a lot of culture. If the university wasn't here, we'd have nothing."
The campus is hardly struggling. Enrollment has dropped from 2,400 in the mid-1980's to 1,900, but only because the university is choosier, Mr. Coakley said. It has been spending $20 million a year on physical improvements for some time.
Yet the university is trying to look ahead, and it would help if Main Street had a little more of Chapel Hill or Harvard Square about it, and a little less deep-woods-barely-hangin'-on.
So St. Lawrence has already handed out tens of thousands of dollars in low-interest loans to help merchants improve their storefronts. In exchange for closing Leigh Street through campus, the university has promised $300,000 to open up more parking behind Main Street "to give the village a more mall-like feeling," Mr. Coakley said.
But the village is balking, and who knows when anything will be done.
"I think people in the village think St. Lawrence is trying to run the place," said David Curry, the owner of a no-name bar on Main and a village trustee who opposed closing Leigh Street. "But if it wasn't for them, no one would have heard of Canton."
If anyone can move Canton in the right direction, it ought to be Tommy Coakley. He grew up here, played hockey for Canton High and went to Brown on a hockey scholarship. He lost a leg in an ambush in Vietnam and married a nurse from the amputee ward. He earned a master's in economics at Wharton, and, in the timeless pattern of North Country kids who leave for a while, he found himself headed home.
Now he worries about making sure other young people who visit Canton and St. Lawrence see what he sees -- the clean air, the quiet, and the friendly people, even if they do get a little crusty.
"Urban campuses worry about urban blight, and rural campuses worry about isolation," Mr. Coakley said. "In terms of running a successful university, having a little isolation and being a little behind the rest of the world is O.K. The important thing is not getting a lot behind."

HEADLINE: These New Invaders Have The Old Pristina Preening

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Sept. 4

 BODY:
All over Pristina, there is building and the noise of electric drills and cement mixers from every direction. Pedestrians walk an obstacle course over and around piles of sand, boards and scaffolding.
No one is rebuilding the handful of burned and bombed buildings that stand as silent witnesses to the Serbian purges of the city's Albanian stores and homes a few months ago, and to NATO's bombs. Instead, people are repairing the buildings that survived more or less intact. The main aim seems to be to redo a house and rent it to foreigners. 
 There are thousands of foreigners here, not just the peacekeeping troops but armies of aid workers, advisers and diplomats. The journalists are gradually disappearing but the long-term development people are only just arriving.
Already the international organizations are changing the look and the feel of the city, most evidently in a suburb called Dragodan, on a hill overlooking downtown Pristina. Dragodan's spacious houses are favored by the international agencies and diplomats. Going further than the rest, American Government officials are taking over the entire top street.
Between them, the United States Agency for International Development and the American mission here have leased 11 houses and plan to seal off both ends of the street to create a secure compound with guards at either end. To achieve this, the Americans have pushed several aid agencies from their offices, including Mercy Corps International and Save the Children.
Jim Kenney, spokesman at the American mission, admitted that the aid agencies had not had much choice. "We asked people politely to move," he said with a slightly embarrassed smile. "It was all done in diplomatic language."
The local director for Save the Children, Steven Rifkin, bowed to the inevitable and says he will now simply have a longer walk to work. "We are all here for the same thing," he pointed out.
There are nearly 200 private organizations in Kosovo, as well as the big United Nations agencies, all employing dozens of foreigners and local residents. The American mission will eventually be the equivalent of a medium-size embassy, employing some 50 Americans and about 150 local workers. The United Nations mission already employs nearly 150 strong, and will grow over the months. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is up to 250 now and will reach 500. The international police force will number 3,000.
The foreigners' presence is being felt most immediately on the streets, because many of them drive big four-wheel-drive vans, outdone in size only by the NATO force's armored vehicles.
So far, the Albanians do not seem to mind the foreigners. For Pristina residents, the much more startling change is the influx from the villages. This city originally had 200,000 people but may now hold almost double that, local journalists say.
They came when NATO troops arrived in June, and the Serbian community left en masse, following their own army and police forces to Serbia. Albanians, back from the refugee camps and down from the mountains where they hid from the Serbian forces during NATO's bombing campaign, flooded into the city to occupy the houses and apartments abandoned by the Serbs.
It was a swift smash and grab. "The law of the strong arm," one man said, as he barricaded himself and his family into the house he had taken. By now, virtually every apartment is full to the brim. In one apartment block by the main police station, only two occupants are the original owners. Albanian names are scrawled on the doors of what had been an exclusively Serbian building. Some of the new occupants have rented from the departing Serbs; others have just moved in.
"Don't touch" is written in Serbian and in Albanian on various doors, presumably first directed against Serbian paramilitaries and then against Albanians. Ardita Uka, 17, says she can tell the youths from the countryside by their accents and their clothes but laughs at the invasion.
"It's funny when I go to my friend's apartment," she said. "It was always very quiet there. It was all Serbs and they had no children. Now it's really noisy with lots of children, and lots of shoes outside each door," she added, referring to the Albanian custom of removing shoes before entering a house.

HEADLINE: Corporation Walks Away From Tax Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Bertelsmann A.G., the third-largest media company in the world, has decided to walk away from $28 million in tax breaks for the new headquarters for its Random House publishing division rather than comply with a last-minute city request to conduct a full environmental review of the $300 million project.
Nonetheless, the company will proceed with construction of the 31-story tower on Broadway, between 55th and 56th Streets. 
 The company has spent more than two years looking for a suitable location and a year negotiating with city officials over an incentive package. Construction is to begin Nov. 1, and the company recently learned that to obtain the subsidies it would have to conduct the environmental review, a process that could take a year.
Unwilling to accept any more delays, Bertelsmann balked last week. Some executives said they suspected that the city's last-minute demand was being used to renege on the tax breaks, and city officials countered that they were not asking for anything out of the ordinary.
Because the city's zoning law does not require an environmental review in this case, Bertelsmann has decided to forgo the $28 million in tax breaks and proceed with what will be called the Random House Building.
"The incentive package is not as important as our need to consolidate our employees at Random House into one state-of-the-art building," said Robert Sorrentino, president of Bertelsmann Inc. "We did not ask the city for any special treatment. We respect the Mayor's decision, but we'll go ahead without the city's incentive package."
Mr. Sorrentino said his company would conduct its own environmental analysis and resolve any problems, like traffic congestion.
The sudden turnabout by Bertelsmann raises a critical question about the city's policy of granting tax breaks to some of the largest, most profitable corporations in the world: If Bertelsmann can proceed without the tax breaks, why did the Giuliani administration offer them in the first place?
"Turning down a tax break is pretty good evidence that the subsidy wasn't ever needed," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization. "I'm sure a lot of these projects could fly without government support."
Urban planners, anti-tax groups, labor unions, liberal analysts and good-government groups like the Citizens Budget Commission have long criticized the tax breaks as a form of corporate welfare, particularly when the economy is strong. They say the deals shift the tax burden to small and medium-size companies while depriving the city of needed tax revenue. The Bertelsmann decision gives credibility to their contention that companies choose to expand or relocate for business reasons, not because city officials offer a special tax bonus, the critics said.
"Our view is that they should be trying to create a good business environment for all businesses, large and small," Ms. Fortuna said. "That can be done by improving schools and public transportation and lowering taxes across the board."
Even as the New York economy has surged in recent years, the Giuliani administration has provided more than $2 billion in tax breaks for 50 companies, including Viacom, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, the New York Stock Exchange and the News Corporation. Under the state law governing such subsidies, the tenant must sign an agreement saying that if it were not for the tax breaks, it would have been unable to build a new skyscraper or would have moved out of the city.
So-called corporate retention deals have become so common that Bear Stearns, CBS and others did not even threaten to leave New York before getting tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives.
"We think our policy of providing incentives has been enormously successful," Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said. "In this case, Bertelsmann was in a time bind. Their need to get into the building on time outweighed their need for incentives. So the city gets the best of both worlds: it gets a new building, and it gets to save money for taxpayers."
Even before Bertelsmann completed its acquisition of Random House in July 1998, the German company had been looking for a home for both Random House and its Bantam Doubleday Dell consumer publishing group. The company spent more than seven months last year negotiating over a site in Times Square across the street from Bertelsmann's headquarters at 1540 Broadway, but the deal fell apart.
In December, Bertelsmann opened talks with Steve Ross of the Related Companies, who needed a tenant for an 860,000-square-foot building he planned to build on the west side of Broadway, between 55th and 56th Streets. By May, the two sides had come to terms: Bertelsmann would own and occupy 640,000 square feet of the building and move in more than 1,500 employees. Retail space and about 130 apartments would take up the rest of the building. The project needed no city approvals.
About the same time, Deputy Mayor Levine agreed to provide Bertelsmann with $28 million in tax breaks, a bit less than what the company had sought. In the meantime, Mr. Ross completed most of the demolition on the Bertelsmann site.
But before the deal could be approved by the city's Industrial Development Agency, city officials unexpectedly told Bertelsmann in early August that to get the tax breaks it had to conduct a full environmental review, rather than the more perfunctory analysis that is usually done at the agency.
The demand took Bertelsmann by surprise because city officials had not mentioned such a requirement in more than a year of talks on an incentive package. City officials said the company's lawyers should have anticipated the request.
The company said the review could kill the project altogether, while Mr. Levine and Michael Carey, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the city was not asking for special treatment, according to people on both sides of the negotiating table.
"It came up at the last minute," said one person involved in the Bertelsmann project. "It looked like the city was hiding behind the technicality to pull the tax breaks."
Mr. Levine denied that the Giuliani administration's real motive was to withdraw the incentive package. Rather, he said, it feared that the absence of a full environmental review might arouse neighborhood opposition. "We didn't want the project delayed by lawsuits," he said. "We wanted it to go forward."
In an embarrassment for the Giuliani administration, the State Supreme Court recently struck down a year-old zoning rule that allowed Broadway theaters to sell air rights above the theaters to nearby developers, saying that the city should have conducted an environmental impact statement.
Two people familiar with the Bertelsmann project suggested that the Giuliani administration was now gun-shy. But they said the city's decision also raised the dangerous possibility that all new projects might have to conduct what many regard as a tortuous environmental review to obtain tax breaks. Several real estate lawyers said that most deals approved by the Industrial Development Agency involved existing office space, not new buildings like the Bertelsmann project, and did not require a full environmental review.
Even so, said Richard G. Leland, who heads the environmental practice group at the Rosenman & Colin law firm, it is reasonable to assume that a building will be built at Broadway and 55th Street, whether or not there are tax breaks.
"So there is no real environmental impact from the tax abatement," said Mr. Leland, who did the environmental work for the Bear Stearns tower, which is being built on Madison Avenue with a city tax break. "In those circumstances, it's unusual to require an environmental review."

RABINOWICZ, RACHEL ANNE

 BODY:
RABINOWICZ-Rachel Anne, ZL 20 Ellul 5747 14 September 1987 love everlasting 
More than any other art fraud in recent memory, the Drewe scandal has raised the ire of London's independent art dealers, much of it directed at the auction houses, which, they claim, willfully moved Myatt forgeries knowing they were fakes in order to boost profits. How else to explain passing off supposed oil paintings by famous artists made with vinyl paint and K-Y Jelly? The auction houses, in turn, insist they were conned like everyone else.
"These pictures were not flung in sales and we turned a blind eye," insists Melanie Clore. "Reputable academics authenticated the pictures, and people who have a lot of experience with these particular artists condoned them. I think it's a case that affected the whole art establishment, dealers, auction houses, academics, collectors. We were as diligent as we could be." Complaints about the auction houses, she says, sound more like the sour grapes of dealers bitter and embarrassed about being suckered themselves.
In the case of one Giacometti, Sotheby's withdrew the picture just hours prior to its sale because Lisa Palmer of the Giacometti association was suspicious of it, in spite of what appeared to be an overwhelmingly substantiated provenance. "You go to the Tate Gallery archives," says Clore, "and you look through the stock book of the most reputable gallery in London in the 50's and you find the picture reproduced in black and white. You can't be more diligent than that. You can't underestimate the lengths to which Drewe went." Christie's refused to comment beyond the assertion that it checked the provenances thoroughly and so did nothing wrong.
Thomas Hoving doesn't think that the auction houses are always, or even often, purposely deceitful. "The auction houses get stung from time to time because of the volume they deal with," Hoving says. "In general, they simply don't have the time to confirm the authenticity of everything. The amount of things they deal with is awesome."
Lowry of MOMA adds, "If it is determined that a dealer or an auction house is a willing purveyor of forgeries, their credibility is so affected that at the end of the day it's self-destructive."
Peter Nahum, a senior director and head of Sotheby's British paintings department for 17 years and one of London's most respected art dealers, was among the first to be bilked by Drewe. He complains that too many private dealers and auction houses "are really interested in churning through as much money and getting as much profit as possible," and that both are consequently complicit in their own corruption. While at Sotheby's, Nahum sold up to 10,000 paintings a year and looked at up to 40,000. As a dealer, he sells 300 to 400 a year, and though he looks at about 100,000, he says the smaller number of sales reduces his chance of being conned, but doesn't eliminate it.
Nahum argues that in recent years the market has been thinned of good art, and that the auction houses have cut costs by firing their experts. "Nowadays," Nahum laments, "expertise gets in the way" by slowing the process. "You can't expertise on 100,000 pictures a year. You can't do your job properly and make any money." Leslie Waddington, another London dealer, agrees: "It's a much bigger problem than the discussion about Drewe. The real question is, Who are the experts at Christie's and Sotheby's? Are they just experts at selling and chatting up old women? . . . If the auction houses dominate the world, where is the expertise going to be? Will they have no one who has visible knowledge?"
Nahum's first contact with Drewe came in the late 80's. Unbeknown to him, Drewe had been offering Nahum paintings by Ben Nicholson and Laurence Lowry for years through his band of runners. "They were bad and expensive, and I ran them along," Nahum says. "But then we're in the middle of a very bad recession. We've all lost a lot of money. We're all desperately trying to meet our overhead. There is no business. It's hell." In 1984, Drewe's next-door neighbor, Clive Bellman, "came in with a Graham Sutherland 'Crucifixion,"' Nahum said, adding that he thought it was junk. But Christie's, Nahum had been told, had just sold a group of similar Sutherlands for $24,000 to $32,000 each. This Sutherland came with letters of authenticity from an order of monastic priests, the Order of Servite Mary -- all, it would turn out, forged. Nahum bought the painting and sent it to auction at Christie's in London. Eventually, Nahum bought the Nicholsons. "They weren't great paintings, but they were flashy, colorful, what the market desires. The market doesn't want anything difficult or intellectual."
Those paintings, too, had come with convincing documentation, including, according to Nahum, supporting letters from Alan Bowness, the world's top Nicholson expert. In flusher times, provenance is often checked more thoroughly. But, compromised by the necessity to move product, experts sometimes can't afford to look too hard; thus, the poisonous combination of raw commercialism and the desire for discovery. "The Dubuffets were a joke," Waddington says. "One or two of the Nicholsons looked good. I thought the fakes were third-rate. I say that glibly now. When I saw them I was worried, but I didn't say they were fakes." As Nahum says, "None of the innocents are innocent."
But raising an alarm, or even offering solid evidence of fraud, is no guarantee that a painting won't be sold. In 1994, Waddington was approached by Jean Dubuffet's concerned daughter with photocopies of 18 of her father's gouaches, some of them his trademark cows. "Some of these I was very worried about," Waddington recalls. "I thought they were fakes, but the provenances were good. I thought maybe Dubuffet had a bad phase." Then the dealer noticed that the paperwork had been signed "Jean Dubuffet," but knew that the artist almost always signed his name "J. Dubuffet." His suspicions aroused, he then noticed that three or four of the photocopies showed inscriptions to "Lawrence" or to "Lawrence Alloway," curator of the Institute of Contemporary Art in the 1950's. But Dubuffet was rigid in matters of social etiquette, and would have inscribed the works to "Monsieur Alloway." The last tip-off was the date on the art, "1955." Dubuffet stopped doing cows in early 1954.
The Jean Dubuffet Foundation was alerted. But the dealer soon learned that even after the warnings, Armande Trentinian, director of the foundation, issued certificates of authenticity for the works without having seen the originals. Because her lover had bought one for himself for $16,000, Trentinian's blunder was probably a product of stubbornness, possibly to cover her initial mistake. The Pace Gallery in New York had already bought four of the pieces. "Everyone was profiting," Waddington says, suggesting that there was little motivation to stop the flow of fakes. Trentinian has since resigned.
"When I authenticated these works, I believed they were from Dubuffet," Trentinian says. She claims she had the drawings analyzed. "The ink was good. The result was perfect. All the analysis was good. . . . If the elements we have now show certainly that these works are fake, then I regret my mistake."
In another instance, the forged Giacometti, the 1955 "Nu Debout," passed through the hands of two independent dealers before it was offered to the American purchasers. After Lisa Palmer could not guarantee the picture's authenticity, the Americans had the painting analyzed privately by Eugena Ordonez, a conservator who also worked at MOMA. Though Myatt had painted the picture sloppily and in an emulsion paint not invented until the mid-60's, a decade after the picture was supposedly done, Ordonez's report was "inconclusive." Ordonez says she had been hired only to analyze the pigments, which gave satisfactory results, but not the medium, which might have raised suspicions that the painting was a forgery. "What I say in my report is what I was asked to do," Ordonez explains. "What I think and know about a painting is something else entirely different." When asked if a conservator who suspects the picture's origins, but doesn't object when the picture is sold and later determined to be a fake, is an accessory to a crime, Ordonez paused, then replied, "That's a good question."
As Lowry puts it: "When a forger is as successful as Drewe was, it's not one person who's corrupt, it's not one dealer. It's a whole system that has failed. A lot of checks and balances that should have connected, didn't."
By late 1994, Myatt had begun to pine for the simplicity and safety of his pre-Drewe life. He began to dread Drewe's phone calls. "The sound of his voice going on and on," he recalls now, "I needed a stiff drink afterward." Myatt had also become repulsed by how Drewe preyed on the vulnerable, the dead and the dimly acquainted to concoct art owners. Drewe had used Myatt's dying father's name on some of his fake provenances; he had done the same with Stoakes's. He had even cannibalized portions of his own mother's will. Myatt had also grown vaguely afraid; twice Drewe showed off his weapons. And after nearly nine years, Myatt yearned to return to painting in his own style.
The last straw was a Christie's auction that Myatt attended with Drewe, where he watched one of his own Dubuffets sold off for a lot of money. "It was strangely depressing," Myatt says. "It should have been my own work."
Meanwhile, Drewe had walked out on Goudsmid but had left behind incriminating evidence of his forgeries. She in turn contacted the police and left three incriminating letters from Drewe with a friend. A third person, an acquaintance, took other documents from Goudsmid and kept them in his house in the London neighborhood of Hampstead. In mid-January 1995, Drewe called Myatt to inform him that Goudsmid had the papers and was blackmailing them. Myatt recalls Drewe's saying, "I can't stand for it." He told Myatt he'd "burn down the house."
According to Goudsmid, Drewe heard that some of his papers were now in the house of Goudsmid's acquaintance. Drewe called her repeatedly, badgering her about how many locks were on the doors and whether there was an alarm. By this time, Goudsmid had taken the evidence back to her own home. The next night a man fitting Drewe's description was found hiding in the acquaintance's basement by a young renter. A few hours later, the house burned. A 25-year-old Hungarian woman renting the top floor jumped from the flames and later died of her injuries. Based on Goudsmid's statement and the witness's description, Drewe was arrested and put in a police lineup. But he had shaved his mustache, cut his hair and taken off his glasses. The young renter failed to identify him. Reluctantly, the police released him.
Three months later, armed with Myatt's confession and Goudsmid's evidence, police raided Drewe's house and rearrested him, charging him with conspiracy to defraud and forgery. Even after four days of interrogation, Drewe refused to admit guilt, never wavering from his story that the paintings were genuine and that Myatt was just a man he'd hired to reline some pictures he'd bought at auction. Drewe's "all-consuming drive to pull the strings -- hence his title 'puppet master' -- has left him unable to live outside his own version of reality," says Detective Constable Inspector Miki Volpe, a 22-year veteran. "He's a verbal bully who thinks he can manipulate anyone. As you start to learn more about this man, you realize the enormous web of deception he has spun. . . . He was certainly the most devious character I had ever come into contact with in my service." Drewe was released on bail and immediately disappeared.
While on the lam, Drewe obviously reconsidered his case, for when he was reapprehended two months later -- his mother was followed to his hiding place on the south coast -- his story changed from blanket innocence to a fantastical frame-up defense. He no longer denied the fraud, but now claimed that he has been set up as fall guy for a widespread conspiracy that included Scotland Yard, the Ministry of Defense and the governments of at least seven nations; that there were not 200 paintings, but more than 4,000, all sold to help finance covert arms deals that he helped broker between British weapons manufacturers and Iran, Iraq and Sierra Leone; that Myatt wasn't a "starving artist" but actually an operative for Combat 18, the violent neo-Nazi group, and that Peter Harris, who appeared on countless false provenances, was really a South African intelligence agent and weapons broker. Drewe explained the mysterious blank 15 years in his life by claiming to have worked covertly for the British Government. "I was very active in the development of certain items of defense technology," he told me in Pentonville Prison. "The sale of the paintings relates to some pretty devastating things. They include the sale of a ballistic-missile guidance system which I was responsible for selling to Iran in 1991. I have got the papers to prove it." Asked repeatedly for corroboration, Drewe produced not a single source. The prosecution's position is that Drewe's story of international intrigue is a figment of the imagination of a fantasist and consummate con artist.
At the trial, which began last September, Drewe fired his lawyer for refusing to conduct the art-for-arms defense and took up the case himself. The courtroom was arrayed like an art gallery, with nine of Myatt's forgeries hung about the walls. The trial, which was expected to last three months, stretched to six. Myatt sat in the witness box and called Drewe a "psychopath" and a "liar" to his face. By the trial's end, Bevan was mocking Drewe with the identities he had assumed: "The truth is that you are Mr. Drewe, you are two sorts of Mr. Cockett, you are Mr. Sussman, you are Mr. Green, Mr. Atwood and you are Mr. Martin and Mr. Bayard the researcher and Mr. Coverdale, aren't you?" The jury returned with a guilty verdict in less than six hours. Drewe is appealing his conviction.
If Drewe's success provides any lesson, it is that the art world's aura of sophistication creates a false sense of security that makes it especially vulnerable to what was, in the end, a confederacy of mediocrity. Myatt's sloppy pictures, Drewe's litany of far-fetched identities and the ignorance of his pitiable salesmen should have been no match for the likes of the auction houses, scholars and dealers that Drewe conned. But in the end, the system's multiple lines of defense -- dealers, galleries, auction houses, museums, archives, world-class experts -- proved all too permeable.
But if a picture brings esthetic pleasure and is beloved before its fictitious pedigree is exposed, and the only person who loses money is a collector probably wealthy enough to absorb the loss, then where exactly is the problem? As Van Meegeren said at his 1947 trial for forgery about a Vermeer he had faked: "Yesterday this picture was worth millions of guilders, and experts and art lovers would come from all over the world and pay money to see it. Today, it is worth nothing, and nobody would cross the street to see it for free. But the picture has not changed. What has?"

An Early Labor Day Parade on Wall St.

BYLINE: By Patrick J. Lyons 

 BODY:
Talk about your getaway days.
 The stock and bond market redeemed what had been a pretty sour late-summer week by soaring on Friday, elated by monthly job statistics suggesting that, even though the unemployment rate is at 30-year lows, the labor markets are not taut enough to spark renewed inflation.
 
 Earlier in the week, troubling robust data on new home sales and factory orders, followed by cautiously hedged remarks about Fed policy from Edward Kelley, a Federal Reserve governor, left many analysts thinking that a third interest rate increase this year to cool the economy might be in the offing. But Friday's good news on employment chased away clouds of worry about inflation that had been fathering for days.
 The major stock indexes and the bond market all turned in bravura performances to kick off the long Labor Day weekend. The fireworks - including the Nasdaq composite's biggest point gain ever - pulled American stocks sharply into positive territory for the week, but came too late to buoy most overseas markets, where trading had already closed. Even the dollar shared in the ebullience, rising Friday despite falling Treasury yields. PATRICK J. LYONS

In Alaska, Helicopters Alarm Environmentalists

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
WHEN the United States Forest Service issued a permit in 1984 for the first commercial helicopter to land tourists on the Juneau Ice Field, it limited the landings to 400. Today four helicopter companies are allowed a total of 19,039 landings a year on the 100-mile-long ice field, and have petitioned for twice that. They also want to land at two of the ice field's 10 zones that were declared off limits to helicopters in 1987.
Whether the helicopter companies get their wish will depend on regulations that emerge from passage of a Forest Service environmental-impact study that is now in the draft stage. The final version is scheduled to go into effect for five years after the current five-year regulations expire at the end of this year. At issue are arguments about noise pollution, the impact of helicopters on mountain goats and other animals, access to public land on the ice field and, most recently, air safety. 
 That last issue arose on June 9, when a sightseeing helicopter belonging to Coastal Helicopters crashed on Herbert Glacier on the ice field, about 20 minutes north of Juneau, killing the pilot and all six passengers.
The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating, and so far the pilot does not appear to have violated any flight regulations. And while the crash is thought to have been the first of a sightseeing helicopter on an ice field (a tourist was killed when a helicopter collided with a small plane over Juneau last year), the accident has sharpened the underlying differences between environmentalists, who are adamant about preserving Alaska's remaining wilderness, and those who believe that the future of Juneau and other Alaskan cities depends to a large extent on tourism.
John Mazor, president of the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau, defends the proposed increase in helicopter landings as vital to the economic future of Juneau, the landlocked Alaska capital of 30,000 residents. "Ten years ago Juneau had twice as many government jobs as jobs in the private sector," he said, "while today there are about 9,200 private sector jobs and 6,100 government jobs." That turnabout, he said, is a result of shrinking oil reserves in Alaska, which forced cutbacks in government employment, and a rapidly expanding private-sector tourist industry.
"A decade ago we probably had 150,000 cruise ship passengers stop in Juneau during the summer," Mr. Mazor said. "Now it's about 590,000." Those visitors, who are in port for less than a day, account for most of the estimated $75 million annually that Juneau business earns from tourist expenditures at restaurants and stores, and on such tours as excursions to a fish hatchery or to Mendenhall Glacier -- and helicopter sightseeing. (They may soon account for even more of Juneau's revenue if the city adopts a head tax of $5 a passenger -- as it is expected to Oct. 5 -- in retaliation for the dumping of pollutants in Alaskan waters by the Royal Caribbean International cruise line.)
The briefest helicopter tour takes about 30 minutes, includes a landing on a glacier long enough for passengers to walk around, and costs about $125 a person. The 60- to 90-minute tours, which average $150 to $200 a person, stop at two glaciers; at each stop the pilot shuts the engine and leads passengers on a short walk.
Two helicopter companies combine glacier sightseeing with a half-hour dog-sled trip. One company drops off passengers, who trek across the ice field for an hour or two with a guide to a pickup point.
And the Forest Service has received requests for tours that feature ski planes, off-road vehicles, overnight trekking, hut-to-hut guided tours, cross-country skiing, snowmobiles, and a combination of float planes and helicopters -- as well as for tours of mining claims combined with glaciers.
Not surprisingly, the Sierra Club looks askance at any increase in helicopter landings or any opening of other areas of the Juneau ice field to aircraft.
"We want helicopter landings kept at their present levels," said Richard Hellard, who is chairman of the conservation committee of the Sierra Club in Alaska. "We're particularly concerned about quiet in the back country, because it destroys the wilderness experience that people are seeking. And what happens to our community by the constant roar of helicopters taking off and landing?"
The Sierra Club is not opposed to tourism, Mr. Hellard said, only unrestrained tourism. "We want a Juneau that 20 years from now is still a place where people want to visit, not a depleted wilderness reserve or a tourist trap."
Mr. Mazor wants the same things, he said, but doesn't want Juneau residents having to choose between eliminating essential city services, or -- in a state that has neither a sales tax nor income tax -- finding other income sources. "So it comes down to whether we can put up with four months of tourism, including helicopter flights, for the tremendous benefits we receive in return," he said.
Mr. Hellard does not fundamentally disagree. "But what we need to know, and what nobody's talking about, is, How much is enough? How much is too much?" he said. "So far, nobody on the other side's even raising those questions, much less trying to answer them."
This sounds auspicious. Gary Sinise is the archetypal 60's iconoclast, McMurphy, in this adaptation by Dale Wasserman of Ken Kesey's memorable novel about the inmates of a mental hospital, the evil nurse who doles out their medication and the free spirit who shows the patients the light.

MARTIN GUERRE
Four years after a lackluster West End opening -- and a long process of thinking, rethinking and replacing -- "Martin Guerre" the musical lands in New York. With a score by the "Les Miz" and "Miss Saigon" team of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, the show is the latest reimagining of the legend of Martin Guerre, the basis for the 1982 film "The Return of Martin Guerre." Cameron Mackintosh's production arrives with a new director (Conall Morrison) and choreographer (David Bolger) and with Hugh Panaro ("Side Show") as the mysterious Martin. Tentative opening, April 26. Theater to be announced.
 
WISE GUYS
One of the most eagerly anticipated events of the season. Stephen Sondheim's first new work on Broadway since the 1994 "Passion," the musical follows the lives of the Mizner brothers, Wilson and Addison, who wandered the cultural and financial landscape in the tradition of great American dreamers. Mr. Sondheim's score, and the book by John Weidman, are said to draw heavily on performing styles popularized by vaudeville. The British director Sam Mendes, whose revolutionary "Cabaret," still running at Studio 54, swept the 1998 Tonys, has been recruited, and Nathan Lane and Victor Garber will head the cast of a workshop version in November. A Broadway opening is expected on April 27 at a theater to be announced. (A related article is on page 2.)

HEADLINE: The Singer Solution To World Poverty

BYLINE: By Peter Singer

 BODY:
The Australian philosopher Peter Singer, who later this month begins teaching at Princeton University, is perhaps the world's most controversial ethicist. Many readers of his book "Animal Liberation" were moved to embrace vegetarianism, while others recoiled at Singer's attempt to place humans and animals on an even moral plane. Similarly, his argument that severely disabled infants should, in some cases, receive euthanasia has been praised as courageous by some -- and denounced by others, including anti-abortion activists, who have protested Singer's Princeton appointment.
Singer's penchant for provocation extends to more mundane matters, like everyday charity. A recent article about Singer in The New York Times revealed that the philosopher gives one-fifth of his income to famine-relief agencies. "From when I first saw pictures in newspapers of people starving, from when people asked you to donate some of your pocket money for collections at school," he mused, "I always thought, 'Why that much -- why not more?"'
Is it possible to quantify our charitable burden? In the following essay, Singer offers some unconventional thoughts about the ordinary American's obligations to the world's poor and suggests that even his own one-fifth standard may not be enough. 
 In the Brazilian film "Central Station," Dora is a retired schoolteacher who makes ends meet by sitting at the station writing letters for illiterate people. Suddenly she has an opportunity to pocket $1,000. All she has to do is persuade a homeless 9-year-old boy to follow her to an address she has been given. (She is told he will be adopted by wealthy foreigners.) She delivers the boy, gets the money, spends some of it on a television set and settles down to enjoy her new acquisition. Her neighbor spoils the fun, however, by telling her that the boy was too old to be adopted -- he will be killed and his organs sold for transplantation. Perhaps Dora knew this all along, but after her neighbor's plain speaking, she spends a troubled night. In the morning Dora resolves to take the boy back.
Suppose Dora had told her neighbor that it is a tough world, other people have nice new TV's too, and if selling the kid is the only way she can get one, well, he was only a street kid. She would then have become, in the eyes of the audience, a monster. She redeems herself only by being prepared to bear considerable risks to save the boy.
At the end of the movie, in cinemas in the affluent nations of the world, people who would have been quick to condemn Dora if she had not rescued the boy go home to places far more comfortable than her apartment. In fact, the average family in the United States spends almost one-third of its income on things that are no more necessary to them than Dora's new TV was to her. Going out to nice restaurants, buying new clothes because the old ones are no longer stylish, vacationing at beach resorts -- so much of our income is spent on things not essential to the preservation of our lives and health. Donated to one of a number of charitable agencies, that money could mean the difference between life and death for children in need.
All of which raises a question: In the end, what is the ethical distinction between a Brazilian who sells a homeless child to organ peddlers and an American who already has a TV and upgrades to a better one -- knowing that the money could be donated to an organization that would use it to save the lives of kids in need?
Of course, there are several differences between the two situations that could support different moral judgments about them. For one thing, to be able to consign a child to death when he is standing right in front of you takes a chilling kind of heartlessness; it is much easier to ignore an appeal for money to help children you will never meet. Yet for a utilitarian philosopher like myself -- that is, one who judges whether acts are right or wrong by their consequences -- if the upshot of the American's failure to donate the money is that one more kid dies on the streets of a Brazilian city, then it is, in some sense, just as bad as selling the kid to the organ peddlers. But one doesn't need to embrace my utilitarian ethic to see that, at the very least, there is a troubling incongruity in being so quick to condemn Dora for taking the child to the organ peddlers while, at the same time, not regarding the American consumer's behavior as raising a serious moral issue.
In his 1996 book, "Living High and Letting Die," the New York University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of money to help people who are hungry, malnourished or dying from easily treatable illnesses like diarrhea. Here's my paraphrase of one of these examples:
Bob is close to retirement. He has invested most of his savings in a very rare and valuable old car, a Bugatti, which he has not been able to insure. The Bugatti is his pride and joy. In addition to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car, Bob knows that its rising market value means that he will always be able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement. One day when Bob is out for a drive, he parks the Bugatti near the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track. As he does so, he sees that a runaway train, with no one aboard, is running down the railway track. Looking farther down the track, he sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the runaway train. He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of the danger, but he can throw a switch that will divert the train down the siding where his Bugatti is parked. Then nobody will be killed -- but the train will destroy his Bugatti. Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security it represents, Bob decides not to throw the switch. The child is killed. For many years to come, Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and the financial security it represents.
Bob's conduct, most of us will immediately respond, was gravely wrong. Unger agrees. But then he reminds us that we, too, have opportunities to save the lives of children. We can give to organizations like Unicef or Oxfam America. How much would we have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable diseases? (I do not believe that children are more worth saving than adults, but since no one can argue that children have brought their poverty on themselves, focusing on them simplifies the issues.) Unger called up some experts and used the information they provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of raising money, administrative expenses and the cost of delivering aid where it is most needed. By his calculation, $200 in donations would help a sickly 2-year-old transform into a healthy 6-year-old -- offering safe passage through childhood's most dangerous years. To show how practical philosophical argument can be, Unger even tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their credit card and calling one of these toll-free numbers: (800) 367-5437 for Unicef; (800) 693-2687 for Oxfam America.
Now you, too, have the information you need to save a child's life. How should you judge yourself if you don't do it? Think again about Bob and his Bugatti. Unlike Dora, Bob did not have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his own material comfort. The child was a complete stranger to him and too far away to relate to in an intimate, personal way. Unlike Dora, too, he did not mislead the child or initiate the chain of events imperiling him. In all these respects, Bob's situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to overseas aid and differs from Dora's situation.
If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child's life, then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed above. Unless, that is, there is some morally important difference between the two situations that I have overlooked.
Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really reach the people who need it? Nobody who knows the world of overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist. But Unger's figure of $200 to save a child's life was reached after he had made conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated that will actually reach its target.
One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to donate to overseas aid organizations but don't is that only Bob can save the child on the tracks, whereas there are hundreds of millions of people who can give $200 to overseas aid organizations. The problem is that most of them aren't doing it. Does this mean that it is all right for you not to do it?
Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars -- Carol, Dave, Emma, Fred and so on, down to Ziggy -- all in exactly the same situation as Bob, with their own siding and their own switch, all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own cherished car. Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same? To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse follow-the-crowd ethics -- the kind of ethics that led many Germans to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed. We do not excuse them because others were behaving no better.
We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line between Bob's situation and that of any reader of this article with $200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency. These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the unsuspecting child. In the light of this conclusion, I trust that many readers will reach for the phone and donate that $200. Perhaps you should do it before reading further.
Now that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who put their vintage cars ahead of a child's life, how about treating yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant? But wait. The money you will spend at the restaurant could also help save the lives of children overseas! True, you weren't planning to blow $200 tonight, but if you were to give up dining out just for one month, you would easily save that amount. And what is one month's dining out, compared to a child's life? There's the rub. Since there are a lot of desperately needy children in the world, there will always be another child whose life you could save for another $200. Are you therefore obliged to keep giving until you have nothing left? At what point can you stop?
Hypothetical examples can easily become farcical. Consider Bob. How far past losing the Bugatti should he go? Imagine that Bob had got his foot stuck in the track of the siding, and if he diverted the train, then before it rammed the car it would also amputate his big toe. Should he still throw the switch? What if it would amputate his foot? His entire leg?
As absurd as the Bugatti scenario gets when pushed to extremes, the point it raises is a serious one: only when the sacrifices become very significant indeed would most people be prepared to say that Bob does nothing wrong when he decides not to throw the switch. Of course, most people could be wrong; we can't decide moral issues by taking opinion polls. But consider for yourself the level of sacrifice that you would demand of Bob, and then think about how much money you would have to give away in order to make a sacrifice that is roughly equal to that. It's almost certainly much, much more than $200. For most middle-class Americans, it could easily be more like $200,000.
Isn't it counterproductive to ask people to do so much? Don't we run the risk that many will shrug their shoulders and say that morality, so conceived, is fine for saints but not for them? I accept that we are unlikely to see, in the near or even medium-term future, a world in which it is normal for wealthy Americans to give the bulk of their wealth to strangers. When it comes to praising or blaming people for what they do, we tend to use a standard that is relative to some conception of normal behavior. Comfortably off Americans who give, say, 10 percent of their income to overseas aid organizations are so far ahead of most of their equally comfortable fellow citizens that I wouldn't go out of my way to chastise them for not doing more. Nevertheless, they should be doing much more, and they are in no position to criticize Bob for failing to make the much greater sacrifice of his Bugatti.
At this point various objections may crop up. Someone may say: "If every citizen living in the affluent nations contributed his or her share I wouldn't have to make such a drastic sacrifice, because long before such levels were reached, the resources would have been there to save the lives of all those children dying from lack of food or medical care. So why should I give more than my fair share?" Another, related, objection is that the Government ought to increase its overseas aid allocations, since that would spread the burden more equitably across all taxpayers.
Yet the question of how much we ought to give is a matter to be decided in the real world -- and that, sadly, is a world in which we know that most people do not, and in the immediate future will not, give substantial amounts to overseas aid agencies. We know, too, that at least in the next year, the United States Government is not going to meet even the very modest Umited Nations-recommended target of 0.7 percent of gross national product; at the moment it lags far below that, at 0.09 percent, not even half of Japan's 0.22 percent or a tenth of Denmark's 0.97 percent. Thus, we know that the money we can give beyond that theoretical "fair share" is still going to save lives that would otherwise be lost. While the idea that no one need do more than his or her fair share is a powerful one, should it prevail if we know that others are not doing their fair share and that children will die preventable deaths unless we do more than our fair share? That would be taking fairness too far.
Thus, this ground for limiting how much we ought to give also fails. In the world as it is now, I can see no escape from the conclusion that each one of us with wealth surplus to his or her essential needs should be giving most of it to help people suffering from poverty so dire as to be life-threatening. That's right: I'm saying that you shouldn't buy that new car, take that cruise, redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit. After all, a $1,000 suit could save five children's lives.
So how does my philosophy break down in dollars and cents? An American household with an income of $50,000 spends around $30,000 annually on necessities, according to the Conference Board, a nonprofit economic research organization. Therefore, for a household bringing in $50,000 a year, donations to help the world's poor should be as close as possible to $20,000. The $30,000 required for necessities holds for higher incomes as well. So a household making $100,000 could cut a yearly check for $70,000. Again, the formula is simple: whatever money you're spending on luxuries, not necessities, should be given away.
Now, evolutionary psychologists tell us that human nature just isn't sufficiently altruistic to make it plausible that many people will sacrifice so much for strangers. On the facts of human nature, they might be right, but they would be wrong to draw a moral conclusion from those facts. If it is the case that we ought to do things that, predictably, most of us won't do, then let's face that fact head-on. Then, if we value the life of a child more than going to fancy restaurants, the next time we dine out we will know that we could have done something better with our money. If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous, well, then that is the way things are. If we don't do it, then we should at least know that we are failing to live a morally decent life -- not because it is good to wallow in guilt but because knowing where we should be going is the first step toward heading in that direction.
When Bob first grasped the dilemma that faced him as he stood by that railway switch, he must have thought how extraordinarily unlucky he was to be placed in a situation in which he must choose between the life of an innocent child and the sacrifice of most of his savings. But he was not unlucky at all. We are all in that situation.

Putting a Billboard in Every Wallet

BYLINE: By LOUISE KRAMER 

 BODY:
ADVERTISERS have discovered a hot new piece of New York City real estate: the four-and-a-half square inches on the back of a Metrocard. Within the next few weeks, most cards sold at subway stations will have ads on the back, many of them aimed at specific stops and riders. Riders who buy their fare cards in a station near a college, for example, will see a Citibank ad touting credit cards with lower interest rates for students.
The space has been available for nearly two years, but it only recently caught on. Last week stations along the No. 7 line to the U.S. Open were selling cards with American Express ads featuring famous tennis players. In Chinatown, ads will promote international phone cards, while stations at East Tremont Avenue and 174th Street in the Bronx will sell cards with ads from European American Bank, which has just opened two branches nearby. And Continental Airlines, which flies out of Newark, has bought the backs of Metrocards sold on the West Side of Manhattan. The thinking seems to be, East Siders are more likely to head to La Guardia or Kennedy Airports, so why waste money on them?
The Metrocard ads are part of a growing trend among advertisers trying to cut through the clutter of TV and radio commercials. Any blank space seems to be fair game, from the floor of a supermarket to the wall behind a urinal. "More and more, we're looking for nontraditional ways to reach our consumers," said Julia Jones, an executive at Deutsch, the advertising agency for the Snapple Beverage Corporation. In July, Snapple bought space on 100,000 cards to introduce its new Elements line of beverages, and used 200,000 more to crow about its existing brand in neighborhoods like Union Square and SoHo.
"It is nice for products with specific niche targets to be able to cherry-pick locations," Ms. Jones said.
The space on the fare cards has been available since October 1997. Once devoted to instructions on how to swipe at a turnstile, it is expected to bring in close to $1 million this year. "It's a growing part of our revenue mix," said Chris Boylan, deputy executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Instep Marketing, a Manhattan company that specializes in maps that can be folded to the size of credit cards, has the contract to administer the program. In some cases, the Metrocard ads are coordinated with those in subways, buses and stations.
"Things are clicking up very well," said Tim Kunhardt, Instep's marketing director. "Starting right about now, there essentially will be no more plain vanilla cards."
Companies pay $29,000 to buy the backs of 100,000 cards, he said, with volume discounts for larger orders. Typical orders are for 500,000 cards, and an order for one million costs about $170,000. The cards are stocked in the booths until they sell out, typically in about two weeks, and care is taken not to have rival businesses in nearby stations. About five million cards are sold throughout the system in a month; riders swipe them three million times a day.
Instep is able to provide advertisers with sales information for each station in the five boroughs, along with demographic information about the riders who live and work near them. While some companies blanket the entire city, others want to zero in on specific stops. To introduce a new catalogue, for example, Banana Republic chose stations near its stores and near its competitors. ABCNews.com selected stations in business areas where riders were thought to have a thirst for desktop news.
One of the prized stations is Grand Central Terminal, which sells some 31,000 Metrocards a week. "You've got a lot of volume," Mr. Kunhardt said. "You've got a lot of business commuters. You've got a lot of everything."
Most companies want Manhattan, and the stations in high-income neighborhoods on either side of Central Park have had waiting lists. There are no extra charges for the popular stations, and companies get their pick on a first-come-first-served basis.
The ads do get noticed, even though Metrocards spend most of their time hidden away in wallets, Mr. Kunhardt said. According to M.T.A. research, the average Metrocard is swiped 36 times. He said the cards have an advantage over other types of transit advertising.
"This is more intimate," he said. "The person holds on to this media form in their pocket. It has monetary value. It's a different matter than an outdoor billboard, where you're going to get a quick impression. This one you have a close relationship with."
The response to toll-free numbers on Metrocard ads has been as high as 5 percent, Instep says, well above the industry average of 2 percent.
"In direct marketing, anything above a 2 percent response rate is something to write home about to Mom," said Carol Krol, a senior editor at DM News, an industry trade publication. "A 5 percent response rate on a Metrocard, I would venture to say, is pretty good."
Since space is at a premium, most messages are simple, and many contain toll-free numbers and Internet addresses for riders to use later. The ads by American Express feature black and white photographs of tennis stars, and the dates they became card holders. Snapple's ad featured a tongue-twister the company hoped would amuse jaded riders: "Super savvy straphangers sip Snapple after stepping out of the subway station. Repeat 10 times fast."
Ms. Jones, the advertising executive, said the ad purposely did not tempt riders to open a Snapple on the train, since the M.T.A. prohibits drinking on subways and buses.
Chicago, San Francisco and Washington also sell advertising on their fare cards, but New York stands out because it has the greatest number of riders by far and the most extensive public transit system, Mr. Kunhardt said. In other cities, companies typically buy space for cards in the entire system, and for longer periods of time than in New York, he said.
So far there has been no consumer backlash, he added. "It's been accepted as a standard thing, just as there would be ads on the side of a bus."
One Manhattan rider, Jessica Valdez, said the ads did not bother her at all. In fact, she said, a Metrocard with a pitch from a phone company helped her pick a new long-distance service for her mother last month.
"We just had a Metrocard handy, and we called them," she said. "It's convenient to have the phone number on the back."

Chart: "THIS SUBWAY RIDE BROUGHT TO YOU BY..."
A space once used mainly for instructions on how to swipe a Metrocard is expected to bring in $1 million in advertising revenue this year. Some companies are aiming messages at specific neighborhoods and subway lines.
 
American Express, a sponsor of the U.S. Open in Forest Hills, began advertising last week on the backs of 300,000 Metrocards sold at stations along the No. 7 subway line in Queens and in high-income Manhattan neighborhoods. The ads feature tennis players (and card members) like the brothers Luke and Murphy Jensen.
 
Snapple bought space this summer on 100,000 cards sold at stations near colleges to advertise its new Elements line of beverages, and bought 200,000 more to promote its other drinks in neighborhoods like Union Square and SoHo.
 
In July, ABCNews.com took aim at stations where riders are believed to have a particular thirst for desktop news: the East and Eest Sides, from 66th to 86th Streets, Greenwich Village and the neighborhood around Union Square, where several interactive advertising agencies are located.
 
PT-1 Communications, which sells phone cards for international calls, has bought advertising on Metrocards sold in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, including Chinatown.
 
New York University advertised at Grand Central Terminal to draw adult students to its School of Continuing and Professional Studies on 42d Street.

To the Editor:
Vinca LaFleur is correct when she contends that the Clinton Administration and Sandy Berger, the national security adviser and Ms. LaFleur's former boss, have a vision of foreign policy that has created opportunities for American businesses around the world (letter, Aug. 29). But the idea that the policy has "lifted the lives of people abroad" and helped Russia manage its "historic transformation" is bewildering. 
 The Administration's promotion of economic reforms and trade liberalization has enriched American companies at the expense of most people in the developing world and Eastern Europe. With increasing impoverishment and expanding inequalities have come the destruction of local production and intensified alienation, social instability, debt and financial crises.

THE CELEBRATION CHRONICLES
Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Property Value in Disney's New Town
By Andrew Ross
Illustrated. 340 pages. Ballantine Books. $25.95.
Celebration, Fla. (ZIP code 34747), is an easy target for mouse-hating intellectuals, smug coop-dwelling Manhattanites and architects who still cling to the quaint notion that International Style-minimalism will save the world, despite itself. Celebration began with a gaudy made-for-television spectacle in November 1995, when the Walt Disney Company held a public lottery on the swampy site for the right to buy a house in a town that then existed only in an old Disney film, set in picket-fence America, some time back before things took a wrong turn in the national life. 
 Because the folks who brought us the theme parks were selling the lots, Disneyphiles everywhere assumed that Celebration would soon materialize in a cloud of pixie dust, perfect in every respect, clean, tidy and wholesome. On the other side of the plastic fencing, Disneyphobes were sure that this corporate excursion into the New Urbanism would end in artificiality, mindless nostalgia and a rigid social order imposed from above by bureaucrats wearing Mouseketeer hats. But, as things turned out, everybody was wrong.
The story of building and sustaining Celebration has been nicely told by Douglas Frantz, a national correspondent for The New York Times, and his wife, Catherine Collins, a freelance writer, in "Celebration, U.S.A.," a book that amounts to a firsthand investigative report on life this Central Florida community where Disney World tourists tend to view the inhabitants as so much clever robotic scenery (domesticated "pirates of the Caribbean," perhaps, minus the eye patches and peg legs).
In June 1997 the authors and their two younger children moved into a midprice home in Celebration and spent the next 16 months as pioneers, caught up in the struggle to make friends, get a neighbor's porch moved out of their side yard, find a place to buy a hammer and nails, and generally reconcile dreams with realities. The result is an intimate chronicle, full of real people facing debt, family hardship and disappointment in pursuit of a sense of community, harmony and well-being.
This strong feeling of being there is the element missing from Andrew Ross's recently published book "The Celebration Chronicles: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Property Value in Disney's New Town." Like Mr. Frantz and Ms. Collins, Mr. Ross moved to Celebration and did his research, but he lived alone, in a pricey rental overlooking the downtown shopping district, without a real stake in Celebration (a mortgage, for example), and his tone is detached, oracular. And given the importance of the architecture -- the layout and the building style that made the place so appealing -- his disinterest in the physical reality of the town cripples his analysis.
Celebration was planned as a New Urbanist town. The movement called New Urbanism posits that the car is the root cause of personal isolation and malaise: automobility creates urban sprawl and breeds, in the cul de sacs of sidewalkless suburbia, a terrible, destructive loneliness. By building houses close together, within walking distance of a sociable community center; by suppressing individualism in favor of a harmonious exterior finish for the town as a whole; by designing houses with big front porches to promote interaction with the street, planners hope to provide conditions favorable to the growth of genuine community.
From those same front porches neighbors can keep watch over one another. The official Disney-designed seal for Celebration shows a little girl on a bicycle zipping along a pretty tree-lined street in blessed safety, her ponytail streaming out behind her in the Florida sunshine.
But "good architecture couldn't make the town work," Mr. Frantz and Ms. Collins argue, despite the residents' fierce attachment to their brand-new, old-fashioned, porch-girdled houses. The typical "Disneyville" house comes in six styles, labeled Classical, Coastal, Colonial Revival, French Normandy, Mediterranean or Victorian. And within each style there are a variety of plans and prices and details. The overall effect, however, is consistent, cute and kind of gingerbready, as though all the houses on an ordinary street had dressed up for a masquerade.
Everything matches, thanks to a plan book that amounts to a Celebration bible, setting forth the permissible range of colors and curtains, plantings and porch furniture. This visual consistency is a strong selling point for the upscale houses, of course, but it is also an irritant: the "porch police" are apt to visit those with an un-communal taste for purple polka dots on their draperies. Because the look of Celebration cries out for dormers, the builders supplied them, but because dormer spaces don't fit into the plan of a contemporary American home, they are fake ones, with the windowpanes painted black.
Despite such garniture, the houses turned out not to be the issue in Celebration, although they were too expensive and often poorly constructed, and families stretched to the limit by monthly payments wondered if they would ever get their money out of what amounted to a risky investment. This concern was prompted by the highly publicized failure of other key parts of the Celebration master plan. Advance publicity had promised a school incorporating the best thinking of America's best educators, and an electronic infrastructure linking residents to one another and to the world.
As parents of school-age children, the authors were in an ideal position to chronicle the fierce and disruptive battles that broke out in the largely bookless model school, and the inability of the computer system to do much more than collect data on participating households. There was, from the outset, an odd disjunction among advanced educational theory, cutting-edge technology and cozy houses with porches and (ersatz) dormers.
Moms and dads who moved to Celebration in search of a half-remembered, utopian small town -- and the values attached to it -- were apt to be flummoxed by open classrooms that contained several age groups, teachers who looked like students and report cards without conventional grades.
In the end the best thing about Celebration was its frontier spirit: the determination of people who came there in search of community to create one, against all odds. Nothing stopped them, not leaky roofs; not a Potemkin-village downtown without a supermarket, a hairdresser or a video store; not bad press or carloads of tourists who believed that Celebration was a leftover set for "The Truman Show."
The lesson of this excellent book is that middle-class Americans want something different from the gated communities and the anonymous suburbs the contractors usually supply. They are hungry for Lake Wobegon with nice front porches, big kitchens and a decent hardware store within walking distance. Oh, and A's and B's on the children's report cards.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
Making Hay With 'Custom' Magazines

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Stacks of glossy publications compete for attention in the pane-glass vitrines of Universal News, a sprawling magazine emporium in Soho favored by the downtown intelligentsia. Wired and Vogue sit side by side in the front windows, sharing space with a new title: Sony Style, a quarterly that sells for $5.95 in the United States and $8.95 in Canada.
Sony Style? It is just one of a growing number of "custom published" magazines. While advertisers like Philip Morris, Mercedes-Benz and Starbucks used to push magazines to mention their products in the editorial pages, they have now adopted a more sophisticated approach, creating from scratch magazines in which they control the mix of feature articles and elaborate product placement. 
 Flip through the pages of Sony Style and the editorial feeling is that of a technophile's version of People magazine. There is a loving profile of the actress Jennifer Lopez, an interview with an up-and-coming Danish filmmaker, a page about the designer Diane von Furstenberg and her newest fashion accessory -- a vest designed to hold Sony electronic equipment. And what woman can go without a vest with a special pocket for her Memory Stick?
A few pages further into the magazine, there is an article about a Sony computer called the Vaio, which begins: "Sony designers express a product's power and potential through its form and detailing. Each product looks and feels unique, yet all share a family resemblance that says 'Sony' wherever they go."
Of course, saying Sony -- make that trumpeting Sony -- is what the magazine is all about. Call it custom publishing, relationship marketing or naked self-promotion, it all boils down to the same principle: a publisher like Time Warner's Time Inc. produces a magazine for a customer like Sony or Starbucks to use in its marketing program.
Custom-published magazines are either sold on newsstands, given out at stores or sent to a list of customers. The magazine publisher is almost without exception guaranteed a profit, because to the corporate sponsor, the magazine is a marketing tool intended for one purpose alone -- to reach the consumer -- and losses are counted as marketing expenses. In the words of one custom publisher, "the companies marketing the products lose money and the magazine publishers make money."
"That's why we like it," the publishing executive said.
And it has grown into big business for publishers. Custom publications generate $650 million in revenue for the magazine industry, according to a survey to be released this month by the Magazine Publishers of America. David Wilkofsky, chairman of Wilkofsky Gruen Associates, the consulting firm that conducted the survey, said the business had grown exponentially in the last five years.
"It's a relatively new industry that's arrived on the radar screen in the last five years," Mr. Wilkofsky said, adding that the economics of custom publishing are a welcome balm to magazine publishers. "When someone as big as Time Inc. goes into the business, it's another stream of revenue to add to the dozens of streams of revenue that company already has. The issue is not 'does this make money?' The issue is how major a profit center custom publishing is going to be."
And every major publisher is doing it, with varying degrees of editorial glasnost. For example, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, part of Lagardere Group and the publishers of George and Elle, produces Momentum, which is underwritten by Mercedes-Benz, owned by DaimlerChrysler A.G., and is clearly marked Mercedes on the cover. ("As the miles flew by," reads one travel article in the current issue, "I felt myself slipping into the first phase of our hedonists' holiday. Mercedes offers three special seat options on the S500, and our car has them all!")
But Hachette also publishes Unlimited, a seeming men's outdoor adventure magazine -- complete with articles about sports gear, surfing and mountain climbing -- that is paid for by the Philip Morris Companies and distributed to two million consumers on the Philip Morris data base. The only clue that Unlimited is produced by the cigarette maker is two tiny lines of type on the magazine's masthead that identify it as a Philip Morris publication.
Time Inc.'s custom publishing division produces Sony Style and Joe, a joint venture with Starbucks, a lavishly produced quasi-literary magazine that is sold for $2.95. A Time executive said Joe will actually lose money for the company this year. And its coffee connection is not readily visible, because there are, in fact, no articles about coffee. Instead, the second issue featured articles by James Salter (on flying), Frederick and Steven Barthelme (on gambling) and Dusko Doder (on Yugoslavia).
Time has been in the custom publishing business for four years, and the company policy is "to keep a very low profile," said Tim Hildebrand, president of Time Inc. Custom Publishing. The division publishes magazines for about 18 clients, Mr. Hildebrand said, but he declined to name them. "There is no upside to telling my competition what we're doing, and how we are doing it," he said.
Time produces other custom publications for the Ford Motor Company's Jaguar division and the Dayton Hudson Corporation's Target chain of discount stores, as well as one called S that is distributed in 200 shopping malls owned by Simon Debartolo Group Inc.
The Meredith Corporation publishes dozens of custom titles, from Mature Outlook (with Sears, Roebuck & Company) and You & Your Dog (with the Iams Company) to Bond, a publication of the Lutheran Brotherhood that is distributed to three million households. Christopher M. Little, the president of the Meredith Publishing Group, said all the magazines are profitable. "The advertiser or marketing company has a very clear idea of who they are trying to reach and what sort of message they want to deliver and they are not thinking in terms of a true consumer magazine that they would charge people for," Mr. Little said. "They are trying to get their message to a targeted audience, and that's the value."
As for Sony Style, Howard Stringer, president of the Sony Corporation of America, said he expected his new quarterly to sell as well as any consumer magazine.
"Sony is not just about hardware anymore," Mr. Stringer said. "It's about life and culture. What better way to let consumers know that than through a magazine?"

HEADLINE: Misbegotten Charter Revisions

 BODY:
From the moment he unveiled it in June, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to revise the New York City Charter has come across as a cynical exercise in power politics designed primarily to change the law governing succession at City Hall should Mr. Giuliani leave office before the end of his term. After heated criticism, the Charter Revision Commission has now postponed the implementation of that plan. But its final product remains a hodgepodge of marginal, meaningless or ill-advised proposals that ought to be rejected by voters.
A case can be made for changing the succession rules. But making a major change now, without extensive discussion among voters or the City Council or State Legislature, is premature. 
 Other proposals to be presented to the voters are equally ill advised. One charter revision would limit year-to-year increases in city spending to the inflation rate, while another would require a two-thirds vote of the City Council for any tax increase. These proposals would hamper the city's flexibility to deal with financial emergencies.
Even worse is a proposal requiring that nearly half of any future surplus be used to prepay debt service costs in future years. This proposal could actually foster a longstanding budget gimmick employed by Mr. Giuliani -- using extra revenues in one year to help close budget gaps in the next year or two. It makes more sense to use budget windfalls to retire long-term debt outright or pay for capital expenses, like a family using a bonus to pay down a mortgage or buy a house. As written, the charter proposal would discourage these more prudent options.
Most of the other proposals would codify existing arrangements in the charter. Several existing city units, like the Commission on Human Rights, the Children's Services Administration and the Office of Immigrant Affairs, would become part of the city's charter, as opposed to the administrative code, a nearly meaningless change.
Merging several departments that deal with mental health and health might make sense, but so far Mr. Giuliani has failed to persuade the City Council of the wisdom of this idea. Setting up a new organized crime control commission, establishing "gun free" school safety zones and streamlining the city's procurement procedures also sound like good ideas. But Mr. Giuliani should at least first try to get these approved by the normal legislative route before trying to change the charter by referendum.
This entire exercise has suffered from the bad faith that surrounded its inception. There are some worthy proposals here, but voters will not be able to pick and choose among the 14 proposals they are given. They will have to vote the entire package up or down. That is no way to change the city's charter.

HEADLINE: Internet Wars

 BODY:
With each new technological advance, the Internet beckons as a rich and competitive playing field for business, communication and entertainment. One of the most promising recent innovations is high-speed Internet access through upgraded cable television lines. Before long, these lines are expected to offer a nearly limitless variety of television programs, movies, music, face-to-face telephones, commercial transactions and other interactive services.
But that lucrative prospect has produced a battle royal in cyberspace. It revolves around AT&T's acquisition of major cable systems as well as its big stake in Excite@Home, an Internet service provider that would give AT&T customers access to the World Wide Web. The fear is that by controlling both the cable and the avenue to the Internet, AT&T can dictate where users can go and what to buy. 
 The alarms are understandable. America Online, with more than 18 million customers, has joined with other Internet companies and consumer groups to warn that they all could get shut out if AT&T gains an Internet stranglehold, or be forced to pay high fees to AT&T to reach potential customers. Similar concerns have been raised over Time Warner's plans for its cable lines.
The critics want the Federal Communications Commission to require AT&T and Time Warner to grant equal access to America Online and other companies that provide Internet services. For now, the commission has demurred, and rightly so. As William Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, has said, it seems premature to impose rules on cable Internet access to head off a problem that does not yet exist in a market that has not yet developed. The F.C.C. is also right to try to block localities from imposing restrictions.
Whether consumers will have a choice other than cable monopolies like AT&T and Time Warner will depend on the emergence of other high-speed technologies. Local telephone companies have begun to upgrade their service with a technology known as digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L., which could compete with cable. They may not have acted so quickly if it were not for the threat of AT&T and Time Warner. Satellite and wireless communications might also provide consumers with another way to tap into the Internet. America Online points out that these alternatives to cable are only in formative stages. But the interest of consumers is served by letting all these technologies develop and taking regulatory action only if they fail to provide adequate competition.
The Internet's future and its prosperity clearly depend on the principle of maintaining open access for all competitors. This principle has led the Justice Department to block Microsoft from using its operating system monopoly to force consumers to use its browser as the sole means to surf the Web. With 130 million users around the world, the Internet is driving a major part of the American economy. The question now becomes whether cable systems, which are inherently monopolistic enterprises that traditionally belong to the companies that built and paid for them, become so dominant that they will restrict consumer choices in getting news, watching programs or buying products.
In monitoring AT&T and Time Warner as they venture more and more into cable Internet services, the F.C.C. should not let down its guard. Even though cable systems are not now regulated, as telephone lines are, the F.C.C. should insure competition and open access in the future. For now, it is best for the F.C.C. to wait and see how the new world unfolds before trying to set rigid rules for it. But if AT&T and Time Warner do not exercise some self-restraint and act like good citizens, allowing fair access for America Online and other Internet service providers with a legitimate service to offer, they will find themselves subjected to demands for regulation by the F.C.C. and local communities. It is in their interest to preserve the open spirit of the Internet.

HEADLINE: Libya's Maverick Leader, 30 Years in Power, Makes a Bid for Respectability

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Muammar el-Qaddafi's Libya turned 30 this week, and a spree of congratulations here has been intensified by a conviction, at least in some quarters, that the leader may finally have outgrown his bad-boy past.
From all across Africa, where Colonel Qaddafi's Government once meddled so famously, other heads of state are on their way to Tripoli for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of African Unity that is to begin on Monday, timed in his honor to coincide with the anniversary celebrations. 
 Among those who have already paid tribute was King Abdullah of Jordan, whose father, King Hussein, could never abide the Libyan leader. King Abdullah's visit last Wednesday came on the anniversary of the date that King Idris I of Libya was toppled -- Sept. 1, 1969 -- in a coup led by a 27-year-old Colonel Qaddafi, who replaced him as Libya's leader.
The annual ceremonies to commemorate that revolution have always been triumphal, with the capital covered in the trademark Libyan green, on pennants and posters and innumerable tiny lights. But even compared to a year ago, the backdrop this time is not at all usual.
Thanks to a deal struck in July, Libya enjoys full diplomatic relations with Britain -- a country that suffered from Libyan terrorism -- for the first time in 15 years. Thanks to another struck in April, it has been freed from the bind of United Nations sanctions that, among other things, had since 1992 rendered its "international airport" international only in name.
And the fresh flow of potential investors now arriving on direct flights from European capitals is seen by the hopeful here and outside Libya as a tangible symbol that an end to Libya's isolation is at hand.
Colonel Qaddafi is best known in the West as a serial troublemaker, with the defiance and unreality of a perpetual youth. But lately he has tried to encourage a fresh look, with acts and comments that some believe reflects additional maturity.
"The guy has grown up," said a Tripoli-based Arab diplomat. "He tried everything when he was young, but he's 57 now, and he's made up his mind. In the next millennium, he wants to present a new Libya."
Last month, for example, Colonel Qaddafi told African journalists that he in fact shared an aspiration, voiced by President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who said that people were eager to see something new from the Libyan leader.
"The world knows Muammar Qaddafi as the leader of the world revolution, which is contributing to the liberation of peoples," the Libyan leader said that President Obasanjo had told him. "And now that the liberation stage has ended, the world wants to know Muammar Qaddafi as the leader of peace and development in Africa and other countries."
"In fact, I hope that Muammar Qaddafi meets this description," the Libyan leader added.
Colonel Qaddafi remains eccentric; at most international gatherings, he usually stays apart, in a tent. But many African leaders -- like President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Idriss Deby of Chad, who were helped greatly by Colonel Qaddafi in their own revolutionary days -- now seem to see him as a force for stability.
These days, Colonel Qaddafi is hardly a picture of youth. He hobbles on an aluminum cane that he acquired last summer after he broke a thigh under circumstances that have not been fully explained. His skin looks puffy and wrinkled. Still, most observers say his firm grip on power remains undiminished.
And, with his flowing dark hair and striking features, he retains his rugged glamour. For public appearances this week, his outfits included a double-breasted white blazer, traditional Arab robes, and a dashing white linen suit that he wore for a speech to foreign investors.
Yet even as he tries to promote a new image, he sometimes reverts to old patterns. In front of the gathering of investors, he accused the United States of promoting "a satanic policy" by using economic sanctions for political purposes. He then went on to claim that the International Monetary Fund was "controlled by the Zionists," and complained that if Libya wanted to obtain a World Bank loan, it would be necessary to "go first to Tel Aviv."
Despite such lapses, most foreign observers here say they are nevertheless convinced that Colonel Qaddafi is fully committed to better behavior. And while it is not easy to gauge public opinion, the changes of the last few months have clearly made many Libyans more hopeful.
For many, the most important change, which came with the suspension of United Nations sanctions, is the fact that Libyans can once again travel abroad without enduring an arduous journey by car or ship. And, as they recognize, foreigners have begun to do the same.
"The best thing is that it will allow tourists and businessmen to come, and that means more jobs," said Latif Abdelsaid, a 24-year-old computer technician who works in a Government ministry.
Of course, Colonel Qaddafi's long record of political and economic mismanagement means that many skeptics remain. In Libya, which is Africa's richest country on a per capita basis, many people remain poor, and some grumble over what they say has been Colonel Qaddafi's longstanding disinclination to pay attention to problems at home. The most bold among them say they are waiting now to see results.
"Now the excuse for the bad economic situation is over," said a 40-year-old accountant who would give only his first name, Abdelsalem. "We can't blame the sanctions anymore."
Among foreign countries, the main skeptic, of course, is still the United States, and its grounds are Libya's long record of support for terrorism, particularly as practiced by radical Palestinian groups. Together with Britain, the United States supported the plan to suspend United Nations sanctions on Libya after a deal was struck to try the suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
But now the Clinton Administration stands as the main obstacle to a Security Council decision to lift those sanctions altogether. Beyond that, the Administration has left in place tough unilateral sanctions against Libya, some of which date back to 1978.
They include a comprehensive trade embargo imposed in April 1986, at a time when American outrage over Libya's sponsorship of terrorism led to bombing raids on, among other targets, Colonel Qadaffi's house and was said by Libyans to have killed one of his daughters.
The United States has said those sanctions will not be lifted until Libya can demonstrate that it has renounced terror "in word and deed." For now, Libya still appears on the State Department's list of international sponsors of terrorism.
European countries, struck by the new softening in Libya's old intransigence, have proven far more willing than the United States to give Colonel Qaddafi the benefit of the doubt.
A general consensus among observers here holds that after seven years of United Nations sanctions, Colonel Qaddafi decided that defiance was no longer sustainable. Not only did the sanctions cut off air links to Libya, they also banned the import of aircraft parts, weapons, and equipment needed for oil production.
Although Libya has succeeded in maintaining oil production at undiminished levels, the cost to the Libyan economy has been estimated at $24 billion, and the incalculable cost to popular morale may have been greater.
"I think probably Qaddafi himself recognizes that he might have made some mistakes," said a Western ambassador here. "But the past is the past, and now they want to move quickly into a different future."
In the Lockerbie case, the Libyan leader agreed to surrender the two suspects only after the United States and Britain first bent to his demand that the trial of the two men, said by Western officials to be Libyan intelligence officers, take place in a third country. The trial is now expected to begin next year in the Netherlands, and Colonel Qaddafi's Government is obligated under the Security Council resolution that suspended the sanctions to cooperate with prosecutors.
In two other notorious cases, Colonel Qaddafi has quietly moved closer to accepting some responsibility. In one, involving the 1989 bombing of a French UTA airliner over Africa, the Libyan Government in July transferred $31 million to France to compensate relatives of 170 people killed in the attack. But Colonel Qaddafi specified in a recent interview that the move should not be construed as an admission of guilt.
It came after Libya cooperated in a French investigation that led to the conviction of six Libyans for their role in the attack, including Abduallah Senoussi, Colonel Qaddafi's brother-in-law and top security aide.
Libya always refused to surrender the defendants to the French court, so the trial was held in their absence. All of the men were sentenced to life in prison, but French officials have little expectation that any will spend even a day behind bars. Even so President Jacques Chirac of France proclaimed at a conference of French diplomats last month that France and Libya had turned past "a dark page."
In the second case, Libya has now explicitly accepted responsibility for the 1984 killing of a British policewoman, Yvonne Fletcher, by shots fired from the Libyan Embassy in St. James Square in London. That step, also taken in July, was the one that prompted Britain to restore diplomatic relations, which were severed at the time of the incident.
Now, for first time in 15 years, there is officially a British Embassy in Tripoli, although the old quarters have not yet been restored, and diplomats are working from lower-profile quarters established previously on the grounds of the Italian Embassy.
One effect of all those moves, taken together, is that rarely a week goes by in which Colonel Qaddafi is not visited by a foreign head of state trying to make up for lost time after the long ban on international air flights. Another can be measured in the crush of foreign delegations that have descended on Tripoli. Some 30 have been from Italy alone, others have come from Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and countless private firms.
Still, few here expect any investment boom soon. Colonel Qaddafi's Government has issued scores of new contracts, but it has not signed any of them yet; it is not known for swift decision-making. Investors remain wary too, particularly of the fact that the United Nations sanctions could technically be renewed at any time.
Libya has held talks with British Aerospace on a multi-billion dollar deal to acquire new aircraft for its debilitated commercial fleet and rebuild the country's crumbling airports. But some observers say that what Libya would prefer to persuade the United States to join in the new embrace.
In the minds of some Libyans, it would also mark a true end to the bad old days. "Things have been going downward for a long time," said a storekeeper who would give his name only as Mohammed. "The politics are too complicated for me to understand, but things were better when the Americans were around."

HEADLINE: In America;
The Baker's Slice

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
If you listen too long to the rhetoric you could begin to think we've stepped into some kind of economic nirvana. Things are going well, and maybe it is nirvana for the lucky ones at the top. But the economic reality for middle-class American families is somewhat more modest.
A new study by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington shows that middle-class workers are only slightly better off now than they were 10 years ago. 
 Make no mistake, these are good times. Tight labor markets, increases in the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit have helped low-wage workers. Unemployment over all is very low. And the C.E.O.'s and others at the very top have more money than they know what to do with.
But at $44,468, the annual income for the median American family (using the latest available data, adjusted for inflation) is less than $300 above where it was in 1989.
The men in that group are actually doing a bit worse than 10 years ago. The institute noted that "despite gains over the past 2 1/2 years, the inflation-adjusted hourly wages of middle-wage men were 1.8 percent lower in 1999 than in 1989, the previous business cycle peak."
Nirvana, that ain't. What we are seeing is that the families right in the middle are struggling, as always, to make ends meet. "Though middle-wage women workers have fared better than their male counterparts, by the middle of 1999 the median female worker's wage was only 3.4 percent above its 1989 level," the report said.
That is not much of a raise over 10 years. The families faced with constant worries about mortgages and the costs of education and health care may well be wondering what all the celebrating is about.
The authors of the report said: "The booming economy has thus far failed to lift the economic prospects of middle-class workers beyond where they were before the last recession. Despite their substantial contribution to the growing economy, wages for these workers have been stagnant or declining, manufacturing jobs are disappearing at an accelerating rate, and the share of non-college educated workers with employer-provided health coverage has declined."
To make ends meet, middle-income wage earners, men and women, have been working more and more. The report found that "the typical married-couple family with children put in 256 more hours of work -- six additional full-time weeks --than it did in 1989."
And yet even as the number of hours on the job has increased, the benefits -- particularly health benefits -- have declined. Sixty-two percent of the work force in the U.S. are individuals with a high school diploma and perhaps some college, but not a college degree. The report found that "the share of high school educated workers with employer-sponsored health insurance coverage fell from 72.1 percent in 1989 to 69.5 percent in 1997. For those working full time, year-round, the share with health insurance through their own employer fell by 5.3 percentage points between 1989 and 1997, from 66 to 60.7 percent."
Jared Bernstein is a labor economist with the Economic Policy Institute and one of the authors of the report. In an interview, he said: "We, as much as anyone, have made positive noises about the last few years. But if you look at the business cycle over the last 10 years, you will see that despite some positive results in the most recent years, folks are just about back where they started. And that's not the most impressive economic result I can think of."
What has happened is that the wages of middle-class workers have trailed the growth in labor productivity in the U.S.
Said Mr. Bernstein: "When productivity is increasing on average, and workers at the middle of the wage scale -- who certainly make a non-trivial contribution to that growth -- when their wages are not keeping up with it, that's evidence of an unfair distribution of economic growth. And if it's not going to the middle, we know it's been going disproportionately to the top.
"I like to look at it this way: If the pie is growing faster, then the bakers of the pie ought to get a bigger slice."
For the folks in the middle to really get beyond where they were in the late 80's, the economic recovery will have to continue at approximately the same pace for another few years. You might mention that to Alan Greenspan if you see him.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Amid Political Cynicism, Standing Steadfast in Her Faith

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SERVING in Washington in the 1990's has sorely taxed the faith of Alexis M. Herman, the Labor Secretary and one of the few remaining survivors of every blessed day of the Clinton Administration.
She has endured a nasty confirmation battle, the embarrassment of President Clinton's dalliance with an intern and a little-noticed but continuing investigation by an independent counsel. The Republican-led Congress has nickel-and-dimed her agency's requests for increases in spending for job-training programs and other labor initiatives. And she is tempted at times to give up on politics in an age of cynicism and the poisoning of public discourse. 
 Yet her faith abides, rooted in the teachings of her father, an early advocate of voting rights for blacks in her native Alabama who once was dragged from his car and beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan as his 5-year-old daughter looked on.
Ms. Herman said she still remembered the heft of the pearl-handled pistol that her father handed her before the attack, instructing her to use it if any of the Klansmen threatened her.
But Ms. Herman, in a conversation late last week over lunch, did not want to dwell on that day 47 years ago. It was part of the upbringing that ignited her lifelong devotion to Democratic politics and minority rights and that landed her in the 24-by-36-foot corner office at the Labor Department with a commanding view of the Capitol.
Her devotion has been shaken in recent years, but never to the point of apostasy.
"It does cause me to go back and remember the early days and the path I took to get here," she said over a plate of cold sliced turkey and overcooked green beans in the private study off her huge ceremonial office. "I try not to be distracted by the cynicism and the negative climate in politics today."
An observant Roman Catholic since childhood, Ms. Herman begins each meal with grace ("Bless us, O Lord, for all of our gifts and for these we are about to receive.") and fluently recites her favorite Biblical passage, from the Book of Proverbs ("Lean not unto thine own understanding but in all ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths."). Prominently displayed on a side table in her office is a photograph of the Labor Secretary with her pastoral and political shepherds, Pope John Paul II and Bill Clinton.
Steeped in Southern gentility -- she takes four bites to finish a single cherry -- Ms. Herman is enduringly gracious and reluctant to talk about her personal life. She has never been married, except to her work, and finds relaxation in hiking, biking and reading. She entertains her friends and her large extended family with "old-style Southern cuisine," including about a half-dozen versions of her signature dish, red beans and rice.
Ms. Herman is at once earnest and glib. A friend once called her "the queen of schmooze."
She did not want to talk about the inquiry by an independent counsel ordered in May 1998 by Attorney General Janet Reno, to resolve accusations of influence-peddling and conflict of interest. Investigators are looking into her role in a series of White House fund-raising coffees in 1995 and 1996 as well as her private business dealings in the 1980's when she was a consultant on affirmative action and minority business contracts.
She would discuss the investigation only off the record, and only then to express bewilderment at the charges and to profess ignorance of the inquiry's progress.
Her lawyer, W. Neil Eggleston, would say only, "It's not taking up too much of my time and almost none of the Secretary's."
Neither Ms. Herman nor Mr. Eggleston would estimate how much the investigation has cost her in legal fees, but the final bill will almost certainly be in the six figures.
Calls to the office of the independent counsel, Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., a lawyer from Maine, were not returned.
MS. HERMAN has spent almost her entire career engaged in the struggles of working women and minorities.
Her first job after graduating from Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans was with Catholic Charities in Pascagoula, Miss., lobbying the shipyard to give apprenticeships to unskilled black workers. In the 1970's, she lent her dresses to black women applying for office jobs. She served as director of the Women's Bureau at the Labor Department during the Carter Administration. And she worked on the Presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988 before joining the Democratic National Committee in 1989 as deputy director under Ron Brown.
She was on the Presidential transition team in 1992 and in the White House as director of the office of public liaison through Mr. Clinton's first term. She was nominated for the Labor post in January 1997 and was confirmed four months later after a bitter struggle with Congress over the same issues that ultimately led to the appointment of an independent counsel.
The position of Labor Secretary -- she is the first black woman to hold the job -- has given her an enviable platform to address issues that have animated her all her life: the rights of workers in the United States and overseas, the difficulty balancing work and family, job programs for disadvantaged youth, the transition to a technology-driven economy.
She listed as her priorities for her remaining months in office an expansion of the Administration's welfare-to-work programs, additional help for unskilled workers and passage of the President's health care bill of rights.
On l'affaire Lewinsky, Ms. Herman toed the company line: She was "disappointed" in the President's behavior but never doubted his ability to lead the nation or the sincerity of his contrition.
"The President made a mistake and he told us he made a mistake," Ms. Herman said, the smooth smile never fading. "I was raised in a faith and a tradition of a forgiving gospel."

HEADLINE: A Homeless Organ Donor Gets Help

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
An unemployed woman who donated a kidney to a young boy but was left homeless when she was evicted from a public housing project in Alexandria, Va., has been offered her own place to live.
The woman, Marian Neal, has been staying in a shelter for the homeless since she was kicked out of the housing project, where she had been staying in a friend's apartment. Managers of the project said that Ms. Neal's presence violated the friend's lease and that a complaint had been filed. 
 But on Friday, after Ms. Neal's ordeal had been widely publicized in Washington, Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said his department would lease Ms. Neal a recently renovated one-bedroom town house in Washington. The rent will be based on her income, which Ms. Neal said made the town house affordable.
"She was a heroine who should be treated decently," Mr. Cuomo was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.
William Dearman, executive director of the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority, which runs the housing project on the edge of Alexandria's Old Town neighborhood, said he had been unfairly cast as the heavy because he had evicted Ms. Neal. But he defended his actions.
"I think it's a great thing that she did," Mr. Dearman said, "donating a kidney to this kid. But, you know, we have rules in this world."
Ms. Neal said she had no hard feelings for whoever turned her in.
"We pray for them," she said. "We feel no anger."
People who have met Ms. Neal, 40, say they come away impressed by her spirituality and her stoicism, which actually masks a sharp sense of public relations. That has helped her collect donations, but she is still living in Carpenter's Shelter, a place for the homeless in Alexandria, a Washington suburb.
"Marian has done most of her own publicity on this," said Frances Becker, executive director of Carpenter's Shelter.
There have been news features on three of Washington's four major television stations. When a Washington radio station, WRQX, told of the eviction of a woman who had donated a kidney, listeners called in pledges of $5,000.
On Wednesday, Ms. Neal sat in the living room of her friend's apartment and talked about her decision to donate her kidney last year to Terrance Varner, now 8, who lives in the Old Town neighborhood.
She said she began helping Terrance's grandmother take care of him last year by taking the boy, who suffered from renal failure, to dialysis treatments three times a week. Terrance was on a long waiting list for a new kidney.
When Ms. Neal learned that none of Terrance's family members were suitable kidney donors, she offered one of hers. Even though they were not related, she was found to be a close match. The transplant was a success, and Terrance is doing well, Ms. Neal said.
Bob Spieldenner, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va., said that of the 4,038 kidneys donated by living donors last year just 163, or 4 percent, were from people unrelated to the recipients by either blood or marriage.
Ms. Neal is from Philadelphia, where she worked in hospitals as a housekeeper and then sorted packages for Federal Express. She said she had to stop working in 1994 because of a degenerative back disease that has forced her to use a cane to get around.
Asked why she was not receiving Social Security disability payments, Ms. Neal said she was appealing a decision in which her application for benefits had been rejected.
"It's all right," she said when asked whether she harbored any ill feelings toward the person who had made that decision. "Everything that happens in life, it's all for the good of the Lord."
The decision meant that she was forced to live on the $210 a month that she received from the city welfare agency in Alexandria and $120 a month in food stamps, which led her to move into the tiny, well-kept apartment of Patrice Hall, whom she describes as "my sister in Christ."
This summer, Ms. Neal and Ms. Hall provided Bible study, tutoring and arts and crafts for the children in the housing project, Ms. Neal said.
Mr. Dearman of the housing authority said that he had offered to allow Ms. Hall to sign a new lease with Ms. Neal as the official co-tenant but that she had declined. As a result, Ms. Neal had to go to the bottom of a list of applicants for public housing in the city and turn to the homeless shelter.
"There are 60 people on the waiting list ahead of her," Mr. Dearman said. "Some of them are homeless. Would it be right to put her ahead because she is a kidney donor? Sometimes there are hard decisions that have to be made."

HEADLINE: Prime Minister Says Russia Is Cooperating in Corruption Probe, but Discounts Significance

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said tonight that Russian law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation into a suspected money laundering scheme involving Russian money at the Bank of New York, and asserted that the sums involved were far less than the billions of dollars reported.
"The scope described in the press -- huge billions -- obviously doesn't correspond to reality but I repeat, the problem exists and we will work on it, without dramatizing it but without ignoring it," he said in a television interview. 
 The Russian Government has been accused of playing down the significance of an investigation into at least $4.2 billion transferred over the last 18 months to accounts at the Bank of New York in what American investigators have called a scheme involving money illegally taken out of Russia.
Appearing on a news show on ORT, the largest television station, Mr. Putin, a former chief of Russia's domestic intelligence service, acknowledged that illegal capital flight out of the depleted economy is a serious problem. But he echoed the view of several top officials that the ongoing investigation involving Bank of New York has become a "campaign," fueled by election year politics in both the United States and in Russia.
While Mr. Putin appeared on one television program tonight, former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov appeared on a rival show on NTV, an independent television station, where for the first time he accused members of President Boris N. Yeltsin's inner circle of conspiring to remove him from office last May.
"I think the cause was that some people in the circle close to the president supplied him with wrong information about me and the Government," said Mr. Primakov, who has returned to politics as head of a coalition that could mount a presidential campaign next year.
As attacks against Mr. Yeltsin's small group of advisers gathered steam, Mr. Putin dodged an interviewer's question about a scandal that has reached into the Kremlin itself, touching one of Mr. Yeltsin's longest-serving aides and members of his own family.
According to several investigators, an ongoing probe into alleged kickbacks paid to Kremlin officials by Mabatex, a Swiss-based company that landed a lucrative Kremlin reconstruction contract, is focusing on suspects including members of the Yeltsin family, in particular his two daughters, Yelena Okulova and Tatyana Dyachenko.
An article published in an Italian newspaper on Saturday reported that Pavel P. Borodin, head of the Kremlin's property management office since 1993, was one of three signatories on a Swiss bank account opened by Mabatex in March 1995. The newspaper also said that Russian investigators believe that two other bank accounts, opened in the names of two of Mr. Borodin's deputies, codenamed "Cinderella" and "Tsarina," were put at the disposal of the two Yeltsin daughters.
The Kremlin last week denied that any members of the Yeltsin family held bank accounts abroad.
But the charges have already entered Russia's highly charged political arena, where Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, a Yeltsin foe and a leader of the newly formed political coalition, openly challenged Mr. Yeltsin and his family to come forward with a full accounting of credit card and bank accounts held abroad.
Charges of corruption are expected to fly fast and furious as the struggle for power intensifies with parliamentary elections in December and presidential elections next summer.
The report in Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading newspaper, largely corroborated a report published in July in Vestiya, a Russian investigative newspaper, that Mr. Borodin was one of three names listed on an account at the Gotthard Bank, which showed about $3 million in separate transactions. The other signatories were Mr. Borodin's daughter, Yekaterina Siletskaya, and Behgjet Pacolli, president of Mabatex.
Members of the Borodin family were among the 24 names of Russian officials -- many of them connected to Mr. Borodin's Kremlin department -- which Swiss prosecutors, at the behest of Russian prosecutors, circulated among Swiss banks this summer seeking information on secret bank accounts.
Mr. Borodin has repeatedly denied having his own Swiss bank account, although he has said that Mabatex paid his expenses on trips to Europe for the Kremlin renovation. Mr. Pacolli has said that his firm had opened a bank account to pay those expenses, but that other money -- including $1 million transferred to a Budapest bank in 1995 -- had been sent through the account by mistake.
Mr. Putin said tonight that the case was still under investigation but suggested that evidence in the press could have been manipulated.
"An account can be opened in your name very easily, and then it is possible to say that you have it," he said. "Then this account may be made bigger and you will be asked: where did you get the money? These are technologies that are well known."
Some newspapers have reported that credit card bills showing charges made by Mr. Yeltsin and his family were found during a search of Mabatex offices by Swiss authorities in January.
Asked if he thought Mr. Yeltsin might have ever used a credit card, Mr. Putin said with a half-smile, "Not likely."

HEADLINE: Jackson Recalls When Jews And Blacks Marched as One

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
His voice was all weary and worn out. But the church was hushed, and it was time to talk, time to resurrect the details of history -- those crucial moments during the great struggles of a fading century when blacks and Jews fought together for the same causes.
In a robe of green so luminous that he seemed to shimmer in yesterday's milky morning light, the Rev. Jesse Jackson recalled Jewish lawyers who joined with Thurgood Marshall to defeat segregation. He recalled black soldiers who liberated Jews from German death camps. He recalled blacks and Jews who joined forces to pass anti-lynching laws, to fight for labor rights. 
 "As the century ends, what should we tell our children?" he had asked at the outset of his sermon at Riverside Church in Morningside Heights. Near the end of his remarks, he answered the question. "Tell them," he said in a tremulous voice, "haters will lose."
When he was finished, hundreds of worshipers -- black and white -- stood and gave him an ovation. Some wiped away tears. Mr. Jackson simply beamed and raised his hand in appreciation.
Though he never mentioned Khallid Abdul Muhammad by name, Mr. Jackson clearly meant to remind New Yorkers of the bonds between blacks and Jews, bonds tested in the last few weeks by Mr. Muhammad's daily displays of anti-Semitism.
Again on Saturday, during his second annual Million Youth March in Harlem, Mr. Muhammad punctuated his demands for black separatism by portraying whites in general, and Jews in particular, as the mortal enemies of black people.
Mr. Jackson, speaking with reporters after his sermon, suggested that the sparse crowd at Saturday's rally showed that the great majority of blacks had rejected Mr. Muhammad's views and his leadership. But while Mr. Jackson condemned Mr. Muhammad for inciting hatred with his inflammatory words, he also called Mr. Muhammad a "voice of alienation and despair," and he argued that people should be more offended by "the realities" of economic distress that have helped to produce such voices.
Citing crumbling schools, abuses by the police and the failure of Wall Street to invest in places like Harlem, Mr. Jackson said, "So long as there is alienation and pain, there will be voices of alienation and pain."
Mr. Jackson is no stranger to the relationship between blacks and Jews in this country. In 1984, during his Presidential campaign, Mr. Jackson referred to Jews as "Hymies" and to New York as "Hymietown," for which he subsequently apologized. In the years since, Mr. Jackson has made several efforts to solidify relations between blacks and Jews.
In 1988, speaking at a Jersey City memorial for Holocaust victims, he called for "the sons and daughters of the Holocaust" to find common ground "with the grandsons and granddaughters of slavery." In 1992, he assisted in arranging for a documentary film about black G.I.'s who liberated a German concentration camp to be shown at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Two years later, after the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith bought newspaper advertisements to publicize Mr. Muhammad's anti-Semitic speeches, Mr. Jackson quickly denounced the remarks.
Mr. Jackson said yesterday that he may try to visit Iran on behalf of 13 Iranian Jews facing death sentences as alleged spies for Israel. "So long as those Jews are threatened with death, it creates great pain," Mr. Jackson said.
But beyond their differing views toward Jews, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Muhammad offer distinctly different visions for the future of blacks in the United States. Mr. Muhammad insistently calls for blacks to disengage from whites at all levels. On Saturday, for example, he urged blacks to form separate schools and separate "people's militias." He recommended that blacks not marry whites, and he criticized "white imperialistic corporations" for trying to invest in Harlem.
Mr. Jackson, by contrast, argued yesterday for blacks to finish the job of integration, saying that the effort to end segregation had led to huge economic and political gains for blacks as they made inroads into once forbidden spheres of life.
Referring again to the "details of history," Mr. Jackson recalled yesterday how Lena Horne could not sit in the seats of the whites-only theaters where she once entertained, and how Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. could not get a haircut from the Capitol Hill barber. And yet now, decades later, Mr. Jackson said, Tiger Woods is the world's best golfer, Colin Powell is a widely respected former military leader, and black executives run major companies across the country.
"We have hills to climb," Mr. Jackson said, "but mountains behind us."
He said the most important fault lines in America today divide the country not by race, but along economic and educational lines. To overcome what he described as an "opportunity gap," it seems only natural for blacks and Jews, given their history of shared scars, to again join forces.
"We have a century of struggle together," he said.

HEADLINE: A Treat for Women: Cheering Women

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
"Did you ever think you'd live to see the day," asked Sharon, an insurance adjustor, of her friend, Peg, "when a women's bar would be showing sports?"
Usually, women go to Rubyfruit, a bar in Greenwich Village, for a drink or two with friends. But yesterday afternoon, Rubyfruit turned into a sports bar, complete with screaming, groans and waving arms, as women settled in for the uncommon pleasure of watching women versus women in a nationally televised event: the New York Liberty facing the Houston Comets for the Women's National Basketball Association championship. 
 By rights, the Liberty should not have played yesterday. The Comets, the favorite by far, were 0.4 seconds away from victory on Saturday night in Houston when Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon sank a near-miraculous half-court shot, winning the game by a point and creating a sliver of basketball history.
So spirits were high yesterday for the last game of the best-of-three series.
"I practiced screaming for today," said one woman, who said she watched a tape of Weatherspoon's play late Saturday night and early Sunday morning.
The fans proved to be serious yellers. Every time Liberty scored a point, they screamed and jumped. Every time a player fell, they cried out. Every time the ball balanced suspensefully on the rim, they shrieked. And they laughed. The sounds were those of women having a good time.
The fans cramming the cozy bar, many in T-shirts with Liberty logos, included rank novices: "Basically, I'm like, if our team has the ball and it goes in, it's good," one said.
There were many who had been high school players, watching intently. A few had brought newcomers to the game, and were explaining the fine points. Michelle Roun, 28, a technical recruiter, went to her first basketball game at Madison Square Garden earlier this season and, she said, was immediately hooked.
"It was brand new," she said. "It was real. I was, 'Oh my God, this is exciting!' I started jumping! Now I know their names. That shot by Teresa last night was just a miracle."
Jody Rajcula, 42, a college coach, said she used to play professional basketball herself, as a forward with the defunct Women's Basketball League. She said she played with the Chicago Hustle and the New England Gulls in the early 1980's, making all of $11,000.
"We were pioneers, the first professionals," said Ms. Rajcula, now a coach at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury. "This is a dream of mine, basketball as a women's game. Little girls running around with Liberty T-shirts."
Sharon, the insurance adjustor, who spoke on condition that her last name was not used, was one of many women who played on high school teams. "I loved it," she said. She follows the Knicks sporadically, she said. But she is loyal to Liberty.
"It's a personal thing," she said. "It belongs to you -- more than the Knicks.
Many women over 40 said they would have liked to have played sports in high school. But the schools did not have girls' teams. Some said they were even discouraged from playing after-school pick-up games.
"I was supposed to be doing home economics," said Sunny Toscano, a painter in her 50's who was wearing a Liberty T-shirt. "I used to sneak over to the gym instead."
Ann, 52, a saleswoman who used to play pick-up ball after school said: "I follow the Knicks. But I like to see women have a league. We deserve a league. We're good players."
A lone male, sitting with a group of women who play after work on an amateur team, seemed to be the only spectator startled by the roughness of the female professionals. Ernesto Cano, a Fort Lauderdale hairdresser, expressed dismay at the pushiness and competitiveness of players. "I've never seen this side of women before," he said.
In the end, the miracle was not repeated. The Liberty lost, 59 to 47. The crowd grew quieter, but not depressed. "They played great, they deserved it," said Sharon, graciously giving the Comets their due.
Christa Kirby, 32, an actress who works in a law firm, said Liberty should have tried harder. "But it's great to be here," she said. "Instead of being in a men's sport bar, it's great in here with women, watching a women's team."

HEADLINE: New Race But Old Walk On the Beach For Bradley

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: SPRING LAKE, N.J., Sept. 5

 BODY:
The storm-whipped winds had been lashing the beach all day today, driving dark clouds before them, roiling the surf and forcing summer's last vacationers out of the water when former Senator Bill Bradley stepped onto the boardwalk for an afternoon of handshaking.
Call it dumb luck, or call it a good omen, as Mr. Bradley did. But at that very moment, the sun broke through the clouds in this town south of Asbury Park, briefly warming the small crowd that had gathered in their tank tops, swimsuits and sandals to welcome Mr. Bradley on his annual Labor Day political pilgrimage to the beach. 
 But this was no ordinary beach walk for Mr. Bradley -- who has done this nostalgia-laced event for 19 of the last 21 years -- and so the weather was more welcome than ever. For Mr. Bradley is running for the Democratic nomination for President, and today's stroll was a kickoff of sorts for his national campaign. (He will make another kickoff in his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., later this week.)
Although the day did not quite have the feel of a major Presidential event, it was quite a bit more intense than Mr. Bradley's past laid-back Labor Day visits to the shore.
The clutch of more than 20 reporters tailing him was the largest ever, his aides said, and included television crews from Britain. Instead of his usual small coterie of aides, he brought several car loads this year. And the beachgoers' enthusiasm for their favorite-son Presidential candidate seemed louder than in past years.
"Take a french fry, Bill," shouted Gloria Hennessy, 64, from Point Pleasant, N.J. "You're the best. You're going to the White House."
Asked later why she liked Mr. Bradley, who represented New Jersey in the United States Senate for three terms and still lives in Montclair, Ms. Hennessy said, "He's honest and he played basketball."
But if things around him seemed somehow different than in past years, Mr. Bradley looked and acted every bit the same. As he has on all his beach walks, he wore the sort of informal clothes he did 30 years ago, when he was playing professional basketball for the New York Knicks: forest green shorts, size-13 Adidas sneakers and orange-and-blue socks that were falling around his ankles from the moment he stepped out of his car.
And if Mr. Bradley was charged up about kicking off his campaign, he did his best to hide it. He just wandered up to people, offered his hand without introducing himself, asked a question or two, and then ambled on. He did not kiss any babies, except his own grandchildren, and did not ask anyone to vote for him.
His aides referred to his Labor Day shore visits as "walking focus groups" that allowed him to hear the common complaints of common folk. But today, surrounded by cameras and boom microphones, the conversations tended to skirt national policy and sounded a bit more like this:
Mr. Bradley, to a boy carrying a huge Winnie the Pooh bear: "You win that?"
"Yeah."
"What'd you do to win that?"
"Shot water into the hole."
"Shot the water in the hole, eh?"
For most people, even Republicans, that was enough. They lined up for his signature and the chance to be photographed standing next to the candidate, a Hall of Famer as a professional basketball player. More than a few asked him to sign dollar bills -- his nickname with the Knicks was "Dollar Bill" -- but Mr. Bradley dutifully declined, citing Federal laws against defacing currency.
They included Tom McHugh, 53, of Pearl River, N.Y., a registered Republican who is quite sure he will not be voting for Mr. Bradley. But he asked for a signature anyway. "I'm a fan of his," Mr. McHugh said. As a politician or a basketball player? "As a celebrity," he replied.
But Doris Meyer, 62, a registered Republican from Caldwell, N.J., said she was certain she would vote for Mr. Bradley, provided, of course, that he gets through the Democratic primary, which she cannot vote in.
"He's very natural," said Ms. Meyer. "He doesn't come across as a snob."
Of course, there were those who had no idea what all the commotion was about. Parents could be heard telling young children that the tall man was once a famous basketball player. One man said, "There's Gov. Bill Bradley."
And then there was Maria Jimenez, 27, from Westchester County, N.Y., who had the excited look of someone who just received a free handout at the mall after meeting Mr. Bradley, telling a friend, "Whoever he was, I shook his hand."
There were a few questions to be answered, mainly from reporters. At a brief news conference along the arcade in Point Pleasant a few miles to the south, Mr. Bradley was asked by an English reporter about those "dogging questions" concerning his being too vague about his agenda.
Mr. Bradley replied that he had already offered detailed proposals to require registration of handguns and to revamp campaign finance laws, and would soon be releasing more on health care, the economy and preserving people's pensions. "I don't feel dogged," he said, adding, "I feel like we're going out and telling the people what I believe and what I want to do and who I am and where I came from."
Mr. Bradley also said he felt that President Clinton should not have offered conditional clemency to 16 members of a violent Puerto Rican independence group, a move that has puzzled and angered Republicans as well as some Democrats.
Asked to identify the major differences between himself and Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Bradley said Mr. Gore did not seem willing to support far-reaching gun restrictions and changes to campaign finance laws. He also questioned the depth of Mr. Gore's support for teaching evolution in schools.
And then there was the issue of style. "I'm having more fun," Mr. Bradley asserted. "I like being out with the people."

HEADLINE: Just Published: Minutiae Without Meaning

BYLINE: By Stanley Fish; Stanley Fish is the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois, Chicago. His most recent book is "The Trouble With Principle."

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Although biographies are a staple in bookstores and a favorite of reviewers, I confess that I rarely pick one up and almost never finish it when I do. Beginning a biography always makes me queasy, and queasiness turns into something close to a feeling of illness by the time I reach the third sentence.
The first sentence is usually O.K. It goes something like this: "On the fifth of May, 1879, in a small town in Ohio, John Smith was born to Aaron and Sarah Smith in the main house of their family farm." 
 Nothing much to quarrel with there, but nothing much to hold a reader's interest either. Interest is supposed to be supplied by the second sentence, which might be, "It was a year of drought, and the collapse of farm prices seemed imminent." Or, "Memories of the Civil War were still strong, and quarrels between partisans often erupted in the inns and ale-houses of southern Ohio."
It is with this second sentence, no matter what it is, that a gap opens up and a question is implied. What connects the first and second sentences? What is the relationship between the birth of John Smith and the imminent collapse of farm prices or post-Civil War tensions or anything else?
Presumably the gap will be filled or at least begin to be filled by the third sentence, but in fact the third sentence only widens the gap. When it arrives you realize that it could have been almost anything. "Little did little John know . . . " Or, "Only years later would it become clear . . . " Or, "Meanwhile, in another part of the country . . . "
And if the third sentence could be almost anything, so could the fourth and the fifth, and on and on, with nothing stopping the spiral sprawl of unconvincing speculation except the occasional sentence that, in its solidity and flatness, reminds you of the first: "John Smith married Betsy Jones in the fall of 1901." Or, "On Dec. 10, 1944, he was hit by lightning and died immediately."
It's the stuff in between that's the problem. You know what it's supposed to do -- it's supposed to supply the explanatory structure that links and gives depth to the bare recital of dated events -- but all it really does is call attention to the stretch and strain of conceptual bridges that are not connecting, bridges made up of psychology, economics, military analysis, astrology, whatever.
The falseness of it all is overwhelming, and you begin to be embarrassed at the spectacle of a biographer who knows so much and is trying so hard, but who can deliver only transitions that creak and analyses that you don't believe for a minute.
It wasn't always that way. Once upon a time, biographers didn't have to invent connections because they came ready made in the form of master narrative models. The two most durable were the providential model (everyone lives out the pattern of mistakes bequeathed to us by the original sin of Adam and Eve) and the wheel of fortune model (every life worth chronicling is an example of the general rule that what goes up must come down).
The great advantage of these models was that they supplied in advance the meanings modern-day biographers desperately seek in letters, medical records, the names of boyhood sleds, anything. In an age like ours, when master narratives have little or no credibility, meaning is supposed to just well up spontaneously from the details biographers obsessively collect. But details unattached to a master story don't mean anything in particular, or can mean anything at all. Which is why the biographer is compelled to invent or fabricate a meaning by riding his or her favorite hobbyhorse until every inch of the subject's life is covered by some reassuring pattern of cause and effect.
Cause and effect took care of themselves when you knew before you began that the life you were narrating would end up illustrating a general truth familiar to everyone. But when general truths have been foresworn, the biographer is left with little more than a collection of random incidents, and the only truth being told is the truth of contingency, of events succeeding one another in a universe of accident and chance.
The honest thing for a biographer to do in this situation would be to give up cause and effect and just go with contingency. But cause and effect are the biographer's very stock in trade, and contingency is what no self-respecting biographer can allow to stand; it must be pushed away and replaced with an explanatory structure, any explanatory structure.
The only exceptions to this general rule (and the only kind of biography I can endure) are the biographies of film stars and other celebrities, a subgenre that does quite nicely even when explanations are either absent or weak.
The reason is that contingency and accident are pretty much the content of celebrity lives. First, there is the accident of "the discovery" (in a drugstore or a chorus line, on the beach or on the street), followed, after false starts and failures, by the accident of the "big break," followed by the even bigger accident of the "role of a lifetime" (turned down by Lana Turner or Clark Gable), followed -- not inevitably, but often -- by the accident of the "decline and fall" (Fatty Arbuckle, Elvis Presley, Ernest Hemingway), followed by the most glorious accident of all, the "comeback" (Frank Sinatra, John Travolta, Judy Garland, Marv Albert).
There are a few variations on the basic formula -- the accident of a life cut off in its prime (James Dean, John Lennon, Princess Di and almost any country-and-western singer who ever boarded a plane), the accident, often in dispute and mysterious, of suicide (Marilyn Monroe, Kurt Cobain), the accident of heroically overcoming an accident (Christopher Reeve, Ann-Margret, Montgomery Clift, George Jones).
But these are just variations on contingency, and since by definition the contingent is what defies explanation, readers and viewers will not be disappointed if the explanatory structure is missing. Indeed, whenever A&E's "Biography" interrupts its rehearsal of improbable successes and failures to indulge in a fit of explanation, the effort is so obviously halfhearted and pathetic -- "Meanwhile, their marriage was unraveling" or "Meanwhile, the public turned away from that form of entertainment" -- that you are not even tempted to take it seriously.
My criticism of biography does not hold for autobiography. It makes none of the claims made for biography and is therefore not subject to any of the criticisms. You cannot fault the author of an autobiography for failing to be objective, or for substituting his story for the story of his subject.
He is his subject, and his performance, complete with the quirks and blindnesses of his personality, is not a distraction or deviation from the story of his life but an extension of it. Autobiographers cannot lie because anything they say, however mendacious, is the truth about themselves, whether they know it or not. Autobiographers are authentic necessarily and without effort.
Biographers, on the other hand, can only be inauthentic, can only get it wrong, can only lie, can only substitute their own story for the story of their announced subject. (Biographers are all autobiographers, although the pretensions of their enterprise won't allow them to admit it or even see it.)
Biography, in short, is a bad game, and the wonder is that so many are playing it and that so many others are watching it and spending time that might be better spent on more edifying spectacles like politics and professional wrestling.

HEADLINE: The Policy Behind the Exodus of Russian Money

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You are right to suspect that a large exodus of capital from Russia has occurred, but you forget the central role of economic policy in accounting for that outflow ("The Russian Money Trail," editorial, Aug. 31). 
 Until August 1998, Russian companies were not legally barred from holding money abroad. If a Russian businessman profited from buying products like precious metals locally at controlled prices and then exporting them at market prices, the profits could have been held abroad.
Since August 1998, exporters have been required to return foreign earnings within 90 days, and importers must deposit the full value of imports in rubles with the Central Bank of Russia until the imports cross the border.
So the continuing outflow of capital has taken the classic route: Russian exporters get an invoice from a foreign company understating their exports and importers get an invoice from a foreign partner overstating their imports. They stash away the differences in foreign banks, violating Russian rather than foreign laws.

HEADLINE: When the Market Pops

 BODY:

To the Editor:
One's confidence doesn't increase on hearing that the Federal Reserve has commissioned a study on how to handle the dangers of soaring stock prices from two academics whose thinking it already knew and agreed with (Business Day, Aug. 31). 
 As Charles P. Kindleberger, an economist, has pointed out, if the market knows a lender of last resort can be counted on to come to the rescue, risky or imprudent behavior may follow. The old savings and loan industry and twentysomethings that still live at home are two good examples.
Many seem confident that the rapidly inflating United States real estate market (and the spending that flows from it) couldn't possibly be a bubble that might burst, because it would never approach the insanity of the ruined Japanese market. To admit to bubbles only when they reach the levels of Japanese real estate or Dutch tulip bulbs is to ignore a large amount of important economic history.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Relivin' The Fun Life In Some Pop Showdowns

BYLINE: By ANN POWERS 

 BODY:
As autumn creeps into the air, a critic's thoughts turn reflective. Recent history offers insight into our current obsessions. What was the song of the summer? The singles that blare forth from car radios or boom boxes in parks and at the beach are the catcalls of a nation baring its collective skin. With the pop scene in a giddy, fast-moving mood, such quickly fading shout-outs seem more resonant than usual.
Offered here, in the hopes of causing some entertaining arguments among pop aficionados, is a ringside view of this summer's tournament of hits. 

'LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA' VS. 'BAILAMOS' -- The ballyhooed Latin music explosion was really just an overdue acknowledgment of America's bilingual reality, a point reinforced by the return of Carlos Santana, whose music has been explosively Latin for decades. But the media's largely clueless coverage did not diminish the enormous fun of Ricky Martin's crazy song, propelled by a rocking salsa beat and scrumptiously silly lyrics, delivered by the former teen-age pinup with appropriate sarcasm.
"Bailamos," by Enrique Iglesias (son of Julio Iglesias, himself a formidable adult pinup), is subtler and more insinuating while fulfilling its share of spicy south-of-the-border cliches. Still, the knockout punch takes the match. Winner: "Livin' la Vida Loca."
 
'IF YOU HAD MY LOVE' VS. 'GENIE IN A BOTTLE' -- The actress and singer Jennifer Lopez is also a contender in the Latin category, but her seductive whisper has more in common with the coy teasing of the former Mickey Mouse Club member Christina Aguilera than with Mr. Martin's confident bluster. Both the romantic come-on offered by Ms. Lopez and the titillating maybe whispered by Ms. Aguilera creep under the sheets fully clothed, generating sexy but ultimately modest fantasies. The difference between them is a matter of better beats and a real voice, both the property of Ms. Aguilera. Winner: "Genie in a Bottle."
 
 'BILLS, BILLS, BILLS' VS. 'UNPRETTY' -- Today's most interesting popular conversations about feminism are taking place on the rhythm-and-blues charts. TLC's slap in the face of freeloading guys, "No Scrubs," set the tone last spring. Another girl group, Destiny's Child, addresses women's economic anxieties in an earthier and more heartfelt manner in "Bills, Bills, Bills." These songs earned the ultimate hip-hop tribute: answer songs, both by the gold-digging male group Sporty Thieves. But the surprise champion in the round robin of empathetic girl talk is "Unpretty," an effervescent meditation on the beauty myth, in which the gamines of TLC confront the damage done to women by the very materialism the singers blithely embraced in "No Scrubs." Winner: "Unpretty."
 
 'BEAUTIFUL STRANGER' VS. 'AMERICAN WOMAN' -- Getting sick of Austin Powers was a popular pastime this season, as the bucktoothed sleuth played by Mike Myers grinned through endless promotions for "The Spy Who Shagged Me." These two singles from the movie's soundtrack kept everyone doing the tie-in twist.
The video for "Beautiful Stranger" featured Madonna crawling all over a befuddled Austin, while the Lenny Kravitz remake of the Guess Who classic showed Mr. Myers's co-star Heather Graham frugging atop a bus. As for the songs, Mr. Kravitz capably tore the original to pieces, while Madonna offered a swooning love ballad with a subtext about the hype that such hits help generate. "You're everywhere I go," sang the head of Maverick Records, who released the soundtrack, to her cash cow. No kidding. Winner: "Beautiful Stranger."
 
'WILD WILD WEST' VS. 'JAMBOREE' AND 'JIGGA' -- Hip-hop shout-alongs are a summer staple. The rapper and movie star Will Smith followed up his irresistible "Miami" with a site-specific song that did better than the cyber-Western it promoted. (What's next? A hip-hop "Blue Hawaii"?) Naughty by Nature returned to form with an anthem best heard at a picnic. And hip-hop's smoothest foul mouth, Jay-Z, collaborated with the Ruff Ryders crew to augment his list of chart-toppers based around lyrical hooks that get censored on most radio stations. Titillated teen-agers nationwide filled in the blanks. Winner: "Jigga."
 
 'ALL STAR' VS. 'SOMEDAY,' 'SCAR TISSUE' AND 'LAST KISS' -- Every summer hit by an even slightly seasoned alternative-rock group jovially took on the genre's faded status, and the devil-may-care made for fine pop. Smashmouth and Sugar Ray defied the odds of a sophomore slump with perky, ska-tinged reflections on the one-hit wonder status they ended up avoiding. The Red Hot Chili Peppers reminisced on a life of troublemaking in a tune as peacefully desolate as a desert sunset. And Pearl Jam, covering a 1964 teen-age car-crash saga, transformed it into a sly nod to the dramatic burnout of grunge, the subculture this classic rock band steered to the top. Winner: "Last Kiss."
 
'WHAT'S MY AGE AGAIN?' VS. 'MY OWN WORST ENEMY' -- As their immediate elders pondered extinction, punk-inspired brats examined their own growth spurts. Mark Hoppus of the gleefully obscene Blink 182 poked fun at his gender's propensity for juvenile behavior in a song that had him whining like Dennis the Menace getting his ear pulled.
A. Jay Popoff of Lit moaned about being so irritating that his girlfriend makes him sleep in the car. Both songs are more honest than they probably were meant to be, but Blink 182 wisely sticks with jokes, while Lit gets stuck in faux sincerity. Winner: "What's My Age Again?"
 
 'BAWITDABA' AND 'COWBOY' VS. 'NOOKIE' -- Call it the new hard rock, or just call it bothersome. The willfully offensive mix of hip-hop, metal and head-banging hard core beloved by an ascendant generation of white rap fans is not going back into its corner. Those who like at least a little panache from their obnoxious rock stars can take comfort in Kid Rock.
This Detroit-based journeyman understands that he can sneak into a black-owned musical genre not simply because he's skilled, but because he lucked upon the right historical moment. So he rocks with dedication, raps with humor and plays up the unlikelihood of such a skinny goofball making it big. Either of his two singles, the one with the nonsense word for a title and the one in which he makes out like a horse-riding bandit, easily bests Limp Bizkit's nasty ditty about hating girl germs. Winner: "Cowboy" and "Bawitdaba."
 
 'THE HARDEST THING' AND 'I DO' VS. 'SUMMER GIRLS' -- While America's young men holler along with Kid Rock, their younger sisters are busy squealing for much hunkier pop stars. A few teen-age--oriented "boy bands" bridge this gender divide by looking enough like football heros to inspire today's body-conscious male youth; 98 Degrees generates macho well-being while crooning devotion to female fans. The group's one-two punch this summer started with a poignant song about two-timing, then resolved that moral dilemma with an old-fashioned walk down the aisle.
Yet the graceful 98 Degrees can't top the lion cubs of LFO. These three dudes know what they like (girls who shop at Abercrombie & Fitch) and what they don't (Chinese food). And as they drawl out these preferences in a loping rap, they sound just like the high school seniors who prevail in every fight. Winner: "Summer Girls."
 
 'STEAL MY SUNSHINE' VS. 'I WANT IT THAT WAY' -- The greatest summer singles are like modern-day nursery rhymes, going beyond the moments they reflect into the realm of pure pleasure. Only two this summer reached the level of inspired frivolity defined by "Tutti Frutti" and "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."
The first, by the Canadian group Len, relies on a girlishly sung hook that warms the skin like the very rays of light it describes. But it's the only line in this very wordy song that makes sense. The lyrics seem to be about the hangover Len's leader, Marc Costanza, had when he wrote it, and it expertly captures the pleasantly fuzzy feeling of the morning after a very enjoyable night.
Len might have been the summer's victor, if not for pop's unstoppable force, the Backstreet Boys. The latest smash by these dream dates is an overwhelmingly earnest love ballad, of course, but one without a shred of lucidity. "I never want to hear you say, I want it that way," the boys beg, but they never specify what "it" might be, or exactly which way someone might or might not want it.
The music sweeps forward, delicate and soulful; the words might have been computer-generated. Yet everywhere Americans went this summer, in sports arenas and concert halls, in malls and parking lots, they sang along with the Backstreet Boys, deeply feeling those nebulous emotions that only coalesce within the strange language of pop. Winner and overall champion: "I Want It That Way."

HEADLINE: A Lull in Art Sales? Well, Not Anymore;
New Collectors Are Changing the Market

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Like Broadway, baseball and big-game hunting, the art trade has always had a season. It began in mid-September, rose to heights each fall and again each spring, then tailed off at the end of June, when rich collectors headed for a summer of leisure at their country homes.
"August," said Arnold Glimcher, the chairman of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, "was a time when you could pull in the sidewalk, and some galleries would even close for the whole month." Certainly, big-name dealers left town, leaving skeleton crews in charge of their galleries. 
 But not last year, and especially not this year. "It's been insanity this summer; our business has not let up at all," Mr. Glimcher said, still working one day in mid-August and willing to reel off sales of major works by Rothko, de Kooning and Lichtenstein.
Dealers all over Manhattan related similar experiences. And Nancy Rosen, an art adviser who makes regular visits to Chelsea, SoHo, midtown and uptown to look at all kinds of art, witnessed the same thing. "I go to galleries all the time, and this summer they're not empty," she said. "Almost all the dealers I know have said they've had more activity this summer than they've ever had before."
For the last few years, art dealers and auction houses have gloried in the exuberant economy and the ever-ascending stock market, which have created many multimillionaires and billionaires eager to plow their excess cash into paintings, sculpture and decorative art. People like Michael Dell from the high-tech sector, Robert D. Soros from the investment world and Gwyneth Paltrow and Leonardo DiCaprio from the entertainment industry have all been bitten by the collecting bug.
Now these new collectors, along with many executives and entrepreneurs who began collecting in the 1980's and have since grown richer, are so strong in number and buying power that they are changing the art world. For a start, the business, which once followed the rhythms of the carriage trade, is instead moving to the beat of Wall Street. That means that art buying has become a year-round activity, and lazy Augusts are a thing of the past, even when dealers do go on vacation.
"I was on the phone every single day for work," said Jennifer Vorbach, a partner at C&M Arts, about her two recent weeks in the Hamptons. "These were significant pieces of business wanting to happen, and the business had to go on no matter where I was." C&M's August sales included a major Warhol painting, a Rothko painting and a Cornell box.
"With mobile phones and the Internet, I don't think business stops anymore," agreed Rachel Kaminsky, the director of Otto Naumann Ltd., an Old Masters dealer that also had visits in August from collectors she called significant.
Diana D. Brooks, who as the chief executive of Sotheby's sees a lot of collectors, new and old, is not the least bit surprised by the gallery activity. "The new collectors are people who work 12 months a year, and if they work 12 months a year, they want to buy art 12 months a year," she said.
So far neither Sotheby's nor its archrival, Christie's, is holding sales in New York during the summer. But both auction houses, concerned that the big sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in New York and London are bunched too closely in November-December and May-June, are considering spreading the sales more evenly throughout the year. They are also counting on Internet sales to cater to people who simply must buy between auctions.
Besides buoyant sales, dealers and auction houses alike are seeing a second effect of the influx of new money: their business is more volatile. Ms. Brooks said that when she joined Sotheby's 20 years ago, she was told the art market did not follow the stock market. Then, in the 80's, the art market was said to lag the stock market by a couple of years. "Now we track the stock market much more closely," she said, "and we have more ups and downs."
"When the stock market was off its record highs for six or eight weeks earlier this year, it had an impact," she added. "Even in that short period of time it had an impact psychologically. Those ups and downs affect people who are willing to spend $500,000 or $1 million or $5 million on a picture."
Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's in the Americas, who used to make a strong case that the art market rose and fell in fairly predictable cycles lasting about seven years, said he had long since given up that theory. "We're a full nine years into this cycle," he said, thanks to the prosperity of the 90's.
This newfound dependence on the whims of the stock exchanges is widely acknowledged. "Why are you calling me?" asked one dealer when queried about the market outlook. "You ought to be interviewing Alan Greenspan."
With Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve so far keeping their cool, the art world is counting on a strong fall. Although it is early for announcements, Sotheby's, for example, said it would offer a Cezanne still life, "A Stoneware Pitcher," estimated at $18 million to $25 million, and Monet's landscape with his wife, "In the Meadow," estimated at $15 million to $20 million, both from private collections. Christie's has a van Gogh, "The Bridge at Trinquetaille," from the estate of Akram Ojjeh, which has an unpublished estimate said to be $20 million.
In the galleries, Pace Wildenstein will have new work from the estate of Saul Steinberg, while Alexander and Bonin, Luhring Augustine and others will have shows by Young British Artists featured in the "Sensation" exhibition that opens at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in October.
But that is a small sampling, since the new collectors' tastes are broad. While many of those with megadollars to spend do want trophies by Impressionists and 20th-century masters, many more, with smaller budgets, seem to be interested in contemporary art, especially the youngest collectors. "They focus more on the highly publicized sectors, to young artists they have heard about," said Francesca Guglielmino, the business head of Citibank's Art Advisory Service.
Just how beholden the art market is to the new class of collectors is difficult to say, although some dealers say they are posting record sales. Many more say they are having their best year since the market peak of 1989-90, when vigorous buying from Japan sent prices for even mediocre art to unprecedented highs. But dealers, as private businesses, do not report their sales as public companies do.
Yet signs that the art business is strong are everywhere. At the auction houses, for example, combined North American sales of Christie's and Sotheby's climbed from $1.68 billion during the 1996-97 season (from July 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997) to almost $2.15 billion in the year ended June 30, 1999. That is an increase of nearly 30 percent in two years.
Art insurers are also smiling. "Business really picked up in 1996," said Dietrich von Frank, president and chief executive of AXA Nordstern Art Insurance. He said the average increase of private collection holdings among his clients was up about 10 percent in the last year, after a jump of about 7.5 percent the previous season. Jeffrey Haber, an expert at Acordia, which also specializes in art insurance, said his clients had on average increased the insured value of their holdings by 15 to 20 percent in the last two years.
And those figures do not capture the effect of many beginning collectors, who tend to insure their early art purchases by adding to their homeowner policies, rather than buying special policies to cover their art.
Throughout the economy, while consumer spending continues to be robust, conspicuous spending is even more so. Spending on luxury goods like art, according to Robert Frank's recent book, "Luxury Fever," is increasing four times faster than spending over all.
Art buying is always tied to real estate, and the size of new homes -- first, second and sometimes third -- is exploding. Twenty thousand square feet, which used to sound baronial, is unexceptional nowadays. Homes of 40,000 square feet to 60,000 square feet, with yards of walls to cover, are being built not just by Bill Gates but also by people whose names do not sell magazines. The Whitney Museum of American Art, meanwhile, has only 42,000 square feet of exhibition space.
Experts agree that collectors are filling these homes with art, but they insist that new houses are not driving the market. "I don't have the sense that it's people decorating," Ms. Brooks said. "Collecting is a lot more focused today. New collectors are driven people who are very intense about everything they do."
Dealers report that during the last two summers it is the browsers who have disappeared, not the collectors. "The people coming in aren't surprises," said Andrew Fabricant, a director of the Richard Gray Gallery. "It's not walk-in trade." Some seem to come to New York, often from the Hamptons, but sometimes from the West Coast, specifically to look and buy, several dealers said.
Still other buyers, apparently, are intense enough to go collecting on their real vacations. "Rich people get bored," said Thea Westreich, an art adviser. "They're on vacation and spending money is a kick." She said she was busy all summer with "high-end business, significant money, willing to buy $5 million to $10 million pictures."
Another new factor, during August especially, was European collectors, who by all signs were in the United States primarily for vacation and decided to go shopping for art, too.
Delighted by all this activity, dealers and auctioneers nevertheless take pains to make distinctions between the 90's and the 80's, when speculators inflated the market, and anything and everything sold. The whole thing fell apart when the Japanese economic bubble burst.
This market, by contrast, remains more orderly and rational, they said. "Now," Mr. Burge said, "collectors are so well advised. They have advisers, curators, restorers, conservators following them around in packs. Anyone with serious money is buying with advice." For the most part the frenzy is gone, except perhaps in contemporary art, some experts said, although not for attribution.
The market is so strong that some collectors are starting to sell. For example, in July -- also an unusual occurrence -- Richard York, an American art dealer, received an 1871 Hudson River painting by Jasper Cropsey from "one person who thinks it's a good time to sell." Both the Monet and the Cezanne at Sotheby's are voluntary sales. And Mr. Burge promised, "It will be a rich fall because of discretionary selling. You'll see."
The appearance of discretionary selling has both positive and negative implications. It is desirable because dealers and auctioneers have had a hard time finding good, fresh material to sell. On the other hand, it does mean that some people think prices are peaking. Or perhaps, everyone hopes, the sellers simply want to trade up to better, more expensive works.

The Fruits of 'Realism'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
The savagery taking place in East Timor -- armed Indonesian thugs taking over the territory by mayhem and murder -- is something besides a human disaster. It carries a profound lesson for international affairs: the price that can be paid for Kissingerian "realism."
Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State, and President Ford visited the tyrant ruler of Indonesia, President Suharto, in December 1975. Mr. Kissinger knew that Mr. Suharto planned to invade East Timor. He made no objection, on the ground that it would be unrealistic to offend Indonesia. 
 The day after he and President Ford left, the Indonesians invaded. They used arms obtained from U.S. aid: a violation of American law. That was pointed out to Mr. Kissinger in a cable from his State Department aides, but he angrily rejected the point.
"I know what the law is," he told a staff meeting when he got back to Washington, "but how can it be in the U.S. national interest for us to . . . kick the Indonesians in the teeth?"
That was Kissingerian realism: the view that the United States should overlook brutalities by friendly authoritarian regimes because they provided "stability." Thus Mr. Kissinger supported Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Shah in Iran.
The people of East Timor have paid a heavy price for that realism. In the invasion and subsequent occupation, a third of the population of 600,000 died. The Indonesian military carried out, over many years, what The Financial Times of London called "unspeakable atrocities." Now, after voting overwhelmingly for independence, many thousands have been driven out of their country by militiamen armed by Indonesia.
Indonesia has also paid heavily for its seizure of East Timor, and it is going to pay a lot more. The stubborn East Timorese insistence on independence has inspired other remote areas of the archipelago state to rebellion. And what foreign company will want to invest in a country that, apart from human concerns, cannot control its own military?
The United Nations and the entire international community have been badly hurt by the debacle in East Timor. Having led the way to the referendum on independence, they relied on Indonesian promises to maintain security because -- once again -- they did not want to offend the Government.
Now U.N. employees have been killed and U.N. offices sacked by the militia forces. The international community has been made to look hapless against a ragtag challenge. And the only response by the U.N. Security Council so far has been to send a mission: not to East Timor but to Jakarta.
The international community has been so silent about all that has happened in East Timor over the last 24 years, and so feeble, that it has a responsibility to act firmly now. Many responses are available.
The United States should immediately end all programs involving the Indonesian military: training, sharing of intelligence, military aid. Indonesia's military is either covertly supporting the militiamen or has failed to oppose their rampage, violating many assurances.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are heavily involved in keeping the Indonesian economy afloat. The country has asked for $71 billion in funding this year from the two institutions. Further tranches should be withheld until legitimate order is restored in East Timor.
If those measures do not bring the Indonesian Government and military leaders to their senses, it will be necessary -- quickly -- to send in an international peacekeeping force.
American political leaders, especially, should reflect on the larger lesson. Ignoring human realities may not, after all, be "realistic." The Shah did not bring stability to Iran; his policies opened the way to a virulently anti-American regime. General Pinochet awaits justice in the British courts.
Using American troops abroad is always, rightly, a delicate decision. But it is not so hard to speak out, and the voice of American leaders carries weight. In Bosnia we learned the price of failing to speak out promptly against aggression. The price of silence on East Timor remains to be calculated.

HEADLINE: Prisons as Mental Hospitals

 BODY:
Rikers Island handles some 25,000 mentally ill prisoners in New York City each year. While in jail, even if only for a few days, they can get treatment and are housed in special units if their problems are severe. But afterward is a different story. Many have neither homes nor families, and carry histories of repeated arrests. It does not take a trained social scientist to predict what will happen to these people if they are left to their own resources after release. Nevertheless, for many of them the city's post-incarceration plan is brutally simple: They are put on a bus and dropped off at Queens Plaza before dawn, with $1.50 and a two-fare Metrocard.
Advocates for the mentally ill recently filed a lawsuit asking that the city be required to plan for the continuing treatment of these prisoners after release. Some of the cases they cited seem to underscore the growing concern that the prisons are becoming the housing of last resort for the state's mentally ill. Brad H. was a homeless man who actually grew up in a mental hospital. He had been jailed 26 times as an adult, always treated for mental illness at Rikers, and then released without any plan for his future treatment. Another, Robert K., was a suicidal schizophrenic whose 30 separate confinements followed the same pattern. 
 The Urban Justice Center, which is leading the advocates who filed the suit, says that prisoners who have been prescribed medication at Rikers to control their symptoms are released without enough drugs to tide them over until they can get a prescription on the outside. While most of the mentally ill prisoners would be eligible for Medicaid, the advocates say, the prison makes no effort to help them qualify for it.
Members of the Giuliani administration point out that there are already programs that help some mentally ill inmates prepare for the future. But the city denies that inmates at Rikers have a legal right to the sort of pre-release planning that mental patients at hospitals are supposed to get. Most of the prisoners are awaiting trial, and typically stay only a few days. The city fears the lawsuit could lead to an expensive mandate that will be impossible to fulfill.
Court mandates are often a costly and cumbersome result of government's failure to do something obvious. Whether mentally ill prisoners have a legal right to help in applying for Medicaid, maintaining their medication program or finding a treatment program on the outside seems beside the point. From a humane point of view, and in the interests of public safety, dumping inmates who may have little or no control over their behavior onto the city streets is outrageous. On a policy level, it makes no economic sense. Any service that keeps the mentally ill from returning to the prison system saves money. There is no more costly way to treat them than to confine them in jail.
The city's first response to the Urban Justice Center's lawsuit should be to review the way it handles the release of mentally ill people, and determine what services it could offer that might help keep more of them on medication and under treatment. Once Rikers Island accepts its obligation to offer whatever help it reasonably can to this particularly vulnerable population, it will be much easier to argue that it should not be mandated to do more.

HEADLINE: European Stocks Gain as Rate Fears Ease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Most European stock markets rose yesterday, led by fast-growing companies as concern faded that interest rates would soon rise.
In Britain, the FTSE 100 rose 43.6 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,375.7. The DAX Xetra index of 30 major companies in Germany rose 64.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to 5,400.55. But in France, the benchmark index fell 4.33 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,668.04. 
 "We're going to see a shift into European markets," said Heiko Veit, who is adding Deutsche Bank and Siemens shares to the 500 million mark ($270 million) fund he manages at BW Asset Consulting. "There is earnings momentum."
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks rose for the first time in three days, led by exporters, as a report showing lower-than-expected United States wage inflation eased concern that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates a third time this year. The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average rose 126.52, or 0.7 percent, to 17,756.51. Canon, Fujitsu and Bridgestone accounted for more than a third of the benchmark average's gains on hopes that stable rates would sustain growth in the United States economy and demand for their products.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 206.85, to 13,385.16. South Korea's stock market rose 32.60, to 943.22, its second day of gains.
Financial markets in the United States will reopen today. They were closed yesterday in observance of Labor Day.
DaimlerChrysler, Lafarge and British American Tobacco led gains among automakers, building-materials suppliers and cigarette makers, respectively. All but one of the 19 industry groups in the Dow Jones Europe index rose.
Concern that interest rates are about to rise has lessened, as one policy maker after another at the European Central Bank said inflation did not look like a threat. The latest was the Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet, one of the 17 members of the rate-setting E.C.B. council, who told a weekend conference in Cernobbio, Italy, "I'm confident that Europe will see noninflationary growth."
Steady or falling rates make it less expensive to buy high-growth stocks, like computer and telecommunications companies.
"We're not so concerned about the rate situation for the moment -- profit forecasts keep getting revised higher," said Lionel Antoinat, who helps manage about $2.7 billion at BBL Asset Management in Paris.
Phone stocks' gains helped push the Dow Jones telecommunications services index 2 percent higher -- the biggest gain by an industry group -- for a two-day rise of 5.4 percent.
Car makers gained after a report showed that sales of imported automobiles in Japan rose 0.3 percent in August from a year earlier. DaimlerChrysler advanced 0.81 euro, to 72.91. Sales of Chrysler vehicles rose 28.5 percent in the month, while Mercedes-Benz sales increased 39.5 percent.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Investigating Russian Bank's Use of Loans

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund began its own investigation today into whether the Russian central bank misused the fund's loans, officials said.
The investigation comes amid allegations that money from the fund may have been illegally diverted through the Bank of New York. American investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion may have been funneled by Russians through the bank, and some suggested that I.M.F. aid might have been part of that money. 
 But fund officials have insisted that the new investigation is unrelated to the allegations involving the Bank of New York.
The investigation of the Russian central bank is being conducted by the fund and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, and is examining whether the bank misused fund loans by means of foreign affiliates, a source close to the investigation told Dow Jones Newswires.
The central bank has misled the I.M.F. about its finances before, and the Russian Government had to agree to independent reviews of its books as a condition for a $4.5 billion loan the fund approved in July.
Russia has received the first $640 million installment of the loan. The second installment, expected next month, will depend on the fund's assessment of Russia's compliance with the terms of the loan.
"We are ready to provide the necessary information," Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin was quoted as saying today on television.
After the allegations of money laundering through the Bank of New York were made public, the United States -- the dominant member of the fund -- said it would delay a decision on whether it should support new fund loans to Russia until a full accounting was made of money already loaned.
An earlier investigation by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that in 1996 the central bank secretly moved $1.2 billion of its reserves to an offshore company, Fimaco, based on the Channel Island of Jersey. The deputy managing director of the fund, Stanley Fischer, said the fund would have suspended Russia's loan program at the time if the truth had been known.
Money laundering and capital flight have been major problems for Russia throughout this decade, with tens of billions of dollars pouring out of the country.

HEADLINE: Americans Lead the World in Hours Worked

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Americans put in the longest hours among workers in industrialized countries, according to a report released today.
But increasingly efficient Europeans and Japanese workers are chipping away at the United States lead in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- according to the 600-page study by the International Labor Organization. 
 Americans put in an average 1,966 hours at work in 1997, the most recent year studied. That is 83 more hours, an increase of nearly 4 percent, than the average 1,883 recorded by United States workers in 1980, according to a United Nations agency report on global labor trends.
"Currently, the U.S. worker works more hours than his or her counterpart in other industrialized countries and he or she also leads the way in terms of productivity," said Lawrence Jeff Johnson, the labor organization economist and co-author of the study, "Key Indicators of the Labor Market."
The annual report examines 18 facets of the labor market, including productivity, costs, unemployment and underemployment and hours worked in more than 240 countries between 1980 and 1997.
American workers continue to outstrip their European and Asian counterparts, producing an average $49,905 of goods in 1996 -- more than other countries for which statistics were available. But the gap in some cases was narrow. The French lead the Europeans, producing an average $47,958 for each worker, followed by Germany at $46,100 and Britain at $38,890. In Japan, the average worker produced $39,434 in 1996.
In comparing productivity gains, however, the United States was behind its rivals in the period studied. The country gained 22 percent between 1980 and 1996. That fell short of the gains of 141 percent in Thailand, 43 percent in Japan and 30 percent in France, Germany and England in the same period, the study found.
The findings followed last week's United States Labor Department report that American productivity growth had slowed from 6.8 percent in manufacturing in the first three months of 1999, to a rate of 4.8 percent.
"While the benefits of hard work are clear, working more is not the same as working better," the labor organization's head, Juan Somavia, said of the report's findings.
While Americans were putting in more time at the office, Western Europeans logged fewer hours, with the French, who are considering legislation to shorten the work week to 35 hours, clocking in 1,656 hours annually in 1997 and the Germans working an average of 1,560 in 1996, the last year for which comparable data was available. Norway was at the bottom, with an average 1,399 hours worked in 1997.
Japanese workers logged 1,889 hours in 1995, the last year for which statistics were available, compared with 2,121 in 1980.
 The report was produced by the International Labor Organization together with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and drew on statistics from the United Nations, the World Bank, and the statistical offices of the European Union and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HEADLINE: Clinton as Laborer in Campaign for Schools

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Sept. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton performed a bit of light labor today at a 75-year-old elementary school here to dramatize his call to Congress to finance a plan to build or modernize 6,000 schools across the nation.
Donning a hard hat and rolling up the sleeves of a blue work shirt, the President used a cordless electric screwdriver to help assemble a computer desk at the school, Coleman Place Elementary. 
 Mr. Clinton seemed unfamiliar with a tool used by millions of American homeowners and weekend hobbyists. He joked that with the purchase of a home last week in Chappaqua, N.Y., the first private residence he has owned in two decades, he would have to get with the home-improvement program.
"Now that I'm a homeowner, I better get one of these," the President said, as he uncertainly wielded the electric tool. "I've never seen one of these."
Mr. Clinton's Labor Day project in classroom 29 of the school took about five minutes. The work was completed by volunteers from a local construction trades union.
Later, speaking to several hundred students and parents in the schoolyard, the President said that rebuilding the nation's schools should be one of Government's top priorities.
Pointing at 10 trailers being used as temporary classrooms at Coleman Place, Mr. Clinton said, "Now, folks, we have to fix this."
He said that 3,000 trailers were being used as classrooms in Virginia alone and that tens of thousands more were serving that purpose across the country.
"This is a national problem," the President said. "If we can meet this big long-term challenge to America, don't we have the obligation to do it?"
The Administration has proposed a $3.7 billion Federal tax relief program to help local school districts float construction bonds backed by the Government. The Republican Congress rejected the plan last year, but it appears to stand a better chance of passage this fall with a smaller Republican majority in the House.
Before returning to Washington this evening, Mr. Clinton appeared at the annual Labor Day picnic and political rally sponsored by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, at Mr. Scott's mother's house in Newport News, Va.
While not technically a fund-raising event, the picnic did have as one of its goals energizing support for Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, who faces a tough re-election challenge next year from former Gov. George F. Allen, a Republican.
Mr. Scott, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was one of the President's most ardent defenders during the panel's impeachment debate last fall. He is seeking a fifth term in the House.
The President plugged the two lawmakers' re-election bids and once again criticized the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cut proposal. He said passage of the bill would raise interest rates for all Americans and jeopardize the eight-year economic expansion.
And he delivered a Labor Day endorsement of unions. He was accompanied on the trip today by John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Robert Chase, president of the National Education Association.
"I'm pro-business," the President said, "but I'm pro-labor, too. I don't think you can help the economy if you hurt the working people."

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Visits Kuwait as Tensions Ease

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Sept. 6

 BODY:
King Abdullah II of Jordan began a two-day visit to Kuwait today, the first visit by a Jordanian ruler since relations soured during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and 1991. 
 Kuwait accused Jordan of supporting Iraq and froze all ties, although relations have recently improved. In March, Jordan reopened its Embassy in Kuwait.
The King was met at the airport by the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and said the visit was a "historic new chapter in the brotherly relations which bind us to Kuwait."
His comments echoed a front-page editorial in Al-Qabas newspaper here that called for greater cooperation between the two countries. A political analyst, Shamlan al-Issa, said such cooperation should be encouraged by a Kuwaiti offer of economic aid to Jordan so that Jordan would be less dependent on Iraq.
"Oil, direct economic assistance and opening the Kuwaiti job market to Jordanians are weapons that can be used to apply this strategy," Mr. Issa said in an interview.
Nearly 300,000 Jordanians of Palestinian origin who were working in the emirate in 1990 were expelled after the United States-led coalition won the gulf war in 1991.
Information Minister Saad Mohammed bin Teflah al-Ajmi of Kuwait said on Saturday that the improved climate with Jordan would hasten the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
On Sunday, an Iraqi spokesman said the Kuwaiti leaders were corrupt, people who "resort to every possible type of deceit to destroy any form of Arab solidarity."
Jordan has relied on Iraq for all its supplies of crude oil since the gulf war. Ninety thousand barrels of oil a day, or 3.8 million gallons, is transported by road, with United Nations approval. Jordan is also a crossing point for Iraqis who travel abroad, because of the air embargo against Iraq.
The Jordanian Information Minister, Ayman Majali, had said earlier that there was no fixed agenda for the King's talks in Kuwait.

HEADLINE: The Frantic Final Days Before School;
Long Before Doors Open, a Principal Is Busy Juggling Crises

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Working in his cluttered principal's office at a table piled high with memos, stacks of school schedules and blueprints for the library renovation, Ron Attivissimo should have looked like a man under siege the other day.
A desperate mother wanted to speak to him about transferring her daughter to his already overcrowded school, James Peter Sinnott Middle School 218 in East New York, Brooklyn. A man was waiting to talk to him about a teaching job. An architect and his team were expected to arrive any minute to talk about the library plans. And the phones did not and would not stop ringing. 
 But Mr. Attivissimo, a principal in one of the toughest and poorest areas in the city, Community School District 19, prepared for the reopening of school this Thursday with the relative cool of a seasoned Broadway producer.
He and staff members worked long hours last week and over the weekend, juggling phone calls; drawing up student and teacher schedules; interviewing prospective teachers, 5 of whom were hired in a day; assigning classrooms to 15 new teachers; making room for 500 new sixth graders, and trying to determine who failed summer school and who passed. All within the constraints of a tight budget.
"It doesn't happen overnight," said Mr. Attivissimo, who has been in the business for 32 years, 9 of them as principal. "No one walks into a school one day and opens it the next day, especially not in this day and age."
Mr. Attivissimo, 52, like all city school principals, is under more pressure than ever to improve performance in this era of high-stakes testing and increased accountability.
In June, for example, in a shake-up of the city's worst performing schools, the District 19 superintendent was fired after fewer than a third of his students performed at grade level in reading and math on standardized tests. The superintendent, Robert E. Riccobono, is appealing his dismissal.
M.S. 218, a magnet school for health and health careers, was one of the few schools in District 19 to show strong gains in reading. Mr. Attivissimo is eager to achieve even greater gains, but he is acutely aware of the pressures and spotlight he and many other principals are under.
"It's tough," Mr. Attivissimo said, running both hands over his narrow, heavily lined face. "But I wouldn't be here if it wasn't worth it. I can go to a school on Long Island where 90 percent of the kids read at or above grade level. I can sit back behind my desk, relax and no one's going to come down on me because my reading scores aren't there. But here, there is a job to do in helping these kids succeed in their future lives. It's a commitment."
He started preparing for opening day on Aug. 6, though the Board of Education did not require principals, assistant principals and supervisors to report back until last week. (It also does not pay them for returning to work early; Mr. Attivissimo makes $73,000 a year, with or without overtime.)
In a way, Mr. Attivissimo's job is much like that of a Broadway producer: a delicate and demanding juggling act involving a cast of hundreds, innumerable logistical obstacles and a show that indeed must go on. The stakes, of course, are much higher. And forget the big budget, glitz and applause.
What follows is a snapshot of such a task, three days last week as reopening approached for Mr. Attivissimo and his staff.
 
Monday
So Many Details, So Little Time
 Mr. Attivissimo was greeted by several staff members, some of whom were returning to the four-story building with blue window frames for the first time after a long, hot summer.
Most of the activity took place in his office, about the size of two classrooms, and a small office to the side, where two workers with pencils huddled over several broad sheets lined with tiny squares. They were making out schedules for the school's 70 teachers, 23 of them new.
Short, thin and confident, Mr. Attivissimo sat behind two Formica-topped conference tables, sipping coffee, answering questions and signing papers shuttled in by his secretary, Barbara Abramowitz. The peach-colored walls of his office are lined with posters from Paris, Madrid, Ivory Coast and Mexico, reflecting his background as a French and Spanish teacher.
"This child is being held back," said Phyllis Schneider, a longtime math teacher who was there to help out, rushing into his office with a letter from the state. "He should have gone to summer school."
The lines in Mr. Attivissimo's narrow face grew deeper. He buried his face in his hands before looking at the letter.
"No, he isn't," Mr. Attivissimo said confidently. "I know this student. They're wrong."
He retrieved the student's records from a stack of nearby papers. They showed that the student had passed his standardized tests and did not require summer school. Bingo. The child was moving on to the eighth grade.
"One kid saved," Mr. Attivissimo said proudly.
But another problem surfaced. An architect from the School Construction Authority arrived with a design team. The library, on the second floor, was being renovated to give students a larger reading area, but the principal discovered that the blueprints showed that too much space was given to the new computer lab. The plans had to be redone to allow more room for reading. Renovations are to begin sometime this fall.
Then there was Alice Williams, 41, and her daughter Jessica, 13, who came to plead with Mr. Attivissimo to allow Jessica to enroll at the school. The school zoned for their Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood is too dangerous, Mrs. Williams said. She planned to move Jessica to her sister's house across the street from M.S. 218.
Crowding, Mr. Attivissimo explained, was a problem. But he asked if he could see Jessica's report card. She was a good student. But he was concerned about her 41 absences and 24 late days.
The marks, Mrs. Williams said, were recording mistakes made at a poorly run school. A stickler for attendance for students and teachers, Mr. Attivissimo grimaced as he handed the report card back and told them to come back on Thursday.
"He's nice," Ms. Williams, an unemployed mother of six, said as she packed up to go. "He sees a good student and is willing to give her a chance."
Next was a meeting with a man who was applying for a teaching position. The 60-year-old applicant did not have the credentials for the job, but he was enthusiastic and eager to teach. So Mr. Attivissimo met with him for 30 minutes anyway.
But Mr. Attivissimo was in a bind. He still needed about 12 new teachers. He made plans to send staff members to a hiring fair on Wednesday.
This school year, he will need more teachers than ever as the district completes the final phase of a three-year plan to move the sixth grade from elementary to middle schools. Enrollment at the school, which is largely black and Hispanic, is increasing from about 900 to 1,400.
"The sixth grade is going from 6 classes to 14," Mr. Attivissimo said. "We had a number of teachers who went to work on Long Island because of more pay and a closer proximity to their homes. How can anyone say no to $10,000 to $15,000 more and be 15 minutes away from home?"
 
Tuesday
A Meeting Here, A Rally There
Mr. Attivissimo attended an all-day meeting at district headquarters about Breakthrough for Learning, a program in which teachers and administrators can receive bonuses if student achievement improves. The program also includes teacher training and regular student assessment.
Run by the Board of Education and the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce -- one of the largest business groups in the city -- the program will put District 19 under the spotlight for the second year. Among other things, the meeting focused on teaching strategies and the extended school day.
Mr. Attivissimo says that he is a proponent of the Breakthrough program, but that he believes the bonuses should be aimed more toward the teachers and assistant principals. Perhaps it exposes his working class roots, which were planted in Bensonhurst. His father worked for years at a warehouse for the A.&P., while his mother stayed home to raise him and a younger sister.
Today, he lives in Forest Hills, Queens, with his wife and two cats.
"Of course bonuses are issued regularly to the best performers," Mr. Attivissimo said. "But I don't think you work harder because you're getting a bonus. I don't think because I could get $14,000 more a year, I'm going to do more. I don't think many of our teachers could do more than they're doing."
He excused himself from the Breakthrough meeting in the afternoon to join hundreds of colleagues at a principal's union rally at the Board of Education headquarters at 110 Livingston Street. The city's principals have been working without a contract for about three and a half years.
Negotiations have been deadlocked over tenure. The city wants to do away with it, but union leaders say no.
Mr. Attivissimo, like a growing number of principals, supports doing away with tenure if the city can guarantee that they will not be fired capriciously. Mr. Attivissimo is a tenured principal.
"The union fears we will lose due process," he said. "I disagree with the union a little bit. We should be held accountable. It's been three and a half years that we've been working without a contract. I'd like to know I'm worth something."
 
Wednesday
Five New Teachers, One New Crisis
Mr. Attivissimo began by deciding to extend the school day for about 120 seventh graders in the magnet program. The move would cost about $30,000, but his $5.9 million budget was already committed. He needed to appeal for assistance to the new superintendent, Joan Mahon-Powell, a proponent of longer school days. The school's sixth graders are already on an extended day, which lengthens the school day by an hour.
He also began holding back-to-back teacher interviews -- about five in all. He answered phone calls and questions from Mrs. Abramowitz throughout the interviews.
In the midst of it all, he managed to keep focused on the candidates and put them at ease, though two showed signs of stress. A woman perspired through her kelly green suit jacket, and a young man nervously chewed gum. He hired all five.
The new teachers, including a former student from 218, were carefully screened by Eileen Lew, an assistant principal, and Mrs. Schneider, the math teacher, who is also a lead teacher in the Breakthrough program, at a hiring fair at the district headquarters that morning.
Mr. Attivissimo's schedule was overflowing with other tasks: more resumes to plow through, classroom assignments to make, teacher schedules to finish and staff development issues.
But first, he had to rush to another meeting with Ms. Mahon-Powell at the district office. She wanted him to mentor a new principal. He left his staff with a mess of papers and shouted orders to Mrs. Lew as he ran backward down the long, empty hall.
There was a crisis: a longtime teacher had just called to say he had accepted a job on Long Island.
"Get him on the phone!" he yelled. "See if you can change his mind."

New York Incomes Decline, Report Says

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The incomes of most New Yorkers declined in the 1990's relative to the cost of living, according to a report released to coincide with Labor Day weekend.
The disparity between the rich and the poor is greater in New York than in any other state, and the gap is growing at a faster rate, said James Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit Albany organization that issued the report. The group is supported in part by labor unions. 
 Middle-income families saw their earnings decline by 8 percent since the late 1980's, while incomes for the poorest 40 percent of families fell between 13 percent and 15 percent, the report said. At the same time, the incomes of the richest 20 percent of households grew by nearly 30 percent, the report added.
The report said New York City saw sharper income and wage declines than the rest of the state. On average, income fell by nearly 20 percent for all except the richest 40 percent of families.
Average hourly wages rose because of growth in the securities industry, but the median hourly wage fell 6.3 percent, the report said.
All the figures are relative to increases in the cost of living over the last decade, Fiscal Policy Institute officials said.
Mr. Parrott said the downstate region was heavily reliant on the performance of Wall Street. In recent years, Wall Street has experienced robust growth, but only 7 percent of New York households have reaped the benefits, receiving 85 percent of the capital gains, mostly from the sale of stocks.
The economy of upstate New York fared worse, as the region lost high-paying manufacturing jobs and gained low-paying service jobs.
Matthew Maguire, a spokesman for the Business Council of New York State, a statewide chamber of commerce, said the report's findings were "largely old news and old thinking." He acknowledged that the state's economy deteriorated in the early 1990's because of the national recession, but said it was "on the right track now."
Steve Kagann, Gov. George E. Pataki's chief economist, agreed, saying the report gives "a distorted view of the economic conditions in New York."
Mr. Kagann said the state ranks 20th in the nation in private-sector job growth, up from 50th in 1994.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Different Genes, Same Old Label

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
WHEN a field of genetically altered corn at the University of Maine was destroyed by protesters in mid-August, it was a rare hint that uneasiness over bioengineering in agriculture is growing among Americans. Such actions have become common overseas, with experimental fields burned in England, and the European Union and Japan decreeing that genetically engineered food must be labeled. But Americans have so far been slow to anger.
One reason may be that most of them don't have a clue that many foods are already being made with genetically engineered ingredients: no labeling is required in this country, nor is Government approval. 
 But the September issue of Consumer Reports includes a surprising shopping list of products tested by Consumers Union that were found to contain genetically engineered soy, corn or other ingredients. Among them were three powdered baby formulas -- Enfamil Prosobee soy formula, Similac Isomil soy formula and Nestle Carnation Alsoy -- as well as several soy burgers, including Boca Burger, Chef Max's Favorite, Morningstar Farms Better 'n Burgers and Green Giant Harvest Burgers. Ovaltine Malt powdered beverage mix, Bac-Os Bacon Flavor bits, Bravos Tortilla Chips Nacho Nacho, Old El Paso 12 taco shells and Jiffy Corn muffin mix also tested positive for genetically altered ingredients.
Consumers Union said it tested breakfast cereals and cooking oils too, but that the results were inconclusive. It also reported that 60 percent of all hard-cheese products are made with a biotech version of rennet, the enzyme from calves' stomachs. And it analyzed McDonald's McVeggie Burgers, sold in some of the chain's New York City restaurants, and they tested positive.
Consumers Union said it chose to test foods that were likely to include genetically altered ingredients; the testing analyzed the DNA makeup of those foods.
Genetic engineering involves the splicing of plant or animal genes into the DNA of other species, either to improve crop yields or to ward off insects or disease. Corn, potatoes, squash, papayas, soybeans and canola are among the bioengineered crops already on the market. All a company has to do to grow bioengineered products is certify to the Agriculture Department that it will take safety precautions.
Because so few safety studies have been done, there is no evidence that genetically engineered food now on the market is unsafe to eat. But some scientists and consumer advocates worry about the potential for unknown allergens, an increase in natural toxic substances, a decrease in nutritional value and especially environmental damage. In addition, some religious groups are concerned about the possibility that genes from foods they are forbidden to eat will be put into other foods, like shellfish genes into a tomato. The environmental concern has led to protests like the one in Maine, in which a group calling itself Seeds of Resistance claimed responsibility for cutting down 1,000 stalks of genetically engineered corn in an experimental field near Bangor.
But the big issue, as Consumer Reports emphasized, is whether consumers should be informed when bioengineered ingredients are used, so they can decide whether to avoid them.
A recent survey by the International Food Information Council found that 71 percent of consumers in this country rated themselves as poorly informed about food biotechnology. (Only 2 to 3 percent thought soybeans were genetically engineered, for instance.) But when they do know, they often act. After bovine growth hormone was approved in 1993 to increase milk production, sales of organic milk skyrocketed, and last year they doubled. That still represents only 0.3 percent of the $75 billion dairy market, but analysts say the figure could reach 2 percent by 2005. Between 10 and 30 percent of the nation's dairy cows have been injected with the gene-altered hormone rBGH.
Fears about genetically modified corn were raised last spring when it was reported that pollen from such corn killed monarch butterfly larvae in a laboratory experiment. Entomologists at Iowa State University are following up on the experiment in the field. Consumer Reports said that John Obrycki, one of the entomologists, reported that mortality data indicate that there is indeed a threat to the monarch.
Since the European Union has refused to accept some genetically modified American crops, farmers have begun to pay attention to the issue, too. A judge in Brazil has also banned the sale there of Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybean seeds, which are resistant to the company's Roundup herbicide.
Today, genetically engineered crops cover one-fourth of the cropland in the United States, representing 35 percent of all corn, almost 55 percent of all soybeans and nearly half of all cotton.
Consumer Reports, which has a circulation of 4.5 million, offered recommendations for dealing with the issue of genetically altered foods, like requiring a Federal review of the safety of such foods for humans before they are put on the market.
These were some of its other recommendations:
* That safety reviews be required before farmers are allowed to plant bioengineered species, in an effort to prevent insects from developing resistance to pesticides, the creation of superweeds and harm to beneficial insects.
* That a single national standard be established certifying that "organic" food meets certain standards, and that genetically engineered food not be considered organic. No Federal standard exists now.
* That the agriculture industry be made liable for economic or biological damage resulting from genetically engineered crops.
* That genetically engineered foods, both domestic and imported, be labeled. As the magazine put it, "Consumers have a fundamental right to know what they eat."
In a Time magazine poll published in January, 81 percent of the respondents said genetically engineered food should be labeled. In fact, labeling can work more than one way: some dairies and tofu makers have found that they can increase sales by noting on labels that their products are free of genetically engineered ingredients.

30-Year Treasury's Yield Rises To 6.07% in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury yields rose yesterday as investors awaited an inflation report scheduled for release on Friday and braced for speeches by Federal Reserve officials.
Government securities were also under pressure from coming issues of corporate debt, which are expected to compete with Treasuries for investors' cash. 
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 26/32, to 100 23/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.01 percent on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.
Light trading continued to plague the market throughout the day, exaggerating shifts in buying. Analysts noted that the bond market had shown a penchant for volatility lately with plenty of obstacles to choke off any attempt at a sustained rally, including a busy calendar of Fed speeches and a steady stream of economic data.
This week's appearances at the podium by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and two Fed governors, Laurence H. Meyer and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., "have the power to send the bond market scurrying for cover," said Adam Blankman, Treasury market analyst for Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco.
Treasury prices slumped yesterday in what traders described as an uneventful session. Mr. Blankman noted that supply was weighing on the market, though estimates of the corporate debt this month are being reduced from about $60 billion to the range of $30 billion to $40 billion.
The firms that manage corporate bond sales often hedge against possible losses by selling Government securities before the corporate issues are sold, then buying back the Treasuries after the corporate issues are in the hands of investors.
Market participants looking for signs of the Fed's position on the economy and the direction of interest rates will be paying particular attention to the Fed officials' remarks this week and to a Government report on producer prices, or inflation at the manufacturing level, on Friday.
Analysts expect the report to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in August after gaining two-tenths of 1 percent in July.
The three-month bill was the session's top performer. "Thanks to the laws of supply and demand, this is the only instrument on the yield curve that is above water today," Mr. Blankman said.
The Treasury's bill auction was well received. The three-month issue was awarded at 4.72 percent, a little better than expected.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.807	97.498	High Rate	4.72%	4.95%	Coupon Yield	4.85%	5.16%	Low Rate	4.63%	4.85%	Median Rate	4.72%	4.94%	Total applied for	$29,317,225	$27,848,204	Accepted	$10,373,518	$11,864,600	Noncompetitive	$1,282,186	$1,161,606	

Both issues are dated Sept. 9, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 9, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on March 9, 2000.

HEADLINE: Ford Loses Bid to Keep Documents Off Internet

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Asserting that an Internet site has the same free-speech rights as newspapers and other traditional media, a Federal judge ruled here today that the Ford Motor Company could not stop the owner of the site from using information that he had gleaned from confidential Ford documents.
Ford had requested a preliminary injunction barring Robert Lane, the owner of the Web site about the company, from using, copying or disclosing the documents, which Ford said contain trade secrets. But Judge Nancy G. Edmunds of Federal District Court ruled that free speech under the First Amendment took precedence over Ford's secrets. 
 Newspapers and magazines have won cases over the years preventing corporations from exercising prior restraint on the publishing of information. Today's ruling adds to a small but growing collection of court rulings granting the same Constitutional protection to Web sites, said Mike Godwin, a lawyer specializing in free-speech issues on the Internet.
"It's an important case because it further establishes the scope of First Amendment protections in cyberspace," Mr. Godwin said.
The first cases involving prior restraint on the Internet were filed by the Church of Scientology in an effort to stop the electronic posting of church documents, Mr. Godwin said, adding that the church had prevailed in some cases and lost in others.
Judge Edmunds couched her decision today in broad language, saying: "In the realm of law, we are only beginning to grapple with the impact of the communications revolution, and this case represents just one part of one skirmish -- a clash between our commitment to the freedom of speech and the press, and our dedication to the protection of commercial innovation and intellectual property. In this case, the battle is won by the First Amendment."
Judge Edmunds did grant Ford a preliminary injunction barring Mr. Lane, a 32-year-old nursing student, from infringing on the company's copyrights. This might prevent Mr. Lane from posting Ford documents in their entirety on his Web site, as he had done until Ford sued him two weeks ago. But the copyright decision had little legal significance, several First Amendment lawyers said, because Mr. Lane's lawyer had already promised the court last week that his client would not post any more Ford documents on the site. Mr. Lane can write about the documents and quote them extensively without worrying about copyright issues, the lawyers added.
Ford's lawsuit, accusing Mr. Lane of violating its trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, is still pending and could result in financial damages against Mr. Lane. His lawyer, Mark Pickrell, also agreed in court last week that his client would tell Ford whatever he knew about who provided the documents. But Mr. Lane said in court he did not know who had mailed them to him or dropped them off at his home, so this agreement may not help Ford.
Mr. Lane's site, which is called www.blueovalnews.com, is named for Ford's corporate logo, a blue oval with "Ford" inside. The site was started last year to provide news for Ford Mustang fans, but broadened this summer after Ford became critical of some of the news posted on it.
Mr. Pickrell welcomed today's ruling as a victory for free speech. Ford said it was pleased that Mr. Lane's constitutional rights had been respected but also glad that its copyrights would be protected. Ford lawyers want to discuss the ruling with Mr. Pickrell, and have not yet decided whether to appeal, said Terry Bresnihan, a company spokesman.
The case is particularly awkward for Ford because many of the secret documents say the company may someday be able to build automobiles, particularly sport utility vehicles, that emit less pollution and have better fuel efficiency than current models. Yet the company is lobbying against tighter emissions and fuel-economy regulations as unrealistic. The company builds the least polluting sports utility vehicles currently on the market, although not the most fuel-efficient.
The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new rules that would crack down on tailpipe emissions from sport utility vehicles in particular. Separately, the Senate is considering whether the Administration should be allowed to raise fuel-economy standards for sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans.
Mr. Bresnihan said today that the company had been frank in discussions with the Environmental Protection Agency about the feasibility of lower-emissions vehicles. Documents regarding fuel economy describe technologies that may not be feasible for technological and marketing reasons, he said.
David Cohen, a spokesman for the environmental agency, declined to comment on the documents, but said, "We're convinced that the rules we've proposed and the final standard will be the toughest ever."

East TimorChaos Is Seen as Imperiling Indonesia Recovery

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 7

 BODY:
A failure to quell the chaos in East Timor could strangle Indonesia's fragile economic recovery, government officials and independent analysts warned today.
As the violence takes on every appearance of a military-backed terror campaign, officials fear that foreign lenders will shun Indonesia while local business will lose confidence in the Government's authority. 
 "If we are not able to overcome this, the recovery could slip away and we could fall into another deep crisis," said Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie. "We've got to be very careful."
The Jakarta stock market, after plummeting on Monday, leveled off today. But Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, continued weakening, reaching a rate of 8,250 to the dollar in Asian trading and settling in New York later at 8,245. Analysts regard an exchange rate of 8,000 rupiah to the dollar as a psychological benchmark.
Mr. Juoro said his greatest fear was that foreign lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank would cut off billions of dollars in aid. Although these two agencies have not directly threatened such action, both have expressed shock at the flood of violence.
"We're terribly concerned and worried about the East Timorese, and we're following the situation closely," said Ben Fisher, the World Bank's deputy director and country program coordinator in Indonesia. "For the entire international donor community, this is a very difficult issue."
The International Monetary Fund said today that it would consider canceling a planned trip to Indonesia by its senior officials to review its program. "The I.M.F. continues to view with grave concern the deteriorating situation in East Timor," it said in a statement.
Some analysts said foreign donors had little choice but to continue pouring money into Indonesia. Without the aid, they said, the Government would default on its debt and the country would be ripe for further social unrest.
Indeed, Japanese officials said today that they were not considering halting their aid to Indonesia. All told, international organizations have pledged $47 billion to Indonesia since the onset of the Asian crisis in 1997.
The money is going toward rebuilding Indonesia's shattered banking system and aiding tens of millions of people thrown into poverty by the crisis.
Even more important than the money is the message. If the I.M.F. and other groups suspend their programs, Mr. Juoro and other analysts said, it will drive away prospective foreign investors, who regard the aid as a stamp of approval.
"It would really be a signal for foreign investors to get away from Indonesia," Mr. Juoro said. "It would also cause Indonesian capital to flee the country again. If they stop the support, it would be a disaster."
Even with the aid, the country's economy has followed a haphazard course. After contracting 14 percent last year, the economy showed a few glimmerings of life. Exports began growing in April for the first time in a year. In June, the stock market and the rupiah soared after Indonesia held peaceful elections, the first voting contested by candidates from more than one party in four decades.
But the euphoria dissipated the next month. Investigators discovered that one of Indonesia's leading private banks, Bank Bali, had diverted about $70 million in public funds to a top official of President Habibie's ruling party, Golkar. The money was apparently intended to help gain support for a plan to keep Bank Bali afloat. And it fed suspicions that Mr. Habibie's Government was guilty of the same corruption that marked his fallen predecessor, Suharto.
"The Bank Bali scandal was a big blow to confidence," said Mari Pangestu, an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. "Now, East Timor is dealing another blow."
Ms. Pangestu said the events in East Timor were particularly damaging in the intangible, but important area of business confidence. If executives doubt the Government's ability to control even a small province, she said it would discourage them from making new investments in the country.
In that sense, dispatching a United Nations peacekeeping force to East Timor might steady nerves. But other analysts warned that such a move could harm foreign companies with operations in Indonesia.
"There might be an anti-foreign backlash," said James W. Castle, an American consultant with the Castle Group in Jakarta. "In general, that hasn't been a problem here. But this could bring it to the surface."

HEADLINE: Insurance Service Company, and 770 Jobs, Leaving New York for Jersey City

 BODY:
The Insurance Service Office Inc., an information clearinghouse, will move 1,400 employees from five offices, including its Manhattan headquarters, to a building under construction in Jersey City, the company said yesterday.
The company signed a 20-year lease with the Lefrak Organization on Friday to occupy 394,000 square feet of an 800,000-square-foot building in Lefrak's Newport complex on the Hudson River waterfront. The move is expected in the second quarter of 2001, two years after Lefrak broke ground on the 22-story structure in May. 
 The company will move 770 employees, including its chief operating officer, Fred R. Marcon, from its headquarters at 7 World Trade Center, said David Ostwald, a company spokesman. Another 500 employees will come from a site in Pearl River, N.Y., with the rest from two sites in Manhattan and one in Rahway, N.J. The company, which is privately held, employs another 1,000 workers nationwide, who will not be affected.
The move is intended to improve the company's efficiency, although no layoffs are planned, Mr. Ostwald said. "We want to retain all of our current employees, so we wanted a site that was accessible to all our locations," Mr. Ostwald said. "We talked to New York City, but this was a more attractive arrangement."
Mr. Ostwald said other attractions include the city's accessibility by PATH train, ferries and the Holland Tunnel.
The announcement comes amid steady construction and job growth along Jersey City's Hudson River waterfront, often at New York City's expense. Alex Cohen, a senior manager at Cushman & Wakefield, the Manhattan-based real estate firm, said cheaper rent was only one factor. "There's not enough high-quality space being built," Mr. Cohen said.
Sam LeFrak, chairman of the Lefrak Organization, based in Rego Park, Queens, said Insurance Service Office would start out paying about $26 per square foot -- $5 cheaper than industry averages for downtown Manhattan, and $10 cheaper than midtown -- and increase its payments over the life of the lease. Mr. LeFrak said the $150 million building received a 20-year tax abatement from Jersey City. Tom Gallagher, Mayor Bret Schundler's chief of staff, said the company's arrival would "give further credibility and prestige to a Jersey City address."
Mr. Ostwald would not discuss New York's offer. Nor would Michael Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
"What this demonstrates," Mr. Carey said, "is that when companies threaten to leave New York, their threats have to be taken seriously, because sometimes they will carry them out."

The Mean Season

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
For the past decade, Australian strategists have referred to the Southeast Asian nations to their north -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand & Co. -- as Australia's "strategic shield." Today, Australian strategists refer to Southeast Asia as "the arc of instability formerly known as Australia's strategic shield."
They have a point. When you look up at Asia from down under, what you see today is a region more explosive than at any time since the Vietnam War. For years it has been widely assumed that all these countries, even China, were in "transition" from underdeveloped to developed, from confrontation to multilateral cooperation and from closed political systems to more open ones. It was going to be the Pacific Century. 
 But today it is the fear of implosion, not the inevitability of transition, that dominates political discussions here. It starts with Indonesia. For the past 25 years Indonesia has been the keystone holding together Southeast Asia as a pro-Western, free-market bloc counterbalancing China. Today that keystone is crumbling. Indonesia is the Yugoslavia of Southeast Asia. Its economic downturn has weakened the center, and civil wars have erupted at both ends of the Indonesian archipelago, from Aceh in the north, where Muslim separatists want to secede, to East Timor in the south, where 80 percent of the population voted for independence and the Indonesian military simply won't let go.
The U.S. and U.N. are right to lay down an ultimatum to the Indonesian Government: Either stop the gangs marauding East Timor, and permit a U.N. peacekeeping force to go in -- which the Australians would gladly provide the forces for -- or Indonesia will be treated as a pariah state and its tentative economic recovery aborted. (The Aussies are ready to put troops into Timor because they know if Indonesia implodes, the boat people are heading for Australia.)
Unfortunately, this is not the only problem in the neighborhood. "Whether it is Indonesia, or the Korean Peninsula, or Taiwan, or the South China Sea or India-Pakistan -- all the most sensitive hot spots today are in Asia," remarked Gerard Henderson, director of the Sydney Institute. America's role in the region has gone from containing Communism to containing chaos. The Pacific Century is now officially on hold.
It need not be forever, though. There are still positive trends here that have a lot of human energy and aspirations fueling them. Look at Thailand. Its central bank, responding to the Asian economic crisis, just announced a whole new strategic approach "emphasizing new values of honesty and integrity, teamwork, competence, accountability and efficiency." Next door, Singapore's Government, which has always kept a very tight lid on what its citizens can read and say, indicated it may ease up a bit because it realizes this is the only way to attract more brains to Singapore. The Asian Wall Street Journal quoted Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as saying, "We have to create a Silicon Valley state of mind in Singapore -- creative and willing to take risks." Meanwhile, Korea's Government is dismantling Daewoo, one of the four bloated family-controlled conglomerates that helped sink the country in a pool of foreign debt. China has even restarted talks on joining the World Trade Organization, which would open and regulate its economy as never before.
But then, when you look closer, you see that even these silver trends have cloudy linings. Korea may be dismantling Daewoo, but it isn't actually closing down any of its companies, for fear of unemployment, so they will limp along. There have been several unexplained bombings in Chinese cities, and billions of dollars of hot money keep being smuggled out of China.
It is no accident that the two countries that emerged unscathed from the Asian economic crisis also happen to be the two most democratic in Asia, with the freest media -- Australia and Taiwan. The others are like kids who spurted up economically, but never adjusted their political clothing. Well, now they are, and that adjustment is going to produce stresses and even implosions throughout this region. And that's why this yin and yang, between positive and negative trends, is going to be with us in Asia for a long time. So welcome to the "New Asia" -- the arc of instability formerly known as Australia's strategic shield.

HEADLINE: East Timor Under Siege

 BODY:
Last week, in a referendum with nearly 100 percent turnout, East Timor's voters overwhelmingly supported independence from Indonesia. Now rampaging militias, with the backing and apparent complicity of Indonesia's army, are taking revenge against the inhabitants of this unlucky territory. They have set East Timor on fire -- murdering residents and driving tens of thousands of people to neighboring West Timor. Unfortunately, the proposals coming from Jakarta to stop the terror are less than reassuring. The United Nations Security Council should immediately endorse Australia's attempts to assemble a quick-reaction international peacekeeping force, and countries with economic influence should use it to press Indonesia to end the violence now or let the peacekeepers in.
In 1975, after Portugal withdrew from its colony of East Timor, Indonesia brutally invaded. Its annexation, carried out with the acquiescence of the United States and Australia, led to the deaths of 200,000 Timorese, nearly one in three residents. 
But East Timor provided huge international headaches for the dictatorship of President Suharto. His successor, B. J. Habibie, decided to offer East Timor a plan for autonomy inside Indonesia. If Timorese voters rejected it, then Indonesia would pull out and East Timor would become independent. Despite growing violence by anti-independence militias, the U.N. agreed in May that if East Timor chose independence, Indonesia would withdraw its troops and the U.N. would take over security in the region -- but only well after a referendum.
Indonesia's military and millions of nationalists deeply resent the offer of independence, and worry that it could encourage separatist movements in other regions. What East Timor is suffering is not chaos but an organized rampage by the militias, as some of the more than 15,000 Indonesian troops there stand by and even participate. The violence is very likely being coordinated by military men in Jakarta. Indonesia's Government insists that it can solve the problem without international help, and has declared martial law. But Indonesia's military is the problem, not the solution.
Although Australia is now rightly assembling a peacekeeping force, the U.N. Security Council has announced that it will not endorse it without Indonesia's agreement. Getting Jakarta's consent will require strong and immediate pressure, especially from the United States, Australia -- which has strong ties to Indonesia's military -- and Japan, a large donor of economic aid.
All three nations should announce that they are cutting off all military aid and sales. They, and the international banks, should also stop all but humanitarian loans and economic aid. America should give the peacekeeping mission a strong endorsement. An international force is clearly the last resort, to be tried only if President Habibie and Indonesia's military leader, Gen. Wiranto, will not stop the violence. But a united, powerful threat from abroad is likely needed to persuade them to end the killings.

HEADLINE: Backstage Drama Unfolds Over Taste-of-Broadway Show for Tourists

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Three longtime theater producers are creating a 60-minute, $25-a-ticket Broadway production aimed at the tourists swarming through Times Square. But their project at the Lyceum Theater has run into intense opposition from the most powerful theater owner on Broadway.
The dispute has embroiled other theater producers, Broadway labor unions, preservationists and city officials. And, as is often the case in a city of skyscrapers and wrecking balls, a real estate deal is also deeply entwined in the story. 
 The backstage drama pits Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns nearly half the Broadway theaters, against the producers David S. Singer, Thomas Viertel and Richard Frankel, whose collective credits include "Angels in America," "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," "Smokey Joe's Cafe" and "Stomp."
The producers of the new show, "Spirit of Broadway," say it will introduce the wonder of Broadway to newcomers who might be wary of shelling out $70 for a traditional show. But Mr. Schoenfeld contends that the show is not a legitimate theatrical attraction and should not appear at the 928-seat Lyceum, which has a covenant with the city to continue functioning as a legitimate theater.
Also at stake in the dispute is control of the Lyceum itself. It is owned by Mr. Schoenfeld and the Shubert Organization, but Bertelsmann A.G., the giant German media company whose American headquarters is adjacent to the theater, has an option to buy it.
The three producers have lined up Jerry Zaks, the Tony Award-winning director of "The House of Blue Leaves" and "Six Degrees of Separation," for the play, an inside look at the theater world complete with songs and the ghosts of Broadway's greatest actors. The show would run about six times a day, with tickets ($25 for adults, $15 for children) priced to lure some of the 30 million tourists who stream through Times Square every year, most without ever buying a Broadway ticket. The production would employ as many as 50 people in a theater that because of its small size is, more often than not, dark.
The entire program, known as the Broadway Hall of Fame, would also include a backstage tour, memorabilia and videotaped segments of current Broadway shows.
"The show will introduce people who are reluctant to go to a very expensive Broadway theater to the experience of live performance and the special bond it creates between the audience and the performers," Mr. Viertel said.
The three producers have raised about half the $22 million necessary for the project and signed a tentative deal with Bertelsmann for the use of the Lyceum, a landmark Beaux-Arts theater on the east side of the Bertelsmann headquarters at Broadway and 45th Street. Bertelsmann, which is now paying $600,000 a year in rent, would buy the theater for more than $13 million.
But Mr. Schoenfeld has objected, citing the covenant he signed with the city to get approval for the real estate deal that ultimately gave Bertelsmann the air rights from the Lyceum for its office tower. The covenant states that the Lyceum will be preserved as a legitimate theater.
"It's not a play or a musical," Mr. Schoenfeld said of the proposed production. "The Broadway Hall of Fame presentation will have a live component, a museum component and a concession component. To us, that is not a legitimate theatrical use consistent with the covenant."
While Mr. Schoenfeld said his sole concern was upholding the covenant, others suggested that he might be reluctant to see Bertelsmann exercise its option to take over the Lyceum. Another developer holds a similar option at another Shubert theater, the Belasco.
"I don't know why Jerry's opposed," said William Moriarity, president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. "He's got 16 1/2 theaters. He'd have 15 1/2 theaters after this deal. It's a theater that he himself says gets very little use. This looks suspiciously like a real estate problem, not a theater problem."
Whatever the motives behind the dispute, the Lyceum covenant does not define legitimate theater.
"What they say about pornography may apply here," Mr. Schoenfeld suggested helpfully: "You know it when you see it."
There are some other Broadway denizens who privately dismiss the "Spirit of Broadway" project as Broadway lite, a cheap imitation that would allow visitors from the hinterlands to say they had seen a real Broadway show, thereby narrowing the audience rather than expanding it. But many others do not understand the fuss.
"The only difference between this and other Broadway productions is the number of times it'll be shown in a day," Mr. Moriarity said. "We always saw this as a fairly good thing."
As the number of Broadway theaters fell from 60 in the 1930's to fewer than 40 in the 1970's, preservationists and theater activists have sought to preserve the number of legitimate theaters, which last year attracted a record 11.7 million people and gross ticket sales of $588.5 million.
But Mr. Schoenfeld was never in the forefront of such efforts. He opposed the landmarking of the Lyceum and once tried to install a community court in the Longacre, both small theaters that are difficult to book. At the time of the air rights deal, Mr. Schoenfeld described the Lyceum as a "liability," saying: "It doesn't make money; it loses money. It is the oldest theater extant, a two-balcony house on the wrong side of Broadway."
Nevertheless, Mr. Schoenfeld sounded the alarm about the potential "loss" of the Lyceum at a May 28 meeting of the Broadway unions. According to those who attended, the impresario described the "Spirit of Broadway" as a museum, which would employ ticket-takers rather than union actors, stagehands and musicians. He urged them to write letters to Joseph B. Rose, director of the City Planning Commission, opposing the project. Many did.
But then Mr. Frankel and his cohorts swung into action, visiting each union and Mr. Rose to correct what they said was the mistaken impression left by Mr. Schoenfeld. They won the support of Marvin Hamlisch, Harold Prince, Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout Theater, and Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters Corporation.
As a result, the Theatrical Wardrobe Union Local 764 quickly retracted its protest letter to Mr. Rose. Alan Eisenberg, executive director of Actors' Equity, said last week that his letter was "premature," and that the union's executive board would vote on the issue Sept. 14.
"I didn't realize how much work will be involved for Equity members," Mr. Eisenberg said.
In the end, it may be up to Mr. Rose at City Planning, which will have to rule on the issue.
"From the city's perspective, the Broadway theaters are an extremely important cultural, aesthetic and economic resource," Mr. Rose said. "We will adopt an extremely protective approach to the Lyceum. This proposal has been described to us in several ways. Some versions would be unacceptable; others require further study."

HEADLINE: U.N. Says a Quarter of East Timorese Have Fled

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
As many as 200,000 people, nearly a quarter of East Timor's population, have been driven from their homes within the last four days by militias opposed to independence for the territory, the Secretary General's spokesman said here today.
Many displaced people who had sought refuge in churches and aid agencies are being rounded up and forcibly moved across the border to Indonesian West Timor, according to a report from the United Nations mission in East Timor provided by the spokesman, Fred Eckhard. Thousands of others have fled into hills and forests, the report says. 
 Its figures are based on reports from refugees, the few remaining journalists -- who say the capital, Dili, seems all but deserted -- departing aid agencies, church officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which until today had officials on the border with West Timor.
With most foreigners evacuated from East Timor and the remaining 335 United Nations staff members trapped in a compound in Dili, virtually all relief aid has ended, almost no food is available for emergency distribution and the fate of many refugees is unknown. United Nations officials in East Timor say they face an emergency "with potential catastrophic consequences."
But in the absence of a call for international military help from the Indonesian Government, the Security Council continued to stand by, giving President B. J. Habibie and his military commander, Gen. Wiranto, at least 24 more hours to end a reign of terror that seems to have been orchestrated by units of the military. The general, however, may not be able to call a halt to it. The United Nations believes that the Indonesian Army as well as local militias have been involved in the violence.
"I can assure you that the Security Council will not give the green light if there is no permission on the part of the Indonesian Government," Peter van Walsum of the Netherlands, the Security Council president for September, said after a Council meeting.
A five-member Council delegation is due to arrive in Jakarta overnight to warn Indonesian authorities that they will have to stop the violence in East Timor or allow others to do it. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said that the United States still had hopes that the Indonesian military could restore order and that there were no plans at this point for the United States to help an evacuation from East Timor or to send troops to a peacekeeping force.
Today, the situation drove the territory's Nobel prize-winning religious leader, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, out of the country to refuge in Darwin, Australia.
Jose Ramos-Horta, an exiled East Timorese independence leader, said in an interview today that through all the years of conflict in the territory, church buildings and convents had never before been attacked as they have been in recent days. Mr. Ramos-Horta, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Bishop Belo, is in the United States campaigning for immediate military intervention.
Mr. Ramos-Horta and some diplomats here have raise the question of why military intervention has not been requested by Portugal, the former colonial power in East Timor and the country still recognized internationally -- if only technically -- as the administering authority. Indonesia's seizure of the territory in 1995, after Portugal withdrew, was never accepted.
Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United Nations, said in an interview that Portugal had been making such a request, saying that Indonesia had broken the agreement signed in May that allowed the East Timorese to vote on their future. Last week they decisively chose not to remain part of Indonesia, and that vote set off the anti-independence violence.
"The U.N. has to go there because there is an emergency, because there is chaos," he said, adding that his view met resistance in the Council.
David L. Phillips, executive director of Columbia University's Conflict Resolution Program, who visited East Timor earlier this year, said there was a real question whether the Habibie Government could speak any longer for Indonesia on the issue because the military seemed to have control over the situation in East Timor. But he agrees with diplomats that the United Nations cannot go in, for political reasons, unless the Government, however weak, makes the request.
"General Wiranto is being given the chance to demonstrate his ability to re-establish law and order in East Timor," Mr. Phillips said. "If that fails, there will be need for an international force." With a request from the Government, he said, no questions would be raised in the Security Council that would delay or impede its deployment.
He said Indonesia would also be pressured to seek help because it would not want to lose international aid with its economy just emerging from crisis.
Apparently in a gesture of good will toward the East Timorese, Indonesia today freed a rebel leader, Jose Alexandre (Xanana) Gusmao after seven years of detention.
Robert Fowler, Canada's representative on the Security Council, said it was obviously painful for Council members to see themselves portrayed as paralyzed in the face of this crisis. All around, he said, there are cries of why can't the United Nations do something?
"Do they mean, why can't the U.N. go to war with the fourth-largest country in the world?" he asked. "Is that what that means?"
"Indonesia has very specific commitments under the May 5 agreement that it will look after security," he added. "We have all, in a variety of different ways, been trying to cajole, convince, warn the Indonesians that they must do this, that their international reputation depends on it, and the whole world is watching. But up until now they have made it extremely clear that they will not allow a foreign presence into this part of their country.
"There is no taste in the Council or in the world for going to war with Indonesia."
Mr. Phillips said that Indonesia's international reputation might not be foremost in the minds of those responsible for the violence in East Timor but that international opprobrium remained a useful weapon toward a country that is in political turmoil and that is trying to crawl out of a severe financial crisis.

HEADLINE: 2 Are Indicted In Sex Abuse Of a Boy Met On Internet

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
A Yonkers official and a former public-relations executive for Pepsico were indicted today on charges of sexually molesting a Westchester County teen-ager whom they had met separately through the Internet.
The Westchester County District Attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, said in a news conference that the charges stemmed from a continuing investigation into the killing of a 12-year-old Yonkers boy whose body was found alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway in January. There was no suggestion that either man was a suspect in the murder case. 
 James Surdoval, 42, who was chief of staff to Terence M. Zaleski, the former Yonkers Mayor, and who is currently an economic development official for the city, was arrested on charges of third-degree sodomy and endangering the welfare of a child. At an arraignment this afternoon, Judge Kenneth Lange of Westchester County Court set bail at $20,000.
Patrick Murphy, 45, who had worked in public relations for Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y., was charged with 18 counts of third-degree sodomy, 1 count of endangering the welfare of a child and 1 count of third-degree reckless endangerment. The final count accuses Mr. Murphy, who is infected with H.I.V., of not using a condom during sex acts and not disclosing his health status.
Mr. Murphy's bail was set at $20,000 by Judge Barbara G. Zambelli of Westchester County Court.
The two arrests were the latest in an investigation by the Westchester County District Attorney's office into the abuse of the Internet by suspected pedophiles. More arrests are expected, Ms. Pirro said.
Last week, another Westchester County man was indicted on charges that he sexually abused four boys whom he had met through the Internet. The man, Robert D. DeRosario, 36, who was already awaiting trial on 17 counts of sexually molesting and sodomizing five other boys, is a suspect in the killing of Orlandito Rosario Maldonado of Yonkers, law enforcement officials said. The boy was last seen in Mr. DeRosario's apartment building in Yonkers.
It was not known if Mr. Murphy and Mr. Surdoval knew each other or knew of each other's contacts with the Westchester boy, who is 15 years old, Ms. Pirro said. Mr. Surdoval, who lives in Yonkers, had one sexual encounter with the boy, in July 1998, officials said, whereas Mr. Murphy, of Port Chester, had "numerous encounters" with him between November 1998 and January 1999.
People in Yonkers politics reacted with shock and dismay today upon learning of the charges against Mr. Surdoval, a respected policy maker who had also worked closely with Mayor Nicholas C. Wascisko during the city's housing desegregation battle in the 1980's. Mr. Surdoval's lawyer, Neal Comer, did not return a phone call left at his office.
Bob Donnelly, a friend of Mr. Surdoval who is a lawyer in New York City, said Mr. Surdoval phoned him today to tell him of his arrest. "He told me he was absolutely innocent of the charges, and he intends to fight this vigorously," Mr. Donnelly said. "He sounded upset but determined."
Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers issued a statement today that read in part: "To those who would rush to judgment in this matter, I urge restraint. The filing of charges is simply a prosecutor's formal accusation, and it is the first step in a legal process with a time-honored tradition of presuming the accused innocent unless proved otherwise. We support Jim and will await the outcome of these legal proceedings."
The statement went on to say that Mr. Surdoval would "continue as director of the Office of Downtown and Waterfront Development during the course of this matter."
Another political associate, Ed Meyer, who is a member of the State Board of Regents and a former State Assemblyman, called Mr. Surdoval a "person of high integrity" and a "prodigious public servant."
Few details about Mr. Murphy's former job at Pepsico were available today. A spokeswoman for Pepsico, Elaine Franklin, said only that he left in early 1996 after going on "long-term disability."
Mrs. Pirro said that on Thursday, her office planned to mail pamphlets to public libraries and schools across Westchester, warning of the possible dangers faced by children who use the Internet unsupervised.
"The Internet continues to give pedophiles and others who seek to have contact with children the opportunity to have access in a way we have never seen before," she said.
She urged parents and adults to tell children not to give their names or addresses to anyone they meet through Internet chat rooms and to warn them not to make arrangement to meet them in person.
"Even though kids are told, 'Don't talk to strangers,' they're not being told not to meet strangers via the Internet," she said.

HEADLINE: Gore Pledges A Health Plan For Every Child

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore proposed today to guarantee access to affordable health insurance for all children by 2005, expanding on a program enacted two years ago that he conceded had had limited success so far.
Mr. Gore acknowledged that the number of Americans without health coverage had increased steadily since he and President Clinton took office. But in a speech at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, in Hollywood, he said, "If you elect me President, I will insure that by the year 2005, every single child in our country has full access to fully affordable health coverage." 
 The number of uninsured children rose by roughly 2.5 million in the last decade, to 11 million in 1997, the last year for which official data are available.
When Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, it gave the states billions of dollars and considerable flexibility in how the money could be used. Mr. Gore said he would expand eligibility for the program by increasing the limits on family income and by allowing some parents to enroll with their children. He would also impose financial penalties on states that did not meet Federal targets for the enrollment of children, while offering bonuses for states that did.
The Administration said in July that 1.3 million children had been enrolled in the children's insurance program. Mr. Clinton said that he would have expected at least three million by now and that he was therefore "a little disappointed."
Aides to Mr. Gore said his proposals, taken together, could provide coverage for 11 million to 15 million Americans, most of them children. The number of people without health insurance has been rising in the last decade and now exceeds 43 million.
The goal of offering affordable health insurance to all children, though ambitious, is modest by comparison with Mr. Clinton's original plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans.
"We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one fell swoop," Mr. Gore said in underlining the differences between his approach and the grand schemes devised in 1993 by the President and his wife, Hillary.
He also took a dig at the leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, noting that one-fourth of the children in that state lack insurance, a higher proportion than in almost any other state.
While focusing on children, Mr. Gore offered several proposals today to increase coverage of adults, too. He proposed a new tax credit to offset 25 percent of the cost of health insurance bought by individuals who lack access to employer-sponsored coverage.
"Today, companies that provide coverage get a tax break," he said. "But not individuals who have to get coverage on their own. That's just not fair, and we have to change it."
Many Republicans in Congress agree.
In addition, Mr. Gore's proposal to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997, would extend coverage to the seven million uninsured adults whose children are eligible for either Medicaid or the new children's program.
The logic of the proposal is simple. Most uninsured children come from families in which the parents are themselves uninsured. But Mr. Gore's proposal raises a question of equity and fairness: Why should the Government provide subsidized health insurance to adults with children while denying it to adults of working age without children?
Mr. Gore did not say how much his proposals would cost or how he would pay for them. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Vice President, said, "This will be done in the context of a balanced budget, and we'll put out a detailed budget proposal later, but we have no price tag right now."
Health-care experts said the cost of Mr. Gore's proposals would almost surely exceed $24 billion over five years, the amount appropriated by Congress to cover a maximum of five million youngsters in the new health program for children.
Administration officials have chided Congress and governors for not doing more to increase health insurance coverage. But this is a tricky issue for Mr. Gore, because the Clinton-Gore Administration shares responsibility for the failure to fulfill the promise of programs already enacted at the President's request.
Despite a vibrant economy, Mr. Gore said today, the number of Americans without health insurance has been growing by about a million a year. This is "one of the few social indicators that have not improved under the strong Clinton-Gore economy," says a new paper on health policy prepared by the Gore campaign. Even though Congress has created and expanded several health programs, enrollment has been "woefully inadequate," it says.
White House officials have known for several years that at least four million children eligible for Medicaid were not enrolled, and there is no evidence that this number has fallen, despite many efforts and exhortations by Federal officials in Washington.
Mr. Gore repeated Administration proposals to define the rights of patients in health maintenance organizations, to establish new prescription drug benefits under Medicare and to provide a modest tax credit for the cost of nursing home care. But the focus of his speech was on uninsured children, and Mr. Gore offered these ideas to deal with the problem:
*The Federal Government should impose financial penalties on states that do not meet Federal targets for enrolling youngsters in Medicaid and in the new health program for children. At the same time, the Government would pay bonuses to states that meet their goals. (Mr. Gore said this would make states accountable for their performance. But critics said it would reward states that are succeeding, at the expense of states that are struggling.)
*States could expand eligibility for the new Children's Health Insurance Program, so families with incomes up to 2.5 times the official poverty level could qualify. In most states, the ceiling on family income is set at twice the poverty level. For a family of four, the poverty level this year is $16,700.
*More affluent families should be allowed to buy insurance coverage for youngsters through Medicaid or the new children's health program if the parents work for companies that do not provide health benefits. Such families would have to pay the full premium, but this would often be a bargain compared with prices in the private market, because large government programs have much greater purchasing power than individuals. The Gore campaign said there were more than two million uninsured children in families with incomes exceeding 2.5 times the official poverty level.
Health-care experts said Mr. Gore's proposals would clearly help some working families, but might divert states from the task of finding and enrolling children who are already eligible for health benefits.
Mr. Gore would give states a bonus for enrolling children in a program that already offers states a generous financial incentive to do just that. In the new Children's Health Insurance Program, as in Medicaid, the Federal Government and the states share the costs, but the Federal Government pays a larger share of the costs in the new program.
Some of Mr. Gore's proposals are intended to restore health insurance for tens of thousands of children who lost coverage when their families were removed from the welfare rolls. In theory, most such children were still eligible for Medicaid, but their parents did not always realize it, and officials in some states improperly cut off health benefits along with cash assistance.
 
A CLOSER LOOK -- Gore's Proposal
Following are the principal goals of a health-care proposal that Vice President Al Gore outlined yesterday in an address at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles:
*Guarantee access to affordable insurance for all children by 2005.
*Expand eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program to include children in a family of four with an income of up to $41,750.
*Let uninsured parents enroll in this program if their children are eligible.
*Penalize states that fail to meet Federal goals for insuring children.
*Provide tax credits to help individuals and small businesses buy health insurance.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Is Warned It Could Lose Western Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund separately warned Indonesia today that the financial aid that has kept the country economically afloat for the last two years could be suspended if violence in East Timor is not brought under control.
A State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today that "productive relations between Indonesia and the international community, including the I.M.F., depend on Indonesia adopting a constructive approach towards ending the humanitarian disaster in East Timor." 
 Several hours later, the fund, which has administered the multibillion-dollar emergency package to Indonesia since the Asian economic crisis struck two years ago this month, said it was considering holding up a review later this month of Indonesia's economic troubles. Without it, the fund's board cannot approve the next loan installment.
Administration officials said the statements today were clearly intended as a warning to President B.J. Habibie that his biggest claim to success so far -- that he has worked with the I.M.F. and kept national bankruptcy at bay -- would be imperiled if he could not get Indonesia's military to stop the violence aimed at pro-independence East Timorese and United Nations personnel.
President Clinton is likely to have a chance to make that case to Mr. Habibie directly this weekend, when both leaders attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Auckland, New Zealand.
"There is a lot of running around right now, but no clear sense of what direction we should go and how hard to push," one senior Administration official said today. "No one is sure how much the U.S. could contribute to a U.N. peacekeeping force, even if one was invited in."
 In Canberra, Australia, Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday that the United States was likely to provide logistical support for any multinational peacekeeping force, Agence France-Presse reported. He said his Defense Minister, John Moore, had spoken to Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain overnight. "We are confident now that the Americans would provide at least logistical support," Mr. Howard said.
If the Administration carried through on its warnings, it would be suspending an aid package that the Treasury and national security advisers assembled in 1997.
Mr. Rubin was quick to say today that his warning to Indonesia "doesn't mean that any specific loan or any specific fund" might be frozen. But the only real economic leverage the United States holds is its power within the I.M.F. to block disbursement of the next payment of loans.
Those loans are partly intended to stabilize the banks, but they also allow Mr. Habibie to continue using government money to subsidize food and fuel. If those subsidies ended and prices soared, it could easily set off the kind of violence that helped oust President Suharto last year.

HEADLINE: MAKING A MEDIA GIANT: THE REGULATORS;
Wide Belief U.S. Will Let A Vast Deal Go Through

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
If there were a nursery character to symbolize this year's corporate deal-making, it would almost certainly be a variation of Humpty-Dumpty, in which he was finally put back together again.
Nearly 30 years ago, Viacom Inc. became an independent company after regulators forced CBS to sell its cable television and syndication units. And about 60 years before that, the Government ordered the breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which led to the creation of Exxon and Mobil, two of the world's largest oil companies. 
 Now regulators in Washington are nearing completion of their review of the proposal by the Exxon Corporation to buy the Mobil Corporation just as other officials begin their examination of Viacom's plan to buy CBS in the richest merger of media companies in history. Earlier this year, the regulators once again approved a merger of two of the regional Bell telephone companies, companies that had been created as part of the antitrust breakup of the AT&T Corporation.
While experts agreed today that CBS and Viacom may have to shed a handful of television stations and other assets to complete the deal, there is a widespread consensus that at the end of the day Washington will bless the acquisition.
What has made all these corporate deals, which would have been unthinkable a generation ago, possible?
The short answer is that the companies and the economics of the industries they serve have changed sharply and as a consequence, so has the regulatory climate.
"The feeling is that the winds of competition are blowing and therefore anything can happen," said Professor Eleanor Fox, an antitrust scholar at the New York University School of Law. "The perception is that markets are more open than earlier times and that barriers are lower. In any of these markets, firms are more under the gun to survive growing competition. And of course, the philosophy of regulation has changed. It used to be there was a lot of socio-economic concern for the concentration of power in a few hands. The concentration of power used to be seen in a dark light."
"Now," Ms. Fox added, "the concern is that businesses be free from regulation in order to compete in the global marketplace."
Despite these changes, executives at CBS and Viacom today acknowledged that there important obstacles to the deal remain.
The Federal Communications Commission generally has the authority to approve or disapprove any telecommunications merger to make sure it is in the public interest. The agency which has not yet been formally notified by the companies, said in a statement that its policy "is to evaluate mergers to see if they meet the public interest standard."
"We will certainly evaluate this one when it is filed with us," the agency statement said.
But three regulations in particular limit the ownership concentration of networks and television stations. As a result, CBS and Viacom will have to either persuade the regulators to change the rules, seek waivers or, more likely, sell some of their interests in television stations and one of the two networks they now own.
So it was hardly surprising today when Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, and Mel Karmazin, chief executive of CBS, announced that they would spend Wednesday huddled with top officials at the F.C.C. to both explain the deal and criticize some broadcast ownership rules, a few of which the agency announced only five weeks ago.
One older regulation that is of particular concern to the executives prohibits a company from controlling more than 35 percent of the television broadcasting market. The cap used to be 25 percent but was raised to 35 percent as part of legislation that largely deregulated the telecommunications industry three years ago. CBS already owns stations reaching 32 percent of American households, and its acquisition by Viacom would increase that to 41 percent. But the F.C.C. has indicated it is now reconsidering the cap.
A second F.C.C. rule prohibits a company from owning two networks, which is a problem because because Viacom has a 50 percent interest in the UPN network.
A third rule, adopted last month, substantially relaxes the television station limits that had restricted ownership for most of the century. The new standards permit a company to own two stations in cities where there are a sufficient number of "media voices," which include all radio and television stations, large daily newspapers and cable systems. Specifically a city must have at least eight independently owned television stations for a single company to own two.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Regulatory Hurdles"
Like most big media mergers, the Viacom-CBS deal will be subject to review by antitrust regulators and the Federal Communications Commission. Besides the F.C.C.'s mandate to review any merger involving broadcast licenses, to determine whether it is in the public interest, the agency has three rules that could affect the proposed Viacom-CBS merger. Here are the rules and their relevance to the deal.
 
NETWORK OWNERSHIP LIMIT
A company that owns a broadcast television network can own no more than one-third of a second network. Because Viacom already owns 50 percent of the UPN network, it would have to reduce that stake - or get the rule changed - in order to acquire CBS.
 
NATIONAL STATION LIMIT
A company cannot own television stations whose total reach exceeds 35 percent of the nation's television households. CBS's stations already reach 32 percent of households, and adding Viacom's stations would raise the total to 41 percent. Selling some stations - or getting the rule changed - would be necessary.
 
LOCAL STATION LIMIT
According to a rule announced only last month, which relaxed previous restrictions, a company can now own two television stations in a single metropolitan area - as long as the market ends up with at least eight independently owned stations and as long as a single company does not own more than one of the four top-rated stations in that market. Viacom and CBS both own stations in six metropolitan markets: Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Dallas. All of those markets currently have enough stations to make Viacom and CBS eligible for joint ownership.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The Great Home Run Race, Part II

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
They start three hours before game time, behind the ivy-covered wall of Wrigley Field, under the right-field bleachers, in the batting cage. This is where home run swings are built.
It's just two men, Sammy Sosa and his hitting coach, alone except for the shotgun sound of white ash on horsehide. Between underhand tosses from eight paces, the coach, Jeff Pentland, passes on the mantras he learned from studying Ted Williams. "Stay back." "Give yourself time to recognize the pitch." "Stay within yourself." 
 In his white pinstriped uniform pants and a blue sleeveless T-shirt, Sosa swings intently but easily, driving the ball into the net. It's five more swings, then two more, then end on a good one.
"How was that?" Sosa asks. Pentland answers through his chewing tobacco, "Ninety-nine percent."
A once-a-generation event is happening for the second straight year. The sluggers who entertained baseball fans and the nation last summer, Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, are again within reach of the record for most home runs in a season.
Only this time the leader is Sammy Sosa. With less than one month to go, Sosa leads McGwire, 58 to 54. No one-hit wonder, Sosa is excelling on a team so dreadful that Cubs fans have changed that old baseball lament to "Wait till next century."
And he's just warming up. Sosa, who did not homer in a doubleheader against Cincinnati today, needs to hit a home run every other day to reach McGwire's record of 70; that's just what he has done over the past month. If he were to hit as many in the Cubs' remaining 24 games as he has hit in the past 24 games, Sosa would finish with a record 73.
The McGwire-Sosa reprise provides a second chance for those who rooted for Sosa -- because he was the underdog, or because he wasn't pumping up his muscles with questionable substances, or just because he was having so much fun.
One year ago on Sept. 7, McGwire bested Babe Ruth's 1927 mark of 60 home runs. The next day, he made obsolete Roger Maris's 1961 record of 61. Then began the friendly competition with Sosa, who finished at 66 homers while McGwire pushed on to 70.
McGwire is a perennial, but few expected Sosa to do it again.
Before this season, 43 baseball fans in Chicago, mostly office workers in the downtown Loop, got together in a home run pool. In picking their roster of players, they were limited to only one of last year's leaders. Out of 43 fans, in Chicago, only 6 chose Sosa.
"I can't believe he's done it again this year," said one of the entrants, Mike Olah, 28, who works for an investment firm. "The winds seemed to be blowing the Cubs' way last year, and I figured that was the case for Sammy, too."
Fans saw how Sosa spent his vacation: throwing out the first pitch at the World Series, parading through New York City, helping the victims of a hurricane in his native Dominican Republic, lighting the national Christmas tree, touring Japan, sitting with the First Lady at the State of the Union Message and joking with Jay Leno.
And fans see Slammin' Sammy's exuberance during the game. How he starts the game sprinting to his position in right field, swapping salutes with the Bleacher Bums. How, in the first inning, he taps the umpire and the catcher on the back of the leg with his bat, just to say hello. How he follows a home run pop with a hop high in the air, and then, back in the dugout, blows kisses to the camera for his family.
Fans do not see Sosa's preparation for the game. Before noon, hours before an afternoon game at Wrigley, this is usually the time for rookies and old men. At third base, 23-year-old Cole Liniak is taking groundballs, hoping his first week in the majors won't be his last. At the gate on Waveland Avenue, Marty Mahinsk, age 77, is stacking up programs to sell, as he has since 1939.
In the cage, the 30-year-old Sosa is working on his swing, as Pentland's mantras continue. "The hands," he says, "are the communicators to the ball." The batting practice on the field just before the game is for timing. But the time in the cage is for the swing.
It's also the time to shed bad feelings after a strikeout or another Cubs loss. For Sosa is in danger of breaking another record: Never has a player hit more home runs than his team has won games. So far, Sosa leads the Cubs by two.
"He's a very emotional person, and he tends to be moody," Pentland said. "When he's in a bad mood, he wants to be by himself. But it doesn't affect his production on the field. He has incredible inner drive. The greater the pressure, the greater his performance."
It has been a most dismal year in a dismal century for his last-place Cubs. Everyone is being nice to the manager, because he's not expected to be back next year. The problem areas seem to be pitching, hitting and fielding.
During a game this summer, as fans tell the story, a Bleacher Bum in right field called over an usher. "These guys are bothering me," he said. "Which guys?" the usher asked. The fan pointed to the Cubs.
Not all great home run hitters have played on great teams. For every Ruth and Maris and Mickey Mantle, there is a Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the 1940's, a Jimmie Foxx of the Philadelphia Athletics of 1932 and a Willie Mays of the New York Giants of 1955.
Even playing for losers, Sosa and McGwire are drawing the largest crowds on the road. But there is no mania, no bidding for the home run balls, no tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on what they might be worth. It's as if the nation has been inoculated against outright home run fever.
It is possible the home run is being devalued by its frequency, the product of weak pitching in an expanding league. In a single game on Friday night in Philadelphia, the Cincinnati players hit nine home runs. In more than a century of baseball, only 29 times has a player hit 50 or more home runs in a season; 12 of those seasons have happened in the 1990's.
But home run inflation doesn't explain why Sosa and McGwire are one-third ahead of the other players in baseball. In their National League, Jeff Bagwell of Houston was third in home runs with 39 before today's games. In the American League, Rafael Palmeiro of Texas and Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle had 42. No one is close to "those guys."
"They're good" is Billy Williams's short explanation. The Hall of Fame player, and Sosa's first hitting coach with the Cubs, has a longer answer, too: "They're strong. They're quick. And every pitcher is told to keep the ball down, to guard against the home run. Those guys are low-ball hitters."
A fan can compare their swings six more times this season. McGwire's Cardinals and Sosa's Cubs play three games in Chicago, Sept. 20-22, and the last three games of the season, Oct. 1-3, in St. Louis. (That first game will be played on McGwire's 36th birthday.) Both managers say they will pitch to the other team's slugger, if the other team pitches to their guy.
The baseball statisticians believe a new home run record is attainable. The detail: Sosa has 24 games to go. Extrapolation: In his previous 24 games, he has hit 15 home runs (result: 73). Extrapolation: In his final 24 games last year, he hit 11 (result: 69). McGwire has 22 games to go; in his previous 22 games, he has hit 7 (result: 61); in his final 22 games last year, he hit 11 (result: 65.)
The failure of both teams has brought criticism of Sosa and McGwire from some fans and commentators, who suggest that their spectacular performances have somehow hurt their teams. While Sosa and McGwire are among the league leaders in runs batted in, Sosa leads in strikeouts, with McGwire not far down the list.
Strikeouts are common for home run hitters -- Ruth had 1,330, enough to fill three full seasons -- but some suggest the two players are a little selfish, swinging for the home run when a more cautious swing for a single might help the team more. Or perhaps their excellence is distracting their teammates.
Sosa doesn't follow that logic.
"They pay me to do my job," he said. "Just because the team is struggling, it doesn't mean I have to be struggling. If everybody had 57 home runs right now, we would be in first place."

HEADLINE: Yawning as the Earth Warms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bill McKibben (Op-Ed, Sept. 4) is right to wonder what will shock us into waking up to the realities of global warming. However, our actions are determined as much by the incentive systems shaped by our economic and social institutions as by individual perceptions. 
 Many Americans are aware of the coming environmental crisis but are personally unwilling to do anything about it until they see everyone else doing something as well. Once we appreciate this societal nature of the problem, it is easier to recognize that our inaction results more from a lack of collective political leadership than from individual disinterest or neglect.

Re Bob Herbert's Sept. 6 column on the Economic Policy Institute's study showing that middle-class workers are only slightly better off now than they were 10 years ago: When comparisons are made over a 10-year period, we must ask if the same groups are being compared. 
 It must be remembered that the median family is much different from what it was. The booming economy has pulled in both legal and illegal immigrants. Many of these workers have less training and are more difficult to employ.
And many disabled people who never worked before are in the labor force today.
Regarding health care coverage, the study compared the situation of those workers who had a college degree and those who did not. Yet the percentage of the population going to college has increased.
The brightest and best-motivated workers are those who are in the better-off group with college degrees.

Re "Gap Between Rich and Poor Found Substantially Wider" (news article, Sept. 5): Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggests that market rules set by Congress and lobbied for by the rich allow them to become richer. When there is only so much money, if the rich earn more, others -- the poor -- earn less. 
 Yet having a low income not only means buying less. Poor people are generally in worse health than the rich. Poor children are more likely to have elevated lead levels, which affects their capacity for learning. Women living in or near poverty have a higher proportion of low-birth-weight babies than do rich women, and babies in poor families have a higher infant mortality rate than the babies of rich women. As the richest country in the world, why do we let only a few share the wealth?

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Gore's Speech on Care

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an address on health care yesterday by Vice President Al Gore at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, as recorded by The New York Times:
For more than 50 years we have been engaged in a battle to provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people. Now after that long century of effort, conflict and concern, it is time to move past theoretical and philosophical divisions beyond a sterile debate about labels and abstractions to ask what we can do now to take concrete, specific, realistic steps to improve health coverage for all of the American people.
Today I'm proposing and with your help as President, I will fight for a series of steps to do just that. We must and we can insure a set of rights so that all Americans can have health coverage and actually get the care they are -- all Americans who have health coverage, will get the care they are entitled to. We must and we can secure access to affordable quality health care for every child in the entire country by the year 2005. Join with me and we will do that. We must and we can move toward access to affordable, quality health care for every American family. 
 This is a fundamentally different approach. We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one fell swoop. Experience has taught us that there is a way to keep what is right while fixing what is wrong with American health care.
The focus of my proposal is health care for working families. It will put doctors and patients in charge, not H.M.O.'s and insurance companies. The steps that I'm proposing here today will guarantee access to affordable health coverage for every child in America and will provide health-care options for millions more adults. But let me be clear. We cannot rest until every single American has affordable health coverage. . . .
Some will argue that greater access to health care is a luxury we can't afford even as they covet our record surplus for the special interests and propose to blow it on a risky tax scheme that would drive us right back into spiraling Federal deficits. For more than two decades I have seen the struggle between working families and special interests. The tobacco lobby, the gun lobby, those who stood against the Family Leave Bill I co-sponsored in the Senate. We've had to fight them all and we're not about to stop now. Others will argue against reforming our health-care system carefully, realistically and step by step. Some of them will tell you that the only acceptable answer is a one-size-fits-all solution. But I believe Americans know better. They know, you and I know, we need visionary but practical change, change that can be enacted into law, change that works for working families, change that meets their cares and concerns, that respects the diversity of health-care needs. Our cause is working families. And in this campaign and in the years ahead, let's put their interests first, ahead of the special interests, ahead of anything.
This is a unique moment for our nation, for our people. Our economy is strong, indeed we are in the midst of the longest period of prosperity in our peacetime history. But we know that prosperity alone will not meet the challenges that we face in American health care. And as Harry Truman reminded us when he began this fight 50 years ago, in a time of prosperity, we can afford many things. But ill-health which can be prevented or cured is one thing we cannot afford.
We must use our prosperity now to bring new change to our health-care system, to make our families healthier and more hopeful for the new century ahead. That's the kind of change that works for working families. And that's why I'm running for President of the United States.

HEADLINE: Planners Approve Harlem Shopping Center

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
The City Planning Commission yesterday approved a large shopping center for East Harlem that would bring Manhattan its first Home Depot and Costco stores.
The project, East River Plaza, was approved 9 to 3 after the developer, Blumenfeld Development Group, of Syosset, agreed to modify the facade and change the design to ease traffic. The two-level, 475,000-square-foot shopping center would be built on the former Washburn Wire Company factory site along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive between 116th and 119th Streets. 
 "It's an important project for the economy of East Harlem and the city as a whole," said Joseph B. Rose, the Chairman of the Planning Commission. "The stores we think will do very well, and provide an important retail opportunity and a significant number of jobs. At the same time, it's a sensitive location, adjacent to residential areas."
The revised plans call for cars to enter the shopping center on 116th Street and leave on 117th Street, instead of doing both on 116th Street. "A great deal of traffic was going to make some very complicated turning maneuvers," Mr. Rose said.
Another change calls for the facade facing the highway to be clad in masonry instead of metal panels.
David Blumenfeld, the project manager, said he was not unhappy with the modifications, even though they would add millions of dollars to the cost, previously estimated at $150 million. "They made a big effort to make it work," Mr. Blumenfeld said of the City Planning Department. "I think it improves the project."
In addition to the 24-hour Home Depot store and the Costco warehouse store, the shopping center would include several other large retailers and parking for 1,250 cars. Mr. Blumenfeld said he was negotiating with Gap, its Old Navy subsidiary, Best Buy and Staples.
The next hurdle for Mr. Blumenfeld and his partner, Canyon Capital Management, is approval from the City Council, which has 50 days to act. Councilman Philip Reed, who represents East Harlem, said he favors the project but wants to make sure that all the traffic and design concerns have been addressed and that most of the new jobs will go to local residents.
The final plans must also be approved by the Empire State Development Corporation. A vote is expected within a couple of months, said a spokeswoman, Maura Z. Gallucci.

HEADLINE: Charter School Days Dawn in New York

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
This summer, Annie Harris, a P.T.A. vice president at Public School 65 in the South Bronx, put her daughter's name in the lottery for New York City's first charter school, a new kind of experimental school that supporters portray as the salvation of public education. The only person she told was her husband, a limousine driver, and she swore him to secrecy.
Although P.S. 65 is a failing school, Ms. Harris felt guilty about deserting it. She is a leader in the effort to fix it, and proudly confides that she is on a first-name basis with Chancellor Rudy Crew. But Loretta's future came first. 
No matter that the new school was in a church building in Harlem that is on a street as forlorn as any in the South Bronx. Its promise transcended geography.
"One of our kids is making it out of the Bronx," Ms. Harris said, overjoyed when Loretta won the lottery.
This week, about 1,000 schoolchildren, Loretta among them, will enter the first three schools to be created under New York State's new charter law. Two are in New York City, and one is in Albany.
A year ago, Ms. Harris and the other families, many of them among the state's poorest and most disadvantaged, would have had no choice but to go to traditional public schools. They switched because they are searching for new hope for their children, and because educators and politicians have given them faith that charter schools can cure everything that the stereotype says public schools lack: good teachers, higher test scores, discipline and safety.
It is far too soon to say whether charter schools, which are publicly financed but free of the Board of Education control and union rules, will work or be one more broken promise for families who feel they have been betrayed before.
But the dreams of parents and educators are just one face of the fledgling charter school movement. As Loretta's new school, the Sisulu Children's Academy, opens today, a day ahead of other New York City public schools, it is also the story of millions of taxpayer dollars going to a private start-up company with no track record.
The company, Victory Schools Inc., is run by a Wall Street financier better known for his billion-dollar leveraged buyouts than for his educational credentials. It promises to outperform surrounding public schools not by spending more, but by using novice, relatively low-paid teachers trained in a packaged curriculum, based on the popular "core knowledge" books by E. D. Hirsch Jr. and on another method, direct instruction, which dictates what teachers will do and say almost every minute of the day.
Victory intends to propagate schools as efficiently -- and if its owner realizes his ambition, nearly as profitably -- as McDonald's makes hamburgers.
Along the way, it has struck an informal partnership with a major institution in Harlem, the Canaan Baptist Church. By renting the church's nearly unused community center, the school is helping to rejuvenate the church. For its part, the church, led by the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, who lobbied for charter schools in Albany, is lending the school its credibility.
A decade ago, there were no charter schools anywhere in the country. (The first was in Minnesota in 1992.) Now there are more than 1,200, from schools in Arizona that have been investigated for financial improprieties to schools in Boston and Los Angeles that have been widely praised for their innovations.
What they have in common is that they are run by private organizations that have petitioned a governmental body for a charter to operate a school for a set period of years free from many union and civil service rules. These organizations must spell out what they propose to accomplish and, in New York's case, face monitoring by the State Board of Regents, not local boards of education.
When New York passed its charter school law last December, it entered the scene fairly late, becoming the 34th state to allow them.
The law imposes a limit of 100 on the number of charter schools that can be created, but there is no limit on the number of existing public schools that can convert to charter status.
Sisulu is among three new schools approved for this fall by the State University of New York board of trustees, which shared approval power with the Board of Regents. The second, the John A. Reisenbach School, is also in Harlem, but as a nonprofit institution, modeled on an existing small public school, it is less of a challenge to the status quo.
The third, New Covenant, is in Albany. It is a partnership between the Urban League and Advantage Schools Inc., a private company that runs schools in other states. Like Sisulu, it is intended to make a profit.
Sisulu, for one, has promised to do better than other public schools in the neighborhood, which are among the lowest-performing in the city. Even if the school fails to meet its test-score targets after three years, there is an escape clause: if 70 percent of the families approve of the school, the contractor may remain. But if it does not meet its targets within five years, Mr. Klinsky said, the state can revoke its charter.
Since the school goes up only to the second grade, children will not be required to take state tests, which begin in the third grade, this year. It is to expand by one grade each year.
Sisulu is the creation of Steven B. Klinsky, a partner in the investment firm of Forstmann Little & Company, which has no stake in the charter school. Mr. Klinsky said he started the school for a combination of altruistic and unabashedly capitalist reasons.
Quoting Martin Buber, he tells how he believes that everyone was placed on this earth to accomplish one good thing. "I can't invent a new medicine," Mr. Klinsky said. "But I can do something in education."
In 1993, he started an after-school program in memory of his brother, Gary, in East New York, an impoverished part of Brooklyn. That program, now serving 460 children, is nonprofit. Sisulu plans to use a similar after-school program.
But Mr. Klinsky contends that despite the populist veneer of charter schools, only a contractor with significant assets can overcome the financial and logistical hurdles needed to open one. Even before the first student has arrived, Mr. Klinsky said, he has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the school. To make a profit, he needs to achieve economy of scale by opening other charter schools.
The school's business plan permits up to 22 percent of its revenue to go to the contractor, at least 7 percent as profit. Mr. Klinsky expects to collect at least $6,000 per student and about double that for special education students.
"It's just about impossible for a normal group of citizens to open a charter school," he said. "For one thing, the economic requirements are very high."
Mr. Klinsky has capitalized, as well, on his political connections. The board of advisers to the school includes Erskine B. Bowles, former chief of staff to President Clinton, and the Rev. Floyd W. Flake, a former Congressman.
When Mr. Walker proposed to start a school but faced questions about the separation of church and state, Mr. Klinsky came to the rescue by agreeing to rent the community center, on 115th Street between Lenox and St. Nicholas Avenues, for $160,000 a year. After the first year, the business plan contemplates expanding to an adjoining church-owned building, with rent rising $48,000 a year. Two church members are unpaid Sisulu trustees.
The church has been the lure for some parents.
"It should be pretty good," said Valerie Banks, whose son, James, will go to first grade at Sisulu. "It can't be too wrong, because Canaan Baptist won't let anything go too wrong."
In the rush to recruit students, volunteers handed out thousands of fliers in hospitals and at subway stops, promising a refuge from existing public schools "with the quality of a good private school, but with no tuition." Some students were recruited by church members and people on the school staff.
Anyone living in the city was eligible to enter a bingo-style lottery for admission. Some parents waited more than two hours for the names of the lucky children to be fished from a drum. Despite the showmanship, almost every child who applied found a place.
The school hired teachers through newspaper ads and word of mouth, receiving 150 applications and hiring 11. Three of the teachers are uncertified. School leaders would not disclose the salaries offered, but many of the teachers are beginners who have never led an elementary school classroom and will need considerable support to succeed.
"I left corporate America," said Cathy Inniss, one of the teachers, a former commercial insurance underwriter. Her previous teaching experience, she said, was as a mentor to students in her Catholic high school and as a Girl Scout leader.
School officials have worked hard to instill a sense of ownership in the parents. The principal, Berthe Faustin, a petite, authoritative woman, promised that parents could visit their children's classrooms whenever they wanted. Some teachers, she said, would even give out their home phone numbers.
But in other ways, Sisulu is like any other public school. Class sizes are larger than those in elite private schools, and about on par with those in surrounding city schools.
The contract lists spending per pupil, including teacher salaries, textbooks, supplies and aides, of $3,110, compared with an average in Harlem public schools of $3,500.
The curriculum -- Direct Instruction for reading and math; Core Knowledge for history and science -- is focused on helping children pass the standardized tests, leaving as little as possible to chance.
In Direct Instruction, teachers are expected to follow a script, word by word, gesture by gesture. A consultant, Jane DeNapoli, spent seven days before school opened training the new teaching staff in the verbal prompts and hand gestures that Direct Instruction uses to cue children.
"Get ready," the teachers intoned again and again, copying Ms. DeNapoli's inflection exactly.
Core Knowledge, developed by Dr. Hirsch, a professor at the University of Virginia, tries to define cultural literacy, from nursery rhymes to historic events. Dr. Hirsch is the author of the commercially successful series of books "What Your First Grader Needs to Know," and so on for each grade.
To many parents, the cookie-cutter approach was reassuring, and parents seemed beguiled by the opportunity to try something new and different. Many of the parents have been shopping for effective, high-scoring schools, and Sisulu has done some recruiting, giving it an advantage over neighborhood schools forced to accept all nearby residents.
Loretta Harris was a top student at P.S. 65. She was recruited by Laurie Brown, a curriculum developer who worked at P.S. 65 and was hired by Mr. Klinsky.
Valerie Banks, who is on public assistance, would send her only son, James, to private school if she could afford it. She knows that her neighborhood school, P.S. 144 in Harlem, ranks among the lowest in the city, with 21.7 percent of students reading at grade level and 12.5 percent doing math at grade level in 1999.
When she spotted a flier promoting Sisulu, she jumped at the opportunity. "It's a risk, but what caught my eye was that it said discipline," she said. "When you're a poor person, public school is usually your only option."
Sisulu has given James a scholarship for his uniform, supplying two pairs of pants, two shirts, a sweater and a tie. Ms. Banks's mother, a retired transit cleaner, contributed 8 long-sleeved white shirts, one short-sleeved shirt and 24 pairs of socks. Now all he needs are the black shoes. (His good Easter shoes are blue.)
Last week, James received a welcoming card from his teachers. "Can't wait to see you," it said, signed, "Mr. Henderson and Miss Ortiz." His cousin, who will also go the school, got a postcard, too, but with a different message on it. Ms. Banks was pleased by the difference, concluding that the teachers had written the cards themselves.
"It sounds pretty good," she said. "You just got to wait and see."

HEADLINE: A U.S. Office Opens, Stirring Saigon Memories

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Sept. 7

 BODY:
In the heart of the old Saigon, on the site where the American Ambassador fled in a helicopter from his embassy roof 24 years ago, a new United States consulate was dedicated today, a symbol of a new but unsure relationship of old enemies trying to be friends.
The new beige-and-green building is modest compared with the multistoried concrete block that was a nerve center for the Vietnam War. The old compound was demolished last year. 
 Instead of dealing with body counts and B-52 bombing sorties, the consulate is generally expected to grant 25,000 immigrant and 150,000 visitors' visas a year, making it one of the busiest posts in the world.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, here for the formal commissioning of the consulate, spoke of the changing dynamic between the United States and Vietnam, still cocooned by an orthodox Communist Party and struggling to emerge on the economic stage.
"In this place, surrounded by reminders of the past, our two countries will be moving resolutely toward a better future," she said.
As much as the two sides may try to put the war behind them, the dialogue and the visions of the past still reverberate. A former Deputy Foreign Minister of Vietnam, Le Mai, was fond of reminding Americans that "Vietnam is a country, not only a war."
The two top American diplomats in Vietnam fought here. Ambassador Pete Peterson, a former Navy pilot, spent six and a half years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, where the American Embassy now stands. The Consul General here, Charles Ray, served two tours as an Army officer in the war.
They are both big admirers of Vietnam and contend that the emotions of the war should be replaced by closer political and economic ties. But a ceremony on the tarmac of Hanoi International Airport this morning was a reminder that the war's legacy is still very much alive.
Ms. Albright witnessed Vietnamese officials' handing over to a Pentagon group the remains of four bodies believed to be those of American soldiers who died in combat in the 1960's and who have been listed as missing in action. The remains were placed in four aluminum coffins, each covered with an American flag, and put aboard a C-17 Air Force plane for the trip home.
The search for American soldiers missing in action has been progressing since 1992, when the Vietnamese Government gave permission to the Pentagon to work here. Ms. Albright stressed that access to the Vietnamese countryside to find those still listed as missing in action was the basis on which the two countries resumed diplomatic relations five years ago and that it remained paramount to good relations.
Since 1973, the remains of 529 members of the armed forces have been identified and returned to their families, according to the Pentagon. An additional 1,530 are yet to be found. About 200,000 Vietnamese soldiers who died have not been accounted for, according to the Government here.
Recently, in a reciprocal gesture, the Pentagon agreed to open its archives to Vietnamese officials to examine records and maps to assist them in their search for their missing in action.
Ms. Albright devoted much of her time in Hanoi to trying to persuade the top Communist officials that it is in their interest to complete a trade agreement with Washington. The proposed pact, under discussion for four years, would open Vietnamese markets to American companies and would give Vietnam normal trading relations with the United States. Vietnam remains one of a handful of countries that has not been extended such status by the United States.
But since signing a preliminary agreement in July, the Vietnamese have not completed the final accord, even with the approach of an economic meeting of Asian nations in New Zealand this weekend, where the Vietnamese are widely expected to sign. Ms. Albright said after her talks in Hanoi that she was hopeful that the Vietnamese would resolve "technical issues" in time.
Some of the Vietnamese nervousness about the trade accord appears to rise from uncertainty in the Government about whether Communist Party control can be maintained with the intrusion of Western investment and accompanying trends that free trade would bring, diplomats said.
Hanoi remains one of the few cities in Asia relatively untouched by Western culture and consumption. McDonald's does not operate in Vietnam.
The governing Communist Party elite, including Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, were trained in the Soviet Union, and still, diplomats said, hark to those days. Ho Chi Minh remains a revered figure, and a visit to his tomb is a popular excursion.
The lack of a trade agreement, which is intended to slice import tariffs like the 200 percent duty on imported cars and to require a new openness in commercial transactions has severely hampered growth.
Despite an initial buzz of interest by Western companies when the United States and Vietnam opened diplomatic relations, foreign investment has declined in the last several years, according to the World Bank.
The economy was buffeted by the Asian financial crisis, and the state retains control of all important industries. The World Bank recently reported plummeting export growth. About 250 American companies are doing business in Vietnam. But many have reduced their presence. Some have left, and not many are making money, American officials said.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Why Seinfeld ('Irony Incarnate') Is So Menacing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

FOR COMMON THINGS
Irony, Trust and Commitment in America Today
By Jedediah Purdy
226 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $20.
"An ironic man, with his sly stillness, and ambuscading ways," wrote Thomas Carlyle in "Sartor Resartus," "may be viewed as a pest to society."
No, worse, argues Jedediah Purdy in his impressive if somewhat pious first book, "For Common Things: Irony, Trust and Commitment in America Today." The ironic man, whom Mr. Purdy personifies as the sitcom character Jerry Seinfeld, "irony incarnate," is an outright menace. 
 With his "style of speech and behavior that avoids all appearance of naivete -- of naive devotion, belief, or hope," the individual armored in the irony so prevalent among young people today has withdrawn from the political arena just when it needs him most. With good reason perhaps, Mr. Purdy concedes, politics these days being, in his words, "undignified, disreputable, vaguely ridiculous and thoroughly outmoded," especially compared with an earlier time in the century, when, as the German novelist Thomas Mann wrote, "The question of man's destiny presents itself in political terms."
But politics today is both less and more than a Promethean exercise intended to "bring about basic changes in the human predicament," Mr. Purdy argues. Politics can also serve the maintenance of what he punningly calls "common things," referring all at once to what is public, what we all share and what is ordinary.
Mr. Purdy says that the decline of the commons isn't as inevitable as the ecologist Garrett Hardin described it as being in "The Tragedy of the Commons," which argued that self-interest must lead everyone with access to the commons to take as much as possible -- that is, to overgraze or to clear forests -- until it is exhausted.
If only, Mr. Purdy implores, the commons can be seen less narrowly as three interrelated ecologies: first, "an interpersonal, moral ecology"; second, "a broad social ecology," including "the institutions and practices that affect the shape of our lives," and third, the "natural world." In this perspective then the ironist's shunning of politics will become untenable.
To reveal this vision of politics and the commons, he has written "so that I will not forget what I hope for now, and because others might conclude that they hope for the same things." He continues: "That would be the beginning of turning some of our private, half-secret repositories of hope and trust into common things. I think that some of them must be common, if they are to be at all."
As abstract as his ideas may sound, he has rooted them in the realities of West Virginia, where his parents moved in 1974, the year he was born. Growing up there until he went off to Phillips Exeter Academy at age 14, he was inspired both by the way his parents integrated their work and home lives with the community and by the indifference of the coal-mining companies that he sees as having ravaged the environment. He came away with a vision of work that embedded thinking in the dirt of reality, precluding irony.
By defining this work in moral terms, he hopes to unearth another kind of irony, one that "uncovers, in what is ordinarily imagined to be unimportant or banal, something that elicits surprise, delight and reverence." He concludes: "This irony is ecstatic, in the etymologically strict sense of drawing us out of our stasis. It is the irony of discovery. It moves us."
The difficulty is that little of what Mr. Purdy writes is new. As he is the first to recognize, it takes us back to familiar thinkers like Emerson, Thoreau, de Tocqueville, Marx, Camus, Orwell and Weber, among others. On top of this, he labors at length such crashingly obvious ideas as the ethical ambiguities of technology (in particular genetic technology) and the decline of neighborly communities.
Worse, he often sounds self-righteous. He treats the global market economy, which he anathematizes, as if it were something that came into existence in the absence of human effort, whereas it is arguably the consequence of decades of engaged political striving. (Yet on the issue of mountaintop-removal strip-mining, he takes the libertarian position that to pay the cost of coal-mining's environmental damage you must factor it into the price of coal.)
Finally, he trivializes his opposition, not only by reducing all ironists to Seinfeld but also by disdaining all those who seek easier connections to reality than the thankless task of politics.
One comes away from "For Common Things" feeling that the superficial people he seeks to convert won't be bothered to fight their way through his abstruse prose, with its sometimes complex way of saying the most simple things.
Still, you almost always sense what he's getting at, and you have to admire him for taking on the disease of irony, which some see as afflicting an entire generation. If many will not heed him, at least he has articulated a cure.
As his epigraph by Czeslaw Milosz puts it, "What is unpronounced tends to nonexistence." Now that "For Common Things" pronounces the case against a static irony, it gives one pause about reacting ironically.

HEADLINE: Concerts to Introduce Humanitarian Web Site

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Three all-star pop stadium concerts on Oct. 9 -- in New Jersey, England and Switzerland -- are to introduce Netaid.org, a Web site that seeks to end poverty by bringing together relief organizations with donors and volunteers. In a news conference yesterday, Bono of U2 described Netaid as "the Yellow Pages of aid in cyberspace."
The concerts, produced by the people who assembled the Ethiopian famine-relief benefit Live Aid in the 1980's, are to take place at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.; Wembley Stadium outside London, and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. 
 At Giants Stadium, the performers are to include Puff Daddy, Celine Dion, Sting, the Algerian singer Cheb Mami, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Counting Crows, Jon Bon Jovi and the Italian rock singer Zucchero. Wyclef Jean of the Fugees and Bono are to perform a song they wrote in honor of Netaid, "New Day." Giants Stadium tickets go on sale tomorrow through Ticketmaster.
At Wembley the lineup includes David Bowie, Bryan Adams, Bush, the Coors, George Michaels, Robbie Williams and the reunited Eurythymics. A private concert in Geneva, where many of the relief organizations have headquarters, is to feature Bryan Ferry, Des'ree and the Scottish group Texas.
Jewel and Sheryl Crow have both agreed to perform, but their location has not been decided. The concerts are to be televised on VH1, MTV and, in Britain, on the BBC. Radio stations will carry the events to 60 countries, and there will be an Internet Webcast.
The concerts are not primarily for fund-raising, although the immediate proceeds will be dedicated to aid refugees in Kosovo and for relief work in Africa. Donations from listeners will be directed to the Netaid Foundation, which will distribute contributions under the direction of the United Nations Development Program, its antipoverty agency.
But the main purpose of the events is to draw worldwide attention to Netaid, a novel alliance of the United Nations, Internet entrepreneurs and musicians.
"It's about a billion hits against poverty, and we want to punch that sucker out," Quincy Jones, the musician and producer, said at the news conference.
Netaid will provide information and eventually direct connections for people working on projects as diverse as environmental problems, disaster relief or lobbying to cancel the international debts of the 52 poorest countries.
"The idea is for it to become the largest portal and directory for antipoverty organizations in the world," said Bob Chlopak, a spokesman for Netaid. After the concerts, the site will be overseen by the United Nations Development Program.
Cisco Systems, the networking company that has built the Web site and donated $10 million to the Netaid Foundation, announced that Netaid was 10 times larger than any other Web site.
Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, appeared at the news conference. By satellite, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain activated the Web site in North America and Europe. Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa, also appeared by satellite.
"As the Internet reaches more and more communities," Mr. Mandela said, "they will gain access to new information and resources they can use to uplift themselves."

HEADLINE: Forecast of PC Shipments Is Revised Upward

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Worldwide personal computer shipments should grow by nearly 25 percent in the third quarter compared with the similar period last year, according to International Data Corporation -- far more than it had previously forecast.
Three months ago, International Data, a research company in Framingham, Mass., had expected the global PC industry would grow 19.3 percent in the third quarter. 
 The firm said growth was being driven by strong consumer demand for less expensive PC's, healthy demand in Asian markets and the strong United States economy.
Shipment volume is expected to rise 7.2 percent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, it said.
Researchers warned that the figures would not translate into similarly robust revenues; Dataquest, another research firm, expects the average price of PC's to grow by only about 5 percent this year.

EUROPE
 
NETHERLANDS: KEY JUDGE QUITS WAR PANEL -- One of the most senior judges of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Antonio Cassese, will resign next February, the third key figure to quit the United Nations court in recent months. Judge Cassese, an Italian, who has served on the court since its creation in 1993, said he would go back to being a law professor at Florence University, nearly two years before the end of his term. Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, the tribunal president, will leave in November and Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor, steps down on Sept. 15. Marlise Simons (NYT) 

TURKEY: QUAKE DEATH TOLL -- The death toll in last month's earthquake has reached 15,303, and 23,954 were injured, the Government announced. Newspapers have reported that 30,000 or more people are still missing. About 250,000 survivors are homeless. Stephen Kinzer (NYT)
 
GERMANY: SPOOFING SCHRODER -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has appeared on German television as a kinky hermaphrodite complete with pierced breasts, a dog collar and a loony grin -- and he is not pleased. The Munich-based RTL-2 network faces possible legal action from Mr. Schroder after airing an "interview" with a leather-clad Schroder lookalike puppet on an erotic show called "Peep." Mr. Schroder said the show, about the sexual preferences of the Chancellor, was "worse than overstepping the boundaries of taste." Roger Cohen (NYT)
 
GERMANY: HISTORIC PROTEST -- Parliament held its first session in the renovated Reichstag in Berlin, and weathered its first protest. Doctors built a wall of ice 20 feet long by 10 feet high outside the building to protest Government health care changes, which they say could usher in a new ice age for the health service, threatening 19,000 jobs this year. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
SWITZERLAND: IMAGE MAKEOVER -- The Government wants to make a major effort to improve Switzerland's image abroad, especially in the United States. The Foreign Ministry is asking lawmakers to approve a $31 million program to promote the country's humanitarian work, its cultural diversity and democratic traditions. "Switzerland's image abroad has suffered quite a bit recently," said Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
 SWITZERLAND: MILOSEVIC MONEY -- Two months after Switzerland agreed to freeze any assets belonging to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Government said no firm evidence of any Swiss bank accounts had turned up. Acting on a request from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Swiss authorities had promised to block bank accounts or other assets belonging to Mr. Milosevic, four Serbian leaders indicted for war crimes and 300 other senior Yugoslav officials. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
 SPAIN: PINOCHET INVITED TO COURT -- Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking the extradition from Britain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet to answer charges of human rights abuses, has given the former Chilean dictator until Sept. 27 to voluntarily appear in Madrid court. The move comes in response to a motion by General Pinochet, who is under house arrest outside London, to defend himself in Spain -- and gain access to court papers -- while fighting extradition in Britain, where the next hearing is set for Sept. 27. Al Goodman (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
MYANMAR: 2d BRITON HELD -- A 28-year-old British woman was arrested for protesting in Yangon against Myanmar's military rulers but diplomats were not allowed to see her, the British Embassy said. Rachel Goldwyn, a human rights worker, is the second British activist arrested in Myanmar in a week. The embassy said it had still not been given access to James Mawdsley, 26, a Briton sentenced last week for 17 years for pro-democracy activism. (Reuters)
 
NORTH KOREA: TALKS WITH U.S. CONTINUE -- American and North Korean envoys held a second day of talks in Berlin in their latest effort to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, but delegates refused to say whether they were making progress. The Clinton Administration hopes to persuade North Korea to freeze its missile programs during the five-day talks. (AP)
 
SRI LANKA: POLIO CEASE-FIRE -- The Tamil Tiger guerrillas and Government forces have agreed to a four-day cease-fire to allow a United Nations agency to carry out a nationwide polio immunization program. Unicef said the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and security forces agreed to the "days of tranquillity" on Friday and Saturday and again on two days next month. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: PUBLISHING AGAIN -- Iran's most outspoken newspaper, which has published under three different names and been shut down each time by hard-liners, plans to come out under yet another title. Authorities closed the daily Neshat on Saturday for insulting Islam. The paper's Internet site said the daily would be published soon under the name Akhbar-e-Eqtesad, or Economic News. Neshat first appeared as Jameah shortly after the May 1997 election of the reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who called Saturday's closing illegal. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: SUIT OVER BANK PAPERS -- Overriding President Ernesto Zedillo's political party, the opposition in Congress voted to sue in the Supreme Court to force the Government to turn over bank documents from his 1994 presidential campaign. Investigators are looking into whether Mr. Zedillo received illegal donations from Carlos Cabal Peniche, a banker embroiled in fraud charges. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: EXILE MAY BE MOVED -- The Government said it was considering moving Lino Oviedo, the former Parguayan army chief who fled his country and lives outside Buenos Aires as a political exile, to a ranch on an isolated pampas in central Argentina. The move is in response to growing tensions with Paraguay, which has twice called for General Oviedo's extradition to face charges he was involved in the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana last March. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
CANADA: QUEEN'S NEW REPRESENTATIVE -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien named Adrienne Clarkson, a former television journalist, as the country's new Governor General, the representative in Canada of Queen Elizabeth. Ms. Clarkson, who was evacuated from Hong Kong as a child during World War II, is the first immigrant to hold Canada's top ceremonial post. James Brooke (NYT)
 
CANADA: SEARCH FOR TRUDEAU SON -- Canadian Mounted Police divers started searching a high-altitude British Columbia lake where Michel Trudeau, a son of Pierre Trudeau, Canada's former Prime Minister, drowned last Nov. 23. The 23-year-old was traversing a steep snow slope on skis when an avalanche swept him and a friend into the waters of Lake Kokanee. The friend managed to get out, but Michel was last seen struggling in the water. Two days after he disappeared, ice sealed the lake. The ice melted only two weeks ago. James Brooke (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
LIBYA: AFRICAN LEADERS MEET -- More than 40 African leaders met in Libya to discuss ways of restructuring the charter of the Organization of African Unity in order to strengthen closeness among member states. The Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi walked into the meeting 280 miles southeast of Tripoli with a trade-mark clenched fist raised high, prompting other African leaders to follow suit. An O.A.U. spokesman said 43 African heads of state were present, far more than officials had expected. (AP)
 
ALGERIA: REBELS SURRENDER -- Fifty radical Muslim guerrillas surrendered to the Government under a peace plan to be put to a referendum this month, the state-run radio said. It said the surrender took place 140 miles east of Algiers, but did not say when it took place. More than 100 guerrillas surrendered last week. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Americans' Use Of Credit Cards Rises Steeply

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Shoppers amassed credit card debt at the fastest pace in nearly three years in July, Federal Reserve figures showed today, indicating that spending is continuing to keep the economic expansion on track toward a record.
The use of consumer credit increased by a larger-than-expected $8.8 billion, to $1.35 trillion in July. Revolving loans, which include credit card obligations, rose $5.9 billion, the biggest increase since November 1996. 
 The July increase would mean an annualized growth rate of 7.9 percent in consumer debt, compared with a 2.9 percent annual pace in June and a 5.4 percent increase for all of last year. People are so optimistic about the economy that they have little hesitation in charging purchases, analysts said.
Consumer spending has been pushing the nation's economic expansion, now in its ninth year and five months away from becoming the longest ever.
Investors and economists watch the Fed's report on credit to help them gauge consumer demand, even though the report does not account for home equity loans and other lending secured by real estate.
Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass., said that "as long as the labor market remains strong and inflation stays low, we see no obvious reason for the consumer to cut back on spending."
Auto and other loans increased $3.1 billion after falling $2.3 billion in June, the Fed said. Revolving credit had increased $5.5 billion in June.
For June, consumer credit rose a revised $3.3 billion, previously reported as an increase of $2.8 billion.
Other data today, from the Commerce Department, showed that wholesalers' inventories rose nine-tenths of a percent in July, the fastest pace in 10 months. Sales fell two-tenths of a percent, for the first time since January.
Department and chain stores reported sales gains in August compared with figures a year earlier. Auto sales rose markedly.

Welcome to Kremlingate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Surprise, surprise: corruption has been rampant in the Kremlin.
Swiss investigators are finding funny money in secret bank accounts of President Yeltsin's personal and official family members. In the U.S., the Bank of New York is being forced to explain the laundering of billions ripped off by favored oligarchs. 
 "Five years ago," says Grigory Yavlinsky, the reformist leader who has long been blowing an unheededwhistle on the grandest larceny of the century, "you could have asked any little child in the smallest village in Siberia about this, and he would have told you all about the criminal conspiracies. Why is it news today? Because of your elections and ours."
The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, with its hundreds of junketeering bureaucrats, treated the corruption as a mere bump on the road to a market economy. Vice President Al Gore even famously scrawled a barnyard epithet across a C.I.A. memo warning of the diversion of foreign aid into the pockets of Yeltsin's clique. (Why doesn't Al enliven his speeches with such colorful expressions?)
As 2000 approaches, the time ripens for exposure of the blind eye Gore turned to "Kremlingate." We Republicans smack our lips here in the run-ups to our primaries, and the would-be successors to Yeltsin rub their hands before elections to their Parliament this December and their White House next June.
Russia's second contested national election is similar in some ways to our own tumultuous contest in 1800, when the established Federalists John Adams and Alexander Hamilton fell out and deals were made in Congress to help the anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson squeak in.
In Russian politics, three main forces are also taking shape: On the left is the Communist Party, its members aging and dying, its Stalinists and Agrarians splintering off. Though it holds nearly half the Duma seats now, that could drop to below a third in December's elections.
In the sinister center is the front-running team of the old spymaster Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. They have the main money men and the media moguls behind them. Cozy corruption would most likely continue in this "Yevgeny and Yuri Show."
On the right is Yabloko, the democratic party headed by Yavlinsky, the only reformer not to have been suckered and dumped by Yeltsin. He's just been joined by Sergei Stepashin, also 47, one of the revolving-door prime ministers; this cop expands the party base by bringing along not-nutty nationalists. Yavlinsky insists he's clean, and should help Yabloko in its goal of doubling its strength to a fifth of the Duma seats.
There's also an Inconsequential Right, ranging from the grumpy economist Yegor Gaidar to the attractive young reformer Boris Nemtsov to Yeltsin's cunning Anatoly Chubais. But this segment even trails the sidelined Gen. Aleksandr Lebed and the wild Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Beyond corruption, political Russians have to deal with a wild card: the war in Dagestan. Even reformers who condemned the war in Chechnya are calling for Russian action to repel the Islamic fundamentalist invaders said to be helped by the terrorist financier Osama bin Laden. Wars create unexpected heroes and scapegoats and will affect the Russian elections.
What should America do to advance the cause of freedom in the coming Russian elections? Should we pull our investigative punch into Kremlingate lest ordinary Russians think we are abusing them when their country is down ?
We should butt out of their politics. We have shown we do more harm than good to genuine reform. At the same time, we should butt into their predators' thievery -- following every lead to help Russia recover funds spirited out by corrupt officials and Western co-conspirators.
If it embarrasses President Clinton and Yeltsin, or if it means we must wait six months for Communists to be replaced in the Duma so that Russia can ratify our arms limitation treaty, so be it. Both countries will be in business under new management in 18 months.
Yavlinsky's advice on what America should do: "Relax. You are still looking for partnerships with people who may be shown to be corrupt. Please -- just relax."

Mexico's Banks Adopt American Credit-Reporting Practices

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
The usual reason given for the failure of about a third of Mexico's bank loans since 1995 is soaring inflation.
With nearly all loans pegged to the inflation rate, which at times approached 100 percent, it was not long before many Mexicans owed more in interest than they had borrowed. So many borrowers merely walked away. 
 But bankers now acknowledge that even without inflation, touched off by peso devaluation, many of the loans would probably have gone bad.
A key reason was that bankers had made many of the loans with little data about the borrowers. The kind of nationwide, computerized credit reporting companies that had been standard in the United States for decades simply did not exist.
But now two of the biggest American companies, the Trans Union Corporation of Chicago and Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, are at work building files and computer systems in Mexico that will give bankers here the same instantaneous credit profiles that bankers in New York and Miami and Los Angeles take for granted.
Starting from scratch in late 1996, Trans Union, in a joint venture with Mexican banks, has compiled files on 25 million loans, representing most of the market, according to Trans Union. Equifax says it has 8 million files and hopes to have 20 million by this time next year.
While Mexico's economy has been recovering nicely, thanks to a surge in manufacturing and good earnings from higher oil prices, its banks are still limping along, collecting what they can on old debts and lending very little. The few mortgages that are being issued are at interest rates of nearly 30 percent, with credit cards charging more than 50 percent. Small and midsize businesses are starving for cash. Housing construction is down.
So the Government is eager to strengthen the banks. Just a few months ago, it made the credit reporting agencies a formal part of Mexico's financial system, for the first time mandating that bankers check out all prospective loans through one of the agencies. In the United States, credit reporting has been integral to lending for decades, but industry executives say that it is entirely discretionary.
Determined to inject discipline into lending in Mexico, the Government went on to require that, in the case of a bad credit report, a loan of say $100,000 or any other amount, could only be made if the bank were willing to set aside an equal amount in reserves.
It was a blunt sanction, that Federico Castro Rosas, the general director of BC Buro de Credito, the joint venture in which Trans Union is the largest investor, said would surely stop any lender in his tracks.
Like much of the rest of Latin America as well as Africa and parts of Asia, Mexico had gotten along for decades with very little credit reporting. There had been a credit reporting agency in Mexico -- at least in name -- starting in the early 1970's. But it was never really taken seriously and was eventually done away with. Banks and other lenders refused to share their credit information with the agency, and what little the agency could gather was fragmented, often outdated and considered unreliable.
"It was very poorly managed," said Ernesto Gomez-Gallardo, an executive vice president at Banamex, the country's largest bank.
Few felt an urgent need for better credit reporting, partly because, in Mexico as in many other developing countries, the banks lent to a fairly small circle -- either customers they knew or those referred to them.
But bank lending and the credit card business in Mexico exploded in the late 1980's and early 1990's as the banks were reprivatized after a decade of state control. Bankers who had paid high prices to get into the business were eager to put their money to work and began lending to almost anyone.
In those days, one banker said, "you just didn't check people's credit.
"There were questions on the application form," the banker said, "but the customer could lie and tell you he hadn't had any problems. And you would never know. The credit bureau wouldn't have the information."
After the value of the peso was cut in half in late 1994, inflation soared, and the banks and the Government recognized that big changes had to be made.
As one measure, the Mexican Association of Bankers deputized the five largest banks to begin talks with Trans Union, Equifax and the other industry giant in the United States, the Experian Corporation. Trans Union won the contest and three years ago began issuing credit reports as part of the joint venture with the banks. Equifax says it withdrew from contention and decided to go it alone before the banking association announced its choice. Experian is not doing business in Mexico. While Equifax has a few bank customers in Mexico, its greatest following so far has been among retailers. But it has its eyes on a stronger position with the banks. Equifax, the only one of the three companies that is publicly traded in the United States, had revenues in 1998 of $1.6 billion.
"The Mexicans are interested in competition," said Bill Phinney, a senior executive for Equifax in Latin America. "They want more than one player in their markets."
Both American companies have brought in sophisticated computer systems that blend information from several sources and, in seconds, produce reports on a person's debt history, the types and amounts of loans, the timeliness of payments and any defaults or repossessions. The companies charge corporations in both the United States and Mexico a negotiated fee for each report.
For both Trans Union and Equifax, the move into Mexico was part of a plan to expand from the saturated United States credit reporting market into Latin America and other parts of the world. "We see very good growth potential in Mexico," said Mr. Phinney of Equifax.
Lending has become a much more cautious and restrictive business in Mexico. And, the bankers say, it is a tough adjustment for many customers. "This is a big shock to Mexican culture," said Mr. Gomez-Gallardo. "If you have a bad loan or a default, you won't be getting credit. That is something new."
In the past, when one lender did not know what the other was doing, he said, "People didn't pay and nothing happened."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Fed Actions Aid Recovery Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices rebounded yesterday as traders covered short positions after the Federal Reserve took measures to insure there would be enough money in the banking system to counter any Year 2000 computer problems.
The market's tone improved and remained firm after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, spoke at Grand Valley State University in Michigan but did not comment on interest rates, the economy or policy as expected. Remarks by other officials yesterday, including Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, in Philadelphia and Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers at the New York Economic Club had little market effect and failed to put the market in a defensive stance. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32, to 100 26/32. Its yield was unchanged at 6.07 percent.
Analysts said the market was also aided by the announcement of a Year 2000 program that would allow banks to use expanded forms of collateral for repurchase transactions within 90 days, which will add liquidity to the banking system. It eased concern that trading Treasuries or other fixed-income paper might be difficult at the end of the year. Some investors have had concerns the financial markets might freeze up, causing some to postpone selling until early next year.
Yesterday's sparse economic data were virtually ignored, showing that the market gave an inordinate amount of attention to the Fed news, said Andy Bischel, director of investing at Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates in San Francisco. "The Fed is probably going to raise rates as soon as October," he said, "but in the meantime the market has been in and out discounting the increase."
July wholesale inventories rose nine-tenths of a percent, another hint that the change in business inventories in the third quarter could add noticeably to growth in the gross domestic product, some economists said.
Bond market participants have begun to focus on the scheduled release tomorrow of the Government's report on producer prices, or inflation at the manufacturing level, a key indicator of inflation.
However, the economic reports scheduled for release next week will play a role in determining whether the Fed will raise rates again at its meeting on Oct. 5, said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "Market participants will certainly pay particular attention to retail sales, housing starts, industrial production, and capacity utilization, but most keenly awaited of all will be the C.P.I., the Fed's benchmark inflation measure."
A robust Consumer Price Index, coupled with retail sales data that indicate continued momentum in consumer spending, would create considerable consternation among Fed members and could prompt another increase, Mr. Fine said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Prices End Mixed as Traders Await a Key Inflation Figure

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday as investors remained cautious ahead of important economic data scheduled to be released tomorrow. Traders said a small rise in the Dow Jones industrial average was overshadowed by declines in other indicators and by market breadth, which was decidedly negative.
The Dow rose 2.21 points, or less than one-tenth of a percent, to 11,036.34. The Nasdaq composite index fell 28.52 points, or 1.02 percent, to 2,808.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 6.30 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,344.15. 
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers 3 to 2 on the Big Board.
Although several people whose remarks often move markets spoke yesterday, none seemed to sway the market. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, focused on technology in a speech delivered at Grand Valley State University in Michigan and avoided any hint about the direction of interest rates.
In a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said the nation's tight labor market threatened to fuel inflation but left it open whether the central bank would raise interest rates soon to counter that threat. Mr. Meyer -- widely seen as the Fed's most conservative member -- also said the central bank had no choice but to take into account the effect of higher stock prices on the overall economy when it sets interest rates.
Also yesterday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers reiterated that a strong dollar was in the best interests of the United States.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential and bullish market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, raised her 1999 earnings estimate on the S.& P. 500 companies and raised her target for the Dow industrials for 1999 to 11,500. Ms. Cohen said the new target was based on the higher earnings estimates, a continuation of modest inflation and a belief that bond yields appear to be peaking.
"It looked like the market reacted the most to Meyer," Barry Hyman, a strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said. "He intimated that inflation is a concern even though it does not seem obvious right now."
Mr. Hyman said the market was looking for evidence that interest rates would not be raised a third time, and a key indicator of inflation will be the release of producer price data tomorrow. Analysts expect the report to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in August after a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Ingram Micro tumbled 6, to 13 5/16, after the company warned of an earnings shortfall. The wholesaler of computer products and services said it expected to earn 10 to 14 cents a share in the third quarter. Analysts had been expecting 41 cents.
Global Crossing rose 5 1/4, to 25 9/16. Global Crossing, Microsoft and Softbank of Japan said they were joining forces to build a $1.28 billion telecommunications network in Asia. Frontier, which is being acquired by Global Crossing, jumped 8 13/16, to 45 1/8.
VF fell 3 11/16, to 31 1/16. The company said late on Tuesday that third-quarter earnings would slip 10 percent to 15 percent, compared with the period a year earlier. The company blamed weakness in sales at mid-tier department stores and in international sales of jeans.
Covance, which provides drug development services for the pharmaceuticals industry, fell 4 7/8, to 10 5/8. The company said it expected earnings for the third quarter and year to be below analysts' forecasts. Covance said that its clinical trial business was experiencing a slowdown and that growth in its laboratory business had leveled off.
IMRglobal fell 5 3/16, to 11 1/4. The company said late on Tuesday that it expected third-quarter earnings in the range of 12 to 16 cents a share, far below forecasts of 25 cents share. The company, which is involved in software and other services for business customers, said delays in the start of several large projects contributed to a slowdown.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Now Positive On Prospects ForEconomy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Sept. 8

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, suggested today that the United States economy's expansion could continue, thanks to advancements in information technology.
The growth of such technologies as integrated circuits and improvements in software are among the developments that have "begun to alter, fundamentally, the manner in which we do business and create economic value," Mr. Greenspan said in the text of remarks in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
 That has bolstered productivity and shows few signs of slowing, he suggested. "Growth in output per work hour has accelerated, elevating the standards of living of the average American worker" because improvements in information technology have permitted changes in inventory management, distribution systems, customer service and other tasks, Mr. Greenspan said. That has "sharply reduced the degree of uncertainty confronting business management," he added.
Mr. Greenspan, whose last public comments, on Aug. 27, raised questions about whether stocks were inflated and started the Dow Jones industrial average on a 1 percent decline for that day, did not revisit the subject in today's text. He also did not discuss his views on interest rates, inflation or current economic conditions.
His speech was part of a lecture series sponsored by Grand Valley State University and the Gerald R. Ford Museum to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Mr. Ford's inauguration as President.
Mr. Greenspan served as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Ford from September 1974 until Mr. Ford left office Jan. 20, 1977. Before and after his stint as chief administration economist, Mr. Greenspan was chairman and president of Townsend-Greenspan & Company, an economic consulting firm in New York.
The economy's expansion, now in its ninth year, has been marked by a growth of economic value that is "intellectual and impalpable," rather than symbolized by "large steel mills, auto assembly plants and skyscrapers," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
With Prices Up and Joblessness Down, British Raise Rates

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Britain's central bank raised a key short-term money rate today, for the first time in more than a year, in a pre-emptive move against inflationary pressure.
The quarter-point increase in the securities repurchase rate, to 5.25 percent, broke a series of seven modest rate cuts. Its timing was a surprise to many analysts; still, it came in a period of rising housing prices and relatively low unemployment. 
 The bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement, "Although inflation is expected to remain below the target of 2.5 percent in the short term, the committee concluded that a rise in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on track further ahead, and that an early move could lower the level at which interest rates might otherwise need to be set."
British mortgage lenders responded by raising their base rates.
The move by the central bank also sent the yield on the 10-year Government bond 12 basis points higher, to 5.52 percent. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
The pound rose, too, settling here at $1.6209 and in New York at $1.6192, up from $1.6049 on Tuesday. Stocks moved lower on the news, closing down slightly less than 1 percent.
The Bank of England last increased the securities repurchase rate in June 1998 and has been cutting it since. Buthousing prices have now reached a 10-year high, rising 9.4 percent in August. The output of goods and services just increased more than it had in almost a year, and unemployment fell to 6 percent, one of the lowest levels in Europe.
But experts here had generally not foreseen a rate rise until at least November. "We certainly didn't expect it," said Robert Barrie, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Ellen van der Gulik, euro area economist at J. P. Morgan here, said she considered the rate increase appropriate even if surprising now. "This is almost a correction of the rate cut in June, which was unnecessary," she said.
Some analysts were not particularly impressed by the announcement. "It's not as if you can really work yourself up into a state about 25 basis points," Mr. Barrie said. "The real issue is where do you go from here?"
Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said he tended to believe that today's rate increase signified a larger move by the bank's Monetary Policy Committee. "The M.P.C.'s hypersensitivity to real growth prospects, coupled with the likelihood that real activity will strengthen in coming months, means that the chance probably is better than even" of another increase "before year-end -- even though wage and price data probably will remain subdued," he said.
But Mr. Barrie disagreed. "I don't think we're at the start of anything substantial," he said. "Inflation isn't the real issue here. Growth is coming from areas where inflation is at its lowest."
Some analysts and business leaders suggested that the rate increase might erode British economic gains. "With wage levels stable and intense competition keeping prices down at home and abroad, the economy in under no significant danger," said Ian Peters, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. "The decision threatens to put a still tentative recovery into reverse."
Mortgage lenders changed their rates within hours of the announcement. Halifax P.L.C., the nation's largest, announced a 0.14 point rise in its variable mortgage rate, the most common mortgage here, to 6.99 percent, starting Oct. 1. Virgin Direct, part of Richard Branson's business empire, raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 6.45 percent, as of Thursday. The Nationwide Building Society said it planned to hold its rate at 6.45 percent.
"This economy is having very strong growth," Ms. van der Gulik said. "The mood has shifted. This is just the beginning of more hikes."

HEADLINE: Bradley, Starting Campaign, Extols Small-Town Values

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CRYSTAL CITY, Mo., Sept. 8

 BODY:
Returning to his hometown on the banks of the Mississippi River, former Senator Bill Bradley formally opened his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President today, pledging to fight racial strife, restore trust in government and spread the nation's prosperity to the most downtrodden Americans.
On a day when the dark sky rumbled threateningly but held back its rain, Mr. Bradley delivered a 30-minute speech that was a paean to small-town life, asserting that lessons learned in the classrooms and basketball courts here had prepared him to be a more humble, caring and selfless leader in Washington. 
 "Now, above all, is not the time for complacency," he said, standing outside his red-brick high school and before a crowd of more than 2,000 banner-waving residents. "I feel an urgency to seize this moment in history, to strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead us into our full greatness as a nation."
To many Democrats, Mr. Bradley faces an uphill fight against his only rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Gore, who has built a formidable network of party supporters in seven years in the White House. But his campaign kick-off comes at a time when there are indications that Mr. Bradley is gaining steam. Mr. Gore's lead over Mr. Bradley, a former three-term senator from New Jersey and Hall of Fame basketball player with the New York Knicks, had narrowed to less than double digits in two polls of New Hampshire voters released in the past week. One was by a Dover, N.H., television station and the second by The Boston Globe.
Mr. Bradley's campaign has unsettled the Vice President's advisers, who say the former Senator has collected more money than they expected and assembled a talented staff. "He's gone through an important initial phase where he has clearly gotten himself in the game," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "But there's a very big next step in putting the substance into his themes."
But whether Mr. Bradley makes a strong run at Mr. Gore will depend heavily on the way he manages the next phase of his campaign, when he will come under more intense public scrutiny and will be expected to release a more detailed agenda than he has been willing to do so far.
Mr. Bradley's relatively low-keyed campaign may have helped him avoid damaging controversy or criticism. But his aides say that in the next few weeks, he will begin releasing more detailed policy prescriptions. And those proposals, the aides hope, will lead to a more lively debate with Mr. Gore, who has studiously avoided engaging his Democratic rival so far, preferring to set his sights on the leading Republican candidate, George W. Bush.
In today's celebratory homecoming, Mr. Bradley avoided mentioning Mr. Gore, at least directly. But in describing his desire to help working families, he took what could be viewed as a veiled shot at the Clinton Administration, which has been attacked by some liberal critics as offering too many small-bore programs to solve big problems.
"We will do fewer things," Mr. Bradley said. "But they will be essential things, and we will do them more thoroughly."
Mr. Bradley will also try to differentiate himself from Mr. Gore on character issues, his aides say. Though his camp does not bring up Mr. Clinton's impeachment and repeated ethical travails, they sense that Mr. Gore will be hurt by his association with a scandal-plagued administration. Indeed, a poll published in The Washington Post today suggested that voters are tired of Mr. Clinton and are looking for a President who will take the country in a new direction.
With that in mind, today's event was intended to present Mr. Bradley as the antithesis of a polished Washington insider -- as he has described Mr. Gore.
From start to finish, there was an almost studied homeyness to the day. Many of the town's clapboard and stone houses had home-made "Bradley for President" signs on their trim lawns. The high school band that performed before Mr. Bradley's speech occasionally played out of tune. And at a reception for Mr. Bradley in the school gymnasium, home-baked cookies were served with iced tea.
Still, there was something paradoxical about the way Mr. Bradley's campaign sought to cast the day as a natural outpouring of support for a hometown favorite, while also trying to orchestrate it as a huge media event.
Throughout the morning, campaign officials wandered through the high school halls barking orders through portable radios and cell phones. Before the event started, aides distributed copies of Mr. Bradley's nostalgic description of Crystal City in his memoir, "Time Present, Time Past," along with a fact sheet noting the precise number of stop lights in town: five.
And at sunset, Mr. Bradley led reporters and town residents on a guided tour of his boyhood haunts, including the house where he was reared, the church where he worshiped, his father's bank and the local baseball fields.
(Mr. Bradley's parents are dead, but he still owns the family's house, as well as a 250-acre farm.)
But amid all the media management, it was also clear that Mr. Bradley has remained a revered figure here since he left 38 years ago.
"He could do it all on the basketball court, but he didn't try to do it all," said Ralph Boyer, 65, a retired teacher and basketball coach at the local Catholic school who saw Mr. Bradley play in high school. "And what made him a great ball player will make him a great President."
In his speech, Mr. Bradley described himself as a "small-town boy" who learned about hard work and discipline from his father and about honesty, courage and integrity from his mother, a school teacher.
In the Little League, he said he learned about racism when a black teammate was denied service at a restaurant. "Racism disturbed me then and still angers me now," Mr. Bradley said. "For me, the only thing deserving of hate is hate itself."
As President, Mr. Bradley said, he would try to redirect some of the nation's wealth toward reducing childhood poverty and providing affordable health care to working class and poor people.
"In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to improve the well-being of all our citizens," he said. "Shouldn't we be fixing our roof while the sun is shining?"
But like many other candidates this year, including Mr. Gore, he also spoke of his desire to address the nation's spiritual yearnings, as well as its material needs.
"What we need in America is a deeper prosperity," he said. "Deeper in the sense that we have a prosperity that adds up to more than the sum of all our possessions; a prosperity that makes us feel rich inside as well as out."

HEADLINE: Auto Workers Choose Ford For Canada Contract Talks

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company will be the pattern-setting company in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union announced today.
"We will get a good settlement," Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove, the president of the Canadian union, said. "It is time working people in our nation got a pay raise." 
 Ford praised the move. "We're pleased to be the lead company," Donald J. McKenzie, the chief negotiator for Ford of Canada, said. "There are advantages to being the lead company in that you have the opportunity to fashion an agreement that is better suited to Ford of Canada's needs and the needs of its employees."
Richer pensions for current and future retirees is "our No. 1 priority," Mr. Hargrove said. In addition, he said the union would demand improved cost-of-living adjustments, expansion of four-day workweeks, better prescription drug coverage, tuition reimbursements and child care provisions. And he said the union wanted Ford, the General Motors Corporation and DaimlerChrysler A.G. to help insure that their suppliers remain neutral in drives to unionize those companies.
Mr. Hargrove noted that each of the three companies had earned spectacular profits over the last five years and that in the last six months, Ford had earned more than the others, with $4.3 billion in net income. "The issue isn't the ability to pay, it is about the ability to force the companies to share," he said. Workers deserve "to share in the incredible wealth that we helped produce with the auto companies," he added.
Labor experts predicted that unionized auto workers in Canada and the United States would likely get strong raises this year at all three companies. "There's more of an emphasis on pay than we've seen in recent years," said Harley S. Shaiken, a professor specializing in labor and global economic issues at the University of California at Berkeley, noting the recent, rich deal the Boeing Company cut with its union.
The Canadian union will first try to reach a deal with Ford, then plans to follow the industry tradition of demanding that G.M. and DaimlerChrysler accept its terms. Canadian labor contracts expire at midnight on Sept. 21, and Mr. Hargrove said he would call a strike if no deal was reached by then.
"There shouldn't be a work stoppage if the companies come to the table recognizing the contribution of our members," Mr. Hargrove said. The Canadian union has $60 million in its strike fund, which would support workers in the event of a strike.
Mr. Hargrove said the union chose to bargain first with Ford in part because the leader of the American union, Stephen P. Yokich, had narrowed his choices to G.M. and DaimlerChrysler. "I talked to Steve Yokich this morning and he told me it could be either one," Mr. Hargrove said, adding that Mr. Yokich indicated a decision would be made within a few days.
Industry and labor experts are betting the United Automobile Workers will name DaimlerChrysler as its lead company and will try to quickly reach a deal with the German auto maker, then will insist that G.M. and Ford accept those terms. The companies' three-year contracts with U.A.W. workers expire on Sept. 14.
A G.M. spokesman echoed his words. "Everyone would like to be first, but that's strictly up to the union, so we're waiting it out," the spokesman, Edd Snyder, said.
While Mr. Hargrove said the Canadian agreement would cover the traditional three-year time frame, the agreement between the United Automobile Workers is likely to go longer, industry and labor experts said.
DaimlerChrysler proposed a five-year agreement and Ford proposed a six-year deal with the U.A.W., according to a person close to the talks. A four-year agreement was the most likely, another person close to the talks said. In the United States, no auto labor contract has lasted longer than three years since the 1950's.
The issues at DaimlerChrysler are perhaps more straightforward for the U.A.W. than at the other two companies. Because of G.M.'s past poor labor relations and because of the company's size and complexity, the union has a host of national and local concerns to work through. And at Ford, historically strong labor relations have soured lately as the company considers spinning off its giant auto parts unit, Visteon.
At DaimlerChrysler, it mostly comes down to a matter of money -- raises, benefits improvements and the like. And one thorny issue -- whether Mercedes unionizes its factory in Vance, Ala. -- might be moved off the table if the U.A.W. fears it cannot muster enough support from the workers there.
Still, G.M. was pushing to be named the target. Last week, it offered the U.A.W. lifetime employment guarantees for workers with more than 10 years of seniority. However, Mr. Hargrove said he would not be likely to accept such a deal in Canada because the promise can be renegotiated later.
Despite the record auto industry profits, Mr. Hargrove predicted difficult negotiations. "Ford will bargain tough," he said. "In spite of all of the money they are making, they are still saying, 'We can't afford this.' "

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bradley's Announcement of Candidacy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech yesterday by Bill Bradley in Crystal City, Mo., as recorded by The New York Times:
We're at a special moment in American history, not just because we're on the eve of a new millennium but because our country and the world are changing at a dazzling rate. There are two billion more people in the world market today than just a decade ago. More of our jobs are dependent on exports than ever. 
 Interest rates here in Crystal City are set by millions of individual investors worldwide who every day render their verdict on the economic health of the United States. The nature of work itself is changing. The new global economy values knowledge above all, indeed capital follows knowledge.
In such a world, physical distance disappears. Life expectancy increases, national resources can be better preserved. The entrepreneurial spirit is once again pushing America forward.
But the positive effects of globalization and technological change are falling on us unequally. The economy soars, but some of us are slipping behind. Median family income seems stuck. Personal debt and bankruptcies are at an all-time high. One out of 5 children in America still live in poverty. And while kings and dictators come to this country for the best health-care treatment in the world, you and I both know that this care is not available to the 45 million citizens who have no health insurance at all.
Is this where we want to be? Is it our best self as Americans? The numbers tell us that we're living in a time of unprecedented prosperity. But what are we doing with that prosperity? After 10 years of a robust economy, are the important things truly better? A health-care system? A school, a civic life, a family life, our children's future?
In so many ways we have failed to use our prosperity to improve the well-being of all our citizens.
Shouldn't we be fixing our roof while the sun is shining? Shouldn't we be shoring up our foundation before the rain gets in?
Now, above all, is not the time for complacency. I feel an urgency to seize this moment in history, to strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead us into our full greatness as a nation.
We're at the end of what's been called the American century. We started it as a minor power and we ended as the undisputed giant among nations. For the first time in human history, one nation can truly be a light into the future. We believe that the values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are not just American values but human values. But first we have to embody those values at home. . . .
The Dow Jones is at record height. But as Robert Kennedy reminded us, such numbers are not the measure of all things. They do not measure what is in our heads or hearts. They do not measure a young girl's smile, a little boy's first handshake, a grandmother's pride. They convey nothing about friendship or the self-fulfillment of helping a person in need. They tell us little about the magic of a good marriage, or the satisfaction of a life led true to one's own values. They can't comfort us when personal tragedy strikes, or supersede the pleasure of a job well done. They say nothing whatsoever, these numbers, about us being "one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all." . . .
There are two kinds of politicians, maybe more. Those who talk and promise, and those who listen and do. I know which one I am. As President you must listen and consult, study and examine, pray and plan. But in the end you must be guided by the compass of your own convictions and do what's right as you're given to see that right and then trust that the people will understand.

HEADLINE: In Rubin's Shadow? Summers and the Dollar

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
In his two months as Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence H. Summers has tried to leave no daylight between his policies and those of his predecessor, Robert E. Rubin.
Given that Mr. Rubin's approach was considered stellar both on Wall Street and in Washington, and that Mr. Summers was his deputy for four years, it seems a logical approach. And it was on full display yesterday when Mr. Summers made his first major speech in his new job, to the Economic Club of New York, and broke no new ground on domestic or international issues. 
 The question now, though, is whether an evolving economic situation and intensifying political pressures will allow Mr. Summers the luxury of leaving policy on automatic pilot.
The Clinton Administration faces a showdown with the Republican-controlled Congress in the next two months over how to apportion projected Federal budget surpluses. The Administration will have to make tough choices about how hard to push its free trade agenda, balancing the growing deficit against its desire to bring China into the world trading system and start a new round of trade liberalization.
And the White House will work to help keep the political deterioration and repression in Indonesia from derailing nascent economic recovery in the rest of Asia, while trying to defuse criticism from Republicans that it has turned a blind eye to Russian corruption.
In all these debates, Mr. Summers will be in the middle and will have considerable opportunity to put his own stamp on the job.
But the issue where he is most on the spot is in managing the Administration's policy on the dollar, which is shaping up as the first big test of his ability to step into Mr. Rubin's shoes.
Mr. Rubin's tenure as Treasury Secretary was marked as much as anything by his advocacy of a strong dollar, an approach that contributed to the economic prosperity and bull market of recent years by helping to keep import prices low and to attract a flood of capital to the United States from abroad.
Despite some doubts on Wall Street about Mr. Summers's commitment to keeping the dollar as strong as it has been, he has so far given no indication that there will be the slightest change in policy.
In his speech yesterday and in a separate interview, Mr. Summers repeated word for word Mr. Rubin's mantra that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States, and said that policy would not be determined by short-term considerations.
"One of the secrets of our success has been that we have not tried to manage economic policy to the markets, but instead have focused on strengthening economic fundamentals," he said in the interview. "Certainly that is the approach I will take."
But when speaking generally about the process of emerging from Mr. Rubin's shadow, Mr. Summers suggested that while his goals remained the same, the course he will take to get there might have to be adjusted along the way. Events in the real world, he said, could ultimately force him to reassess the way he approaches all the big issues.
"The important themes and principles that have guided our policies -- fiscal discipline, international engagement, a commitment to making the economy work for people, managing government well -- those principles require constant new application as circumstances change," Mr. Summers said in the interview.
Circumstances are certainly changing in the economic backdrop for dollar policy. As a result, questions on Wall Street about Mr. Summers's commitment to a strong dollar are being joined by questions about whether it is possible or even desirable to keep the dollar strong -- through intervention in foreign exchange markets, higher interest rates or other tactics.
Mr. Rubin was able to keep the dollar strong over the last few years without much difficulty because the economies of most other big nations were weak or weakening, making the United States the logical place for investors to keep their money. Now, most of the rest of the world, including Japan and Europe, is rebounding economically -- attracting capital that would have been invested in the United States.
At the same time, the nation's trade and current-account deficits are rapidly increasing, creating an imbalance that many investors and analysts fear could eventually lead to a weaker dollar.
And with the trade deficit growing -- and the 2000 election campaign already heating up -- there is bound to be pressure from exporters and labor groups to fight the loss of sales and jobs to foreign competitors by weakening the dollar, which would make American goods cheaper to foreign buyers.
The dollar bought 111.08 Japanese yen in late trading yesterday, up slightly for the day but down from its 1999 peak in May of more than 124 yen to the dollar. After strengthening through the first half of the year against the major European currencies, the dollar weakened over the summer against the euro before leveling off again. Yesterday, it settled at $1.0595 to the euro, compared to its strongest level just over $1.01 in mid-July.
"The fundamentals do not line up for the dollar they way they did before," said Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics. "The question for Summers, from a market point of view, is whether what he says about the dollar, if he says anything at all, is credible against the reality of the changed situation."
Moreover, investors seem to be testing Mr. Summers, pushing the dollar down against the yen as if to dare him to back up his words with action and disprove their doubts about his resolve.
"Because of the influence of Rubin, Larry Summers has credibility," said David Hale, an economist at Zurich Kemper Investments. "But the dollar is a sensitive area for him. There are a large number of people out there who believe that in his heart of hearts, Larry Summers wants to devalue the dollar."
Mr. Hale said that some of the suspicions about Mr. Summers' resolve stemmed from a historical pattern in which Treasury secretaries who came from backgrounds on Wall Street, like Mr. Rubin, presided over periods of dollar strength, while secretaries from other backgrounds saw the dollar fall on their watch. Mr. Summers is an academic economist.
By this theory, those from outside Wall Street -- people like James A. Baker 3d, the Texas lawyer who served under President Reagan, and Lloyd W. Bentsen, the former Senator from Texas who was Mr. Rubin's predecessor under President Clinton -- are more sympathetic to arguments that a weaker dollar can help stimulate exports and protect jobs at home.
If the dollar is shaping up as a test of Mr. Summers's economic and financial acumen, dealing with economic policy toward Russia may prove to be the first big test of his ability to operate in a political minefield.
A Federal investigation into whether money from Russia was laundered through the Bank of New York has prompted criticism from some Republicans that the Administration, and the Treasury Department in particular, have not been tough enough in demanding that Government in Moscow crack down on corruption. With elections next year, analysts say the issue could well lead to pressure on the Administration to scale back Russian financial aid through the International Monetary Fund.
"To quarantine Russia, or to write it off as some have suggested, would I think be a potentially disastrous error," Mr. Summers said. "The policy challenge is to find a balance between being supportive of the Russian people, in whose support for market democracy we have an enormous stake, while at the same time protecting our own basic interests."

HEADLINE: THE CONTENDERS: Running Toward 2000;
Quayle, Seeking Vindication, Plods On With High Hopes

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: GOFFSTOWN, N.H., Sept. 7

 BODY:
By the time Dan Quayle made it to the Rotary Club breakfast here at 7:30 A.M., he had already finished two radio interviews and was bursting to offer this latest audience his distinctive conservative refrain: an embrace of family values, a call for a 30 percent tax cut and his lamentation over what he views as the dark spiritual legacy of the Clinton Administration.
But when the former Vice President concluded his remarks, he was met with another variation of the question he encounters at almost every turn these days: Why, given his weak showing in last month's Iowa straw poll, and the overwhelming signs of Republican support for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is Mr. Quayle staying in the race at all? 
 "They say it is over," Mr. Quayle said, displaying just a slight edge of frustration at hearing the question again, this time from a Rotarian. "It is not over."
"I plead with my party members, 'We need to have a serious debate,' " Mr. Quayle said, adding: "The Republicans are on the verge of saying to the Republican Party and the primary voter that we're going to have a coronation, that we're not going to have a serious primary. That would be most unfortunate, and it would diminish our chances in November."
Mr. Quayle, whose slingshot career has given him a glimpse of both the heights and the depths of American politics by the age of 52, appears to be back at the bottom of his political trajectory. Since his eighth-place finish in the Iowa straw poll -- only two candidates fared worse, one of whom did not even compete in the nonbinding contest -- some of Mr. Quayle's aides have quit for other campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately describe his Presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing small crowds. Even a signing for his new book in Boston on Tuesday that was advertised to last for 90 minutes petered out after 20, as the lunchtime line of autograph seekers dwindled away.
Yet, with poignant tenacity, Mr. Quayle perseveres, motivated by the political vindication he has pursued since he was selected as a Vice-Presidential candidate 11 years ago, and by the dogged belief in the possibility of success.
The candidate's schedule here on Labor Day was typical: He managed two television shows, a parade and two picnics, all before dinner. There is, it seems, no invitation that he will not accept. Labor Day morning found the former Vice President of the United States hustling down a set of stairs into a basement entrance to the Milford Town Hall, which was closed except for the cramped room serving as the studio for the local cable television show that was giving Mr. Quayle an hour of time.
For Mr. Quayle, the prospect of becoming the Republican nominee for President in 2000, as fanciful as that seems to many in his party, remains a realistic goal, if admittedly a difficult one. It is simply a matter of conservatives rallying around him as their ideological alternate to Governor Bush, Mr. Quayle said. And then, he continued, it is simply a matter of Mr. Bush's campaign collapsing, notwithstanding its continued signs of health.
"Eventually, the conservatives will have to take a deep breath and ask themselves this question: Who is the conservative candidate that is most qualified, and has the best chance of defeating George Bush and ultimately prevailing against Bradley or Gore?" Mr. Quayle said in an interview.
"Believe me, if I didn't think I had a good chance of winning -- why spend 18 hours a day, six, seven days a week doing this?" he asked. "There are other things in life. The moment I'm convinced that I can't win, then I won't be here."
There is little doubt, that he brings a strong resume to the race. He has far broader governmental experience -- he is a former Representative, Senator and Vice President -- than any of his opponents. Indeed, he was serving as Vice President to Mr. Bush's father when the younger Mr. Bush showed hardly a glimmer of interest in public service.
Alone among the conservatives in the race, Mr. Quayle has won election to public office. And he has a cogent ideological appeal that impresses his audiences.
Yet, that does not seem to be enough. As Mr. Quayle turns all his attention to this state and its first-in-the-nation Presidential primary, he is finding that his most daunting opponent is not Mr. Bush, but himself -- or rather, the frozen image of himself as a hesitant and intellectually slight figure that even Mr. Quayle acknowledges is the legacy of his Vice Presidency.
"The introduction that I had to the American people, that was totally unfair and is something that I have to deal with today," Mr. Quayle said, bristling at the memory. "The unfair, outrageous, false coverage. From Day 1, from the introduction, it was all BOOM -- totally, 100 percent negative."
Mr. Quayle is reminded of this more often than he would like. As he marched cheerfully along the parade route in Milford on Labor Day, Beverly Simpson, 75, met his smiling glance with a stern shake of her head, turning away as he sought to greet her. "I think he ought to drop out and let Bush have it," Mrs. Simpson said. "I don't think he is the man for the job. Mark my words -- I don't think he has the makings of a President."
Mr. Quayle's most enthusiastic supporters, after ticking off what they say should make him a particularly attractive candidate in this conservative state, acknowledge that his candidacy remains problematic.
"It's what I call the next-door-neighbor-people problem," said John H. Sununu, a former Governor of New Hampshire who is Mr. Quayle's biggest supporter. "They say, 'I really think he's great, but how are you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?' And you talk to the neighbor and they say, 'I think he's great, but how are you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?' "
Mr. Quayle suggests that the only way to counter the argument that he cannot win is, obviously, to win. Yet he acknowledges that there are people who will not vote for him because of the perception cited by Mr. Sununu, and seems flummoxed as he considers this contradiction of his political situation.
"Don't rely on others to go back 10 years ago, or whatever the case may be, to some false caricature that we know is totally not true," Mr. Quayle pleaded to listeners on WGIR-AM in Manchester on Tuesday morning. "Go with what's in your heart."
Through it all, the candidate shows no signs of flagging, offering an energetic and ideologically distinctive agenda that inevitably invites a comparison with the more general agenda offered by Governor Bush. Mr. Quayle supports a 30 percent cut in taxes. He advocates 12-year term limits for members of Congress or, alternately, a constitutional amendment that would stop the pensions and health-care benefits of lawmakers after 12 years.
But Mr. Quayle's overwhelming theme is a return to what he describes as traditional values. It is what has come to define his political views since he gave a speech assailing the television character Murphy Brown after she decided to give birth out of wedlock.
Americans, Mr. Quayle said, are understandably jubilant about the state of the economy and their material lives. "But ask them how are they doing inside," Mr. Quayle said. "Their hearts ache. They can see the cultural decline.
"We need to reclaim values that made America great in the first place," he continued. "Reclaim values like respect. Integrity. The value of faith. The value of freedom."
There is no question that Mr. Quayle's words have some appeal here. "I like everything he stands for -- family values," said Kevin Currie, 32, a forklift operator. "I don't think the press treats him fairly at all."
In pushing his quest for the Presidency, Mr. Quayle often suggests comparisons to another former Vice President who went on to become President, Richard M. Nixon.
But Mr. Nixon succeeded because he spent eight years creating a new image for himself; Mr. Quayle has resisted friends' advice that he do the same thing, arguing that to attempt that would be to affirm, in effect, an unfair caricature.
Indeed, Republicans who have advised Mr. Quayle over the years think that given the crowded current field, which includes several candidates who have Mr. Quayle's ideology without his history, it is unrealistic to think that he could succeed even if Mr. Bush were to fail.
"I'm afraid I think that's fanciful," said William Kristol, who was Mr. Quayle's chief of staff and is now editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. "That's wishful thinking in the extreme. But I can see how he believes it. I mean, maybe it should be the case."
And these days, as Mr. Quayle makes his last stand in New Hampshire, it seems hard to quarrel with Mr. Kristol's assessment. As Mr. Quayle was stepping briskly around a turn in the Milford parade, he came upon a marquee. It was scattered with a jumble of letters, but one word, evidently a greeting for Mr. Quayle, stood out: "potatoe."
Mr. Quayle looked toward the sign, and then his gaze floated away as he turned to the other side of the street with a wave to the crowd, and quietly finished his march to a van waiting to take him to his next stop.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Should Clinton embrace the China trade deal? Some say yes.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
GRAB it. So say many economists, referring to the bold trade deal that China offered the United States in April and President Clinton rejected in what many deem a serious foreign policy blunder. Mr. Clinton can reverse course when he meets President Jiang Zemin on Sunday in Australia.
China wants to enter the World Trade Organization in time for the group's next meeting in Seattle in November, when the member nations are expected to embark on a new round of world trade talks. But before China can join, it needs the approval of Mr. Clinton and Congress. So it offered huge "concessions" on nearly every front. 
 Concessions is the lingo of tradespeak. But the term is wholly misleading. China's promise to open its economy to foreign goods and investment would serve its own self-interest yet would be largely irrelevant to the economic fortunes of the United States. Some concession.
Critics make three arguments for rejecting the offer. Delay could achieve better terms in the future. The deal's nice-sounding terms are unenforceable. And China's entry into the trade group would flood American markets with cheap textiles and apparel.
But judging from an analysis of Daniel H. Rosen and his colleagues at the Institute for International Economics, the first criticism appears weak, the second misleading and the third misguided.
The precise terms of China's offer remain unpublished, though the Administration published a summary. The breadth of the offer is stunning. China would drastically cut tariffs to levels less than those of most United States trade partners. It would eliminate export subsidies, phase out quotas on industrial products and comply immediately with World Trade Organization rules for protecting foreign investors and intellectual property.
China also agreed to phase out regulations that restrict foreign companies from importing, exporting, wholesaling and retailing. The offer would permit foreign companies to buy substantial stakes in insurance and telecommunications companies. China also agreed to have its state-owned enterprises make purchases on nondiscriminatory terms, based solely on price, quality and other commercial considerations.
Jeffrey Schott of the institute said that these terms were "substantially more liberal than those the United States had hoped to get out of negotiations and substantially more liberal than those which a number of existing W.T.O. members, like India, currently adhere to. You can't say that the terms of the agreement don't measure up."
Greg Mastel of the New American Foundation, a prominent critic, says that the deal is deficient on telecommunications and financial services. He has a point. There is, for example, no firm provision to eliminate nonperforming loans from banks, which serve as disguised subsidies to state-owned enterprises. This omission raises questions about China's commitment to run its state-owned enterprises on a commercial basis.
Mr. Mastel also criticizes the deal because, he says, it cannot be enforced. China is not, he warned, "a rule-based society" that makes decisions in ways that can be monitored and challenged. He points to China's repeated violations of patent and copyright protections.
But here the Administration must ask, what is the alternative? In the absence of membership, China could continue many of its protectionist ways with impunity. But as a member, China is subject to the trade group's disciplinary process that has proven to be impartial and unflinching.
The United States would lose the right to impose unilateral trade sanctions against China once it joins the group. But the United States would gain international backing for sanctions so that every dispute does not turn into a bilateral foreign policy spat. Also, China would be responsible for meeting market-opening commitments that go well beyond anything the United States can now demand.
Critics point to the fact that as a member of the World Trade Organization, China would escape restrictions now in place on its exports of textiles and apparel to the United States. But Marcus Noland of the institute estimates that most Chinese sales here come at the expense of imports from other countries, not American manufacturers. Indeed, the institute estimates that American exports to China under the trade deal would rise by about $3 billion. Imports from China would rise by slightly more, so the overall effect on the $8 trillion American economy would be minute.
For the most part, the United States already provides China nondiscriminatory access. So why does China fight for admission to a club whose benefits it largely enjoys already? Prime Minister Zhu Rongji apparently needs the weight of international commitments to help overcome domestic opposition to his ambitious plan to drive his economy away from state controls and toward markets. That would seem to be an ambition that Mr. Clinton would want to propel rather than sabotage.

Canadian Auto Workers To Bargain With Ford First
Ford Motor will be the pattern-setting company in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union announced. The union will first try to reach a deal with Ford, then it plans to follow the industry tradition of demanding that G.M. and DaimlerChrysler accept its terms.
The Canadian union said it chose Ford in part because the leader of the American union, Stephen P. Yokich, had narrowed his choices to General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. Industry and labor experts are betting the United Automobile Workers will name DaimlerChrysler as its lead company. Page C2. 

Greenspan Talks, but Not of Rates
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested in a speech that the United States economy's expansion could continue, thanks to advancements in technology. But he did not discuss his views on interest rates, inflation or current economic conditions. C8.
 
Stocks End Mixed Ahead of Report
Stocks ended mixed as investors remained cautious ahead of the producer price index, which is scheduled to be released tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.21 points, to 11,036.34. The Nasdaq composite index fell 28.52 points, or 1.02 percent, to 2,808.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 6.30 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,344.15. C9.
 
Bond prices edged up as traders covered short positions after the Federal Reserve took measures to insure there would be enough money in the banking system to counter any Year 2000 computer problems. The yield on the 30-year issue was unchanged. C9.
 
S.E.C. Fines Van Kampen $100,000
The Securities and Exchange Commission censured and fined Van Kampen Investment Advisory $100,000 for marketing the Van Kampen Growth fund's hot track record without disclosing how its returns were actually obtained. The S.E.C. said Van Kampen improperly failed to disclose to investors that more than half of the fund's 1996 return of 62 percent came from hot initial offerings. The fund was able to buy these initial offerings while it had only a few hundred thousand dollars of assets and was closed to the public. Market Place. C10.
 
Britain Raises Key Interest Rate
Britain's central bank raised a key short-term money rate for the first time in more than a year in a pre-emptive move against inflation. The quarter-point increase in the securities repurchase rate, to 5.25 percent, broke a series of seven modest rate cuts. In response, the pound rose, settling in London at $1.6209 and in New York at $1.6192, up from $1.6049. Stocks moved lower, closing down slightly less than 1 percent in London. C4.

HEADLINE: Herbert Stein, Nixon Adviser And Economist, Is Dead at 83

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Herbert Stein, a free-market economist who used careful analysis and sharp wit to persuade the business community in the 1940's to rally behind the "unnatural" idea of using Federal budget deficits to regulate the economy, died yesterday at a hospital in Washington. He was 83.
The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Rachel Epstein of New York City. 
 Most famous as a member and later chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Nixon and Ford, Mr. Stein seldom let ideological purity stand in the way of what he thought was economic common sense.
He made news in the 1960's and 70's, but he made economic history in the 1940's. Mr. Stein served as an economist for the Committee for Economic Development for 22 years, starting in 1945. The committee, formed during World War II by executives and educators to study economic issues, adopted early on the idea, associated with John Maynard Keynes, of running deficits to moderate economic downturns.
Robert Solow, a Nobel Laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, applauded Mr. Stein's role in bringing the business community, a potentially hostile audience, behind the strategic use of deficits, a linchpin of economic thinking in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon Administrations.
"He convinced a powerful business lobby that there was no ideological reason not to pursue Keynesian fiscal policy," Mr. Solow said yesterday. Mr. Stein argued that while Government spending and revenue could be matched over the long run, it could be economically destructive during recessions to raise taxes or cut spending to eliminate deficits in the short run.
By now, this idea is commonplace. But it was an uncomfortable, heretical notion in the 1940's.
Mr. Stein, at the suggestion of Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, served on President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers from 1969 to 1972 and as chairman of the council until 1974. During that time, he helped design Mr. Nixon's 90-day freeze of wages and prices and its aftermath -- an uncomfortable position for a conservative who preached the benefits of unfettered markets.
After he left Government, he became a professor at the University of Virginia and joined the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. He gained more fame by writing pointed, often humorous columns for The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and other large newspapers.
Because his writing often defended surprisingly liberal positions, he became known as the liberals' favorite conservative -- a tag line, Mr. Solow says, that made Mr. Stein cringe because he wanted his ideas to be applauded for their sensible, pragmatic underpinnings.
Mr. Stein came to what others perceived as contradictory positions because he followed the nonideological logic of the economist's tool box. He argued against those, including fellow Republicans, who focused on a relatively small number, the Federal deficit, when what they should be analyzing, in his view, was the entire composition of national spending. With that figure in mind, Mr. Stein argued that the nation could afford to spend not only more on the military, which he often favored, but also more to combat poverty.
Charles Schultze of the Brookings Institution praised Mr. Stein for refusing to give into fads. He understood that taxes depress economic activity, but he refused to follow those who fell in love with extreme versions of supply-side economics -- the notion, popular in the 1980's, that tax cuts would unleash waves of more work and investment. Mr. Schultze recalled a conference at which Mr. Stein punctured a speaker's faddish claims about the revolutionary effect of computers and the Internet by simply observing that the effect of those technological changes were not as great as that of the steam engine.
Mr. Stein was born in Detroit, received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1935 and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1958. His most important academic work was "The Fiscal Revolution in America," published in 1969, which examined decades of American fiscal policy and its effect on the economy.
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Stein is survived by a son, Ben of Los Angeles, the host of the Comedy Central television quiz program "Win Ben Stein's Money"; a sister, Pearl Weiss, of Sarasota, Fla., and three grandchildren.
Mr. Stein was famous for making sensible economic points with wit and style. He frequently reminded Jeremiahs that "if a thing cannot go on forever, it will stop." His point was that economies adjust to growing trade deficits, accelerating prices and ballooning deficits and that to project that bad things will continue indefinitely makes no sense.
Cautioning against attaching religious significance to the deficit, Mr. Stein wrote: "I have consulted a concordance on the Bible. Apparently the world 'budget' does not appear in either the Old or the New Testament. The world 'balance' does appear about eight times, but never in connection with fiscal policy."

HEADLINE: Officials Urge M.T.A. to Build Full Second Ave. Subway Line

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
Calling on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to show the vision and foresight they said were needed to protect the city's future, elected officials urged the agency yesterday to seek enough funds to pay for a Second Avenue subway line running the length of Manhattan.
In August, the M.T.A. described alternatives for a Second Avenue line in its five-year capital plan. The most ambitious version offered by the agency, which critics called the stub line, would run under Second Avenue from 125th Street to 63d Street, where it would switch onto tracks now used by the N and R lines. 
 The original plan for a Second Avenue line from the Bronx to the financial district was scrapped in the 1970's because of the city's fiscal crisis. The Lexington Avenue subway line is the only one running north-south on the East Side, and trains are overcrowded to the point of being dangerous, riders' advocates say.
The authority also has plans for a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal, which would add about 17,000 passengers a day to the Lexington Avenue line, where rib-to-elbows rush hour rides are common. Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the M.T.A., strongly supports that link. The M.T.A. is expected to present its five-year capital plan to its board of directors on Sept. 29.
At a press conference at City Hall, City Councilman A. Gifford Miller said, "If the subway represents the arteries of our city, the Lexington Avenue line is about to cause us a major cardiac arrest."
The Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, spoke in favor of a Second Avenue line reaching from 125th Street to the Battery.
"Growth of jobs in Manhattan is directly tied to a good transit system," she said. "The need has never been greater. Our city's economic future indeed is riding on it."
Earlier yesterday, the Empire State Transportation Alliance, a new coalition of 46 groups as diverse as the Straphangers Campaign and the Automobile Club of New York, called for building the entire Second Avenue line.
Lew Rudin, chairman of the Association for a Better New York, said: "We're sitting on top of a new, exciting communications industry. How could we not move people to the Wall Street area and South Bronx, Harlem and Long Island City?" he said.
Bob Yaro, co-chairman of the transit coalition and executive director of the Regional Plan Association, said that by 2020, 350,000 more jobs are expected in the city. "We've essentially used up the transportation system built by our grandparents," he said. "New York avoids investment in expansion and improvements at its peril."
But Gary Caplan, the M.T.A.'s budget director, defended the shorter line when he testified before the City Council Transportation Committee. He said it would begin at 125th Street and then switch to existing, unused express tracks along the N and the R lines under Broadway, allowing riders to ride from Harlem to City Hall, through the financial district, then on to Brooklyn, without switching trains.
Mr. Caplan said extending the Second Avenue line south of 63d Street would create only an additional 1 percent reduction in crowding at the Grand Central stop on the Lexington Avenue line and 5 percent at the line's 86th Street station over the reductions the stub line would create, and would cost more than twice as much as the shorter line, which he estimated at $3.6 billion.
At the hearing, Councilwoman Kathryn Freed assailed the M.T.A.'s plan. "Maybe it is a first step, but it is an inadequate first step," she told Mr. Caplan, then raised the possibility of someone firing the M.T.A. and holding the Governor and Mayor responsible for transportation.
Mr. Gifford, who represents the Upper East Side, then asked Mr. Caplan, "Why isn't the M.T.A. saying there's not enough money? Why do you say we've got to come up with modest plans for modest resources? I believe more money needs to be raised. But where are you? Where is the M.T.A. when there's not enough money and we need more?"
Mr. Caplan replied, "We believe this is what can be funded."
In later testimony, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said the city must consider the consequences of doing nothing. "The economic loss due to traffic congestion exceeds $6.6 billion dollars annually within New York City," he said.
