Shooting Stars In Minnesota
Bitter winters produce some sweet returns. Minnesota has given rise to three mutual funds that invest heavily in the state and that have outpaced the stock market recently, said Matthew S. Muehlbauer, who edits the Value Line Fund Highlight, which showcases above-average funds in the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey. 
 The three are Mairs and Power Growth, which has outperformed the market every calendar year since 1989; First American Regional Equity, which has done so for the last three years, and Perkins Opportunity, which has done so for two years. Each of the funds has an annualized 36-month return exceeding 20 percent, compared with 15.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The funds all have their headquarters in the Twin Cities area, and the first two have at least 80 percent of their assets invested in Minnesota companies. The third, Perkins, has about half its portfolio invested in local businesses.
Perhaps all this is just a coincidence. But Minnesota is home to several big companies, like 3M, that produce a steady stream of seasoned employees who eventually set up their own companies. The state also has a large, established venture-capital network to support fledgling companies and business groups that support entrepreneurs, Mr. Muehlbauer said.
Investors should note that the small stocks owned by First American and Perkins can be more volatile than bigger stocks, as can the midsize stocks owned by Mairs. And Minnesota's economy has been strong lately, contributing to the funds' performance. Mr. Muehlbauer cautioned that the funds were best suited for people with long time horizons for their investments, and who weren't concerned by volatility.
 
Ordering On Line
Mutual fund activity on the Internet is hopping. Fund companies are scrambling to set up home pages on the World Wide Web with information about their funds and investing in general. But the movement to let investors buy and sell securities on line is still in its infancy.
Jack White & Company says it is the first brokerage firm to process mutual fund orders through its Internet connection on the PAWWS Financial Network (http://pawws.com/jwc). Investors can trade 4,400 hundreds of funds in the company's mutual fund network, including more than 800 in a no-transaction-fee program.
Look for Charles Schwab & Company to add a similar service in May.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
A Handshake Unwise for Europe

BYLINE: By BARRY EICHENGREEN; Barry Eichengreen is the John L. Simpson Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
NOTWITHSTANDING negative forecasts, European monetary unification is likely to happen on schedule on Jan. 1, 1999. But while there are clear potential economic benefits, unification is being carried out in a way that is likely to produce unfortunate effects for Europe and its trading partners, including the United States.
Already, the move toward unification has slowed growth and increased unemployment in Europe. Now, France and Germany have agreed on a structure that will impede Europe's ability to respond effectively to economic downturns. 
 European monetary unification will happen because France and Germany want it. A recent poll found that the French favor a single currency. While the Germans may have reservations, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has vowed to shepherd his program, of which EMU is a central element, through parliament.
The core French-German bargain is monetary union for political union. Germany wants political union in order to acquire a foreign policy role in a united Europe. To obtain it, Bonn must offer Paris monetary union, which France wants in order to regain some control of Europe's financial conditions from Germany.
The rationale for European integration has always been to lock Germany into Europe, economically and politically. Institutionalized restraint appeals to the French, who fear German might, and to the Germans, who for historical reasons are unwilling to use political and military power unilaterally. Mr. Kohl recently appealed to this notion, insisting that monetary union was necessary to free Europe from war in the 21st century.
But in neither France nor Germany is EMU without problems.
Germany fears that its EMU partners will run excessive deficits and incur excessive debts. To reduce debt-service costs, Germans worry, the partners will pressure the European Central Bank to keep interest rates artificially low, resulting in an inflationary monetary policy.
Bonn is therefore insisting on a "stability council" to monitor the budgetary policies of participating countries. Members that don't keep deficits within 1 percent of gross domestic product and otherwise obey the dictates of the council would be subject to political and economic sanctions. While the Maastricht Treaty contains an excessive-deficit procedure and a budget deficit guideline of 3 percent of G.D.P., Germany wants a tougher test.
France, for its part, fears competitive currency depreciation and the dumping of goods by European Union states like Italy and Britain, which will not be founding members of the monetary union. Those countries' departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System in 1992 and subsequent export-led recoveries -- partly at the expense of France -- resonates with a long-standing French aversion to currency fluctuations. (The new Italian Government will try to bring the lira back into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But because of the country's very serious public debt problem, Italy will not be a founding member of EMU.)
Paris has demanded that member states outside the monetary union participate in a new European Monetary System to be built around a single currency.
At the meeting of French and German finance ministers and central bankers in Laval, France, last month, the French agreed to back the idea of a stability council in return for German support for a system of exchange-rate bands for countries that do not participate in the monetary union. This pact was effectively confirmed at a meeting in Verona, Italy, of all European Union finance ministers and central bankers two Sundays ago. Now there is virtually no doubt that monetary union will happen. But it also suggests it will be on undesirable terms.
Germany's stability pact is undesirable because it will hamstring stabilization policy. Monetary union will by definition remove exchange rates and interest rates as instruments for absorbing shocks that affect one European country more strongly than another.
In principle, fiscal policy will remain; thus, if France succumbs to recession -- but Germany does not -- France's automatic fiscal stabilizers can come into play. French taxes will fall, sustaining demand until the recession is over. But a strict 1 percent cap on budget deficits, plus the fact that governments will be up against this limit when monetary union begins, will effectively eliminate all fiscal flexibility.
There may be good reasons to tie Europe's monetary hands, but to remove its fiscal defenses as well would leave its economies naked in the face of business cycles.
France's idea of exchange-rate bands for the outsiders is equally appalling. If there is one lesson to be gleaned from the history of the European Monetary System in the early 1990's, it is that exchange-rate bands are exceedingly difficult to defend in today's highly liquid markets.
Once the strong-currency countries join a monetary union, only the weak will remain outside, rendering them sitting ducks for speculators. The newly created European Central Bank will be intent on establishing the credibility of its commitment to price stability. It will hardly be prepared to lend extensive exchange-rate support to outside currencies.
Monetary union is probably desirable insofar as it will advance the cause of European integration. But if it comes packaged with a stability council and exchange-rate bands, the economic price may be too high. To keep these issues off-limits at the European Union Intergovernmental Conference that began last month in Italy would be shortsighted in the worst way.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
For the Brave, an Open-End Russia Fund

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
ABOUT the time that the people of Russia elect a president in June, Americans are expected to get their first chance to buy an open-end mutual fund invested there. Neither is without substantial risk.
The American company sponsoring the fund, the Lexington Management Corporation of Saddle Brook,N.J., has devoted nearly a third of the draft prospectus to outlining the investors' risks -- from political uncertainty and rampant commercial crime to punitive taxes and a dubious legal and accounting system.
"There are unusual risks, but the exciting part of the story in Russia is that valuations on these companies are very, very low relative to other countries," said Richard Hisey, a managing director and chief financial officer at Lexington.
Low valuations aside, the Lexington fund will encounter some big market obstacles, very thin trading and delays in settlement, to name just a couple. Given how sketchy corporate financial information is there, investors might also think long and hard about how reliable those low valuations really are.
Jim Rogers, known for his international investing in years past and author of "Investment Biker," says most financial data about Russian companies are invented. Any profits, he adds, could easily be stolen by insiders, taxed away by the Government or consumed by raging inflation, which has abated from the 2,600 percent rate of 1992 but is still running about 70 percent.
"Anybody who thinks Russia is attractive doesn't understand history," Mr. Rogers said in a recent interview. "When empires like this dissolve, there is chaos for years."
Mr. Rogers is not the only one with apparent reservations. J. Mark Mobius, who travels the world as a Templeton fund manager and who manages a closed-end fund that invests in Russia, recently acknowledged that he did not have any of his own money in that fund. Americans can buy shares in Templeton Russia, begun last summer, on the New York Stock Exchange, where they now trade at a price about 20 percent higher than the underlying value of the fund's assets.
Perhaps the best summary of the Russian situation came from David Tripple, chief investment officer of the Pioneer Group in Boston. "I would define the Russian equity markets as pre-emergent," he said, drawing a distinction from the emerging markets, commonly considered the most volatile of investments.
Five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian economy is struggling. The nation is desperately poor, with gross domestic product in 1994 estimated at $300 billion, or les than one-twentieth of the United States figure. One member of the Parliament, Pavel G. Bunich, estimated that two-thirds of industrial plant and equipment had been broken up and sold or had decayed beyond repair in this decade. He said the richest 20 percent of Russians received half the nation's total income while the poorest 20 percent got 3.5 percent. Hundreds of bankers and plant managers have been murdered, and the currency has fallen from official parity with the United States dollar under Communism to 4,918 to the dollar in recent trading.
The Russian equities market, with a total capitalization estimated at $20 billion (about the size of Sears, Roebuck), itself is fraught with peril. Shares of about 900 companies are publicly listed, but only about 60 trade at least once a month, and fewer than 30 on a weekly basis, according to Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc., an investment bank in New York. Although there are stock exchanges, shares trade over the counter in practice, and just establishing their value is difficult. Share registries have been known to disappear, and with them the sole proof of investors' ownership.
Not everyone, of course, is completely sour on the market. George Soros, the hedge fund manager, and George Russell, chairman of the pension consulting and money management firm of Frank Russell Company, have expressed cautious support for Russian prospects.
Part of the appeal is that Russian assets are cheap by international standards. Mr. Hisey said one of the Lexington fund's potential investments, Lukoil, has proven reserves of nearly 16 billion barrels of oil, more than twice those of Exxon, but a market capitalization of $4 billion, compared with $105 billion for Exxon.
A recent research report by Bleichroeder says the price of Russian telephone stocks works out to less than $100 a line, compared with at least $2,000 in Latin America and $4,500 in Asia. Nevertheless, the report urges investors to avoid Russia. "Little harm will befall those who choose to remain on the sidelines and place investments in more secure places," it concluded.
Among the problems for investors is that financial disclosure is haphazard, and sometimes entirely absent. Nicholas Bratt, director of the global equity group of Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc., noted that a prospectus for a private placement of stock in Gazprom, Russia's largest gas company, carried this disclosure: "Neither the company nor Morgan Grenfell, the British merchant bank, nor the U.S. placement agent, has 1.) obtained or secured any information, financial or otherwise, which is deemed reliable; 2.) asked any questions of officers, directors, managers or employees of Gazprom, or 3.) conducted any other due diligence with respect to Gazprom." Not exactly a ringing endorsement.
Nor is it an isolated example. Lukoil, cited by Lexington as a potential investment, noted in its most recent annual report, for 1994, that its auditor, KPMG, had reviewed only that information submitted by the company, and that it did not expect to meet international standards of accounting until 1996. "Neither in its objective, scope nor procedures used can the work that we have carried be considered a full audit of authenticity of the above consolidated accounting standards," the auditors' statement concludes.
Mr. Hisey said Lexington was well aware of these problems, and with its Moscow-based subadviser, Troika Dialog Asset Management, has taken numerous safeguarding steps. He said the fund would invest largely in the biggest companies with the most liquid stocks like Lukoil; Mosenergo, the Moscow power company; Rostelecom, the national long-distance phone company, and Red October, a candy manufacturer. It will also limit itself to companies that have truly independent outside registrars for stock records.
"We have what we believe to be a very conservative set of procedures to protect our interests and the interests of our shareholders there," Mr. Hisey said.
Another potential problem, perhaps even harder to skirt, is having shares diluted if a company decides to issue new shares to insiders, politicians or the Russian people. "The biggest risk is not a company stealing or erasing your ownership interest, but diluting it," Mr. Hisey said.
Similar concerns, and a fear that Americans will not fully understand them, have caused the Pioneer Group to rule out the possibility of a Russia fund for the mass market in the near future. Instead, Pioneer expects to offer a mutual fund to Russian investors in June through a joint venture and to add two funds later this year for American institutions.
Single-country funds for retail investors are terribly volatile and risky even when they focus on more established markets, Mr. Tripple said. Based on Pioneer's experience managing funds for Polish investors, he said, "it's tough to match U.S. versions of liquidity in foreign operations." Along with the difficulty sometimes of finding a willing buyer or seller for Russian securities, the actual settlement can take far longer than the three to five days we are accustomed to here, he said.
So far, Russian profits have proved mostly elusive for American investors. While still very young, the Templeton Russia fund experienced a 13.9 percent decline in its net asset value in the second half of last year and a 6.62 percent decline in the first quarter of this year. As a closed-end fund, Templeton Russia has something working in its favor that the Lexington fund won't. Should there be a sharp market decline, it doesn't have to worry about raising cash to meet shareholder redemptions at a time when Russian equities might be even harder to trade than usual or when selling might depress prices further. Its shareholders can simply sell their stake on the Big Board. For this reason, closed-end funds are the most common vehicle for single-country investing.
"I can't imagine anyone running an open-end mutual fund to invest in Russia," said Thomas J. Herzfeld, an investor in Miami who specializes in closed-end funds. The prospect of needing to sell assets in a down market is daunting, he said. "How do you sell securities in an illiquid market?"
Mr. Hisey said the Lexington fund was intended for long-term investors, and he did not expect a problem with redemptions or a resulting cash squeeze. The fund intends to discourage redemptions by imposing a 2 percent fee on shares held less than one year. While the fund will not carry an upfront sales charge, expenses are expected to run a hefty 3.35 percent of assets a year. The minimum investment will be $5,000. The suggested stomach: strong.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Will Japan's Success Soon Shine on Its U.S. Investors?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
IT'S bad enough when a seemingly smart investment idea goes wrong and costs you money. But it's an even greater frustration when being right doesn't pay off.
Take, for example, Japan. 
 Investors anticipating the end of Japan's five-year recession have driven up the Nikkei 225, the blue-chip stock index, more than 30 percent the last year. The performance matches that of the Dow Jones industrial average and surpasses that of the leading stock indexes of Britain and Germany.
But what does the American who bought mutual funds that invest in Japan have to show for making their sagacious bet on the Nikkei, which has soared 56 percent from its early-July low? A relatively paltry gain of about 9 percent in the last 12 months, according to a tabulation of Japanese funds by Lipper Analytical Services.
"From the perspective of the United States investor, it has not felt like a recovery in Japan," said George A. Murnaghan, executive vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore, sponsor of the $220 million T. Rowe Price Japan Fund.
The root cause of this underperformance is the decline in the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar.
In the first three months of 1996, for example, T. Rowe Price Japan posted a 7 percent profit in Japan -- only to wind up with a net gain of just 3 percent after the currency translation.
But some money managers think that the yen's relationship to the dollar is likely to stabilize -- and that American investors may finally get their long-awaited reward.
One is Ron Chapman, head of international equities for the Dreyfus Corporation, the New York sponsor of Dreyfus Global Growth and other funds with sizable foreign stakes. While Mr. Chapman could hedge his Japanese investments to neutralize part of the currency risk, he is not doing so.
Only when the dollar has a "significant" chance of rising by more than 10 percent over a 12- to 18-month period would he hedge, Mr. Chapman said. And by his calculation, if the yen falls at all, it will be by no more than about 3 percent.
Even if the currencies cooperate, will the Japanese stock market continue upward after so much gain? "I can't be as bullish at 22,000 as at 14,000 last summer," said Mr. Chapman, referring to the Nikkei 225 index, which closed at 22,230.1 this week. But Japan, he said, is the only major economy that is in the early stages of business expansion and in which corporate earnings, far below historic highs, could improve significantly.
Japanese investors, Mr. Chapman said, are gradually recovering from the shock of the Nikkei's 63 percent dive from its December 1989 peak to its July 1995 low. That means all the money stuffed into mattresses since then -- "an enormous amount of liquidity," he said -- will slowly become available to power further stock market advances.
"This market has maybe 15 percent upside" potential during 1996, Mr. Chapman estimated, backing his view with a greater weighting of Japanese stocks -- 32 percent against 22 percent -- than the average of his competitors.
Like Mr. Chapman, Mr. Murnaghan of Rowe Price-Fleming does not see any need to hedge against a weakening yen. While the Japanese currency may fall a bit, he said, there will not be much movement.
But opinions differ among money managers. Paul Kirkby, investment manager of the GAM Japan Capital Fund, the top-ranked fund last year among those invested entirely in Japan, said he is "not as bullish" on Japan these days as most of his peers.
There is "clearly a currency risk" in Japanese stocks, said Mr. Kirkby, who has hedged 75 percent to 80 percent of his $37.7 million fund against that danger. He also thinks other investors may be fooled by the Nikkei's past peaks. "If the market's previous peak in December 1989 had been 25,000 rather than 39,000, it is unlikely Japan would be considered a 'bargain' today," he said recently in an internal memorandum.
And he agrees with many analysts who do not expect Japan to grow more than 2 percent this year, less than half of what is typical for an economy emerging from recession. One large source of drag is that many companies, driven by years of yen appreciation that has made exporting less profitable, have been shifting production to lower-cost countries in the Far East, a development referred to as the "hollowing out" of Japanese industry.
Still, Mr. Kirkby has identified dozens of stocks, including insurance, leasing and other nonbank financial companies, that he believes represent good value. He said he also may buy various high-tech issues, some benefiting from deregulation, but would prefer to do so on price dips.

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
Downtown Renewal Includes Pieces of History

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Englewood's historic Monument section is about to undergo a face lift.
Last week, civic leaders and city officials inaugurated a $150,000 fund-raising drive to renovate of the Monument intersection, site of the historic Liberty Pole and a World War I memorial. If successful, the drive, called the Liberty Square Project, will help pay for new historical markers, a memorial walk and wall, landscaping, better lighting and other renovations. Organizers say some work could start this year. 
 The first Liberty Pole was erected in 1766 by colonists celebrating the repeal of the British Stamp Act. Since then, there have been poles of various materials. The current one, installed in 1964, is a 60-foot metal pole topped by a gold liberty cap.
The war memorial, which dates to 1924, features a statue of a soldier in uniform. But the area has fallen into disuse in recent years, obscured by trees and ignored by drivers circling Palisade Avenue and Tenafly Road.
The fund drive is part of a broad plan to revitalize downtown Englewood. Organizers have raised $16,000 from private sources and $3,500 in public money. City officials have also pledged $20,000.
"We just have to remind people of the status of the town, and try to identify the city as a beautiful and historic place," said Wesley Marshall, a trustee of the Liberty Square Association, a nonprofit group spearheading the campaign. DAVID W. CHEN

GETTING AND SPENDING
 
Oh. Right. The Budget.
 
It brings a cartoon to mind: the handyman suggests to his fraying employers that since it's September and he hasn't taken the storm windows off yet, maybe they should just forget about it for this year. Which brings us, of course, to the Federal budget. You'd forgotten about it, right? You probably figured that so much time had passed that those squabblers in Washington would just let it slide and try again next year. But wonder of wonders, with the fiscal year more than half over, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole pulled a deal out of their hats last week. So for five months, at least, museums will stay open, the Government will take no more sick days. But it was a bit like the animal patrol rounding up the kittens and leaving the elephants. For while Democrats salvaged some job and education programs and Republicans got some spending cuts, the compromise tiptoed around the big-money issues, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and welfare. Next time.

What the Downsized Folk Do
 
It's a cacophony of revisionism. Everyone's pronouncing all the downsizing anxiety a bad dream. First a manufacturers group said wage gains had been obscured by exaggerated inflation numbers. Then last week the Council of Economic Advisers put out a study aimed at exploding the notion that yesterday's white-collar paper-pusher is now holed up at the local McDonald's counting pickles. No, the study insists, the new jobs are good jobs, at mutual funds, hospitals, software companies. The head of the council admitted that "the anxieties are real," but insisted they are overblown. It is a coincidence, isn't it, that this rose-colored economics is blossoming in an election year?
 
UTILITIES UNBOUND
 
Get Your Kilowatts Here!
 
Just to clarify one point: When regulators told 166 large utilities last week to open their transmission systems to competition, that didn't mean you'll suddenly have 166 power lines to your house. You won't hear: "Honey, turn on the Duke Power light. Their rates are lowest today." Marketers won't call, as your dinner's first bite is in midair, to urge you to plug your television into the Southern California Edison outlet. No, this is wholesale stuff. Your local utility still has you all to itself. Regulators put the annual savings to industry and consumers at $4 billion or $5 billion. In the high-cost Northeast, utilities can buy cheap power elsewhere and, presumably, pass the savings along to consumers. Presumably.
 
 
TOBACCO STOCKS
 
Mutual Fund Country
 
Many investors balk at tobacco stocks, partly for the risk from all those lawsuits, partly as a matter of principle. Yet those same investors may, knowingly or not, own mutual funds heavy on tobacco. A consumer group, Co-op America, reports that 6 of the 10 biggest mutual funds list tobacco stocks in their top 10 holdings, a total investment in the billions. Now the American Medical Association wants investors to rethink where their savings go, last week urging "people interested in the health and welfare of our children" to sell tobacco shares and funds that buy them.
 
PHONE MERGERS
 
Mr. Dumpty? It's for You!
 
It was the darkest of technological times, those days before the AT&T breakup. No pocket phones. A few scattered modems. Phone bills that private citizens could decipher. But that phone industry, quaint as it was, was owned by AT&T, so it had to be dismantled. The rules have changed, though, and new giants are being born. Bell Atlantic and Nynex, which linked up last week, will dominate the Northeast and be the nation's No. 2, behind a humbler AT&T. What of phone customers? Well, they're being told things will be simpler; one company to serve many needs, less troublesome competition. Which sounds, of course, like the old AT&T. Speaking of layoffs, though, the companies say they'll cut just 3,000 jobs from a combined work force up 133,000, a far cry from the tens of thousands in other megamergers.
 
THE PRICE OF PAIN
 
Crime's Bottom Line?
 
Can an explosive issue like crime really be reduced to a clear, crisp item on a balance sheet? A report for the Justice Department tries to do just that, putting a price tag on everything from legal fees to mental anguish to come up with a startling estimate: crime costs Americans $450 billion a year. That doesn't even count the $40 billion spent locking people up. Does it follow, then, that it makes cold economic sense to jail everyone you can? If America were a corporation, fixated on next quarter's results, then the manic prison-building would be justified. "The public and politicians demand immediate gratification," says one criminologist, "so there is considerable push for being tough." Thus, he added, "we have largely abandoned prevention and rehabilitation efforts." Another study suggests that saving a high-risk juvenile from a life of crime could net the country at least $1.5 million. Or, as the pros say, invest and hold.
 
WORKING GIRLS
 
Was It Cool? Affirmative
 
Affirmative action. Those are heavy words, political words, adult words, not words you'd find in the mouths of 11-year-olds. Ask most Daughters who were Taken to Work about their Day, and they'll probably say it was neat or cool or a drag or awesome. And their brothers might say, "Yeah, my yucky sister got to skip school, and the brat got more ice cream last night, too." Discrimination? Some companies thought so, making it Take Our Children to Work Day. But that, says the Ms. Foundation, the event's organizer, misses the whole point, to repair some of society's damage to girls' self-esteem. A Ms. spokeswoman, referring to one company's comment that it would never "exclude by gender," pointed to all the males running that company and said, "Executives with glass ceilings shouldn't throw stones."
 
 
AUTO SAFETY
 
A Record Ford Recall
 
An internal company memo from February 1995 shows that Ford was aware of a "very small potential for ignition switch fires on certain vehicles" and warned of possible "adverse publicity." No, the danger did not prompt Ford to recall the vehicles then, but the memo was right on target about that publicity. The company got complaints of at least 1,100 fires and some injuries, Canada ordered a recall in November, and lawyers got into the act with a flurry of class-action suits. No self-respecting topic these days would be without an Internet page, and sure enough, the Association of Flaming Ford Owners was born. Last week it all got too much for Ford, which recalled 8.7 million cars and trucks, the largest recall ever by a single car maker.

GRAPHIC: Photos: "JACKIE'S ATTIC: Oh, What Does It All Mean?"
It's a quandary for anyone whose parents have died: what stuff to keep, what to sell, what to toss. Many a ragged item hovers awkwardly between memory-laden prize and, well, junk. Now suppose, for a moment, that Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg suddenly regretted not holding onto the ratty old satin-covered footstool that, in a long-ago White House, helped her up to the window seat. Sorry. Too late. No, it didn't go out with the trash, it sold at Sotheby's last week for $33,350. (That's right, enough for a house down payment or a modest luxury car.) For a few brief shining days, auction mania ("There's only one of these," the auctioneer bubbled. "This is about history.") transformed one family's attic into a quite healthy-sized business, a $4.47 million take the first night alone. What do you suppose, say, Dan Quayle's old easy chair would fetch?

HEADLINE: The Soul of a School Board Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
IT was time to talk about contingency plans. The race for School Board 3 was just beginning, and a group of candidates were huddling around a dining room table in an Upper West Side apartment and, between crackerfuls of blue cheese and cups of seltzer, discussing what to do if things turned ugly.
"The attack you're going to get is on P.S. 9 -- that your kids are all in gifted programs," Deborah Pollock, a member of the outgoing school board, warned the neophytes. "You're going to be called the Gifted and Talented slate." 
 The four candidates -- two white and two Hispanic -- looked at each other nervously. It was true: three had children in programs for the gifted at Public School 9 on West 84th Street, the academic pride of the district. On the playing fields of school politics, "gifted" is a loaded word; charges of elitism could be damaging. So the nascent slate needed a vigorous defense. It also needed a name, something catchy, something that would play in the northern end of the district, up in Harlem, as well as the southern end, the Upper West Side.
Ivette Guerra, a candidate, had an idea.
"How about Padres por los Ninos?" she suggested.
"Padres por los Ninos," mused Gerald Gliber, another candidate. "Parents for Children. The other side can't claim that. We are all parents."
The name stuck. It would appeal to Hispanic parents, it did not sound elitist and it aimed a sly barb at the three members of the rival slate with no children. Giggles and thumps sounded from the next room, where children were playing with a Tinkertoy set and paper airplanes.
Meet the warriors of school district politics, a combative but tiny group. Widely ignored by the electorate, still plagued by accusations of corruption and facing extinction by a city- and statewide officialdom now largely convinced of its ineffectiveness, the 26-year-old school board system is hobbling toward its next election.
Only this year it's worse: There are fewer candidates than ever in the 32 districts and some districts do not even have enough candidates to fill their nine-member boards. And if even 10 percent of the voters go to the polls on May 7, it will be a heavy turnout.
So once again the elections will be placed in the hands of only the most highly motivated parents, special interest groups promoting particular agendas, political clubs, unions, gay groups, the Christian Coalition -- anyone who can get out the vote.
In this era of fiscal austerity, to run for school board is to seek the unpleasant task of fighting over crumbs, of deciding what to keep and what to cut. Guidance counselors or after-school programs? An extra teacher or desperately needed supplies? These decisions take a toll: In District 3, seven of the nine board members are stepping down, generally out of frustration in spite of having made crucial decisions like putting a gifted program in a Harlem middle school; postponing the relocation of P.S. 9's gifted program to a school accessible to people in wheelchairs; writing guidelines for teaching its youngest pupils and planning a school for the musically talented.
The triage atmosphere makes school boards the locus of even more vitriolic disputes, the arena where neighborhoods vie with neighborhoods and parents compete with other parents for resources. These tensions, played out in a school board campaign, provide a glimpse of the city's political life at the ground level.
These competing interests are clear in District 3, a rectangular chunk of Manhattan from Columbus Circle to 122d Street. The district is a study in urban contrasts. It represents both the largely white gentry of the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights, the mostly black poor in lower Harlem, where one resident in three lives below the poverty line, and the Spanish-speaking residents of Manhattan Valley.
The contrasts extend to its public schools. At P.S. 9, four of five students read and solve math problems at grade level. A mile and a half to the north, at P.S. 113 on 113th Street, the opposite is true: four of five students are performing below grade level.
Those two schools represent the extremes of a pattern that is repeated throughout the district. The top five schools are all below 98th Street; the bottom five are all above 110th Street. This disparity is emerging as a major issue in the campaign. It is no accident that the eight-member slate running against Padres por los Ninos calls itself Equity and Excellence.
Why this gulf exists, and what can be done about it, are contentious issues. Some point to economic and social factors, noting that poverty and the breakdown of the family put pressures on children in Harlem that their wealthier peers downtown could not even imagine. Others note that downtown parents are more active in their schools and raise money on their own. Parents at P.S. 9, for instance, raised more than $50,000 this year.
Whatever the reason for the disparity, it does not appear to stem from unequal public financing. The struggling schools uptown actually receive more public dollars than the successful schools downtown, district records show. The current board released a school-by-school budget to correct the perception that it favors downtown schools. Their budget shows, for example, that P.S. 113 receives $4,163 per student a year while P.S. 9 gets $3,058. This is largely because schools with poor students are eligible for extra government aid.
"It's not just a money issue," said Ernestine E. Roach, one of two Harlem residents on the current board.
Just what the issue is has become a major topic in the campaign.
 
UPTOWN, DOWNTOWN: THE HARLEM CONTINGENT
Wearing his black satin Harlem Little League jacket and clutching a copy of "Savage Inequalities," Jonathan Kozol's book about the gulf between poor black schools and rich white schools, William Perkins took a seat at a candidates' forum.
His choice of attire and reading material were a reminder of his main concern: What can be done to give children in Harlem the same educational opportunities as those of the Upper West Side?
"This part of the district is under-represented," said Mr. Perkins, a Harlem district leader and a founder of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club. "The more politically connected, economically influential have been able to reap the better benefits."
He is a big supporter of Yasmin N. Hurston, the lone candidate living in Harlem, which has nine of the district's 21 elementary schools but only two of the current school board's nine members.
Ms. Hurston, 24, has worked for various Harlem politicians. "If you make more noise, you get more results," Ms. Hurston said. "I want to encourage people in Harlem to make more noise."
Ms. Roach said the problem of uptown schools had been stubborn. "It's hard to get good teachers to come uptown," Ms. Roach said. "We don't get many with experience. Many are not state certified."
Teachers with seniority, she noted, get preference when choosing where they want to work and few choose Harlem.
The other Harlem board member, Liz Brock, said she would have liked to see more pressure put on Harlem schools to succeed. She pointed to the example of P.S. 191 on West 61st Street, whose scores were so low that it was put under state review. The board hired a new principal with a mandate to shake things up. Scores doubled.
"That principal worked hard and had gutsy ideas," Ms. Brock said.
But Page Best-Hardy, a black candidate who lives in an Upper West Side housing project and sends her daughter to Wadleigh Secondary School on 114th Street, said of the disparities: "I believe it has a lot to do with race. A whole lot to do with race."
Wadleigh is a Harlem school that has been shaken up. Housed in a turn-of-the-century building, it was rated one of the city's most decrepit schools in 1988. Then the city spent $47 million renovating the school, and it was divided into alternative schools for writing, technology and the arts. But parents say the work is unfinished, with supplies scarce and test scores too low.
The struggle to help Wadleigh shed its old image and problems led Ms. Hardy to run. "I'd like to see teachers held accountable when they fail the students," she said. "When my daughter went to Wadleigh her grades went from honor to horror. We had teachers who couldn't teach."
Stumping for votes at the Frederick Douglass Houses in Manhattan Valley, Ms. Best-Hardy and Carmen Quinones, an outspoken Democratic district leader and Wadleigh parent, stopped parents in a playground. "Mira, this is Page Best-Hardy," Ms. Quinones told her neighbors. "She's running for school board."
Norma Rutledge, another Wadleigh parent, accompanied them. "We need textbooks and materials," said Ms. Rutledge. "But when the parents come out it's like the district is not really listening."
Public school board meetings often resemble gripe fests, but they give parents a sounding board for their complaints in the form of a microphone, an audience and a captive panel of board members. Both Harlem board representatives said that Harlem parents sometimes felt like they were not taken seriously at meetings.
"It was very hard to get attention focused on schools north of 110th Street," Ms. Brock said. "When my parents came out the board's attention was not as focused. But they have concerns just like Upper West Side parents. Many are young and don't work and are turned off by how the board treats them."
 
GIFTED AND TALENTED ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE
While the issue for Harlem residents is improving low-performing schools, parents downtown worry about keeping their schools successful.
Take the squabble about moving P.S. 9. A group of parents, enraged by the district's plan to move their gifted and talented program to a wheelchair-accessible school five blocks away, sent protest letters and faxes, held a candle-light vigil, and lobbied the board until they won a yearlong reprieve.
The issue stirred up the old debate about gifted and talented programs. Supporters say they are needed to stimulate smart children, give poor students a better education and offer middle-class students an alternative to private schools. Detractors worry that they siphon smart students away from other schools, fail to identify qualified minority candidates and are elitist.
Echoes of the P.S. 9 skirmish resonate quietly but unmistakably in the current campaign. It radicalized many parents there, including the three who went on to form Padres por los Ninos. Mr. Gliber, as president of P.S. 9's P.T.A., played a crucial role in the struggle to keep the program.
While the two slates are publicly cordial and even friendly, the issue brings out pointed attacks in private. The Padres accuse the Equities of secretly wishing to destroy gifted programs. The Equities accuse the Padres of running for one reason: out of concern for their own children's gifted classes.
The issue surfaced at a forum when the candidates were asked their views on gifted programs.
"I have very mixed feelings about them," answered Judith Moore, an incumbent running on the Equity and Excellence slate. "I think that ideally, heterogeneous classes are preferable. Of course, there are some children who are so precocious that they need special attention."
After the debate a man in a tweed coat saw Ms. Moore speaking with a reporter and approached her. "How can you say you have mixed feelings about gifted programs," he asked, "when both of your children attend gifted programs?"
The man happened to be Dr. Paul Ehrlich, the husband of Avis Alexander, a candidate on the Padres por los Ninos slate. This was a bit of family spin doctoring, school-board-election style.
But one of the campaign's most interesting alliances has emerged between the P.S. 9 parents and some Harlem and Manhattan Valley parents. The Padres por los Ninos have been outspoken on the subject of uptown schools. "The people in the south," Mr. Gliber said at a forum, his voice rising, "for the most part don't believe that the people in the north can succeed. And it's unfair."
One of the endorsements his slate picked up was that of Ms. Quinones, who is acting as campaign manager for Ms. Best-Hardy. And they have also made inroads with many Hispanic candidates through the candidacy of Gabriel Guzman, the only member of their slate who is not from P.S. 9. Mr. Guzman lives in Manhattan Valley.
 
BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN MANHATTAN VALLEY
If gifted programs rouse Upper West Siders, bilingual education is the hot topic in Manhattan Valley, a corridor bounded by 100th Street, 110th Street, Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue.
More than 2,100 children, or 15 percent of District 3's students, took bilingual classes in 1993. All but a few spoke Spanish. And at the loudest stop along the campaign trail, the fund raiser for Mr. Guzman at the Taller Latinoamericano, a community gallery on Broadway at 104th Street, the talk between dances, drinks and flaky empanadas centered on bilingual classes.
Kiko Franco and El Negro Merengue pumped out the music. The one-two thump of the electric bass anchored couples as they twirled around the dance floor with rigid shoulders and busy legs.
"Los ninos necesitan mejor educacion," Mr. Guzman, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, told about 80 supporters. "Children need a better education."
There are two main concerns about bilingual classes: that they do not teach students English quickly enough and that the quality of instruction in Spanish is poor. Fewer than 9 percent of the district's bilingual elementary school pupils could read at grade level in 1993, even in their own language.
Radames Rivera, a supporter from Washington Heights, was worried that the bad bilingual classes could derail New York's tradition of welcoming immigrants, educating them and giving them opportunities for success. "We're talking about a large community, a poor community," he said. "And education is important."
 
THE POLITICAL INTERESTS AND THEIR CLOUT
Despite the crucial issues, the race for Board 3 has the air of a phantom campaign at times. At forum after forum, the 14 candidates outnumbered their audience.
But it took 2,056 votes to win in the last election. So candidates must seek support from the focused interest groups adept at getting out the vote with big mailing lists, phone banks and active members.
The United Federation of Teachers is not taking sides in District 3. But Local 372 of District Council 37, the union representing school paraprofessionals, is printing up fliers and offering free phones to the the Equity and Excellence slate.
With this kind of support in mind, the candidates filed into the auditorium of Bank Street College one night to ask for the endorsement of the Broadway Democrats, a Morningside Heights-based political club.
As the candidates prepared to speak, the moderator, Alex Peltz, offered a friendly piece of advice: "This club has a history of voting against people who speak too long."
But there was never much suspense. After all, two Equity and Excellence candidates, Larry Sauer and Lucy Wicks, are members. Both won endorsements, along with three other members of their slate. Before the election the club's newsletter will break this news to hundreds of likely voters.
As the only openly gay candidate running in the district, Mr. Sauer has other, potentially more valuable, endorsements. He is backed by the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats, the Stonewall Democrats and the Empire State Pride Agenda.
Those endorsements made all the difference in the 1993 election, when the debate over the Rainbow Curriculum -- a series of initiatives about teaching about sexuality, tolerance and related themes -- mobilized both gay groups and the Christian Coalition and attracted the highest turnout in the history of school elections, 12.5 percent.
"I thought getting elected would be easy, and I would have a lot of extra votes to pull a slate," said Mr. Sauer, who has no children and has never been to a school board meeting. "In the last election, whoever Empire Pride supported in Manhattan became the greatest vote-getter."
But the Rainbow Curriculum has receded as an issue, and the Christian Coalition appears to be staying away from the race. The most conservative candidate is David C. Isaacs, a civil service examiner running as an independent who said he rejected the coalition's help. "I'm open to a pledge of allegiance followed by a moment of silence," he said in a telephone interview. "As far as as the gay agenda goes, I have spoken to gay groups and I feel very strong for tolerance. But not for teaching life styles."
 
THE FUTURE: TAKE IT TO THE SCHOOLS
This could well be the twilight of the school board era, its last hurrah. Several lawmakers have proposed bills that would alter or abolish the system. But many parents have already anticipated them and chosen to focus their involvement at the school level, as opposed to the district level.
Several schools in District 3 already have parents councils, which help select teachers and go over curriculum. The State Assembly leadership wants school-based councils to replace the local boards. "It's much more than bake sales," Ms. Alexander, who serves on one such council, likes to say.
Advocates of school-based management argue that parents will be more likely to get involved at the school level. Skeptics note that the bitter fights over decentralized school boards led only to continued apathy.
Ms. Wicks has made the councils a major theme of her campaign. "We need to train administrators and teachers to bring families in," she said. "I really believe it is through local school-based management that the schools will improve."

Chart/Map/Photos: "School District 3: A Portrait"
 In the school board election in District 3 in Manhattan on May 7, a major issue is the disparity in the performance of schools in the northern part of the district and the southern. Map showing the location of the district's schools shows where at least half of the students tested above grade level in math and in reading during 1995 and where less than half tested that way.
 
THE INTERESTS AND WHERE THEY ARE
A campaign strategy session in Harlem: Parents believe that schools in the southern portion of the district get too much attention and that Harlem schools need a major boost in support.
A merengue fundraiser in Manhattan Valley: Bilingual education is a major concern in the eastern part of the district, especially above 90th Street, where parents are worried that Spanish-speaking children are being short-changed.
A candidates' forum at P.S. 9 on West 84th Street: Gifted and Talented programs are a big issue in the Upper West Side, where middle and upper-middle class parents are trying to avoid private school. (pg. 1)
 
 
Charts: "POWER AND LIMITS OF SCHOOL BOARDS"
School boards are nine-member, unpaid bodies that help set educational policy in elementary and middle schools. Here is a look at what they can, and can't do:
 
POWER: Approve budgets, made by superintendents, that often are more than $50 million a year
 
LIMIT: Little discretion: most money already earmarked by city and state.
When Board 3 refused to pass its budget no one noticed.
 
POWER: Dictate class size in each grade, create special programs and alternative schools, choose how to spend limited funds
 
LIMIT: In era of fiscal straits, it often comes down to what to cut: after school, guidance counselors, teacher's aids, etc.
 
POWER: Hire superintendent to run day-to-day operations of the school; Tell superintendent what the educational priorities should be.
 
LIMIT: Since superintendents often know more about education than the board, strong-willed ones sometimes run the board rather than vice-versa.
 
POWER: Hire principals, assistant principals
 
LIMIT: School staff and parents choose a list of candidates and a superintendents whittles it down to a few names before the board decides.
 
POWER: Listen to complaints from parents at monthly meetings. Try to address their grievances.
 
LIMIT: Bound by Board of Education regulations and teachers' union rules (pg. 1)

"School Elections: A Primer"
WHEN TO VOTE
Polls open Tuesday, May 7 from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M.
 
WHO CAN VOTE
 Registered voters, and those with children in public schools, regardless of whether they are citizens, who registered as parent voters before April 12.
 
WHERE TO VOTE
 At your local polling station. But if your child attends school outside your district, and you are a registered parent voter, you can vote at a polling site in your child's school district. Call (212) VOTE-NYC (868-3692) with any questions.
 
HOW TO VOTE
 Rank candidates on paper ballots in the numerical order of your preference: first choice, second choice, and so one down the line.
 
HOW THE VOTES ARE COUNTED
This part confuses even the most civic-minded and well-informed voters, not to mention many candidates themselves.
The Board of Elections counts the total number of votes cast and calculates the minimum number needed to win a seat on a nine-member board: 10 percent of the votes plus one. So if 10,000 people vote, it takes 1,001 votes to win a seat on the board.
Then first-place votes are tallied. All the candidates who win 1,001 first-place votes win a seat. Once they pass the 1,001 threshold, the superfluous votes are transferred to the second choice candidates. After the second choices win, the excess votes go to the third choices. When the redistributed votes no longer put a candidate over the edge, the votes are transferred up from the last-place candidates.
This system is called proportional representation. Critics say it is too confusing to voters. Fans say it increases the representation of ethnic and ideological minorities.
It makes forming a slate a virtual necessity. Candidates band together and distribute small fliers listing their own names as the suggested first choices and their colleagues as second choice, third choice, and so on down the line. With so many candidates to keep track of, voters often take cards from a candidate they like and then vote the rest of the slate. (pg. 13)

HEADLINE: Perspective;
The Urban Myth of Baseball as Savior

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Sit in the spare, cramped owner's box at Milwaukee's County Stadium, and it's actually possible to feel sorry for the owner; the box has the comfort and charm of a Formica booth in a greasy diner off a bypassed old highway. Even on the crisply glorious afternoon two weeks ago when the Brewers were beating the Yankees, what was the point of belonging to the league of loathsome richies if you didn't even have a condo wet bar to entertain politicians, objects of desire and the kids who snubbed you in high school?
Allan H. ("Please call me Bud") Selig, president of the Brewers and the acting baseball commissioner, accepts the sympathy but not the commentary. He is a romantic; he thinks that Milwaukee truly needs baseball, that baseball truly needs Milwaukee and that Lord knows, Bud needs baseball in Milwaukee. And a new ball park. 
 Because of his obvious passion for the game -- and because it has become his only business -- Bud's fiscal field of dreams is the most poignant of the current cries by the richies for their very own Camden Yards, almost always paid for by taxpayers who are then supposed to further support their teams by buying tickets that generally have to be made more expensive to pay off the debt on the new parks. This is happening in Cincinnati, Detroit, Boston, Seattle and Minneapolis.
Like warring expert witnesses, designated economists fly in to stoutly maintain that a new park will either pump fresh capital into a city or merely divert other entertainment dollars. Most agree, however, that it's at least a short-term feel-good for a city otherwise failing its citizens.
But baseball doesn't really have the power now, if it ever did, to provide a city with a lasting plaza of the spirit. Cities are too fragmented now, their problems too complex for pep rallies, which don't even work in urban high schools. Wise cities like San Francisco make the richies buy their own sandboxes. Crazed cities like New York flip-flop from plan to plan, whipped by an untrustworthy owner and a mayor who seems to think baseball will give him soul.
Selig's Milwaukee is in the middle; some people are willing to be a minor-league satellite of Chicago if the alternative is a tax and a bond issue, and some demand a big club of their own, at any price, as proof of their big cityhood.
Bud just wants baseball.
It was his mother, a schoolteacher, who hooked him on the game. During summer trips to New York, she alternated museum visits with trips to the ball parks. Bud was a history major at the University of Wisconsin, came home to take over his father's auto dealership and became a proper burgher. After the Braves quit Milwaukee, it was Selig who led the local search for a replacement.
"I remember after the last Braves game," said Bud, his mobile face twisting, his long, graceful fingers tracing words, "a handicapped woman came up to me and said, 'You're all we've got, Bud, don't fail us.' "
He didn't, and in 1970, an old minor-league name put Milwaukee back on the major league news network again. But this big, shabby, multi-purpose municipal stadium could make the city minor league again; Bud says that without the profits from luxury boxes and the other amenities of the modern old-fashioned "ball yards" that have been such hits in Baltimore and Cleveland, small-market clubs like Milwaukee cannot be competitive on the field, and probably won't stay in business.
Now 61, Bud raised his eyes beyond the giant beer stein in deep center (after each Brewer homer, a man slides into the beer) to the parking lot and saw an adult version of his childhood -- a baseball-only ball park that evokes Ebbets Field, but has a retractable roof. The beginnings and ends of baseball seasons are a cold sit in Wisconsin.
Bud is not threatening to leave. Where would he go? Unlike George Steinbrenner, he is of the place. And unlike Peter A. Magowan, the Safeway son who is raising private money for the Giants park in San Francisco, Bud doesn't seem to have the money or the collateral to do this by himself, despite the promise of help from the league.
It is "the posturing politicians," according to Bud, "making themselves look good to voters who don't want to spend money" who are making all the noise in Milwaukee and in other cities about taxpayer rip-off. But he says it almost sadly, certainly philosophically, which makes him the anti-George, a bright and pleasant man, direct and without bluff, who can sound almost confident when he says, "I think this will all work out because it is right."
The long fingers are moving again, weaving his dreams. "Baseball is such a wonderful part of our lives, there is nothing bad about it. And I sense we are in the early stages of a renaissance. Revenue sharing. Interleague play. The owners aren't saying bad things about the players and they're not saying bad things about us.
"But the heart of the game is not players or owners, it's the ballparks. Bart Giamatti called them 'our cathedrals.' They bind people together."
His eyes lift again to the Ebbets Field that he sees best. It's too bad that Bud and Bart are wrong.

Happy Days Are Here Again! Right, Voters?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON wrote the book on how to run against the economy in 1992, when the country was in a recessionary funk and the now-famous "It's the Economy, Stupid" sign hung in his campaign headquarters.
Four years later, he is discovering that it is far harder to take credit for an essentially well-paved economy -- 8.5 million jobs created, exports surging -- that is cratered by one large pothole: the much-documented if inchoate anxiety that jobs are less secure than ever and that wages are going nowhere, unless you're in the loftiest executive suite. 
After months of internal bickering, the Administration is finally rolling out its economic theme song for Campaign '96: Look at what a great job we've done! The refrain: For the next four years, we'll ease the pain of the hard-working souls caught in the transition from the old economy to the new one.
A happy tune, but it leaves open the question of how to get much mileage from statistics that are the envy of the G-7 allies, who don't vote, but little solace to American workers who do.
 
 
 
Bored by the Details
 Fortunately for Clinton campaign strategists, however befuddling the nation's economic mood looks to them, it has truly left Bob Dole flummoxed. His own advisers concede that the whole subject of job insecurity and wages bores him. That may explain his awkward handling of the minimum wage debate, an example of what can happen to politicians who wander aimlessly into the minefield of the economic inequality debate.
"You can't have an economic strategy until the candidate sits down and develops one," one of Mr. Dole's colleagues and supporters in the Senate fumed on Thursday, as Democrats popped up on the evening news portraying Mr. Dole as the enemy of workers struggling to stay off welfare on a measly $4.25 an hour.
It's still early in the campaign, and Mr. Dole may yet step forward with a convincing economic pitch. But the Republicans have been struggling to find an economic agenda for six months now, and Mr. Dole would be forgiven for wishing for the comparative simplicity of the economy that faced Mr. Clinton in 1992.
Then the issue was reviving American industry and making the world's biggest economy competitive against a host of external threats. Mr. Clinton's answer was one part "Putting People First," one part tough trade talk and one part big Government programs like Al Gore's "information superhighway."
"The world view in 1992 was that Japan is unstoppable, and the challenge to America was external," said John N. Yochelson, the head of the Council on Competitiveness, a Washington organization born in the mid-80's to help create a national industrial strategy.
But today American officials treat Japan as a nation choking on its own bank failures and arcane regulations. That is why Mr. Clinton could go to Tokyo two weeks ago, barely utter a harsh word about trade, and know that Mr. Dole would not make a peep in response.
 
 
 
The Pay Problem
 Now, even while some workers fear that their jobs are headed to Mexico or China, Mr. Yochelson argues that America's main challenge is "squaring domestic growth with high-wage jobs."
Some Democrats say this conundrum is not all bad. It keeps eyes trained on the economy rather than on issues of character, Mr. Dole's presumed strength. And polls show most workers do not blame the President for their insecurities.
Nonetheless, capitalizing on a sound economy that is not generating bigger paychecks is no easy task. The Democrats learned that in 1994, when the economy looked pretty good and the Republican Congress was swept into power.
So the White House is settling on a middle ground that was mapped out last week by the Council of Economic Advisers. After recent press reports of devastation from corporate downsizing, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Mr. Clinton's chief economic strategist, asked the Council a few basic questions: Do the new jobs being created pay as well as the old ones? Are A.T.&T. executives really flipping burgers? And are white-collar layoffs -- sorry, Washington calls them "displacements" -- really rising, or is that an illusion created by white-collar reporters?
The answers: Yes, 68 percent of the new jobs pay better than the median wages of America's 120 million or so workers. No, employment in burger-flipping is actually falling, and most new service-sector jobs are managerial or professional. But the skeptics are on to something: in the 1991-92 recession, white-collar workers were "considerably more at risk of displacement" than in the 1981-82 recession, particularly those 55 or older. And the average displaced worker takes a 10 percent pay cut -- more or less permanently.
"Are we saying there are no reasons for workers to be anxious?" asks Ms. Tyson. "Absolutely not. There are plenty of reasons. But you can't expect to reverse a long-term trend in just three years."
Polls show nearly three-quarters of voters know someone who has lost a job, and the White House is betting they will like Mr. Clinton's calls for portable health insurance (passed unanimously by the Senate last week), portable pensions and a $10,000 tax credit for college education or retraining. The argument inside the Administration is over how much to intrude upon corporate decision-making. Ms. Tyson and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin drew the line when Robert Reich, the Labor Secretary, advocated tax benefits for companies that guarantee jobs in profitable times and give workers a share in growing profits.
If the Administration is nervous about bashing corporate America. Mr. Dole won't even think about it. Asked how to address worker anxiety, he talks almost entirely about shrinking the Government and cutting the deficit. And he has yet to put together a plan beyond the rising-tide-raises-all-boats approach that Republicans love but that blue-collar voters find increasingly suspect.
He is already in retreat on the minimum wage, as his own troops defect from the party line.
"The Republicans are in trouble on this in a larger way than they ever expected," Mr. Reich crowed in an interview Friday, still surprised by the issue's sudden revival.
"When the stock market is soaring and chief executives are earning princely sums, it's hard to argue that the nation will fall apart because we mandate another 90 cents an hour to the poorest wage-earners in the nation," Mr. Reich said. "But if Dole wants to dig that hole, I'll be happy to hand him a shovel."

HEADLINE: On Shanghai Visit, Yeltsin Finds It Is Russia's Turn to Be Envious

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 27

 BODY:
The last time a Russian leader came to this city, in May 1989, the streets were clogged with student protesters demanding democracy and China seemed to be on the brink of cataclysmic political change.
The leader, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, was hailed by students camped outside City Hall as the kind of forward-looking man that China needed to abandon its outdated ideology and rescue dilapidated cities like Shanghai. 
 Mr. Gorbachev's host, who steered him away from the students, was a local Communist Party chief named Jiang Zemin, who looked like an old-fashioned apparatchik about to be washed away by the tides of history.
It did not work out that way.
This week, seven years later, President Boris N. Yeltsin came to Shanghai to find it transformed, a showcase for China's remarkable economic growth, overseen by the Communist Party. And Mr. Yeltsin's host was none other than Jiang Zemin, now the Communist Party chief for all of China, and President as well.
The Russian President left Shanghai this morning, ending a four-day trip to China that called attention to an odd turn of fortunes, one that nobody could have predicted. Mr. Gorbachev is long gone, and now Mr. Yeltsin himself is facing a tough election in June and is plagued by economic trouble, while Mr. Jiang sits serenely atop a thriving economy.
Social scientists often debate the relative merits of emphasizing political and economic reform in a society emerging from Communist rule, pointing to a Russian versus a Chinese model, as if the experience of one country could be transplanted to another. But it is clear that during Mr. Gorbachev's visit, many Chinese coveted the kind of political freedom that was flourishing in the Soviet Union at the time, and that this time it was the Russian's turn to be envious.
Mr. Yeltsin looked wide-eyed as he toured a high-tech plant in East Shanghai, a special economic zone that was not even opened until 1990, a year after Mr. Gorbachev came. He shook his head in wonder as Chinese officials explained how the zone had grown at an average of 30 percent a year, and been transformed from a cowpatch to an industrial park with more than 3,000 joint ventures and well over $7 billion in investment.
During his tour of Shanghai, Mr. Yeltsin said he was eager to learn from the Chinese experience, describing what he saw as "very impressive."
"We are also in the middle of reforms," he told reporters. "Here, they call it a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. Russia is not building capitalism either -- it is building a market economy with its own specific flavor."
James R. Lilley, who was the United States Ambassador to China in 1989, came to Shanghai to welcome an ill-timed visit by American warships on the day Mr. Gorbachev came that year. By chance, Mr. Lilley was here again this week on a private visit when Mr. Yeltsin came.
"The streets were full of demonstrators," Mr. Lilley recalled of 1989. "It was out of control."
Mr. Lilley said part of China's aim in inviting Mr. Yeltsin to visit was to try to send a message to the United States, China's biggest export market, that Beijing had alternatives. He dismissed it as an empty threat.
"If China wants to go back to the Sino-Soviet relationship of the 1950's, well, lots of luck," Mr. Lilley said, noting that China's trade with Russia, at $5 billion, was a tiny fraction of the $55 billion it bought and sold with the United States. "It's a different world."

HEADLINE: Thai Shrimp Farmers Facing Ecologists' Fury

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KHO KIAM, Thailand, April 22

 BODY:
Like thousands of other shrimp farmers in Asia and Latin America, all Maitri Visetsak wanted was to get rich quick.
He meant no harm, Mr. Maitri said the other day on a tour of his property here in southern Thailand. And at first it worked. In two years, Mr. Maitri, a small landowner, earned enough to buy two pickup trucks. 
 But then, in a pattern that has left much of Thailand's coast a polluted wasteland, his project failed. His shrimp sickened and died, and his two half-acre ponds now lie stagnant and toxic, useless for further cultivation.
On Monday, men like Mr. Maitri will go on mock trial in absentia in New York at a "Shrimp Tribunal" organized by environmental groups. They are accused of despoiling their country's coastal wetlands by raising shrimp.
Organizers of the tribunal say they are out to moderate the surge over the last decade of shrimp farming that is fast depleting the mangrove forests that are an essential coastal ecosystem.
"It is a very important issue in terms of global biodiversity," said Kate Cissna, one of the organizers, noting the role that mangroves play in sustaining food chains and stabilizing coastal lands.
Here in the southern Thai province of Trang, shrimp are everywhere -- in the mangrove forests, in the rice fields and even in the rubber plantations.
Somewhat bewildered, villagers continue to farm and fish, even as their land and water become polluted by shrimp-farm runoff. For the most part, they are victims, not beneficiaries, of a boom industry that is controlled from far away by syndicates or middle-class investors.
The transformation of Trang Province is part of a worldwide explosion of shrimp farming from a $1.5 billion industry 30 years ago to an $8 billion industry today, said Ms. Cissna, who is field coordinator for the Seattle-based Mangrove Action Project.
Her small lobbying group is sponsoring the forum on Monday, in offices at the United Nations, along with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club of Canada and other groups.
In Western countries, shrimp farming is mostly environmentally sound and monitored by marine biologists, said Bob Rosenberry, who edits and publishes Shrimp News International, an industry publication, in San Diego.
But in developing countries like Thailand, India and Mexico, he said, "The overall track record has been a bad one." Shrimp farmers here are "mostly small-scale, irresponsible guys" with little concern or understanding of the damage they are causing, Mr. Rosenberry said.
The farmers' badly managed ponds, with their heavy doses of chemicals and antibiotics, overstocked conditions and high rate of toxicity and disease, have an average life span of less than five years. And so, much in the manner of slash-and-burn farmers, shrimp farmers simply march down the coastline, leaving hundreds of miles of poisonous brown blotches in their wake.
The ponds saturate the surrounding soil with salt and pollute the land and water with a chemical sludge made up of fertilizer and antibiotics as well as larvicides, shrimp feed and waste. This is not what was envisioned by international lending agencies when they encouraged aquaculture as an aid to developing economies and a means to help feed the world's growing population.
While in some cases peasant farmers have benefited, the industry has mostly been taken over by profiteers, producing shrimp as a quick-cash luxury crop for export, mostly to the United States and Japan, and providing little income to the local poor.
"Yes, there is a need to feed the world's population, but shrimp farming is not the answer," said Pisit Chansnoh, director of Yadfon, a small environmental lobbying group here in Trang. "In general, the shrimp farm industry does not belong to the poor. Only the rich can run this business."
Since 1994, Thailand has been the world's leading exporter of seafood, with farmed shrimp its primary product. Exports of frozen shrimp nearly doubled in value in the last two years to $2 billion, from $1.2 billion, giving Thailand 40 percent of the world market. In 1995, Thailand produced 220,000 metric tons of shrimp in 20,000 farms, far more than any other country.
The Government has encouraged shrimp farming, with its fast profits, despite the lessons of Taiwan, China, Indonesia and other countries, where a quick boom was followed by collapse. Thailand has sustained its industry for a decade because its thousands of miles of coastline allow investors to exhaust their farms and then move on.
This pattern has been devastating to the mangrove forests that once lined as much as three-fourths of the world's tropical shorelines. Today, the United Nations Environment Program calculates that half have been lost, and some estimates blame shrimp farming for one-fourth of this destruction.
Mangroves, dismissed until recently even in academic literature as existing in "wastelands" and "mosquito-infested swamps," are coastal trees that grow half in and half out of the water in places like the Everglades of Florida and the bayous of Louisiana.
In Thailand, the United Nations estimates that only 13 percent of the original mangrove forests remain. On the coast of the Gulf of Thailand, mangrove forests have been virtually wiped out; just 40,000 acres remain of what was nearly a million acres just 30 years ago, Government figures show.
Here on the coast of the Andaman Sea, the country's last broad stands of mangrove still support an entire way of life. The village of Wang Won, for example, has subsisted for a century by harvesting the shellfish that thrive among the mangrove roots.
Its 600 people fish and collect honey and mud crabs, thatch their houses and roll their cigarettes from among the mangroves. Even the village paths are paved with crushed shellfish.
But in the fields that surround the village, the area's first shrimp farms bake in the hot sun, some already exhausted and abandoned, some still productive, their motorized paddle wheels churning to aerate the briny water.
The ponds here at Wang Won are owned by city folk from far away and run by low-paid workers imported from the even poorer villages of northeastern Thailand.
Their only effect on the people who live here is to make life harder, said Supit Bunrit, who sorts and shucks seashells on her front stoop for a living. They have siphoned away its drinking water, killed edible sea grass and begun to reduce the catch of grouper and crabs.
This is the start of a familiar process of environmental loss, said Mr. Pisit. "If the mangrove forests on the Andaman coast follow the destruction in other provinces, I do not see a future for Thai mangrove forests," he said. "And once the mangrove forests are lost, there will be no future for these small fishermen."

The suspension of talks between Iraq and the United Nations this week was especially bitter news for Carlos Alzamora.
For more than four years, this former Peruvian diplomat and his team of experts have been collecting and sifting the claims of more than two million people who say they were hurt in some way -- economically, physically or psychologically -- by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Thirty percent of the money that would have been collected from the sale of Iraqi oil that might have come out of the talks would have flowed into the nearly empty coffers of Mr. Alzamora's compensation fund, at the rate of about $100 million a month. 
 A failure to reach agreement -- when and if the talks resume -- Mr. Alzamora said in an interview, "would postpone indefinitely the payment of compensation and would dash the hopes of millions of innocent victims relying on this promised relief that we stand ready to provide."
The processing of claims has gone quickly and efficiently -- "one of the greatest U.N. success stories," Mr. Alzamora said as he sat in his quiet office in a small villa called La Pelousse, set in the lawns of the United Nations' Geneva headquarters.
The house has an appropriately melancholy history. It was the residence of the secretaries general of the ill-fated League of Nations, whose Art Deco headquarters nearby are now occupied by the United Nations.
By the time the League collapsed, shunned by the United States, it had so little money left that it could no longer afford to heat La Pelousse, and the house became unlivable.
By the time Mr. Alzamora's United Nations Compensation Commission inherited the villa, it needed work. Most of all, it needed modern storage space. That was created out of a dank basement whose wine cellar now holds shelves of computer disks. The rest of the basement is piled high with shipping cartons and courier packages.
"We have 29 million pieces of paper here," he said. "They would cover 20 soccer fields."
The Compensation Commission was created by the United Nations Security Council shortly after the end of the 1991 war that drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait. It began receiving claims by early 1992 -- sometimes at the rate of 30,000 a day.
There were the obvious cases: the many thousands of Kuwaitis who lost homes and livelihoods, and foreigners who had been working in both Kuwait and Iraq, as well as the relatives of people who died in the invasion. But there were also many unexpected claimants, Mr. Alzamora said, some with stories that need a lot of checking out.
"We had a rich Kuwaiti claiming millions for his wife's jewels that he said had been in the basement," he said. "He had no papers, no receipts. There was a man who wanted to be paid for his three kilograms of rice. There was a lady in Prague who claims that she crashed her car when she heard the news of the invasion."
Even unexceptional claims were often difficult to verify. If someone claimed to have been chased out of Iraq or Kuwait, are there papers to prove it? Where, for instance, are the receipts for travel and relocation? To resolve such cases, Mr. Alzamora said, Iraq cooperated by turning over its records on foreign workers in the country.
When the period for filing claims ended at the beginning of this year, 2.6 million claims had been submitted, seeking a total of more than $190 billion in compensation. The commission divided the claims into six categories: people forced out of Iraq or Kuwait; those who died or suffered serious injury; those who lost property up to $100,000; those who claimed more than $100,000 in losses; corporate claims, and claims made by governments or international organizations.
Mr. Alzamora said that by dealing with the most urgent individual cases first, the commission and its 100 staff members -- speaking 30 languages among them -- were able to pay a number of claims in full, at a cost of $13.4 million. But the compensation fund, which has depended on borrowing and contributions from United Nations members, is now down to $7 million, and only down payments are being made, with promises of full settlement in the future. With the suspension of the oil talks, that future has become more distant.
The commission is now facing the adjudication of 6,150 corporate claims from companies in 10 countries, including the United States, and 256 claims from governments and international organizations.
"Our main challenge has been to be ready when the money is ready," said Mr. Alzamora, who apologized for bragging when he said that the speed with which these compensation claims had been decided compared favorably with similar processes after the two world wars and many other international disputes.
Only now there will not be any ready money soon.

HEADLINE: Stamford Shapes Up to Hold Off Lean Years;
After a Decade of Malaise, the City Takes Steps to Tame Its Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., April 27

 BODY:
In the sleek corporate office building called Government Center here, the chief diversion of city workers these days is looking out the window to watch the swift progress of the construction of the Swiss Bank Corporation's new headquarters.
Day by day, the international banking giant, which is moving its trading floor and 1,500 employees from Manhattan, is filling in one of the last gaps in a downtown that corporations leaving New York transformed in the 70's and 80's. A new wave of construction and growth appears assured. 
 But while marveling at the work in progress from his 10th-floor office, Mayor Dannel Malloy says with urgency that it is now the city government's turn to be transformed -- and he is looking to the hard experiences of cities like Bridgeport for lessons on how to do it.
If government does not become more efficient, in the next economic crisis Stamford, despite its wealth, would face the same dismal choice that other cities have: cut services or raise property taxes to levels that drive out the middle class. But if Mr. Malloy succeeds, and Stamford can control taxes but still spend enough on its schools and the police, this city of 110,000 people has a chance to be unlike almost any other in the Northeast: a stable, racially and economically mixed city paying its own way.
But to achieve that, after already cutting its work force by one-sixth during the recession of the late 80's and early 90's, the city must remake its bureaucracy in good times, in major ways that other cities have tried only in financial crises.
Mr. Malloy hired his director of public safety, John Byrne, from Bridgeport, where he was an assistant to Joseph Ganim, the Mayor elected after that city tried to declare bankruptcy in 1991. "When we came to Bridgeport, a grenade had been thrown into City Hall," Mr. Byrne said. "The unions were ready to play, and we used that to our advantage and to their advantage. We used the budget as the motivation for a lot of management changes."
"But all taxpayers seem to think the same," said Mr. Byrne, who oversees the police and fire departments. "They don't think they're getting their money's worth, and to a degree they're right. The employees of this city have to understand that taxpayers here don't want to pay another dollar."
A number of factors have combined to give Mr. Malloy, a Democrat elected last November, a strong hand in trying to modernize city government. Voters amended the City Charter to merge several departments. And they ended gridlock between the Republican finance board and Democratic city council by electing Democratic majorities to both.
Perhaps most important, the voters were reacting to a property-tax increase of 22 percent during the term of his predecessor, Stanley Esposito, as the collapse of commercial real-estate values in the recession hastened a shift of the tax burden toward homeowners. The bill for the boom times had arrived at the worst possible time.
Some residents made noises about moving or even, in the affluent suburban area north of the Merritt Parkway, about seceding. Others listened to Mr. Malloy's theme that Stamford was strong enough to solve its problems; by spending money smarter, future tax increases could be limited to the rate of inflation.
"The community psyche was on a downward trend, maybe for as long as the last eight years, worrying about the economy, worrying about lost jobs, worrying about quality-of-life issues, and not seeing things get better," Mr. Malloy said.
"Stamford was clearly suffering a malaise, and that's what I was trying to respond to," he added. "I said, 'Wait a minute, we can manage our way out of this.' "
To a large extent, the economic dislocations of the past decade in the New York region were sorting themselves into ways that were now nourishing the economy of Stamford and lower Fairfield County.
Madison Avenue's mass dismissals in the mid-80's had spawned dozens of small advertising agencies here. As large corporate headquarters shed employees, some started their own businesses, providing services that the headquarters now needed to buy. And Stamford had begun to court smaller companies like reinsurance, that were more likely to grow in the future.
With 20 million square feet of premium office space, Stamford, particularly downtown, had plenty of room for a new breed of businesses that wanted to be near each other -- that found value in being in a city.
"The smaller companies and the streamlined headquarters aren't self-sufficient anymore," said Kip Bergstrom, Stamford's director of economic development, "and people are understanding that you need to interact with the people you work with. You can't be off by yourself in the woods."
Even Stamford's government benefited from the corporate restructuring: Government Center. Built and then declared surplus by GTE in the 1980's, it seemed to symbolize the city that Stamford had become.
But little had changed besides appearances. When Mr. Malloy and his cabinet moved in, they found their offices equipped with 1982 Wang word processors.
Employees were covered by a "hodgepodge" of insurance plans, said Thomas Hamilton, the director of administration. The heads of small departments were accustomed to taking budget issues to the Board of Finance themselves, instead of coordinating them.
Often city employees did their work well, said Patricia Broom, the director of operations, but not because there was any method to it. Putting together this year's budget for pothole and other street repairs, she said, she found that the city never surveyed its own streets; it repaired whatever residents complained about.
"If you didn't call me and tell me your road needed to be fixed, it would never get fixed," she said.
During flush times, these inefficiencies did not matter. "While the tax base was growing, the needs of the city could be met simply by growing the city government, by spending more money," said Christopher Bruhl, president of a regional business group, the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association.
"At the same time," he said, "there was no pressure on Stamford to modernize either its form of government or the management of government. They're locked into a lot of things like 1980's computers and management systems out of the 1950's."
Now, however, the large tax increases mean that Stamford has to make government work better without growing, except for two areas that are essential to keeping the city attractive to its middle class and to its corporations: schools and police.
For what sets Stamford apart from other old industrial cities is that it is still overwhelmingly middle class, in large part because the northern half of the city never broke off as a separate suburb. As a result, the problems of poverty are still manageable, the schools still integrated.
So Mr. Malloy has pledged to solve the city's problems by redesigning city government. He has formed a task force to reorganize it. Like officials in West Haven, he has formed a labor-management committee to begin reclassifying jobs and renegotiating benefits to make the city's money go further for both taxpayers and employees. He is working with Mr. Bruhl's group to find executives to serve as consultants.
He has one powerful incentive for city workers to join him: Because of the city's property wealth, it receives less state aid per capita than all but the state's most affluent suburbs, and so almost every dollar it spends is its own. More than 83 percent of its revenue is derived from local taxes. Whatever the city accomplishes will be its own.
"We've made a relatively rapid transition from an industrial city to another economy," Mr. Malloy said. "The quality of our residential areas has been successfully defended. I think Stamford's upside potential is greater than its downside for the first time in 10 years.
"I call Stamford a city that works," he said, "and there aren't too many. I think we can get it right."

The Auction Aftermath: Was It Worth the Price?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
The television crews have packed up their equipment. The bidders who lost out in the volleying for ever-higher prices have gone home empty-handed. And the buyers who shelled out megabucks at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction at Sotheby's last week are facing the morning-after question: Did I pay too much?
After all, the sale was more about who had touched the merchandise than about who had made it. Few of the items on the block were prime examples of an artist's work or a furniture maker's craftsmanship. And many were acquired after Mrs. Onassis left the White House, a period presumably less significant historically than the thousand or so days between John F. Kennedy's inauguration and his assassination. 
"The value will not last," said Robert White of Annapolis, Md., who bid on 40 items to add to the 350,000 pieces of Kennedy memorabilia he already owns. He said he was "appalled" by the prices, which ranged from $2.6 million for a diamond ring to $453,500 for a rocking chair to $343,500 for a painting by the 17th-century English artist John Wootton.
But Chris Jussel, a consultant and host of the public-television program "The Antiques Road Show," said that the buyers would probably not define the value the way hard-headed investors would.
"Historically, people have always viewed what we call a name sale like that as carrying a premium of anywhere from a quarter to a third to sometimes 50 percent," he said. "Obviously with someone this famous, the premium was even higher."
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to John F. Kennedy's niece Maria Shriver, paid the greatest premium: his $772,500 bid for a set of the late President's golf clubs was 858 times more than Sotheby's estimate. The session at which Mrs. Kennedy's fashion jewelry was sold brought the highest premium, Sotheby's said, with buyers paying $2.45 million, or 45 times the top estimate.
But was what the buyers got any good?
"There seems to be so much, I don't know, stuff: that's all it was, as opposed to antiques," said Thomas Devenish, an antiques dealer with a shop on Madison Avenue. "It was a load of rubbish."
For example, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty desk, a Louis XV mahogany table that was sold for $1.43 million to a European museum that has not been identified. "As a piece of furniture, I don't think it was very much," Mr. Devenish said. "It's better than what's in someone's basement, I guess."
So was the auction just a highly publicized yard sale? Mr. Jussel said not. "She represented a type of person who wanted to live a certain way, surround herself with, no question, books, and certain types of things and drawings that were not the best things in the world, but they appealed to her," he said. "She was not collecting. She was furnishing her homes. Having the latest upholstery didn't matter to her as much as it does to some people. And it was nice. Speaks well for her."
Clearly, it was fashionable the first day or so. But for many New Yorkers the inflection in "Can you believe it?" did a sweet-to-sour transformation as the week continued. Water-cooler conversations went from nostalgia for the Kennedy years to comments on unreasonable extravagance. A flea market on 43d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues posted a sign over its used books, old clothes and secondhand cutlery that said, "All items never owned by Jackie O."
But in the high-pressure atmosphere, the Onassis auction was a turning point for the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, who had not previously conducted an evening sale in the house. She had confined herself to daytime sales, in which the stakes are lower.
Mrs. Brooks, 46, was a splash of color in Sotheby's gray-on-beige sales room. Before the auction, Sotheby's staff was told to wear black to the opening session. Mrs. Brooks was the exception: she wore an electric-blue satin suit that evening, a pink suit the next day and an off-white one trimmed with black the day after that.
Clearly, she relished the entire experience.
"I never want to get off the podium," she said after presiding over part of one session on Thursday. "I'm dreading having to go back to my real job."
On the subject of extravagance, is it any surprise that the auction included something that once belonged to Marie Antoinette?
Maybe the surprise is that the buyer said he got it for a song, even though the price was $105,000.
The item was a traveling "casket," a small leather trunk from about 1770. The buyer was J. B. Maas, an antiques dealer from London who said he thought its resale value would approach $250,000. "If a humidor is worth $575,000," he said, "this was cheap."
Mrs. Onassis was a lifelong bookworm as well as, in her 50's and 60's, a book editor. Some 48 copies of "The White House: An Historic Guide," published at her suggestion in 1962, went for $11,500. Nine volumes about the Kennedy family went for $5,750. Six books of French history, including one from 1890, sold for $5,175.
"I wonder if she actually read it?" said the author Ellen Gilchrist, whose 1984 novel "Victory Over Japan" was included in a group of 14 that sold for $8,050. "Wonder if it actually pleased her in some way?"
Ms. Gilchrist said she had never met Mrs. Onassis and did not know how she came to have a copy of the book. Neither did John Updike, whose "Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories" was sold in the same group.
"But I am delighted to be participating in the massive inflation of the Onassis auction," he said. "It has us all dumbfounded. And I am pleased to think of 'Pigeons' as being part of it."
Richard Whalen, who published a biography of John F. Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, in 1964, knows how Mrs. Onassis got hold of his book. He sent it to her.
"When the book was first published I was told by a mutual friend that she had given a bound leather copy to Joseph Kennedy as a sort of Christmas gag," he said. "Apparently they had a good laugh about it. So I decided to send her a copy. I think I said something like, 'You've given your copy away, so I thought you might like another.' "
"If her kids want to sell it, more power to them," said Mr. Whalen. "I hope I can sell a copy of my book for $5,000 someday."


GRAPHIC: Perhaps the lesson to be learned from last week's touched-by-fame frenzy over Kennedy collectibles at Sotheby's is this: Don't throw out anything, including that tape measure (which fetched $48,875) and footstool ($33,350, stain included). Of course, the value of the items, some 1,200 lots that brought in $34.5 million, was in having been in the possession of one Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It was not the first time, of course, that famously owned objects drew handsome prices at auction. A pair of Buddy Holly's plastic eyeglasses, stamped "Japan" (as in "made in"), went for $45,100 in 1990 at Sotheby's. And John Lennon's psychedelic Rolls-Royce sold for TK in TK. A black top hat worn by Lincoln went for a mere $10,000 in 1979, but that was before the recent boom in collectibles. As the dust settled at Sotheby's, several New York notables were asked to select a possession that might attract attention on an auction block of the future.
 
What Might Entice A Future Collector?
 
Donna Hanover Guiliani, television and film performer and first lady of New York
Photo: "Treasures in the Trunk"
Cowboy boots adorned with the image of the Empire State Building
"I wear them line dancing and most recently to a cast party for the new movie I'm in." ("The People vs. Larry Flynt, in which she plays Ruth Carter Stapleton") "I wore them filming in Memphis."
 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mayor
1939 autographed photograph of Joe DiMaggio, framed in his private office
"I treasure this particular photograph because Joe DiMaggio embodies all that we should strive to be in life. He was the consummate professional, a team player, always graceful under pressure, and above all he was a true gentleman."
 
Edward I. Koch, former Mayor
Copies of the campaign manifestoes "Ed Koch's Guide to the Perplexed Voter" and "The Pocket Guide to Ed Koch"
"They have an intrinsic value of $5 but extrinsically speaking, they could be worth $25,000 each."
Postcard with "how'm I doing?" logo
"I first created this logo 'how'm I doing?' in 1969, and people still remember it. It's the longest-lived trademark of a noncommercial nature I know of. That'll cost people a lot of money if they want to buy it. Corporations pay millions of dollars for logos, and I made mine up myself and paid nobody."
 
Bella S. Abzug, lawyer, feminist, former Congresswoman
Hat
"It started out by my being a lawyer 50 years ago, when only 2 percent of women were lawyers. In those days professional women wore hats and gloves." After frequently being mistaken for a secretary, "I put on the hat and gloves, and when I went anywhere they knew I was there for business. When I got to Congress, they made this fuss about the hat instead of what was under it. I didn't know whether they wanted me to keep it on or take it off. Since I decided they wanted me to take it off, I've kept it on."
 
Ronald L. Kuby on his partner, William Kunstler, the late civil-rights lawyer
Nonprescription eyeglasses
"They were purchased over the counter. You get five for $10, or $2.50 apiece. He had multiple pairs and he would be forever losing them and forever then finding them on top of his head. On occasion he would even have two pairs on top of his head. They were probably as unique as the salt and pepper shakers on the Kennedys' table."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
The Padres Discover a New Winning Formula

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
For part of last week, the list of National League leaders showed Tony Gwynn and Wally Joyner as the top two hitters with averages in the high .400's, but they weren't even playing and the San Diego Padres kept winning. Are the Padres that good? "Earl Weaver said you have to have deep depth," said Kevin Towers, the team's rookie general manager, who then cited two examples of the Padres' deep depth.
Scott Livingstone played first base in Joyner's place last Monday and hit a second-inning home run, starting the Padres on the way to a 5-3 victory over Florida. Livingstone was unavailable the next night because he had returned home to be with his wife when she gave birth to their first child. So Archi Cianfrocco played first and rapped a run-scoring double in the second inning that ignited a 7-2 victory. 
 As helpful as Livingstone and Cianfrocco have been, no one expects them to lead the Padres in the National League West race. But it is apparent by now, four weeks into the season, that the Padres will be in the race. Suddenly, the team that not long ago staged fire sales to dump high-salaried stars has a solid collection of legitimate players.
Towers, 34, is the beneficiary of the groundwork laid by his predecessor, Randy Smith, and the different economic philosophy of the new owner, John Moores, and new club president, Larry Lucchino.
"I feel very fortunate coming in here now," Towers said, citing both reasons. "Ownership has allowed me to do some things that make my job a heck of a lot easier. A lot of the groundwork was set, too. The way I looked at this club reminded me of the '84 club. They went out and got a Garvey, a Gossage, a Nettles. We're hoping that Tewksbury and Joyner and Henderson will be the three pieces that help this team win."
The Padres signed Bob Tewksbury as a free agent, and the 35-year-old right-hander has won his first three decisions. Joyner, acquired in the Kansas City Royals' salary slash, leads the league in hitting (.466 entering last night's game) and on-base percentage (.581). Rickey Henderson, making his N.L. debut via free agency after 17 years in the other league, was hitting only .173 with 9 hits, but 18 walks helped raise his on-base percentage to .403.
Add those ingredients to Gwynn, third baseman Ken Caminiti, second baseman Jody Reed, center fielder Steve Finley, closer Trevor Hoffman and starting pitchers Andy Ashby and Joey Hamilton and the mix is volatile for the division's other teams. And as recent events showed, the Padres have put together a good bench, too, including Craig Shipley, who was hitting .448, and Marc Newfield, who has been invaluable moving between left field and right while hitting .333 and driving in 12 runs.
"The bench is one of the things we wanted to improve during the winter," said Lucchino, who began his baseball career with the Orioles. "We talk about deep depth all the time around here."
Henderson, suffering from a strained rib cage, has played sporadically since April 13. Gwynn, nursing an inflamed right heel, missed eight consecutive games before returning Friday night and raising his average to .474 (he doesn't have enough at-bats to qualify for the league leaders.) Throw in Joyner's bruised ribs, and Bruce Bochy's starting lineup had no more than one of those three players in any of the nine games (the Padres won seven) before Friday, when the three appeared together for the first time since April 13.
When Joyner is out of the lineup, the Padres miss more than his bat. "It's been a long time, probably since Garvey, that we had a strong defensive player at first," Towers said. "Bringing in Wally makes the others better defensively. When they throw in the vicinity, he's going to scoop."
In trading Bip Roberts for Joyner, the Padres created a need for speed at the start of the lineup. That need led them to Henderson. "In the National League," Towers said, "I think you have to have speed to have success. Now we have a catalyst."
Despite Henderson's slow start with the bat, he has made an impact, as he can do. "Every time you look, he's on base," the general manager said. "He finds ways to get on and he bothers pitchers. Greg Swindell threw 35 pitches to first on Rickey alone. John Burkett was pitching well, Rickey gets on base, he throws over to first eight, nine times. When he went back to throwing to the plate, he was erratic."
Towers, who was the Padres' scouting director before gaining a promotion last November, was Joyner's teammate on the Brigham Young University baseball team. As a minor league pitcher, he played against Caminiti. He also played with Bochy at Las Vegas in 1988 and was Bochy's pitching coach in Spokane, Wash., in 1989. "We won the Pacific Coast League championship in '88 and the Northwest League championship in '89," Towers said. "I told Boch maybe we have good karma. We can win here, too."

 
 
A Torrent of Runs
 If any holdouts remain from the view that expansion has drastically diluted major league pitching, it's time to become a believer.
This season's games have produced an average of 10.4 runs a game compared with 8.3 at the corresponding point of the schedule in 1992, the year before the majors expanded from 26 to 28 teams. That's a whopping 25 percent increase. Even more whopping is the 57 percent increase in home runs, from a 1.45 average to 2.27. "There are some pitchers here who are learning how to pitch," Twins Manager Tom Kelly said. "Some teams have a lot learning; some teams don't have as many."
Kelly was forced to sit through the debacle that was his team's 24-11 victory over Detroit last Wednesday, a day that produced a record 195 runs. That game followed by only five days the Texas Rangers' 26-7 romp over Baltimore. "I don't know why it happened to the Orioles, but I can see it happening to us and the Tigers and some other teams," Kelly said. "I guess if it can happen to the Orioles, it can happen to anybody. Some of us are learning."
Jesse Orosco, who gave up half of the 16 runs the Rangers scored in the eighth inning, entered the season with 14 years and 46 days of major league experience. The seven Tigers pitchers the Twins battered totaled 10 years and 44 days in the majors.

 
 
Power On, Power Off
 On the other hand, if the pitching is so weak and the ball so explosive, why hasn't anyone told the Royals? They had hit seven homers entering yesterday's games. Eight players had hit more, 10 the same.
The Dodgers' Mike Piazza and the Giants' Matt Williams haven't been clued in either. Piazza, who hit 92 home runs the previous three seasons, didn't hit his first of the season until the Dodgers' 18th game and had only three homers before the weekend. Williams, who hit 104 the past three seasons, also has only three. Kevin Elster of Texas, whose baseball life seemingly ended five years ago and was never a home run hitter when he had life, has hit four.
But for the really big numbers, how about 9 home runs for Henry Rodriguez of Montreal? Rodriguez, having matched his career high of 8 in 306 at-bats in 1994, then hit his 9th in his 56th at-bat of 1996.
When Cecil Fielder hit his ninth on April 16 in Detroit's 15th game, he had only four other hits on the season. It took him until the 22d game for his other hits to exceed his home run total, which remained at 9. And Jim Bullinger, a Chicago Cubs pitcher, has more home runs (2) than victories (1).

 
 
A Cannon of an Arm
 Lest anyone doubt that Albert Belle could have deliberately hit a photographer with a thrown baseball from the outfield, a feat baseball officials are investigating, it should be recalled that in 1993, Belle had 16 assists from the outfield, second most in the American League.
Oakland was the last team in the majors to record a save, but once they got their first, by Mike Mohler last Sunday, they reeled off three more in the next three games, by John Briscoe, Mohler and Jim Corsi.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Is Preparing Budget Plan With Political Traps for Clinton

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Bloodied but only partly bowed after a 16-month battle over the 1996 Federal budget, Republicans in Congress are finishing plans to shave at least an additional $600 billion from spending by 2002 and, they hope, to seize the political high ground on the deficit issue from President Clinton in this election year.
These new plans are outlined in a budget resolution that Republican leaders hope to issue as early as next week. The resolution, a six-year blueprint for Federal spending, is the first step toward writing a Republican version of the proposed budget for fiscal 1997 that Mr. Clinton sent to Capitol Hill last month. 
 But Republicans see it as more than that. In interviews, they said the document aims to shift the budget debate away from spending cuts in popular Federal programs, where Mr. Clinton has all but demonized the House and Senate, and back to the themes of lower taxes and smaller government. In particular, Congressional leaders hope to avoid refighting this spring's one-sided battle over spending on Presidential priorities like education and the environment by locking into place many of the spending levels that Mr. Clinton negotiated in the 1996 budget bill that he signed on Friday.
Instead, aides in the House and Senate said, the party is planning to rehash a number of fiscal battles that leaders believe they can win, mostly over tax cuts and spending on Federal benefit programs for health care and welfare.
"The challenge this year is not about numbers anymore because we've shifted the whole debate to the point where people recognize the numbers on both sides are in the ball park," one aide to House leaders said on Friday. "The challenge is over policies and over tax relief."
In those battles, the aides argued, Congress has an edge. The White House has already agreed that the budget should be balanced by 2002 and that popular entitlement programs must be restrained if that goal is to be met.
That, of course, is the Republican view. Many other experts say the advantage in the budget debate still goes to President Clinton, who has tried to take on the role of the protector of politically popular programs. Mr. Clinton "has played a weak hand brilliantly," said Robert Reischauer, the Brookings Institution scholar who stepped down last year as director of the Congressional Budget Office, in an interview this week. And Republicans have squandered many political opportunities.
As a practical matter, the budget maneuvers are more a political exercise than a fiscal one. Few expect Congress and the White House to agree in an election year on a compromise plan to restrain spending on benefit programs.
President Clinton's political strategy this year is to position himself as the voice of moderation and to portray Republicans as unreasonable partisan zealots.
In accord with that strategy, the President used his radio address today to challenge his opponents to negotiate with him to balance the budget instead of making the budget a partisan matter. Speaking directly to Republicans, he said: "If it is your political strategy to concoct a budget that you hope I will not sign, you ought to think again. If you torpedo these negotiations today, after so much progress has been made on a balanced budget, simply to create a campaign issue for later, the American people will see through that with their eyes closed."
But Republicans do want to use the budget debate to highlight the philosophical differences between themselves and the Democrats. This year, Congress will probably not send the President a single huge bill encompassing changes in all tax and benefit programs, as it did last year, giving him the opportunity to veto them all in one amorphous swoop.
Rather, House and Senate strategists said this week that Republicans were likely to send the President at least three bills, confronting him with narrower and potentially more difficult choices.
One bill would overhaul Medicare along the lines of proposals the Republicans offered last year to move the system more quickly toward managed-care programs and other cost-saving schemes. The party hopes to bolster its case with new studies showing that Medicare is in more serious financial trouble than had been forecast only a year ago.
A second bill, potentially more troublesome to Mr. Clinton, would wrap together major changes in Medicaid with a complete rewrite of the Federal welfare system. The President ran on a promise "to end welfare as we know it," but he has vetoed Republican proposals to change the system, saying they are too draconian.
And sometime this fall, Congress is expected to send Mr. Clinton a larger tax cut than he has advocated, giving him the election-season choice of endorsing Republican tax dogma or denying voters any tax relief at all.
Senator Bob Dole, the party's presumptive Presidential nominee, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich are already challenging the President to repeal the Federal gasoline tax of 4.3 cents per gallon, although they have not said how the Government would compensate for the loss of an estimated $4.8 billion in revenue.
Mr. Gingrich announced his support today for the gasoline-tax repeal, saying that as early as next week, Senator Dole would introduce a proposal to end the tax. He predicted wide support for the bill in Congress.
Republicans argue that the budget fight is unlikely to be as difficult, politically or fiscally, as in 1995, when Republicans were starting from scratch.
"We've changed the direction," one aide to the Congressional leadership said. "The plan for the next six years is no longer a plan that relies on that first dramatic step. Now it relies on continuing a trend that's already begun."
Republicans can afford to shelve the debate over how much to cut spending and can even accede to some of Mr. Clinton's priorities because they have a few billions to burn. Despite the Democrats' success in blocking many of their biggest restraints on Federal entitlement spending, Congress is still on track to meet its 1994 pledge to balance the budget by 2002 -- or even ahead of schedule.
Republicans have their own parsimony and a healthy dose of luck to thank for that.
The $160 billion spending bill that ended the 1996 budget wars earlier this week, for example, is widely regarded as a victory for the White House because the President forced Congress to add nearly $5 billion to his most prized programs.
But in the larger scheme, the Republicans appear to have the upper hand. The 1996 budget still shaved $20 billion from the domestic spending levels that were approved in 1995, not counting spending for entitlements, like Medicare and Medicaid, and other mandatory payments.
More important, Republican budget strategists calculate that they will save some $245 billion in domestic spending by 2002 -- and meet their deficit-reduction targets -- merely by capping overall domestic spending at 1996 levels.
In the battle over Federal spending, the White House also won a political victory by vetoing Congress's attempt to overhaul entitlements and save hundreds of billions of dollars in future spending.
Viewed on a balance sheet, however, the Republicans actually gained ground in their seven-year plan to erase the deficit. That is because the White House veto also blocked their seven-year, $270 billion tax cut, which would have gobbled up 40 percent of the entitlement savings this year and would have exceeded those savings in later years.
"If you have neither mandatory savings nor a tax cut, you're better off," Mr. Reischauer said. "So, in effect, inaction on this front improves the situation."
The Republican budget strategy has also benefited from two sizable revisions in economic forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office. Both lowered estimates of future deficits, thus reducing the amount of spending Congress must cut to reach fiscal balance.
The Republicans' last proposal to balance the budget, offered last winter in negotiations with the White House, envisioned cuts in projected spending of $660 billion over seven years. The latest economic forecast by the budget office, released last week, sliced that figure to something less than $600 billion, Republican budget strategists said this week.
None of that can be reduced to a campaign slogan or a 30-second television spot, the turf on which much of the next election will be contested. More broadly, however, the changes mean that Congress will have more leeway this summer to avoid the most unpopular spending cuts, and more freedom -- if it chooses -- to claim some of the middle ground staked out by Mr. Clinton on deficit reduction.
As happened last year, the House has advocated deeper and more partisan spending reductions, and larger tax cuts, than the Senate prefers, aides said this week. Still, one proposal suggests that the deficit could be erased by 2002 by shaving roughly $250 billion from projected domestic spending and $350 billion from mandatory programs like Medicare, which would be $50 billion to $75 billion less than last year.
That does not include the cost of a tax cut, which Senate strategists have pegged at about $100 billion and House experts have said would be somewhat higher.

HEADLINE: Plan to Regulate Cheese Has Quebec Up in Arms

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 26

 BODY:
In Quebec they are calling it an insult to the French palate and suggesting that it is just another way federalism fails the province. In the rest of Canada people are asking what all the fuss is about.
This time the confrontation between English- and French-speaking Canada is over cheese. 
 The federal health department in Ottawa wants to ban the sale of raw-milk cheese, like certain bries and camemberts that have long been a staple of French Quebecers' diets. Many Quebecers suspect an English plot against their distinctive eating habits.
Most cheese is made with heat-treated milk to get rid of micro-organisms like listeria monocytogenes that can survive in raw milk and cause severe illness. Once the cheese is made, regardless of the type of milk used, current Canadian regulations, like those in the United States, require that it be aged for at least 60 days at a temperature of at least 35 degrees Fahrenheit.
The proposed regulations would require the milk used for any cheese sold in Canada, whether domestic or imported, to be taken to a temperature of 147 degrees for 16 seconds as part of the cheese-making process.
Yet the raw milk imparts a distinct taste highly valued by many cheese-lovers. Along with bacteria, heat removes natural enzymes that influence the taste.
And Quebecers, anxious to preserve their French heritage, not only consume but produce more raw milk cheese than other Canadians.
After last October's narrow loss by separatists, another Quebec independence referendum may be still a few years away. But when the time comes, as Lysiane Gagnon, columnist at La Presse, noted darkly of the cheese issue, "it's this type of quarrel that will make the difference."
Pauline Picard, a member of Parliament from the Bloc Quebecois, raged against Health Minister David Dingwall during a recent House of Commons session in Ottawa.
"Since cheese made from raw milk is already strictly regulated in Canada and nobody is complaining," she asked, "why do the minister and his officials want to annoy us by prohibiting the sale of this cheese here?"
She read out a list of Quebecers opposed to the ban -- "producers, importers, retailers, restaurant owners, consumers, veterinarians and the provincial government."
Jean-Guy Chretien, the agricultural spokesman for the Bloc and no relation to Prime Minister Jean Chretien, warned that the ban could create a "fine-cheese black market," with traffickers smuggling brie like cocaine.
Still, Mr. Dingwall said he was pressing forward with the new regulations, a project of department scientists for the past six years, because of "increased risk of illness or disease" from the raw-milk cheese.
"I know the whole political spin in Quebec and I travel to Quebec a lot," he said. "And I happen to love the city of Montreal, and I happen to love the cheese which they're referring to. But you have to remember, I'm the Minister of Health with a very clear mandate, which is to protect the health of all Canadians."
Department officials stress that nothing is yet final. The public has until June 13 to comment. Then an advisory group will review options and make recommendations.
Many academics see the probability of serious harm from the cheese as remote.
"I was really surprised and astonished at the urgency of the situation as it was set forth by the ministry," said Dr. Jacques Goulet, professor at Laval University's Department of Food Science and Technology. "There is probably more danger coming from chicken and raw vegetables than cheese from raw milk."
Outside Quebec the debate has been followed with a certain detached amusement. Michael McDonald, director of the Center for Applied Ethics at the University of British Columbia, suggested that if the Government is truly worried, "it could post warnings in cheese shops or even require cigarette-style warning labels on brie."

To the Sports Editor:
A few years ago I participated in a debate about moving the Yankees from the Bronx to another site in New York City while I was a graduate student at the Wagner School of Public Policy at New York University. My research indicated these findings: 
 *Feasibility studies tend to favor the client's point of view.
*A new stadium costs taxpayers money -- always.
*Team owners, not local governments, make money. In fact, there is a question of large sums of money that the Yankees owed the city at the beginning of the Giuliani administration.
*Baseball largely provides a small number of seasonal minimum-wage jobs to the community after the construction phase.
*Ticket buyers are local residents who use disposable entertainment income, which, if not spent on baseball, would be spent locally on other entertainment and does not radically change the dollars flowing into the local economy.
Keeping the Yankees in New York is an emotional issue and an issue of tradition, and not an issue of increased revenues, except for Steinbrenner.

HEADLINE: Inside the Meritocracy Machine

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THINGS HAVE CHANGED AT VAN Nuys High School since its most famous alumnus, Robert Redford, graduated in 1956. Indeed, inside the sprawling, campuslike complex of sandstone-colored buildings and temporary trailers, there is something futuristic about the place. With its earnestly beleaguered faculty, teeming hallways and stew pot of cultures, with its tension between classes and colors and between homeboys (and girls) and newcomers, it looks and feels the way public high schools everywhere in the country are likely to in the next century as our cities continue to expand into the suburbs.
Van Nuys is a pleasantly undistinguished community in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los Angeles, with large blocs of Hispanic and Asian residents. Local kids constitute about half of the 3,000-member student body at Van Nuys High, but as a "magnet" school it also draws high-achievers, many of them the children of recent immigrants, from all over the Los Angeles area who are interested in careers in medicine, mathematics and the performing arts. 
 As a result of the magnet programs, the school is not only diverse but also highly competitive -- the kind of place that top colleges refer to as a feeder, the source of many potential enrollees. There were 12 national merit finalists in Van Nuys High's senior class this year, and three seniors scored perfect 1,600's on their Scholastic Assessment Tests, the standard college admissions exam. So it is not surprising that 16 Van Nuys students applied to Harvard this year -- hoping to become members of the class of 2000 at the nation's most prestigious university. And it's not surprising that as decision day approached the applicants were going through a nervous-making time. On April 4, the last day of school before spring break, and the day before they would find out if they had got in, 4 of the 16 sat outside, between classes, trying to talk themselves out of wanting it so much.
Maybe it was the natural aversion to being judged, maybe teen-age insecurity, maybe an instinctive self-protection mechanism kicking in. (And then again, maybe it was the fact that they had all already been admitted to other colleges.) But for whatever reason, all four now seemed to think that acceptance to Harvard -- the school that had at some point been the first choice of each -- just didn't matter the way it once had.
"I applied because it was a childhood dream, to see if I could have gone," said Parham Yashar, who will graduate ninth in a class of 640 and who scored a perfect 800 on his math S.A.T. By April 4, though, he had already been accepted at three University of California schools, and he was leaning toward U.C. Berkeley; even if he got into Harvard, he said, he was having second thoughts about going so far away from home. Parham, a slightly built, serious young man who speaks Farsi (his parents are Iranian Jews), plans to be a doctor. Harvard, the name Harvard, still has the cachet, he said; it is still a symbol. But the actual school of his dreams, he said, "is not Harvard per se -- it's whatever school you want to go to."
"Harvard is like a generic term," Mira Lew said. "Like Kleenex."
Mira is a first-generation Korean-American -- her parents immigrated when she was 4. She ranks 32d in her class and had a combined S.A.T. score of 1,490. Editor of the school newspaper and captain of its city championship girls' volleyball team, she is tall and pretty and has a penchant for self-scrutiny. Last fall she was talking about Harvard rather dreamily, saying she frequently envisioned herself walking up the steps to Widener Library or hurrying through Harvard Square on the way to a hockey game. But she had applied to Harvard's early-action program and didn't get in. Her application was deferred until the spring.
"I took it a lot better than I thought I would," she said. "I thought I'd have a rotten Christmas vacation, but it wasn't so bad."
By April 4, she had shifted her perspective to the extent that she was wearing a Yale sweatshirt. She had already been turned down by Stanford but had been accepted at Berkeley, where her sister had gone in disappointment after being rejected by Harvard three years ago. Mira was waiting to hear from Harvard, Columbia and her current favorite, Yale.
"I never thought I'd have my choice," Mira said. "The process is just so brutal -- I saw my sister go through it. What's so maddening is that it's never set in stone. It seems so random."
Anna Fudacz ranks third in the class and earned the highest possible score on four of the five advanced placement exams she took. She speaks Mandarin Chinese, although there is no Chinese in her background; her family is of Polish extraction. She had already got into Brown and was thrilled by the cordiality and enthusiasm she felt from the school, neither of which, she said, she felt from Harvard.
"Brown sends me stuff, like, every day," she said. "And people who went there always say, 'I loved Brown.' Nobody ever seems to say that about Harvard. My parents are always telling me, 'Don't rule it out -- what if you get in?' But if I went there, it'd be for the reputation."
Maya Turre ranks 10th in the class. She is a fine enough musician to have been principal violinist in a community orchestra, and she was undefeated in 29 varsity tennis matches on a league championship team. Her combined S.A.T. score was 1,430, very strong but not dazzling: she was, in fact, one of only two Van Nuys seniors with a score under 1,500 to have been accepted at Stanford.
One possible explanation for that is her remarkable package of credentials; her ethnicity, however, may have been a factor. Her mother, whom she resembles, is black and Native American, her father Mexican and Italian. When asked her ethnicity on college applications, Maya answered African-American. As a group, accomplished black students are the targets of the most competitive recruitment.
"They usually ask for just one, and if I'm asked to choose, which I don't like to do, I choose black," Maya said. "It's the culture I most identify with."
Maya had already been accepted at M.I.T., where she said she would go. She hadn't yet heard from Yale. Harvard, at this point, was running third, she said, because it doesn't offer a major in architecture, which is what she plans to study. Asked what she thought about Harvard, she said, arching a skeptical eyebrow, "It has this reputation for greatness."
Indeed, its reputation continues to precede it. Admission to Harvard has never meant so much to so many. At a time when American parents seem palpably nervous about the nation they will bequeath to their children and when the mere fact of a college education has diminished in value as a ticket to success, the elite colleges -- the Harvards, Yales, Stanfords and Princetons -- look more desirable than ever. Harvard routinely receives applications from more high-school valedictorians (2,900 for the class of 2000) than it could admit even if it were admitting only valedictorians and this year received a record number of applicants (more than 18,000) for the 1,620 slots in next fall's freshman class.
Further, more than half of this class was filled in December through Harvard's early-action program, which meant that 16 out of 17 of those waiting to hear from Harvard this month were going to be rejected. No wonder Parham, Mira, Anna and Maya were finding reasons to reject Harvard first.
HARVARD, WHICH TURNS 360 THIS year, is the nation's oldest college and perhaps, as it is consistently deemed by U.S. News & World Report in its annual rankings, the nation's best, though that is an arguable and maybe moot point. What is undeniable, however, is that it is America's most selective. And as the number of applicants increases and the freshman classes stay the same size, it is growing more so.
This year fewer than 11 percent of applicants were admitted to the class of 2000, compared with 12 percent a year ago and 16 percent four years ago. The nation's other top colleges have also grown more competitive, but none more so than Harvard: Princeton accepted 14 percent of its applicants a year ago, Yale 20 percent, Stanford 20 percent and Columbia 25 percent. What these numbers reflect above all else is that those admitted to Harvard tend to go there, no matter where else they get in, which means Harvard has to admit fewer students than other schools to fill its allotted slots: each year 75 to 80 percent of the candidates offered admission to Harvard actually enroll, by far the highest "yield" in the country.
"It's fair to say that if it weren't for Harvard, everyone else's yield would be much higher," said William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions and financial aid since 1986.
In effect, Harvard gets the first pick of the nation's (and, increasingly, the world's) high-school graduates. More than any other university it gets to select its student body, making it the very definition of an elite institution. And what does that mean? Among other things, the necessity of perpetuating itself. Legacies -- applicants whose parents attended Harvard and generally support the institution financially -- are admitted at a rate of about 40 percent, some three times as high as other applicants.
"The institutional side is often undervalued in a discussion of admissions," said Neil L. Rudenstine, Harvard's president, who is currently overseeing a $2.1 billion capital campaign that will add 40 professorships to the faculty of arts and sciences, bolster the endowments of several of Harvard's schools and augment by $200 million the financial-aid fund of its college of arts and sciences. Rudenstine was not just talking about students and their families as potential donors but about how students might contribute to the college's reputation -- in academics, the arts, civil service. Harvard graduates 97 percent of its students, he pointed out, and 70 percent of undergraduates receive some kind of aid, totaling about $70 million annually, more than half of that in outright stipends. The school has to have great confidence in the students it admits, he said, "because we have a tremendous investment in them."
There are some 35 members of the official admissions committee who are involved in the final meetings on candidates; of these, 18 to 20 tend to be faculty members. The admissions committee also includes 15 or so junior officers. And unlike at some schools -- say, Princeton or Stanford, where the admissions deans sign off on all admittees -- at Harvard all final decisions are made with a full committee vote. So, during three weeks of meetings every March, as many as 50 people may take part in a discussion of a candidate for the freshman class, and each has the opportunity to raise a hand, yea or nay on the applicant's fate.
"We are in the business of choosing leaders for the next century," Fitzsimmons said. He acknowledges the hubris of such a claim. It is, he knows, an uncertain quest, to say the least: the Kennedys, yes, but also Theodore Kaczynski. And in a famous case of more recent vintage there was Gina Grant, the young woman whose admittance to Harvard last spring was rescinded when officials learned that she had killed her mother, gone to prison for it and kept that information from the admissions department. (Grant is now completing her freshman year at Tufts University.)
Fitzsimmons, 52, has been in Cambridge almost uninterrupted since his student days in the mid-1960's. He's an amiable hail-fellow in the preppy mode who looks as if he could be Kevin Costner's older brother but who grew up in a blue-collar suburb south of Boston and entered Harvard against the wishes of the nuns at his Catholic high school. He speaks about Harvard with the quiet fervor of a long-ago convert. Grandiose as "leaders for the next century" sounds, he said, what choice does Harvard have? As the demonstrated leader, it is obligated to be the standard-bearer. The standard may be impossible to uphold, but that's the game.
Indeed, in the words of the handbook that Harvard provides to the 5,000 or so alumni who conduct applicant interviews around the world, "selection is not an exact science." And anyway, it seems obvious that whatever standards Harvard declared would be challenged by whoever didn't meet them.
In determining future leaders, according to the handbook, the factors that carry the most weight with the admissions committee are the following: outstanding intellectual ability, unusual attractiveness of personality, outstanding capacity for leadership, creative ability, athletic ability, maturity and strength of motivation for a liberal education, Harvard and Radcliffe parentage and geographic, ethnic and economic distribution. Clearly, as guidelines, these do not exactly provide a decision-making algorithm.
And to complicate matters, the admissions process is need blind (that is, an applicant's financial resources are not a factor). Harvard employs no quotas, nor does it offer academic merit or athletic scholarships of any kind, inducements that many schools use to help satisfy special interest constituencies like the football coach or the chairman of the math department.
In addition, admissions officers say that the applicants grow more accomplished every year. This is partly because Harvard's outreach is becoming ever larger in its embrace, its recruitment more aggressive, and partly because kids (and their parents) start college preparation earlier and earlier. Maya Turre, for instance, took her S.A.T.'s for the first time in the seventh grade and spent one summer in a college-prep architecture program at the University of Southern California and another in a math and logic program at Johns Hopkins.
"It's a lot more of a marathon for these kids than it used to be," said Maya's father, Michael, a math teacher at Van Nuys High. "It's just become more competitive. And parents feel compelled to enroll their kids in these programs in order to get them noticed."
At the same time that the talent pool is growing larger and stronger, admissions officers say, some of the tools for distinguishing among applicants have become less reliable. This year the Educational Testing Service "recentered" its scoring for the S.A.T.'s; that is, it adapted its scoring system around a new, and lower, mean, which had the effect of raising scores in general and thus diluting the signal of intellectual strength traditionally sent by the highest scores. Admissions officers also say that recommendations written by high-school teachers and counselors are less helpful than they once were, largely because counselors are more overburdened than ever: for instance, Van Nuys High School has one college counselor for its roughly 650 seniors each year.
Another factor obscuring the genuine qualifications of applicants is the increasing prevalence of for-hire college counselors, who earn their fees by advising high-school students on how to best position themselves for the admissions process and provide services that may include selecting courses or editing and proofreading an application essay. Mira Lew, at the urging -- and expense -- of her father, has been working since her junior year with Betsy Frederick from a company called College Counseling Service.
"Betsy's my equalizer," Mira said, adding that she hadn't mentioned her private counselor to any of her friends "because the whole thing is way too competitive."
In general, said Harry R. Lewis, the dean of Harvard College, who has served on the admissions committee for 17 years, "I'm not sure the quality of information we're getting now is as good as it was 15 years ago." Given all this, it should come as no surprise -- though it does, somehow -- that admissions officers at Harvard rather easily acknowledge what applicants like Mira Lew fearfully suspect: however scrupulous the selection process may be, it remains, to a degree, random.
"Harvard could probably admit a whole other class," said Robin Worth, who has been an admissions officer for eight years. "Admit the class, put it aside and go ahead and admit a whole other one that would do extraordinarily well and go on to do fabulous things in life."
ON AN EVENING LAST MAY, FIVE TOP admissions officers from five of the nation's best colleges addressed an audience of some 400 personally invited high-school juniors and their parents in a nondescript hotel banquet hall outside Dallas. The title of their presentation was "Exploring College Options," and its purpose was to familiarize these local students with their five distinctly nonlocal schools -- Georgetown, Duke, Stanford, M.I.T. and Harvard. Harvard, which conducts early-awareness college programs in some junior high schools, might be said to have begun assembling next fall's freshman class five or six years ago, but the main work begins two years before a class enters. Admissions officers often travel to schools that have traditionally sent students to Harvard (one visited Van Nuys High around the time of the Dallas gathering), but the Dallas meeting was aimed at students who weren't exactly weaned on the notion of going to an elite private college a long way from home, and it was an evening of serious public relations.
It might seem counterintuitive that top schools need to recruit students, or market themselves, at all. But these schools are more than slightly aware that, particularly in regions where their institutions are not household names, they have snooty reputations. And that, Fitzsimmons acknowledges, is what the admissions-department public-relations work is designed to combat. (The powerful legend, based in considerable historic fact, is that Harvard takes the creme de la creme from Exeter, Andover, Choate and the like, and doesn't bother looking elsewhere.)
Anyone who doubts the power of good will in marketing colleges need only talk to the four Van Nuys seniors. It seems a little paradoxical that Harvard, a school that prides itself on its elite status, succeeds best in recruiting when it persuades applicants that it is a place full of ordinary folks like themselves.
Maya Turre visited the campus last summer and had a long conversation with Roger Banks, Harvard's director of minority recruitment. "Before that, I was having doubts," she said, "but he pretty much convinced me to apply. And I met a lot of students, and they weren't what you'd expect. I remember the guy behind the admissions desk had purple hair. I guess I was pleasantly surprised."
Parham Yashar said his interviewer, a woman who had recently graduated from Harvard Law School, told him that yes, there is some snobbery at Harvard but that it certainly isn't overwhelming; he found her candor persuasive. "Right away when I met her, I felt I could talk to her about anything," he said.
And Mira Lew said her encouraging phone conversation last fall with Jennifer Bates, Harvard's women's volleyball coach, made her feel, for the first time, that getting in was a realistic goal for her; her academic interview, with a Los Angeles businessman, heightened her enthusiasm.
"We really connected," she said. "His story was my story, a middle-class kid who needs financial aid to get through. He said he was really grateful to the school, and that impressed me. I was really high on it when I left."
On the other hand, it was a Harvard interview that soured Anna Fudacz on the place. "The guy was 75, probably, he had graduated from Harvard Business School in the 40's or something and he was very uptight," she said. "He kept asking me, 'So what's so special about you?' And I talked about how I was studying Mandarin Chinese. I thought that was pretty good, but he said: 'Oh, half the population of Harvard speaks Chinese. What else?' Maybe my attitude will change if I get in, but it seems more intimidating than the other schools."
Another paradox inherent in Harvard's marketing of itself is that it essentially makes admissions harder: if college admissions can be seen as a two-pronged process, recruitment and selection, the first part is actually designed to make the second part more difficult. Still, since the mid-1970's, when a decline in the birth rate foretold a declining high-school population, the pursuit of potential students has become increasingly aggressive everywhere. One result of this has been the so-called flight to excellence -- the widening gap between the 40 or 50 top institutions, where applications have been steadily rising for the past 15 years, and the vast majority of others, which continue to wage an annual battle to fill their class rosters.
This trend has dovetailed with emerging pressures on elite schools to diversify their student bodies. That, in fact, was what the five schools represented in Dallas were doing there: all five had discovered a wealth of students willing, in increasing percentages, to be lured away from fine state universities like the University of Texas and Texas A & M. The names of the students at the Dallas gathering had been provided by the College Board Search Service, which uses Preliminary S.A.T. scores and the students' self-reported grades to make up target lists for schools around the country. The College Board has been compiling these statistics annually since the early 1970's and has been multiplying and refining its lists to sell to the nation's colleges ever since.
To help recruit the class of 2000, Harvard asked the College Board for its national lists of African-American, Mexican-American, Asian-American, Native American, Puerto Rican and Hispanic-American high-school juniors whose P.S.A.T. scores had been at least 110 (out of 160) and whose grade-point averages were at least 3.5 (out of 4.0). Harvard identifies more than 21,000 minority students by this means every year, and they are all automatically sent application booklets and other direct solicitations, including invitations to events like the one in Dallas, which was distinctively rainbow-colored. By contrast, the five people running the Dallas show -- Fitzsimmons; Michael Behnke, the director of admissions at M.I.T.; Christoph Guttentag, admissions director at Duke; Charles A. Deacon, dean of admissions at Georgetown, and John Bunnel, Stanford's associate dean of admissions -- were all not only middle-aged white men but also dressed identically, in blue blazers, white shirts and gray slacks. "I want to assure you," Bunnel, as master of ceremonies, began, "that we do not represent the diversity on our staffs or at our schools."
The presentations themselves -- slide shows of the campuses with commentary -- were informative, amusing and designed to allay any suspicions the students and parents might have had about elite institutions in general and these five in particular. Fitzsimmons made sure to praise Harvard's underappreciated engineering program and its national championship math team. And he made the surprising point, to much murmuring, that without offering a single athletic scholarship Harvard fields more intercollegiate sports teams -- 41 -- than any college in the country.
In the end, the meeting -- like similar meetings in Austin, San Antonio and Houston -- accomplished what it was meant to accomplish: it put human faces on institutions that may be perceived as distant and forbidding. Even after a sobering discussion of finances -- the yearly cost of attending these schools is now close to $30,000 -- most people left seemingly satisfied and encouraged, and comparing the schools with one another rather than with, say, the University of Texas, which is precisely what Fitzsimmons and his colleagues desired.
LAST MONTH A FIFTH circuit Court of Appeals decision in a case involving four white applicants to the University of Texas Law School ruled against considering race or ethnicity in college admissions. The ruling does not apply to Massachusetts or to the selection of the class of 2000, but it sent a tremor through Byerly Hall in Cambridge, which houses the Harvard admissions office. Should the case go to the Supreme Court, and should the ruling be upheld and become national law, the effect on the admissions process at Harvard would be profound. Fitzsimmons would not comment directly on the case, but he pointed out Harvard's acute awareness that "an increasing proportion of our future leaders will be coming from the nonwhite population."
The Fifth Circuit ruling appears to conflict with the 1978 Supreme Court Bakke decision. In the pivotal opinion, Justice Lewis Powell wrote that setting aside specific places for racial minorities in college admissions is unconstitutional but that an applicant's race might reasonably be a factor in admissions; it was Harvard's policy that Justice Powell cited specifically as a model. Eighteen years later, asked point-blank if there were two applicants for the final open spot in a class, might race be a decisive factor, Fitzsimmons said: "It could. Yes." A new Supreme Court opinion, then, would require a new policy and, in fact, a substantial revision of institutional thinking.
Attracting minority students is such a current focus at Harvard that Rudenstine, Harvard's president, devoted his entire triennial report in February to a history of the school's efforts to diversify. And in his concluding section, "Admissions: The 1990's and Beyond," Rudenstine equated a future commitment to diversity with Harvard's historical commitment to excellence. "Such diversity is not an end in itself," Rudenstine wrote, "or a pleasant but dispensable accessory. It is the substance from which much human learning, understanding and wisdom derive."
Of course, Harvard has not always been so accommodating. It was not until 1870, 234 years after its founding, that the first black man graduated from Harvard, and dormitories were not integrated until 1917. There were no female students until 1879, when Radcliffe, Harvard's sister school, was founded. In the 1920's, when the percentage of Jews entering Harvard rose to more than 25 percent, A. Lawrence Lowell, then Harvard's president, declared that the university had "a Jewish problem" and proposed a ceiling-setting quota. And though the idea was thwarted by the faculty, Harvard's reputation as a place for elite white Protestants lingered for decades. Fitzsimmons recalls that when he was a student and hockey goalie at Archbishop Williams High School in Braintree, Mass., the first two nuns he approached for recommendations to Harvard wouldn't write them.
"They said it was Communist and atheist and a bunch of elite snobs, and that it was only for the rich," Fitzsimmons said. "I understood where they were coming from. There's a considerable amount of information that until the early 30's Harvard was anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic. What they were reacting to was what they had witnessed."
Since then, minority representation in general at Harvard has risen steadily, reaching 36 percent for the class of 1999. And virtually every individual group is now better represented than it was 15 years ago. As a historical correction this does not please everyone. Harvey Mansfield, a professor of government at Harvard since 1965, has declared that the increased black population on campus and what he perceives as an ill-advised leniency toward blacks and other minorities on the part of the faculty have been responsible for a widespread grade inflation. "I think Harvard has taken too many black or minority students relative to those whom they would have replaced," Mansfield said.
Interestingly, some of those who stand to gain from Harvard's diversity effort are also uncertain of its benefits: Maya Turre, for instance, whose blackness is a plus on her Harvard application but whose academic and extracurricular achievements can perhaps speak for themselves. Maya's parents simultaneously worry that her admission might be tainted by the specter of affirmative action and that Maya might be given an advantage that would better benefit someone else.
"I'm torn," said Maya's mother, Cheryl, an elementary-school teacher's assistant. "I'm in favor of affirmative action, but Maya doesn't need it."
Asian-American applicants like Mira Lew confront a different problem. From 1988 through 1990, the United States Department of Education investigated the Harvard admissions department to determine the veracity of allegations that over a 10-year period, beginning with the class of 1983, Harvard discriminated against Asian-American applicants, holding them to higher academic standards than white applicants and admitting them at a significantly lower rate. The investigation exonerated Harvard, but not without raising a different, thorny admissions issue. The reason for the discrepancy between the percentages of Asian-Americans and whites was found to be the acknowledged advantage, the "tip factor," given to children of alumni and to athletes, categories that don't favor Asian applicants. Could this be construed as simply a veil for racial bias?
The investigation also turned up evidence, albeit not in any quantity or pattern, that some admissions officers made comments on the applications of Asian-American candidates that were indicative of stereotyping, suggesting that Asians were being considered to be more in competition with one another than with the general pool. "He's quiet and, of course, wants to be a doctor," was one comment cited in the report. Another read, "Scores and application seem so typical of other Asian applications I've read; extraordinarily gifted in math with the opposite extreme in English."
This does not appear to reflect an institutional bias. Last year Asian-Americans made up 18.1 percent of Harvard's freshman class, making them by far the best represented of any minority group. (Blacks, who were next, constituted 9 percent of the class.) But in some ways this top-minority status has simply increased fears among Asian applicants that a ceiling has been reached, that they will not be treated individually and that their storied diligence in pursuit of excellence will be held against them.
In "College Success: Advice From Harvard Graduates," written by three Korean-Americans and aimed at Korean-American high-school students, the authors suggest that candidates try to fit themselves into categories -- athlete, scholar, musician, for example -- because admissions officers put candidates in such categories and compare applicants within them. The book also says: "Whether you like it or not, you will also be considered in the category 'Asian-American' consciously or subconsciously at some point in the admissions process. This poses a problem, however, as there is an overabundant supply of Asian-American applicants, and only a few can be considered 'the best' in this category. It is therefore imperative that you position yourself firmly in other 'categories' and emphasize your uniqueness."
Among those families using the book were the Lews. Kwang Lew, Mira's father, came to this country with his wife, Myoung, and two young daughters, to go to graduate school in electrical engineering at the University of Utah. He had planned to return to Korea but ended up staying in the United States so his children would not have to confront the seriously circumscribed educational opportunities in their native country. He and his wife, a college-educated former librarian, now own a hardware store in the Valley.
Three years ago Mira's older sister, Deanne, was valedictorian of her class at Van Nuys High but was rejected by Harvard.
"We were very disappointed," Kwang Lew said. "I can compare the schools to restaurants. The U.C. system is like a fast-food restaurant -- knowledge is like fast food. Harvard, Yale, these are fine restaurants, where you go in, they treat you nice, you know?"
Lew said that if the system here were the same as in Korea, where students are chosen by colleges solely on academic performance and the scores on a college admissions test, his daughter Deanne would be at Harvard today. "We prepared our second daughter differently," he said. Among other things, the family hired Betsy Fredericks to advise Mira and followed the advice in the "College Success" handbook. "We pushed Mira not just academically but into activities and sports," Lew said. "The Ivy League definitely needs Asian athletes."
Margot Hsu Carroll, who oversees Asian-American admissions at Harvard, acknowledges that the Asian tradition undervalues the well-roundedness that is more valued by America in general and Harvard in particular. "The message is getting out in the Asian-American community, slowly, but it's getting out," Carroll said, "that Harvard is looking for more than just high test scores and class rank."
THE APPLICATIONS BEGAN pouring into Byerly Hall last September, the mail gradually becoming more voluminous right up to the early-action deadline on Nov. 1. Early-action applications at Harvard have been on the rise for several years, and this year's total of 3,913 was nearly 1,000 more than last year's, which was itself a record. With 985 students admitted under early action, Maya, Mira, Parham and Anna were competing this spring with about 17,000 others for approximately 1,000 places.
Though the percentages would seem to indicate that students who apply early have a much better chance of being admitted, Fitzsimmons says this isn't true: the early applicants tend to come from the high end of the pool. And he says that his instructions to his staff at the early-action meetings are always the same: if you're sure a candidate would be admitted in March, vote to admit now; if you're at all uncertain, vote to defer. So though the odds are longer in the spring, the quality of the competition is not as stiff.
Fall or spring, the decision-making process is largely the same. It works this way: each applicant's folder, with all the pertinent scores, grades, recommendations, essays and interview reports, is read first by the admissions officer with responsibility for the geographic region where the applicant went to high school. These area reps, as they are known, are meant to be advocates for the students in their assigned areas. It's their job to work with counselors, teachers and administrators at the area schools, and to meet with as many students as possible, in an effort to get as many qualified applicants as possible into the pool. When the applications arrive, they don't exactly switch hats, but they begin to narrow down the field to those applicants they can fairly represent in committee meetings as viable Harvard candidates. So for the officers as well as for the candidates themselves, the process is a bit of a competition.
The area reps indicated that they are impressed by different qualities: one looks for good writing in the essay, another places emphasis on the character references, a third looks for clues that the candidate is ambitious and eager to get to Harvard. About one criterion they agreed: S.A.T. score. If the score means anything at all, it is only an indicator. A very low score, in particular (very low at Harvard being, say, a combined score of 1,000), is a red flag that the student is not academically prepared for Harvard course work, but is not a disqualifier. A high score, particularly with "recentering," doesn't mean much either. This year 9,400 applicants scored higher than 1,400; nearly 1,600 applicants scored a perfect 800 on the verbal section of the test; more than 1,900 had perfect scores on the math section. The school did not admit 165 applicants with double 800's.
Grades are important, and so is a consistently ambitious course selection, though most of the officers say that the strength of the high school is crucial. And most officers say that they are also impressed by a range of pursuits that show up in extracurricular activities. They look for focused excellence -- a Westinghouse national science competition winner, for example. But they also look for energy and a variety of interests, the kind of kid who, say, works 20 hours a week in a hospital, plays sousaphone in the marching band, edits the school's French magazine and organized the local chapter of Act Up.
Area reps have the authority to identify an applicant whose folder does not impress by entering the candidate directly into the regional computer file known as a docket without a second reading. This is called "coding out," and though it's not a disqualification, it is a signal that the application will need bolstering if the candidate is to be considered seriously. The area reps wield this power to varying degrees. Brooke Earley, a young woman in her second year on the committee who represents Georgia, the Carolinas, Kentucky and Wisconsin and parts of Massachusetts, said she coded out maybe 40 of 220 early-action applicants this year. Margot Hsu Carroll, who represents San Francisco and some of California's northern counties, along with Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and parts of Massachusetts, said she reads between 800 and 900 folders a year. "Maybe half the ones I read will not get a second reading," she said.
Most applicants get a second reading from another admissions officer and then a third from a senior member of the committee. Many even get a fourth from a reader with a specialized outlook -- a math professor reading to determine whether a candidate is a truly outstanding mathematician or merely very good, for example, or a Hispanic committee member reading with particular sensitivity to English-as-a-second-language candidates.
At each step the applicants are graded, 1 to 6 (1 being extraordinary, 6 preposterously underqualified, both being rare), in four areas -- academics, extracurriculars, athletics and personal characteristics -- besides being given an overall grade. The numbers are meant to be informative to subsequent readers; a candidate's "official" grades, before the folder comes up for public discussion, are assigned by the senior reader.
"Most folders will be read as 2's, 3's, 4's," Fitzsimmons said, adding that though more 2's than 4's will be admitted, there will be 2's that won't and 4's that will.
From this point on the process becomes something of a spirited debate, with cases being considered in an open forum -- area reps speaking up for their favored candidates and questioned, like lawyers before a tribunal, by their colleagues. Because there are fewer applicants during the early-action process, all the cases are heard by the full committee in meetings that go on for two or three weeks in the fall. For regular admission, however, the thousands of cases are divided among 21 subcommittees, each handling a docket. In subcommittees cases may be dispensed with in a quick vote, though any given folder may lead to discussion lasting an hour or more. In the end, each subcommittee, operating with a general target number of admits, comes up with a list of recommended admits, marginal admits and marginal rejections. The idea is to enter the final phase of the process with about 1,900 tentatively admitted applicants, including those from early action -- a very rough sketch of the class. That way, when the full committee begins its intensive discussions, members can begin to imagine particular candidates in the context of a whole class and the class in the context of the entire student body.
However, the full committee goes over every applicant, person by person, school by school. Most cases are dispatched quickly, but all of the tentative admits are rescrutinized, and Fitzsimmons says that maybe 1,000 or more others get serious consideration as well. "There is a lot of discussion on the margins," he said, adding that the number of tentative admits that in the end don't get in is in the hundreds.
In sum, at least in theory, the entire process comes down to each applicant against the rest, a year's worth of high-school students poured into a sifter to see who filters through. It turns out, of course, that there are annual anomalies: the high school that one year had no admits out of 35 applications and the next 9 out of 20; a sudden dip in the number of black male admits; the peculiar fact of seven sets of twins in one class.
Fitzsimmons shrugged: accidents. "I know it sounds corny," he said, "but we really do treat each application individually."
Harvard would not allow a reporter to sit in on committee meetings, citing, at various times, the confidentiality of the process, an unwillingness to set a precedent and a fear that an outsider's presence might affect the decision makers. In any case, the final two days of this year's meetings brought 79 candidates still in the running for 15 places.
"By this time, we really knew the cases incredibly well, and we would have been happy with any of these kids," Fitzsimmons said. "What people had to think about, really think within their hearts, was who of these kids had really earned it, who would make the biggest difference here and then the imponderable one, which of them would make the biggest difference with their lives? Obviously there are no clear-cut answers."
Late in the afternoon on Saturday, March 23, the committee took a final vote, with each of the 40 or so people in the room making 15 choices. The top 15 vote getters were in. As it turned out, it took a minimum of 13 votes to gain admission, and the final three admittees had 13 on the nose.
Two candidates received 10 votes. Two had 11. One had 12.
HARVARD HAS OFFERED admission to the class of 2000 to a total of 1,985 students, including 901 women, 325 Asian-Americans, 187 African-Americans and 169 Hispanic-Americans. About two-thirds came from public high schools. Of the 16 applicants from Van Nuys High, 3 were admitted and 2 placed on the waiting list.
Parham Yashar and Anna Fudacz took their rejections with cheerful good grace, though in conversations on the day they found out, both retreated from the rejections of Harvard they had expressed the day before.
"I feel fine," Anna said. "But I guess if I'd gotten in I'd have considered it."
And Parham, suddenly not so uneasy about traveling far from home, said, well, he hadn't really expected to be admitted, and, anyway, he still hadn't heard from Rice University in Houston, so there was still hope.
To ease the anxiety, Mira Lew had made several wagers. "If I get into Yale, my friend has to shave stripes into his hair," she said. "If not, I have to paint skunk stripes in mine."
Mira went to the mailbox in front of her home in Northridge at about 1 P.M. on April 5. Peeking in, she said, "Uh-oh."
There were two thin letters, the traditional harbingers of doom. From Harvard, a cordial, apologetic note, signed by Fitzsimmons and explaining, in straightforward, not-quite-condescending language, that the competition for places in the class had been unprecedented. But in fact, the news wasn't all bad. Yale's brief missive said she had been placed on the waiting list.
"So I guess there's still hope," she said. And further, Columbia had sent a fat packet, full of congratulations and an explanation of its generous financial-aid offer.
Inside the house, she stared at the letters, one after another. She was fighting back tears, but it was hard to discern what was upsetting her. Perhaps the rejection, perhaps the waiting list, perhaps that after two years of preparation for this moment, the moment itself offered no clear-cut way to feel.
"I'm still in limbo," she said.
On Sunday, April 7, Maya Turre sat in the living room of her home in Reseda, appearing to be very unsettled for someone who had been admitted to nine of the finest colleges in the country. Harvard had said yes. (On the letter, under his signature, Fitzsimmons had written, "Hope you will join us.") So had Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, the University of Chicago, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Southern California and, her avowed first choice, M.I.T.
"I'm confused now," she said. "I'm having second thoughts."
Maya sat on the couch, her posture erect, her composed expression occasionally infiltrated by a shy smile. But her naturally implacable demeanor was belied by her hands, which seemed to be nervously washing themselves.
"What if I choose the wrong school?" she said. What was shaking her was her acceptance to Harvard. So what if Harvard doesn't have an undergraduate architecture major? She could devise her own curriculum, right? She could take courses in the graduate program in design. All throughout the week following her admission, Maya was on the phone -- to architects, the Harvard design-school faculty, her contacts at U.S.C. -- asking questions, soliciting opinions, asking advice, fishing for the factor that would push her one way or the other.
Reached by phone late last week, she said, "Well, I'm leaning toward Harvard."

HEADLINE: Acres and Acres of Color

BYLINE: BY CHRISTINE S. COZZENS; CHRISTINE S. COZZENS teaches writing at Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Ga.

 BODY:
POISED where the piedmont meets the coastal plains, the pine-forested mountains of west central Georgia, formed from resilient Hollis quartzite, are scored by dramatic ravines and streaked with pink and white dogwoods in the spring; nearby farmlands, once fleecy with cotton, now are host to the full range of botanical specimens from the southeastern United States and an ever-blooming palette. This swatch of land is sometimes called the Chattahoochee Trace after the river that wanders down from the state's northern mountains to form the border with Alabama. It embraces 200 miles of scenic country roads and some of Georgia's most carefully preserved landscape and history -- all because of a rare native plant called the plumleaf azalea and a hot springs that simmers at 88 degrees year round.
In the 1930's, Cason Callaway, a textile magnate from nearby La Grange, and his wife, Virginia, were exploring land they had purchased near Blue Springs at Pine Mountain, a steeply ridged formation that makes up the last spine of the Appalachian range. When the two discovered a brilliant reddish orange azalea, Virginia identified it as the prunifloria, or plumleaf, variety that grows only within a hundred-mile radius of the spot, and Callaway vowed to build a magnificent garden to reclaim the region's worn-out cotton fields and preserve its flora for the public to enjoy. 
 Today, Callaway Gardens covers more than 14,000 acres, including a 2,500-acre woodland garden; paths for walking, bicycling and driving around a complex of lakes; greenhouses that merge the indoor environment with the natural landscape outside, resort and recreational facilities; historical exhibits, and the country's largest free-flying butterfly conservatory. The nonprofit Ida Cason Callaway Foundation, headed by the Callaways' son, Howard H. Callaway, owns and manages the gardens, an adjacent U.S. natural landmark forest of 8,000 acres, and the for-profit resort and recreational properties. The foundation uses the proceeds from the resort and recreational properties to maintain the gardens and forests. More than a million visitors come to the gardens each year, so I avoid weekend visits at the busiest times -- azalea season and the Fantasy in Lights festival in December -- or take my bicycle to bypass the traffic.
A few years before the Callaways made their discovery, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had come to the region seeking a cure for his polio. Near the town of Warm Springs, on the northern slope of Pine Mountain, he built the vacation home soon known as the Little White House and helped design the state park that bears his name -- 10,000 acres of land between Warm Springs and Callaway Gardens. Roosevelt, architect of the New Deal, and Callaway, a fervent Republican, put politics second to their love for the Pine Mountain area and became friends, united in their efforts to cultivate and conserve its beauty.
Opened to the public in 1952 after years of careful re-establishment of the natural habitat, a policy that continues today, Callaway Gardens can be sampled in a day or savored over a longer period. To appreciate the size and stunning variety of the gardens, I like to begin my visit with a trip by car or tram along roads that wind in and out of the forests and lakes. Visitors can also explore the six footpaths -- Wildflower, Azalea, Holly, Rhododendrom, Laurel Springs and Mountain Creek Lake trails, -- and a 7.5-mile bicycle trail for a closer look at the collections of native plants.
Spring months offer the most varied array of blooms, with banks of azaleas, dogwoods and other flowering trees framing almost every vista; the plumleaf brightens the forest floor in July and August; the woodlands ripen into color in the fall, and formal gardens and greenhouses put on an evolving display of horticultural virtuosity with beds of flowers, vegetables and herbs throughout the year.
THE John A. Sibley Horticultural Center at one end of Mountain Creek Lake is one of the garden's two unusual hothouse displays. When I visited the center this month, its high-ceilinged chambers were filled with pink, white and blue hydrangeas, lilies and orchids of every shade and shape, and beds of daffodils, primroses, pansies, English ivy and bromeliads. A two-story waterfall feeds the system of pools that flows through the greenhouse and out into the yard, and the enormous wood- and glass-paneled doors open onto lawns and gardens, where local orchestras give weekly concerts in fine weather and where the plantings continue the seasonal themes begun inside.
Not far from the Sibley Center another greenhouse, in the Cecil B. Day Butterfly Center, more than a thousand butterflies (20 to 50 species at a time) flutter freely around a tiered arrangement of plants -- lantana, shrimp plant, heather, antherium and a collection of bromeliads, ferns and orchids -- and a waterfall. The center is also home to hummingbirds, mandarin ducks and bleeding heart doves. Visitors to this 8,000-square-foot conservatory may find a zebra longwing, a cloudless sulphur or a tiger swallowtail landing on their sleeves. Exhibits of mounted specimens, 19th-century watercolors by the Chevalier de Freminville and illustrations by the Georgia naturalist John Abbot, a film and cases of live chrysalises hanging from racks like so many jewels illustrate the different stages of butterfly development. The butterfly garden around the center is planted to attract more than 70 local varieties.
Adjacent to the Day Center, Mr. Cason's Vegetable Garden, southern site of the PBS program "Victory Garden," is characterized by usefulness and artistry. Framed by neat hedges, the seven and a half acres of orderly flower and vegetable beds demonstrate seasonal gardening using the latest techniques; there are always gardeners to talk to, ideas being tested and seedlings for sale. A year-round herb garden masses fragrant banks of rosemary, oregano, mint and sage with seasonal flowers.
From Callaway Gardens, it is a 16-mile drive over Pine Mountain to the wild, dusky ravines where, in 1924, Roosevelt sought relief at the hot springs in nearby Bullochville, later renamed Warm Springs. He returned to Warm Springs often, staying at cottages near the pools, and in 1927 he arranged for the renovation of the hot springs facilities, eventually investing two-thirds of his fortune to establish the Roosevelt Warm Springs Foundation for the treatment of polio patients. By 1932, the year he became President, Roosevelt's six-room white frame cabin around the corner from the rehabilitation center had been completed.
Today, the Little White House, with its four slender columns and graceful portico, is preserved exactly as it was on April 12, 1945, when the fourth-term President died there while sitting for his portrait. The simplicity of this Presidential retreat, the only house Roosevelt built and furnished for himself, bespeaks its Depression Era origins.
Furnished almost entirely with the plain but well-designed wooden furniture manufactured in the Val-Kill shops -- unemployment relief factories Eleanor Roosevelt established in New York -- each of the six rooms and outbuildings has a built-in audiotape explaining its history and artifacts, and an attendant is always on hand to tell anecdotes and answer questions, most of which concern Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, Roosevelt's longtime companion who was with him when he died. Though one of the three small, sparsely furnished rooms is called Mrs. Roosevelt's Bedroom, the First Lady rarely visited Warm Springs.
A kitchen, an entryway and a central living and dining room make up the rest of the cabin; the veranda stretches across the entire back of the house and overlooks the deep ravine with its tall trees, distant horizons and glimpses of flowering underbrush. The unfinished painting still standing on an easel in the living room captures the strain of the war years and the President's failing health. Shortly after Roosevelt was pronounced dead, the woman who had been his cook since 1929 wrote in pencil on the kitchen wall, "Daisy Bonner cook the first meal in this house for the President Roosevelt and the last"; this quiet tribute is preserved under glass.
Across from the house are the two guest cottages, where national and world leaders sometimes stayed. The complex also includes the old sentry house, a neighbor's cottage and the servant's quarters and garage housing the President's specially built, manually controlled Ford convertible.
Up the hill to the left of the Bump Gate, a wide gate Roosevelt designed to open and swing back into place when nudged by a car bumper, is the Georgia Mustian Wilkins cottage, which tells the story of the Warm Springs years and of Roosevelt's struggle with polio. The cottage is filled with documents, photographs and memorabilia, including the President's saddle and bridle, his leg braces and wheelchair. A film comprised of home movies taken at the cabin and the rehabilitation center includes rare footage of Roosevelt in a bathing suit wearing leg braces or in his wheelchair, showing that he comfortably revealed his disability to the friends, family and fellow polio survivors who surrounded him at Warm Springs.
The unassuming approach to the Little White House through a grove of pines is landscaped just enough to provide a pathway and to merge the small lawn and planted terraces with the wooded setting in keeping with Roosevelt's conservationist views.
All during the Warm Springs years he interested himself in reclamation projects including agricultural experimentation and extensive tree planting in the valleys surrounding Pine Mountain. It is said that except during wartime exigency, he never had a tree cut down if he could help it, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which manages the Little White House and the Pools and Springs Area, still respects his wishes.
The road between Warm Springs and Callaway Gardens, State Highway 190, cuts through Franklin Delano Roosevelt State Park, following the crest of the last ridge in the piedmont region and affording spectacular views of the lakes, forests and farmlands on both sides, especially at Dowdell's Knob, the rocky outcropping that was Roosevelt's favorite picnic spot, where the stone grill he and his guests used is still standing.
ROOSEVELT STATE PARK, one of Georgia's largest recreational facilities, offers a web of hiking trails, cabin and tent sites, horseback riding by the hour or day, and fishing in two manmade lakes. Built from local materials by the New Deal's Civilian Conservation Corps, the park's lodge, stone swimming pool and log cabins reflect the rustic style of the early conservation movement.
State Highway 190 leads down into the little town of Warm Springs, where the 19th- and early 20th-century storefronts, raised sidewalks and train depot have been restored to recall the Roosevelt era. And just outside town, the hot springs and pools that Roosevelt made famous, fallen into disrepair in the last 20 years as the institute moved away from hydrotherapy, were opened for public viewing last year.
Whether I begin my trip on the northeastern side of Pine Mountain, at the Little White House and Warm Springs, or at the southwestern end, I am often drawn in the opposite direction later that afternoon, as if the region's two moods -- the serenity of the forest and the riot of color and foliage in the garden -- made the day whole.

Getting There
Take I-85 south from Atlanta to I-185 (Exit 8) south. At Exit 14 on 185 (Pine Mountain), turn left on U.S. Highway 27 and go 12 miles to Callaway Gardens. For the return trip from the Little White House and Warm Springs, take 27 north through 30 miles of pleasant countryside until it joins I-85 north.
 
The Gardens and Resort
A day pass to the gardens, which includes admission to all attractions, costs from $15 to $20 a car (up to 9 people) depending on the season. Bicycles for use in the gardens may be rented for $5 an hour or $20 a day at the Bike Barn near the beach entrance. The gardens' opening hours and special programs also vary according to the time of year. For information on fees, hours, special attractions and reservations, call (800) 225-5292.
The accommodations at the gardens are well-situated for touring the area as well as Roosevelt State Park, Warm Springs and the Little White House, and a wider region from La Grange to Columbus.
Callaway Gardens Inn is a 349-bedroom luxury motel across from the gardens' main entrance. The inn has an outdoor pool, tennis courts, two pleasant restaurants (the Plantation Room and the Georgia Room) and conference facilities. Accommodation for two people costs from $89 a night. There are also 155 two-bedroom cottages (from $165 a night) and 49 larger villas (from $195 a night) -- all fully equipped. Resort facilities include four golf courses, fishing, tennis and racquetball.
For information on other motels or bed and breakfasts nearby, call the Pine Mountain Tourism Association at (706) 663-4000 or (800) 441-3502.
Inside Callaway Gardens the Verandah and Gardens Restaurants serve lunch and dinner with a view of the lake and grounds ($6 to $25). A more casual restaurant and a great place for children, the Country Kitchen, is at the Callaway Country Store on Route 27, where patrons may purchase a variety of country-style foods such as Vidalia onion dressing, scuppernong jelly, speckled heart grits and old-fashioned candy. Call (800) 280-7524 for mail orders.
Near the store, the 23-mile Pine Mountain Trail begins at one of the entrances to Franklin Delano Roosevelt State Park and ends at the WASP-TV tower near Warm Springs. Opened in 1975, a communal project of hikers and conservationists in the area, this trail takes hikers to Cascade Falls, Buzzard Roost and Sunset Rock, nine campsites and samples of all the region's native plants. Maps of the trail may be purchased at most local shops.
 
Rossevelt State Park
The park is on Georgia Route 190 between Pine Mountain and Warm Springs; (706) 663-4858. In the summer months and on pleasant fall weekends, it is necessary to reserve campsites and cabins. Twenty-one cabins, most with screened porches and all with air-conditioning, at $50 to $80 a week for up to eight people, are arranged around the lake, as are some of the car-camping and RV sites, at $12 a night. The central reservations number for all Georgia state parks is (800) 864-7275. In addition to swimming in the Liberty-Bell-shaped pool (Roosevelt's idea), the park offers fishing in two lakes, 30 miles of hiking trails and horseback riding on 18 miles of trail at the F.D.R. Stables on King's Road; (706) 628-4533. A one-hour ride costs $18 and an overnight ride costs from $60.
 
Warm Springs
Admission to the Little White House and grounds is $4, $2 for children 6 to 18; the site is open from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day; (706) 655-5870. There is a small snack bar and gift shop at the entrance gate. The Pools and Springs Area on Alternate Route 27 is open the same hours as the Little White House; there is no entrance fee.

HEADLINE: Upheaval and Calm as Big Dig Transforms Boston

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 27

 BODY:
Its construction has been likened by people here to that of the Pyramids, the Hoover Dam and the Panama Canal. It has been called "a wonder of the world," by the United States Transportation Secretary.
The Big Dig, as everyone here calls the eight miles of tunnels and highways being built through the heart of Boston, is the largest public works project in America and the most expensive stretch of highway. 
 But what is perhaps most remarkable about the $10 billion project are the 20 years of political engineering and social planning that went into it.
Boston has had a long and bitter experience with the old method of highway construction that ravaged cities and bulldozed houses, businesses and neighborhoods. The Big Dig was designed to repair past damage, and reconnect communities that had been cut off from one another by asphalt, concrete and cars.
The Channel Tunnel between France and England was as ambitious, said the Massachusetts Transportation Secretary, James Kerasiotes, who is overseeing the Big Dig.
But that was built under water. "They weren't building in anyone's neighborhood," Mr. Kerasiotes said.
In Boston, they are building in a lot of people's neighborhoods: From East Boston to Charlestown, from Chinatown to South Boston, from the South End to the North End. Not a single house has been taken, not a single family displaced. Five years after ground was broken, the heaviest construction is going on in congested downtown. Boston is going on around the Big Dig.
Under the plan, in which work is to be completed in 2004, Boston would be transformed. An eight-lane underground highway, much of it covered by parkland, will replace the obsolete, traffic-clogged elevated highway -- the Central Artery -- that cut an ugly swath through downtown when it was built in the 1950's. Boston will regain access to its waterfront, and the North End will no longer be separated from the rest of the city by the artery.
One part of the Big Dig -- the Ted Williams Tunnel under Boston Harbor to Logan Airport -- was opened to commercial traffic in December, and eventually it will be linked to the Massachusetts Turnpike. The project also includes public-transit improvements.
The man who conceived the project, and built the bipartisan coalition that made it a reality, is a bricklayer's son whose philosophy about cities and highways was forged when his grandmother's house was bulldozed for the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1959. An engineer and state Transportation Secretary under former Gov. Michael Dukakis, Fred Salvucci helped stop a highway that would have demolished thousands of houses and businesses 20 years ago.
"Highways don't have to come at the expense of neighborhoods," Mr. Salvucci said the other day, as he drove under the Artery. "When they built the Artery, they thought the city was bad. They thought the suburbs were the future. I hated what the Artery did to the city."
While the project was designed to preserve communities, it is impossible for it not to disrupt life in the city.
The financial district is a maze of reconfigured streets, construction barriers and heavy equipment -- cranes, trucks, backhoes and pile drivers. And peak construction is still two years off.
Traffic is flowing -- as much as it ever flows in historic Boston, with its narrow, twisting streets that started out as cow paths in the 1600's. The usual crowds of tourists have been strolling along the Freedom Trail this spring. Aside from one small restaurant in the North End that closed last month, people are not going out of business -- so far.
With the street torn up in front of Les Zygomates, a French bistro at the edge of downtown, Lorenzo Savona, the co-owner, has been mailing customers parking maps. "They come through snow, sleet, hail -- and dump trucks blocking the street," Mr. Savona said.
"I am awed," said Darlene Bezdegian, a heavy-equipment operator. "There are people everywhere, and equipment everywhere, and life goes on."
An army of union laborers was on the ground in the financial district the other day, excavating dirt, and building walls in preparation for the tunnel beneath the Artery. Many of them come to work with cameras -- "so when it's finished you'll have memories," said Mary Flaherty, a construction worker.
There were men and women crawling with shovels through holes 25 feet underground. They are moving a total of 10,000 miles of underground utility lines -- telephone, television, cable, gas, water, sewer -- to make way for the tunnel. The project will use enough concrete to build a sidewalk from Boston to San Francisco and back three times, enough steel for a one-inch bar that would reach around the Equator.
The project's deputy director, William Flynn, is a retired Army general. During the Persian Gulf war, he directed the movement of 70,000 troops and tanks from Europe to the gulf. "That was easier than this baby here," he said during a break.
One wrong move, and the power could go out in, say, the Federal Reserve Bank. The workers are, literally, digging up the old city -- excavating clay, sand, boulders, wooden piers, all of it used to fill in the harbor when the city was expanded in the 1800's.
To insulate people in the modern city, barricades block work sites. Sound walls muffle noise. Trucks are washed frequently to cut down on dirt. Even fish in the harbor have been protected, with underwater sound waves used to warn migrating herring and alewife away from blasting sites.
The Big Dig is going forward at a time when the Republican-controlled Congress has little taste for such massive urban projects.
What has helped the Big Dig overcome previous political roadblockswas the unlikely coalition that Fred Salvucci built. He brought together business and labor, environmentalists and automobile lovers, Republicans and Democrats, neighborhood leaders and politicians, all committed to the idea that the city's economy depend upon the project's relieving crippling traffic congestion.
In East Boston, though, many people hated the project when it was first proposed 20 years ago because the tunnel to Logan Airport was to have gone through their neighborhood. "We said 'another tunnel? No way,' " recalled one resident, John Vitagliano, whose grandfather's house, and grocery store, had been taken for the Sumner Tunnel across the harbor.
But Mr. Salvucci, who had led a successful fight in the 1960's to prevent further airport expansion, managed to win people's trust during the 1980's, when he was Transportation Secretary, with his mumbling, self-effacing manner.
"Fred went into people's homes and talked to them," Mr. Vitagliano said. "His suits were chronically mismatched. He always wore his belt buckle off to the side in this feeble attempt at imitating Elvis Presley. There wasn't a disingenuous part of his make-up."
Mr. Salvucci, who is 56 and still wears his belt buckle to the side, satisfied many people in East Boston by reconfiguring the tunnel away from their neighborhood.
Charlestown, in turn, was unhappy with a series of interchanges so Mr. Salvucci redrew them.
In the beginning, Mr. Salvucci thought it would be impossible to bring the Artery underground without shutting down Boston. A contractor named Bill Reynolds had approached him at a community meeting in 1970 with the idea. "I said, 'What should we do, put a sign up at the Charles River, saying, Boston closed for alterations, come back in 10 years?' " Mr. Salvucci said.
At the time, Mr. Salvucci was a transportation adviser to Boston's Mayor Kevin White. He would regularly walk from City Hall to the North End for lunch -- under the Artery. "I started looking at it," said Mr. Salvucci, who left government when Gov. William F. Weld took office in 1991 and now teaches transportation studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I realized, 'Gee, there was actually some space. You could construct around it,' " he said. "I thought you literally had to tear it down first." The tunnel could be built while the Artery stayed open to traffic.
It took political engineering to get Congress to approve the necessary Federal highway funds.
In early 1985, according to a political history of the Big Dig by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Mr. Salvucci's Under Secretary of Transportation, Matthew Coogan, went to see a therapist. The therapist asked what was wrong.
Mr. Coogan "replied that he felt excessively nervous, exhausted and tense," according to the report. "The therapist asked why. Coogan went to the window, which overlooked the Central Artery and said, 'You see that road. My boss, the Governor of Massachusetts, and the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, want to put it underground. The President of the United States and the people who work for him think that that is a terrible idea. My job is to convince them that they are wrong."'
The therapist assured Mr. Coogan that he was absolutely sane.
In 1987, with the political muscle of the late Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who has then Speaker, and Senator Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, Congress overrode President Reagan's veto, and approved the transportation bill containing funds for what is officially called the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project. The project was then expected to cost $4 billion.
In 1991, Federal law authorized 85 percent of the Big Dig's costs, which were then expected to be about $6 billion. That law provided that the state would be responsible for any cost increases beyond that. With Congress expected to vote in 1997 on a transportation bill that would contain new funding, questions have been raised about delays and escalating costs. In a report 18 months ago, the Federal Department of Transportation's Inspector General's office called the project out of control. The state has begun looking at regional transportation authorities for sources of revenue and is considering borrowing against future Federal appropriations.
In Boston, meanwhile, there is plenty of complaining. Every traffic jam is blamed on the Big Dig. There was one nightmarish day last month, when an engineer left a concrete barrier in place during the morning rush hour, and caused a four-hour traffic jam. He was summarily fired.
"It was one of those career defining moments in an engineer's life," said Peter Zuk, the project director.
Mr. Zuk, who is thinking about writing a book on the project, said the vast scope of the Big Dig has challenged some to greatness while infuriating others. "It's a metaphor for the human condition," he said.
With a huge excavation outside the window of her loft in an industrial neighborhood, Rebecca Dwyer, an artist, has been exasperated and inspired by the Big Dig. She has begun making collages out of its schematic maps.
The other day Ronnie Cook, a 50-year-old construction worker, was digging inside a 66-inch pipe, 25 feet underground. He pulled from his pocket a Polaroid snapshot of himself in the hole. It was for his 9-year-old daughter, Crystal, he said. He said he wants Crystal to know her father is working on a project for the history books.

The Death of Some Salesmen

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
PAUL BUNYAN, John Henry or Horatio Alger he's not. But America's workday culture has few figures as storied as the salesman, scouring a territory or going door to door, "riding on a smile and a shoeshine," as Arthur Miller memorably put it. The salesman was once ubiquitous. He trudged from the pages of Theodore Dreiser to a Warner Brothers cartoon where, as Daffy Duck, he wrecked Porky Pig's home while demonstrating a vacuum cleaner and other labor-saving thingamajigs.
No longer. When Encyclopedia Britannica dismissed all its home sales representatives last week, cutting 140 full-time employees and 300 independent contractors, it was but one more sign that the old-style career salesman is dead. 
 But not the smaller independent, face-to-face salesperson. Far from it. Where Willy Loman once was, there is now a new force of part-timers, mostly women, prying at the gates between their economic ghetto and the verdant middle class.
In an era of malls, home-shopping networks and catalogues, there are also more and more people like Cindy Funderburk of Florien, La. She drives a school bus, beginning at 6:20 A.M. She tends the chickens and cows on her farm. And she sells Beauticontrol CQ Herbal Serenity lotions, What A Pear! shampoo and Regeneration anti-aging creams with Alpha Hydroxy Acid Complex 3, making enough to help pay for her daughter's college and for three straight annual vacations to Branson, Mo.
The door-to-door mainstays have slowly mutated, until they are all but unrecognizable. Encyclopedia Britannica abandoned door-to-door sales decades ago in favor of having its salesmen, including many full-timers, follow up leads generated by advertising and referrals. At the Fuller Brush Company, 11 presidents in five years couldn't keep up the legendary sales force that once included Billy Graham and Joe DiMaggio. The company was sold two years ago to a buyer who, relying less on the salespeople, has nearly doubled the number of Fuller Brush stores.
At cosmetics companies, meanwhile, person-to-person sales are booming. The Direct Selling Association says that, from 1990 to 1994, the sales force nationwide has increased by more than third, to 6.3 million.
These figures might smell self-serving, but Neil H. Offen, the association's president, has an alarmingly frank explanation. "We provide an alternative to welfare, an alternative to unemployment compensation," he said. Or to other forms of downward mobility. "You can't stay in the middle class on one income," Mr. Offen said. "Sometimes not on two."
Many of the new salesmen and saleswomen belong to triple- or quadruple-career families. The rise in direct sales might partly explain why unemployment rates remain fairly low, despite wave after wave of corporate layoffs.
The industry's growth has been propelled by incessant recruiting. Many merchandisers give their salespeople a percentage on any other salespeople they recruit, and then on their recruits' recruits.
The pros like Mrs. Funderburk, collecting from 24 recruits, are always on the prowl for more. "Does your wife use Beauticontrol?" she asks.
 
 
 
Avon Calling
 Instead of knocking on unfamiliar doors, a tactic some towns now forbid as a danger to salespeople and customers alike, the new sellers network. "We train people in how to connect at the office and factory," said Christina Gold, Avon's chief for North America. "It's a high-touch business." In two years, she has expanded her sales force by about 45,000, to 445,000. Though Mrs. Gold will occasionally test the market by selling with Avon's traditional ding and dong, more than half the company's sales are made or arranged at work.
Sales at home, for companies like Mary Kay cosmetics that have followed Tupperware's lead, now are more likely to involve living-room parties or classes in skin care than cold calling or knocking.
Even Girl Scouts are learning the tricks of modern direct sales, setting up booths in malls, train stations and office lobbies. This year, troops in Hawaii and the Boston area took to flogging their cookies on the Internet. "Times have changed and so have our selling tactics," said Judy Welage, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts.
Some scouts invade Mom's and Dad's offices directly. Who is going to resist buying a few too many boxes of Peanut Butter Patties when confronted in the open by the boss's pigtailed daughter?
Unlike Mrs. Funderburk and Miss Pigtails, the traditional salesman suffers from an image that was muddied long ago. In the 1944 film "Double Indemnity," Fred MacMurray plays a visiting insurance agent noir who gets roped into the murder of a wealthy customer to collect the insurance payoff and the co-conspiring wife.
Decades later, when Louis Harris took a survey for the Direct Selling Association to help the industry shine its image, he reported that spending millions of dollars in one year would add no luster. "He said it would take 20 years," Mr. Offen, the association president, recalls.
As much as consumers have feared predatory salespeople, today's salespeople need protection from their rapacious companies. In an industry where annual turnover runs at 70 percent, companies often stick departing salespeople with overstuffed inventories and hundreds of dollars in training fees
In one sense, though, direct sales may be coming full circle. Mr. Offen reports that men are returning in swarms, with their proportion having more than doubled, to 24 percent, in three years. Most are victims of layoffs or low wages.
Mrs. Gold can readily pick up the scent. "Would you like to be an Avon representative?" she asked with a lilt. "I could have someone see you tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 19% in March

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools rose nearly 19 percent last month, but fell compared with this time last year, an industry trade group reported yesterday.
Orders for machine tools -- which are used to cut and shape metal in products ranging from toasters to tractors -- are considered a sign of whether manufacturers are confident enough about demand to refurbish and expand their factories. 
 March's orders totaled $499.8 million, up from $421.4 million in February, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said. Compared with a year ago, March orders were down 13.5 percent.
The machine tool report said domestic orders totaled $400.6 million in March, up 11 percent from February's level, but down 22 percent from March 1995. Foreign orders totaled $99.2 million, up 65 percent from February and up 54 percent from March 1995.
"The pace of export order growth accelerated in March, driven primarily by two of our major export markets -- Mexico and China," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va.
Last month's shipments of machine tools totaled $453.75 million, down 1.5 percent from February, but up 16 percent from March 1995.
First-quarter orders totaled $1.38 billion, up 4 percent from 1995. First-quarter shipments rose to $1.25 billion, 25 percent ahead of the 1995 period.
The backlog of orders -- a measure of the ability of American tool makers to satisfy demand -- was $2.2 billion, up from February's $2.16 billion, but down from the backlog of $2.42 billion a year ago.

HEADLINE: Freeze in U.S. Aid Hampers New Haitian President's Recovery Effort

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 26

 BODY:
The final American combat unit withdrew last week, leaving a reduced United Nations presence here. Now the United States has frozen most of its economic aid to Haiti, which until recently was being hailed as one of the Clinton Administration's shining foreign policy triumphs.
Because of a law sponsored by Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, about half of the $85 million in assistance that the United States had allocated this year will remain blocked until the Haitian Government shows progress in solving a series of killings of public figures here. 
 Haitian officials complain that the United States is demanding too much of their new police force and failing to cooperate in the investigations.
"It is sad to see the weakness of the criminal investigative capacity of our police, but that is the only structure we have" to meet the American demands, Robert Manuel, Haiti's new Secretary of State for Public Security, said in an interview here. "People should be honest and see the situation that we are in."
Acting under a United Nations resolution, more than 20,000 American troops landed here in September 1994 to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power three years after he was overthrown in a military coup.
Since then, the Haitian armed forces have been abolished and replaced by a National Police composed of hastily trained civilians, which has had difficulty maintaining order, preventing crime and catching lawbreakers.
The decision to hold back American aid comes at a moment when President Rene Preval, who succeeded Mr. Aristide in February as leader of the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, is especially vulnerable. More than $100 million in much-needed foreign assistance has already been on hold for six months because Mr. Aristide failed to fulfill pledges to begin selling inefficient state enterprises to private investors.
Largely as a result of the reduced flow of aid, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Government's budget, Mr. Preval has been unable to get the economy, battered by three years of an international embargo, moving again.
Unemployment remains over 50 percent, currency reserves are dropping, many health, education and agriculture projects are stalled, and the Government expects soon to lack even the funds to pay its own employees, who have begun taking to the streets in protest against possible layoffs.
"Come the summer, there could be an explosion here unless the economy starts up," warned a senior adviser to President Preval. "The people are tired, hungry and disillusioned, and we can't continue much longer in this state of prostration."
The Dole Amendment prohibits the United States from dispensing all but humanitarian aid to Haiti unless President Clinton certifies to Congress that the Haitian Government is conducting a "thorough" investigation of a series of killings in the last 18 months that Congress deems political.
Last week, the State Department said it had determined that the Haitian Government had made "insufficient progress" in the cases, and would "consult soon with Congress on how we propose to proceed."
The list of killings Washington wants investigated includes more than 25 cases. Most attention has been on the slaying on March 28, 1995, of Mireille Durocher Bertin, a prominent lawyer and former adviser to the military dictatorship who was ambushed along with a client and shot dead just three days before President Clinton visited here.
In a report issued after a brief trip here earlier this month, a Republican staff delegation strongly criticized the Haitian Government and the American Embassy for their handling of the Bertin case and others. The delegation concluded that the killings were politically motivated, that the Aristide Government had masterminded them and that, in essence, the American Embassy had joined in a cover-up of the slayings.
"While we do not agree with all of the opinions of the staff delegation that went to Haiti," the State Department said in a written response to the report, "we do not believe it would serve a useful purpose to engage in a point-by-point analysis of their statement of the problems they perceived. Human rights remains a high priority of the Embassy, since it is a high priority of U.S. foreign policy."
The Republican report and attempts to block aid have angered many here, who regard the efforts as pure electoral maneuvering.
Jean-Claude Bajeux, director of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights and one of the country's leading intellectuals, said the Republicans did not care about Haiti or Ms. Bertin but "just want to embarrass Clinton."
But there has also been puzzlement at the Clinton Administration's efforts to gain political mileage from the intervention here, which ended with only one American combat fatality and a transfer of power from one popularly elected President to another for the first time in Haitian history.
The Administration has been quick to claim credit for those achievements, but more reluctant recently to protect its political investment here.
"The more the White House goes on about what a success they have had here, the more the Republicans feel compelled to tear it down," one diplomat said. "Against its will, and very much to its disadvantage, Haiti has been dragged into the American election campaign."
Denying that there was a political motive to the lack of progress in the murder investigations, Mr. Manuel noted that several cases in which supporters of Mr. Aristide had been killed also remained unsolved.
He said the Haitian Government had strengthened the police's Special Investigative Unit, which is investigating the killings, none of which have been formally characterized by human rights groups or the United Nations as political assassinations.
"They don't realize that we are just bad," he said of Haiti's critics in the American Congress. "We will have a good police force in five years, but not in one month."
Other Haitian officials complain that their efforts have been hampered by a lack of cooperation on the part of the United States. They maintain, for example, that American intelligence agencies and the F.B.I. have refused to make available copies of tapes of walkie-talkie conversations that Ms. Bertin had the day she was killed.
"The United States has a lot of information that it has not turned over," one official said. "Our Special Investigative Unit is only being allowed access to material on cases that occurred before Aristide's return."
The officials also say the country continues to face a security threat from renegade elements linked to the former military dictatorship.
Earlier this month, for instance, two Haitians said by officials here to be linked to the Tontons Macoute -- a private army of right-wing thugs -- were arrested in Miami on weapons trafficking charges, and their newly purchased guns and ammunition were seized.
The United Nations mission here is scheduled to end June 30, and it is not yet clear whether Chinese and Russian opposition to an extension can be overcome. The withdrawal of United Nations military and police forces would leave Haiti's security completely in the hands of the 5,000-member National Police, which already seems overwhelmed.
Enrique terHorst, head of the United Nations mission here, said he was "not going to second-guess the American Government" about its decision to suspend aid, but added that he believed it was "necessary to look at the state the Haitian National Police are in right now."
Even with United Nations assistance, he said, the fledgling force is hampered by "a lack of skills at this stage, and criminal investigation is the most sophisticated skill of any police force."
"After 29 years of the Duvalier dictatorship and 10 years of assorted military governments and social upheaval," Mr. terHorst added, "I think it can almost be said that this country is starting from scratch. The police are no exception."

HEADLINE: Libraries Ponder Role In the Digital Age

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
With the turn of the century looming, one of the oldest and most cherished cultural institutions, the library, stands at a crossroads. Librarians all over the world are struggling to cope with new technology that has revolutionized the storing, preserving and disseminating of information and changed the very notion of what a library is.
At the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, leaders from 50 of the world's main libraries in 26 countries gathered on Friday and Saturday to discuss the shape that libraries would take in the coming century, the social role that they would play and the promises and challenges presented by new technology. The conference, titled "Global Library Strategies for the 21st Century," was organized by Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library. 
 It became clear very quickly that for libraries, information is a blessing and a curse. Paul M. Horn, senior vice president for research at the International Business Machines Corporation, pointed out in an address that the cost of information storage had gone down by 40 percent a year in the last 20 years and that he could see no change in that tre'd. At some point in the future, he said, it would theoretically be possible to store all 16 million volumes in the Library of Congress on a disk the size of a penny.
But what gets stored and how? Like several other speakers, Mr. Horn suggested that the traditional role of the library as a place to check out a copy of "Tom Sawyer" would not change. But increasingly, librarians would be the guides and gatekeepers, or perhaps the travel agents, on the information superhighway. "Anyone can put anything on the Internet, and they do," he said. "It is difficult to make your way through the information."
Marilyn Gell Mason, the director of the Cleveland Public Library, agreed. "I sometimes wonder why we don't have librarians organize this stuff," she said. "It is very hard to surf the Internet, and I think the problem will get worse before it gets better."
Frances Schwenger, the chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library, said, "We will be judged by how well we create meaning and undertanding in a world of information chaos."
Mr. Horn predicted a much larger role for digital libraries, as traditional libraries create information packages combining the written word, images and sound that can be transmitted to individual work stations. At the Library of Congress in Washington, for example, I.B.M. has been transferring into digital form the achives of the Federal Theater Project, a New Deal arts program, including sets, props and costumes that are deteriorating rapidly.
Brian Lang, the chief executive and deputy chairman of the British Library in London, brought up a seeming paradox in the outlook for libraries. Commenting on the construction of major new libraries in Britain, Germany, France and Denmark, he said: "We are also investing huge sums so that people will not have to visit those buildings. That's a pretty neat trick that librarians have pulled off."
In one way or another, most of the participants in the conference were grappling with the concept of the library without walls and letting go of the traditional concept that every great library should be self-sufficient, with every title available. "The new library will not be judged by its collections but by its potential for connecting users with information," said Borge Sorensen, the director of the Copenhagen Public Libraries.
William G. Bowen, the president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, paid that his foundation was now reluctant to finance projects that had the goal of allowing libraries or scholars generating a greater volume of work more easily. Instead it was looking for projects that generate savings.
In a pilot project supported by the foundation, about 750,000 pages of a dozen journals have been put into electronic form and stored at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Later this year the titles pill be made available to libraries for a subscription fee. Users will be able to call up the titles 24 hours a day. Since, Mr. Bowen estimated, the cost of acquiring and processing a single issue of a scholarly journal is about $20, the savings in time, acquisition costs and storage space should offset the cost of subscribing to the service.
Several participants from Africa, Asia and South America warned that the new information age could end up widening the gap between the first and third worlds. "If we do not become part of this new age, we will be marginalized," said Christine O. Kisiedu, the librarian at the Balme Library of the University of Ghana in Legon. The shiny, high-tech library of the 21st century looks very remote in Angola, for example, which has two librarians and no libraries. Alfonso Romano de Sant'Anna, the president of Brazil's national library, told of visiting a library in Mozambique that had not a single book. The librarian had sold them to pay the light bills.
At tim's, the expansion of the world information map sounded like a game of musical chairs in which some players stood a good chance of being left without a seat. Some participants saw the potential for Anglo-American 'egemony in the universal use of English on the Internet. At the same time, Warren Horton, the director general of the National Library of Australia, said that Australia was among the world leaders in adopting new library technology in part out of a fear of isolation. "Australian culture is as threatened as anyone else's," he said.
In the United States, too, librarians worry about what one speaker called the "info-rich and the info-poor," a notion that runs counter to the original idea of America's libraries as an equalizing force.
"How do we achieve information equity when there is such an economic disparity among our users?" said Susan Goldberg Kent, the city librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library. That question loomed large at the conference, whose participants spent as much time talking about the library as a human gathering place as they did about technological solutions. Virtually every speaker described an expanding social role for libraries as community centers where citizens could receive literacy training, study English as a second language, learn how to function as parents or get health information.
"We are the most welcoming and least intimidating institutions there are," said Mary A. Dempsey, the commissioner of the Chicago Public Library. "The library is a place one can seek this information out without being judged."
Most participants affirmed the idea of the library as a human space in a potentially cold electronic world. The romance of the printed book, all agreed, would continue to cast its spell. And amid the forecasting, more than one speaker sounded the cautious note of experts smart enough to know what they don't know.
Mr. Horn of I.B.M. paused in his high-speed tour of digitization and the Internet long enough to say, "I can't imagine where it's all going." Peter Lyman, the librarian of the University of California at Berkeley, mused about the linguistic fumbling that the information age seemed to inspire. "We always talk about new technology using old vocabulary" he said. " 'Electronic publishing,' 'digital library,' 'information highway': to our grandchildren these terms will probably sound as peculiar as 'horseless carriage.' "

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Rebels With a Cause And a Video Camera

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Authority Sucks" is the elegant title of this week's editions of "MTV News Unfiltered," a daily half-hour program made by high schoolers with cameras supplied by MTV and then edited in the famous music-video slash-and-dash style for the benefit of viewers whose attention span could not last through this sentence.
The week begins economically with repeats, but tomorrow night brings a man who claims he teaches students "how to beat the S.A.T.'s"; a critic who calls graffiti "a beautiful crime"; a ferret owner who rhapsodizes on the lovability of the animal, which is outlawed in her home state of California, and enthusiasts of jet skiing and of "free-style walking." (The only rule, a practitioner of the latter, widely unpracticed sport explains, is "doing whatever you want to do." A teacher describes the free-walkers, with reasonable accuracy, as "two goofballs running up and jumping against the wall.") 
 These must be the most prudent rebels with trivial causes that the nation has ever thrown up. The S.A.T. specialist advises students to prepare for the detested test so they can get into good colleges; the glorifier of graffiti cautions against defacing private property; the jet skier prescribes pre-ski instruction and helmets.
Also telling their stories are an Italian exchange student who is stuck in the town of Osceola, Iowa, where the main pastimes seem to be drag racing, cruising and hanging around, and a high school sophomore who is being treated for Hodgkin's disease, the single serious note in what is a giddy half-hour. (The sophomore supplies the sole touch of wit. Speaking of her support group, she cracks, "Some of my best friends are bald.")
One must sympathize with both youths, but why are they lumped in an antiauthority bag? After all, the Italian visitor owes his education, albeit in the "middle of nowhere," to bureaucrats, and the cancer patient owes her apparent recovery to doctors and hospitals, those unrevolutionary institutions.
Maybe the rest of the week's insurgents will show more fiery tendencies, but maybe not. Thursday's program opens with an 18-year-old proclaimed virgin in Oklahoma who is fighting against the loose morals on television. Hey, not on MTV!

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Economic Scorecard

 BODY:
The week after the White House settled its budget squabbles with Congress is a good time to assess President Clinton's stewardship of the economy. He came into office promising to bring a consensus style of policy-making to the White House -- no longer would a budget director like Richard Darman, who served under President Bush, bully everyone in sight. He also promised to direct Federal spending away from wasteful programs and toward future-looking investments in training people.
How has he done? The record is mixed. He had many small successes and, in health and welfare reform, a few spectacular failures. On balance, Mr. Clinton did little harm and allowed the economy to prosper. That is not an exciting grade sheet. But it is a responsible one. 
 The economists he enlisted -- such as Joseph Stiglitz, Lawrence Summers, Lawrence Katz, Alan Krueger and Alan Blinder -- were all outstanding academics. But the main figure of the first term has been Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, an investment banker who started off as the first head of the newly created National Economic Council. The N.E.C. was set up to coordinate policy-making, break down turf and bring big egos into line behind consistent policy objectives. Mr. Rubin's "no sharp elbows" style of management, perfected when he was head of Goldman Sachs on Wall Street, has worked well.
The Administration twisted the arms of Democrats in Congress to pass its 1993 deficit-reduction package and has pursued policies to bring down the deficit ever since, even though Labor Secretary Robert Reich and other Cabinet members were opposed. This was a responsible choice, but one that stifled bold initiatives. Perhaps the most important decision Mr. Rubin made was to keep the Administration off the back of the Federal Reserve Board. That allowed credit markets to breathe easy, leading to lower interest rates and steady growth.
On trade, the Administration struck a consistently aggressive and usually constructive stance -- even though Mr. Rubin himself would have preferred a more boisterous Japan-bashing stance. The White House finished off the Bush agenda by completing the Nafta accord with Mexico and the Uruguay Round treaty with the rest of the world.
A quieter, largely overlooked success of the first term reflected the "New Democrat" side of the Administration. The Administration scrapped scores of sclerotic bureaucratic structures in favor of incentive-based rules. Last week, it issued rules that will require electrical utility companies to open their transmission lines to competition from independent power generators. The Administration backed revisions of the unemployment insurance system so that the money could be used by the unemployed to set up new businesses. An important victory was achieved in the earned-income tax credit for low-paid workers, which was expanded to largely offset the stiff fall in their market wages over the past 20 years.
But there were also large failures. Health care reform was created outside the give and take of the N.E.C. and approved by the President even though nearly every one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers thought the approach was folly. Welfare reform also failed, but for completely different reasons. The bill put together by David Ellwood, an economist at the Department of Health and Human Services, was a smart mixture of compassion and discipline, fully matching the mantra of Mr. Clinton's campaign to "end welfare as we know it." The failure was timing. Mr. Clinton held off submitting welfare reform until the fate of his health bill was sealed. Hindsight says that decision cost him both reforms.
A big disappointment of the first two years was Mr. Clinton's inability to push the Democrat-controlled Congress to go along with his plan to reshape the Federal budget toward investment. Once the President, at Mr. Rubin's urging, put deficit reduction above all else, he had no new money to spend. Once the Democratic leaders in Congress scuttled his plans to shift money away from their vested interests and toward new training and education initiatives, Mr. Clinton's invest-in-people strategy became little more than rhetoric.
When Mr. Clinton was cautious -- budget, trade, regulation -- he was sensible and modestly successful. When he was bold -- health care and welfare -- he failed. His artful parrying of Republican excesses preserved the safety net of welfare and Medicaid. Do no harm is not exciting. It looks pale next to the promises of his campaign. But the achievement is no less real.

HEADLINE: Mali's Democracy

 BODY:
While hardly anybody was watching, the people of Mali were burning some 3,000 firearms in a March ceremony meant to mark the end of a five-year conflict between Tuareg nomad rebels and the Malian Army. These "flames of peace" are a salutary augury for Africa, and a pointed reminder for Washington. Mali has moved without fanfare from 35 years of single-party rule and 23 years of military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy. This feat might be better known if a single high-level American official had troubled in recent years to visit Bamako, Mali's capital.
Much of the credit for these gains belongs to President Alpha Oumar Konare, the victor in Mali's first free elections, in 1992. "The single-party system was a total failure in all countries which practiced it," Mr. Konare recently declared. "The logic of 'shut up and obey' gives immediate results, but offers no tomorrow." He is careful to add that it will take years of calm, openness and rule of law to consolidate free government. 
 But under this 49-year-old historian, Mali, once a French colony, has made an impressive start. The former dictator, Gen. Moussa Traore, who was ousted in 1991, is being tried for the killing of 100 students during riots that year, but his execution is ruled out. "I hope that Moussa Traore and his friends will live as long as possible so that they may see democracy flourish in Mali," says Mr. Konare, who opposes capital punishment. A free press, unknown in Mali until restrictions were lifted in 1992, already flourishes as 20 newspapers supplant a state monopoly. Mali, parting company with most African countries, condemned Nigeria for its execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists.
All this is happening in one of the world's 20 poorest countries, sandy and landlocked, whose eight million inhabitants are dependent on the River Niger, which flows through the heart of Mali. But the country's economy is percolating, at a 6 percent growth rate, which is partly a result of privatization and other free-market reforms. This success was recognized by the International Monetary Fund, which recently approved a three-year $91 million loan to Mali.
What is needed along with the money is attention and recognition. Spotlighting Mali's turn to democracy, and its efforts to integrate Tuareg refugees, can powerfully bolster an innovative leadership. The people of Mali will obviously be the final arbiters of this promising experiment, but showing that the world cares can improve the odds. That is something Washington might keep in mind the next time a top Government official goes to Africa.

HEADLINE: A Very Small Computer's Big Numbers

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

DATELINE: CONCORD, Mass.

 BODY:
It might seem to take hubris to enter a new technology market and compete against the likes of Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sharp Electronics and Motorola. But with little fanfare, Psion P.L.C., a company based in London that specializes in hand-held computers, has grabbed a lead in the $1 billion worldwide market for these $200-to-$600 electronic organizers in the last few years.
Now Psion is pushing its way into the American market. In little more than a year, Psion has more than doubled the number of American retail stores selling its computers, to 2,800 from 1,200. 
 On Saturday, Psion began a $6 million advertising campaign, and it has dispatched a small army of sales support people to large retailers like Circuit City and Nobody Beats the Wiz.
"The word-of-mouth is terrific," said Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, a consulting firm in New York. "They make a great product, which is what drives this market. They've gotten good reviews in the trade press, and they don't get many returns."
Unlike its main competitors, Psion makes nothing but hand-held computers and has spent 15 years refining its software and hardware designs, starting with the first electronic organizers.
"We're purely focused on these devices," said David Potter, Psion's founder and chairman. "We don't have to think about microwave ovens or fax machines. We have more resources focused on this area than even our biggest competitors, like Hewlett-Packard or Sharp."
The machines start with $69 electronic address books and run up to palm-sized computers that sell for more than $1,000. The challenge facing Psion and its rivals is to persuade people to abandon their date books for something that costs more and has the potential to wipe out a lifetime of phone numbers if a battery dies.
Forrester Research, a technology research company in Cambridge, Mass., says Psion holds nearly 33 percent of the worldwide organizer market, just ahead of Hewlett-Packard's 200LX and brand new Omnigo, and far ahead of Sharp's Wizard and Zaurus and Apple Computer's Newton. Psion sales rose 48 percent in 1995, to $140 million, and profits increased 78 percent, to $18 million. And on the London Stock Exchange, the company's shares have more than tripled in the last year, closing on Friday at 1,095 pence.
Psion's presence in the United States remains small -- just under 20 percent of its sales are here -- but as the market for such organizers, known as personal digital assistants, or P.D.A.'s, searches for an identity, Psion has the opportunity to grab market share based on its reputation. Psion has 9 percent of the United States market, according to Forrester Research, trailing Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Sharp.
Despite its success, Psion faces a track filled with hurdles, not the least of which is competing in a market that remains ill-defined and fragmented. John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research, said that early promises of sales rivaling those of PC's had failed to materialize.
"The upscale end of the P.D.A. market hasn't found a true reason for existence yet," he said. Mr. Robb noted that only 500,000 such devices were sold in 1995 worldwide, and though the market is growing by 40 percent annually, it is not likely to become a significant sector until the organizers can be used for effective and cheap access to electronic mail and the Internet.
To that end, Psion has just introduced Psimail, a software package that allows users to connect to popular electronic mail packages through a cable and modem connection. But electronic mail access may not be enough. Motorola, for example, sells the Envoy, which offers a pen-like device to give commands and a wireless radio modem for transmitting and receiving E-mail and files. The Envoy sells for about $1,000 and requires another $50 to $100 a month in phone charges to operate. Sales have been disappointing.
Despite the setbacks, there is no shortage of companies seeking to enter the competition. A new P.D.A. called the Pilot One-Touch Organizer from U.S. Robotics, for example, has already attracted attention. The $299 device, shipped this month, offers connections to desktop computers, allowing files to be transferred easily between the two.
Mitchell Kertzman, the senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at Sybase Inc. and a gadget lover, said the Psion was "the best-designed and most integrated" of the organizers on the market. And he owns many of them.
Though 70 percent of Psion's sales are in Europe, the company's marketing director, Peter Norman, said Psion was focused on the United States for its growth. The company has set up an American headquarters here in this suburb west of Boston.
In the United States, 35 percent of Psion's sales are going to corporate and industrial customers like Chrysler, Allied Signal, Dunkin' Donuts and American Airlines, for customized applications like inventory control, route accounting and asset management.
To Europeans, Psion is no upstart. The company was founded in 1980 by Mr. Potter, a former computational physics professor. Mr. Potter had written software, including a successful flight simulator for one of the world's earliest personal computers, a machine made by Sinclair.
Psion actually created the electronic organizer market and gave the category its name when it introduced the $150 Organiser II in 1984.
The latest models are powerful computers with many of the capabilities of a far more expensive laptop or desktop system. The tiny computer has a 16-bit operating system that can run many applications simultaneously, plus two megabytes of random access memory, which can be increased to 10 megabytes, and a liquid-crystal-display screen.
Psion has sold more than two million of its products, including 750,000 of its current high-end $399 Series 3a models, a notable success in a market known mainly for the disappointment of the Apple Newton.
The Psion Series 3a machine employs a small but reasonably efficient keyboard. Normal touch typing is difficult, but two-fingered typing, often using the thumbs, can be mastered.
"I was tired of carrying a Daytimer and a laptop on business trips," said Norma Spreeman, who works for a San Francisco architectural company and bought a Psion six months ago. "I can download pretty much everything I need onto the Psion and work from that."
She did take issue with the machine's design, which she said she found less than user-friendly. If anything, it is too complex, with countless features and a daunting 300-page manual that has turned off more than a few users. "It gets frustrating because I don't have the time to try to learn all these features," Ms. Spreeman said.
As Psion raises its profile in the United States, the competitor that causes most alarm, Mr. Potter said, is Microsoft, which he said had a development group with more than 200 people writing software applications for palmtop computers. "It will be the software that really drives this market," he said, "and Microsoft has the resources to be a key player in this segment."
A spokesman for Microsoft acknowledged that the company was investigating the organizer market but declined to provide details.

HEADLINE: Xerox Is Offering a New Category of Color Printer

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Hoping to find a color-printing niche with machines that sell for about $200,000 each, the Xerox Corporation has introduced its Docu-color printer, which can transform electronic files into full color pages at a rate of 40 sheets a minute.
That is far faster than the color copiers on the market, which print six or seven pages a minute -- though some of these are far cheaper, selling for less than $50,000. 
 For the most demanding color-printing customers, even faster machines with better quality are available in the $350,000 to $400,000 price range. The AM DCP-1, Agfa Chromapress and IBM 3170, all of which use a print engine made by Xeikon of Belgium, and the Indigo E-Print 1000 each print up to 70 pages a minute.
"A lot of print shops who can't handle the price of an Indigo or a Xeikon machine are going to have to look seriously at these new machines," said Charles A. Pesko Jr. managing director of CAP Ventures in Marshfield, Mass., a printing industry consultant. "They are a new class of production between the color copiers and the Xeikon/Indigo machines, and they will probably displace multiple copiers in many shops."
The Docucolor, introduced last week, is based on a print engine developed by Xerox's Japanese affiliate, Fuji Xerox, and can be equipped with electronic front ends developed by Scitex, Electronics for Imaging and Colorbus for networked operations. Scitex, a specialist in prepress equipment, is already selling a similar machine called the Spontane. Scitex, an Israeli company, rejected an $856 million hostile offer made by an Israeli-American deal maker about a month ago.
Xerox invented the electronic- printing business in 1990, when it introduced the Docutech, a machine capable of accepting electronic files over networks and then printing them out at a rate of 135 pages a minute.
That machine, and the competitors that followed, changed the rules of printing. Since the base data was stored and transmitted in electronic form, only as many paper copies as were needed immediately had to be printed, eliminating long press runs and warehouses to hold excess copies. The operating principle has changed from print and distribute to distribute and print.
The machine has been a huge success for Xerox, with more than 10,000 of them, at $260,000 each, already installed. Whole new businesses, like providing custom anthologies for college courses, have developed.
Since then, many who follow the printing industry have wondered when the company would develop a color Docutech. Last week, the company got about a third of the way there, in terms of speed.
"They are playing a game of price and performance, and will probably fit well in niche markets," said Frank J. Romano, a professor of printing at the Rochester Institute of Technology. "But it will not be another Docutech. This machine existed for two years before Xerox decided to market it."
Professor Romano said that Xerox had been trying unsuccessfully to get Xeikon to supply it with print engines and had also sued the company, accusing it of patent infringment.
Some analysts say the Docucolor could give Xerox a nice boost in profit, both from the sales of the machines and the supplies needed to keep them operating.
"We believe that Xerox could place as many as 1,000 Docucolor machines within the next 12 months and more than 5,000 by the end of the decade," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, in a report last week. "Early users are likely to include quick printers, in-plant operations and low-end commercial printers."
Conventional offset printing will always be cheaper for documents printed in large quantities, usually defined as 5,000 copies or more. But because conventional technology requires considerable setup expense, many color documents that are needed only in small quantities are never printed, industry experts say.
One reason the Docucolor is faster than color copiers is that the paper shoots straight through the machine, rather than having to make four turns around the imaging drum to put down the colors cyan, magenta, yellow and black. An imaging belt, rather than a drum, runs under four separate toner heads to apply the elements of an image in one pass.
If a page is to be printed on both sides, it must travel a reverse path through the machine, be inverted, and then head down the belt once again.
With color more easily available, many documents now printed in black and white are expected to add color. Mr. Rosenzweig anticipated that the color machines would be used alongside Docutech-type printers to provide full-color inserts and covers for large black-and-white documents.
Mr. Pesko estimates that the market for short-run color printing will amount to $12 billion a year by the end of the century.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Bets on a Niche"
Xerox is introducing a color copier and printer aimed at midsized firms. When its predecessor, the black-and-white Docutech Publisher, was introduced in 1990, it created an $8 billion instant printing industry.
 
COST At about $200,000, the price of the Docucolor 40 is half that of some current high-quality color printers.
 
SPEED It prints 40 pages a minute, compared with 7 a minute for color copiers and 70 for more expensive machines.
 
WHY IT'S CHEAPER
The resolution on the Docucolor 40 is 400 by 400 dots per inch; more expensive models have resolutions of 800 by 800 d.p.i. The Docucolor won't perfectly duplicate the tonal range of complex artwork.
 
WHY IT'S FASTER
The printer lays down the four colors necessary for full-color printing in one pass of the paper instead of four.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Same-Sex Marriage Nears

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: MAUI, Hawaii

 BODY:
As the legislative session headed toward a midnight close Friday night, opponents of homosexual marriage insisted on a recorded vote. Supporters of gay rights won. Hawaii's state senators voted 15 to 10 against the more conservative House's bill to ban the licensing of marital unions of persons of the same sex.
As a result, the state's lawyers will find it harder to assert a "compelling state interest" in limiting marriage to one man and one woman. Baehr v. State of Hawaii comes before Judge Kevin Chang in August; the likelihood increases that he will rule that the state Constitution's provision against sex discrimination precludes the state from refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. 
 No longer can defenders of one-man, one-woman marriage claim that the institution is being threatened by hyperactivist judges. One state's duly elected representatives have just paved the way, and under the U.S. Constitution's "full faith and credit" clause, a judicial proceeding held in one state is to be honored in all states.
Nor is the movement limited to the United States. In The Hague last week, a majority of the Dutch parliament called on the Government to submit legislation permitting homosexual marriage. That would affect all members of the European Union; British gays could marry in Amsterdam and claim spousal status in London.
The Hawaii solons, in a tense conference just before the deadline, considered a compromise. Homosexuals in contracted "domestic partnerships" were not to be denied pension or insurance benefits or inheritance or other state tax deductions available to spouses, thereby assuring fairness as taxpayers and equal treatment as employees -- but not including a state of matrimony. The compromise, which might have affected the outcome of the court case, failed. That was unfortunate because that is the way this issue should be resolved.
Libertarians like me have a tough time with same-sex marriage because we despise discrimination, cherish privacy and reject homophobia. When we express reluctance to rush to make a fundamental change in the legal and religious definition of a family, editorialists assail "entrenched anti-gay bigotry" and shrilly accuse all who fail to embrace S.S.M. of being "driven by social intolerance." Such straight-bashing neither contributes to civil discourse nor persuades us we are morally obtuse.
To the heart of the matter: Why break the age-old pattern of defining marriage as the union of one man, one woman? Or, to slant the question the other way: Why should heterosexuals have a lock on wedlock?
Serious arguments presented by supporters of same-sex marriage have force: In times of casual cohabitation, marriage would encourage homosexual couples to stay together and build stable, mutually supportive lives. Moreover, when so many children need loving parents, society's sanction of marriage would make adoption much easier, though not everyone agrees that gay adoptive parents would not influence the sexual orientation of a child.
Religion aside, the state's interest in marriage is to create a unit for mutual care and the bearing and rearing of children. Tax and inheritance incentives have long been offered to bolster these "family values," which are under great strain, and nothing should be done now to further weaken the traditional family.
Underlying this disagreement, and giving the debate its bitterness, is the belief that what is at stake is not just tax and pension fairness (in the works for domestic partners who take contractual vows) but the reach for unequivocal social and theological approbation. Gays understandably want not just equal economic treatment but equal moral status; most Americans are not ready to go beyond toleration to active approval. That division is not in dispute.
Will S.S.M. be a political issue? Hawaii, dominated by Democrats, has shown it already is. In the national campaign, Republicans will oppose gay marriage, perhaps in a platform plank; if Bill Clinton ever holds a press conference and is asked about this, he can be expected to straddle, saying he "personally" opposes same-gender legal liaison, but it is a state issue and he's for states' rights.
The nation and its gay minority would be best served by the compromise Hawaii just scorned.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Governor, Due in U.S., Is Warily Bullish

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 28

 BODY:
As Christopher Patten prepares to begin his final year as the territory's last Governor, he will visit the United States this week both to trumpet Hong Kong's successes and future and to outline his concerns about China's takeover of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
The Governor will visit the United States in part to campaign for renewal of China's trade privileges, the so-called most-favored-nation status. The visit comes amidst a vitriolic barrage against him from China and in the wake of public demonstrations against China's plans for Hong Kong, which include the abolition not only of its elected legislature, but also of locally elected boards and councils. 
 "I'm still pretty bullish about Hong Kong," the Governor said in an interview in his sparely furnished office. "But it's because I'm confident about the economy and because I think the values that Hong Kong has espoused are the values of the future, both here and the rest of Asia."
But Mr. Patten lashed out at a storm of Chinese pronouncements about Hong Kong, particularly a recent warning from China's de facto ambassador here, Zhou Nan, that Hong Kong must not become "a center for political struggle." Many understood Mr. Zhou's comments as a barely veiled threat against Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which is committed to universal suffrage here.
Mr. Patten, who introduced sweeping democratic reforms of Hong Kong's legislature culminating in the mostly popularly elected body that was sworn in last September, sarcastically dismissed the idea that democracy and political activity were inappropriate for Hong Kong.
"The politics isn't some optional add-on and, as Zhou Nan suggests, something the departing British colonial oppressors are imposing on the patriotic people of Hong Kong," he said. "The politics is both intimately related to Hong Kong's economic success and just part of the fabric of this place as a decent and civilized society."
During the last month, China's officials have denounced Hong Kong's Legislature and popular demands for electoral freedom, statements that have provoked jitters across the territory. When the Chinese Government tried, two weeks ago, to hold public hearings on its plans for Hong Kong, it excluded many hoping to present their views.
Beijing's penchant for secrecy and its discomfort with open government have fueled worries among Hong Kong's professional civil servants, who are still unsure about China's intentions toward them. And there is widespread concern about the preservation of Hong Kong's laws, as well as unease that China's endemic corruption will seep over the border.
Mr. Patten said that only by insuring Hong Kong's autonomy, which China has promised for the first 50 years after the takeover, could those worries be assuaged.
"Hong Kong has been given substantial promises of continuing economic liberty in the future and liberty in all other areas with the exception of foreign affairs and defense -- I don't think there are senior leaders in Beijing who take exception to that," the Governor said. "But on the other hand, I think there are people further down in the bureaucracy who, unless they are dealt with pretty firmly, will try to get their hands on bits of the silverware in Hong Kong."
One guarantee of Hong Kong's continued vibrancy, Mr. Patten said, will be the renewal of China's most-favored-nation status. "It is important to separate trade and politics," he said. "If Hong Kong can continue to act as China's economically free-standing bridge to the world, it's going to be easier to deal with China over the next few years."
Hong Kong's economy is now integrally tied to China's, with more than 60 percent of foreign investment in China emanating from the territory. Indeed, the Government here estimates that failure to renew China's most-favored-nation status would cut growth in the territory's gross domestic product by half and eliminate 90,000 jobs.
Yet, Mr. Patten said, even as he campaigned for most-favored-nation renewal, he would not shrink from discussing the problems facing Hong Kong.
"Does it carry credibility for the Governor of Hong Kong or somebody in my position to stand up and tell the world, 'There ain't no problems'?" he asked. "No. But I think there is enough momentum in this city beyond economic success for it to continue."

HEADLINE: New Pact for Kazak-Russian Oil Pipeline

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 28

 BODY:
Moving to tap the vast oil resources near the Caspian Sea, Russia, Kazakstan and Oman have agreed on a new accord to build a major oil pipeline.
Seeking to overcome longstanding financial disputes, the accord sets terms for a pipeline to connect Kazakstan's rich Tengiz oilfield to a Russian port on the Black Sea. 
 Eight Western, Russian and Kazak oil companies are to be involved in the project, which is expected to cost at least $1.2 billion.
"For a long time we did not agree on redistributing shares in the consortium," President Boris N. Yeltsin said on Saturday, during a visit to Almaty, the Kazak capital, on his way back from a trip to China. But now, he said, "all questions have been solved."
President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakstan called the accord a "historic economic agreement" and predicted optimistically that the project would be completed within two and a half years.
Still, Russia has previously given its blessing to pipeline projects only to raise technical obstacles later.
And much of the financing, which is to be arranged by the oil companies, will not be provided until after the Russian presidential election in June. That election has clouded the economic picture. The Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, still holds a slim lead over Mr. Yeltsin in most opinion polls.
But the Russian stock market recently bounced back, after a long decline, because of opinion polls showing that Mr. Yeltsin has been closing the gap and reports that the rebel leader of Chechnya, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, has been killed.
Foreign and Russian business executives are wary of the Communists, who have sounded nationalist themes even as they have insisted that foreign investment would be welcome.
On Friday, some of Russia's most important businessmen issued an appeal, warning that Russia was so polarized politically that the nation could be in for a new round of "violence and discord," regardless of who wins the election. The appeal urged that a new compromise platform be forged.
Even without such election-year complications, the Tengiz pipeline has had a long and tangled history.
Under a 1993 accord, the Chevron Corporation has a $10 billion contract to develop the Tengiz field, which has six billion barrels of proven crude reserves. But there were bitter disputes over the construction of the pipeline, including one with the Oman Oil Company, which is owned by the Omani Government.
Along with Russia and Kazakstan, Oman was part of the three-member consortium that sought to build and manage the pipeline.
There was a lot at stake: profits for American companies and a greater political independence from Moscow for Kazakstan.
In an effort to break the stalemate, Kazakstan and Chevron sought to assemble a broader coalition, including American, Russian and Italian oil companies.
During Mr. Yeltsin's visit to Almaty, a protocol was signed by the consortium's board, formalizing a new arrangement and redistributing the shares.
Under the accord, Russia, Kazakstan and Oman will no longer own the entire consortium. Their collective share will be 50 percent.
Specifically, Russia's share will be 24 percent. Kazakhstan will have 19 percent, and Oman's share will be 7 percent, though the Interfax news agency in Russia said Oman might consider selling its share to other participants.
Eight oil companies will control the other half of the consortium. They will also be responsible for financing the project, which is expected to cost more than $1 billion.
Under the new accord, Chevron will own 15 percent. Lukoil, the largest Russian oil company, will own 12.5 percent.
Other owners include the Mobil Corporation (7.5 percent), Rosneft of Russia (7.5 percent), British Gas (2 percent), AGIP of Italy (2 percent), the Dallas-based Oryx Energy Company (1.75 percent) and Munaigaz of Kazakstan (1.75 percent).
The pipeline will be operated by the Transneft oil transportation company of Russia.
"The project has been stalled for many months," said one Western oil official. "If the consortium has the will to finish it, it is a breakthrough."

HEADLINE: For Union Chief, Tough Challenges

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
From the way he used to rail against "the tired old men" of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the way he once backed Jesse Jackson for President, Jan Pierce always seemed to relish a good fight.
But now Mr. Pierce, who heads the Communications Workers of America in New York and New England, finds himself in the middle of two fights that he wished had never erupted. 
 If he loses the first battle, in leading the union charge to stop the merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, consumer and labor groups fear that it could have big and negative consequences for customers and workers in the Northeast. And if he loses the second battle, one in which a challenger hopes to oust him as head of the region's communications workers' union, political leaders worry that it could alter union and Democratic politics in the region by removing one of the labor movement's most outspoken and liberal leaders.
In political and labor circles, the campaign to defeat Mr. Pierce is being closely watched because he has been such a spark plug in supporting strikers in other cities and in campaigning for Mario M. Cuomo, David N. Dinkins and dozens of other Democrats. And many Democrats are deeply worried that this 58-year-old union leader who poured oceans of manpower and money into their campaigns could be defeated.
"He's an articulate spokesman for social, political and economic justice," Mr. Dinkins, the former Mayor, said. "I think the world of him. If he leaves the scene, it will be a hell of a loss."
The thin, intense Mr. Pierce has been such a force in Democratic politics that last month a who's who of New York Democrats, including Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Jackson, Bella S. Abzug and a dozen members of Congress, attended a dinner to celebrate his 40 years in the labor movement.
"He is surely one of the most notable political activists among union people," Mr. Cuomo, the former Governor, said. "There are not a lot of them left. There is something invigorating about his kind of commitment."
As leader of 120,000-member District 1 of the communications workers union, Mr. Pierce represents 40,000 Nynex workers, more than 40,000 New Jersey government workers, about 8,000 New York City municipal workers, and thousands of nursing home and cable television employees. The C.W.A.'s reach will soon extend to reporters, editors and other newspaper workers when a merger with the Newspaper Guild takes effect next year.
In battling the proposed Nynex-Bell Atlantic merger, Mr. Pierce is using the strengths that have distinguished him as a labor leader -- a lofty moral tone that seems to sway audiences, a 1930's-type knack for rallying people and an ability to attack enemies on several fronts at once. He has teamed up with consumer groups to assert that the merger of the two regional telephone giants will reduce competition, push up prices and hurt service. He is also spearheading efforts to persuade the public service commissions in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and nine other states to block the merger.
"The merger is bad for consumers and for workers," he said. "If you look at the history of breakups and mergers in telecommunications since 1984, you see that service quality has suffered tremendously, and it has not resulted in lower telephone bills. Furthermore, the communications workers have lost 15,000 members from AT&T and the Baby Bells."
The two companies say 3,000 employees, none of them union members, will lose jobs as a result of the merger. But Mr. Pierce contends that the companies are underestimating the numbers to minimize public dismay and union opposition.
"If this merger isn't blocked, then five years after the deal is completed, we could be looking at the loss of 20,000 to 25,000 jobs," he said.
The two companies also assert that such large layoffs are not envisioned and that the merger will improve their efficiency and thus hold down telephone service costs for consumers.
Some of Mr. Pierce's detractors say he is mounting his anti-merger crusade in large part to aid his re-election campaign. Some union members say they oppose Mr. Pierce because he is too far to the left and has created tensions in the union by isolating aides who disagree with him. They also complain that he usually consults with just a close-knit circle of advisers, ignoring most local presidents under him on important decisions like negotiating strategy.
"He talks like he's for the people, but he runs union affairs like a dictatorship," said John Alphonse, president of a C.W.A. local in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
Mr. Pierce responds that in his 11 years as head of District 1, he has repeatedly crisscrossed the Northeast to meet and consult with dozens of local union officials.
Mr. Pierce suggests that there is one powerful force behind the campaign to unseat him: Morton Bahr, president of the parent communications workers union. According to Mr. Pierce, his longtime mentor, Mr. Bahr, has turned on him and put up a candidate to oppose him in the June election because his positions have often diverged from Mr. Bahr's. Mr. Bahr did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
Mr. Pierce's opponent, Larry Mancino, denies that Mr. Bahr persuaded him to run. He said he had decided to seek the post because there had been grumbling about Mr. Pierce's leadership, adding that he would have a more inclusive administration.
Mr. Pierce was elected to his current post in 1985 when Mr. Bahr handpicked him as his successor. At that time, Mr. Bahr moved to Washington to become president of the 600,000-member international union.
Sounding like a son trying to escape from his father's shadow, Mr. Pierce said: "I don't know if he was able to accept me as a leader in my own right. I don't know if he wanted me to be subordinate my whole life. I couldn't accept that."
The two men were so close that when Mr. Bahr asked Mr. Pierce to move from Buffalo to New York City in 1973 to become his assistant, Mr. Bahr found an apartment for Mr. Pierce in Manorhaven on Long Island, just a few miles from Mr. Bahr's home. For a dozen years, the two commuted together each day on the Long Island Rail Road.
They have moved steadily apart since 1985. Mr. Pierce angered the less confrontational Mr. Bahr by adopting a strategy of pressuring Federal and state regulatory agencies as a way of gaining leverage over Nynex during contract talks. This strategy hit the jackpot in 1994 -- and won praise from union leaders nationwide -- when Nynex promised its 40,000 unionized workers four years of job security in exchange for Mr. Pierce's pledge to stop opposing Nynex's request for a rate increase.
While Mr. Pierce has vowed to use every ounce of his energy to block the Nynex-Bell Atlantic merger, Mr. Bahr has been extremely cautious, saying the union has "serious concerns" about the deal and needs more information.
Mr. Pierce's opponent, Mr. Mancino, used to be his top assistant in New York but has worked in recent years as one of Mr. Bahr's top aides.
"I've been asked by an overwhelming number of locals to run," Mr. Mancino said. "This came about as the result of a grass-roots effort."
Supporters and opponents alike of Mr. Pierce say he alienated Mr. Bahr by expressing views without caring whether they offended the union president. He also upset Mr. Bahr by supporting Mr. Jackson over Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 Presidential race and by berating the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy before John J. Sweeney became president.
Some union officials say Mr. Pierce's declaration of independence was part of a plan to someday challenge Mr. Bahr as C.W.A. president -- something Mr. Pierce denies.
Union delegates will choose whether to keep Mr. Pierce at a convention on June 11, with both candidates expressing confidence that they will win. If Mr. Pierce loses, some union members say, the reason will be that he failed to do the political work needed inside his union even as he did plenty of political work outside.

The 33-million-member association, best known as a lobbying group for the elderly, is already a big player in the insurance business, endorsing selected auto and homeowners policies, and insurance that pays medical bills not covered by Medicare. In return, it receives substantial revenue from royalties and related income -- $146 million in 1994, which provided 38 percent of its budget. 
 The association said it would deal only with health organizations that met its standards on financial stability, commitment to quality, price and popularity with current members. A consulting firm, Health Benefits America, is screening hundreds of H.M.O.'s for the association. Among other criteria, the association will use standards that are being developed by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, a nonprofit group sponsored by managed-care companies and employers.
The association will seek formal bids late in June or early in July, with the aim of entering into marketing contracts with one or more health organizations in each of 15 or 16 regional markets.
"Our name and logo would be associated with it," said Wayne Haefer, membership director of the association. The group will keep the health maintenance organizations under continuous review, he said, backed by the right to drop any that fail to measure up.
For H.M.O.'s, the prospect of winning the association's endorsement is a mouth-watering opportunity. In a single stroke, they would gain access to a national brand name and to millions of potential customers, and benefit from the association's marketing prowess. The association will promote the health care organizations in mailings; in its national magazine, Modern Maturity, and other publications. And it will provide the H.M.O.'s with lists of its members and advice on "how to talk with people of this age and needs," Mr. Haefer said.
The Federal Government and dozens of big companies with rosters of retirees are already promoting health maintenance organizations as a way of controlling the costs of health care for the elderly; Medicare H.M.O.'s are among the fastest-growing types of managed care.
But the push into managed care is fraught with risk for the nation's biggest membership association. A.A.R.P. will be lending its name to businesses that at times limit or even refuse medical services, instead of just making sure that claims are paid. That could create a backlash in a constituency that has generally looked upon the association as a vigorous advocate for its interests.
Putting the group's seal of approval on particular health organizations could "raise questions about their ability to maintain their credibility as a neutral broker," said Bruce Vladeck, chief administrator of the Federal Medicare program.
"Getting into that business is high-risk stuff," said Marilyn Moon, a researcher in the economics of Medicare at the Urban Institute in Washington. "If some of these guys turn out to be bad actors, it will have an impact -- as it should -- on whoever endorses them."
Among the big companies offering managed care, spokesmen for Cigna, Kaiser Permanente, Humana, Prudential Life Insurance, U.S. Health Care and the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said they were interested. In several states, notably California and Florida, Medicare payment formulas generate high profits for health organizations.
"It's very exciting," said Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a trade group in Washington. "Interest is very high around the country."
For its part, A.A.R.P. has little choice but to embrace managed care if it wishes to keep its important role in the health insurance business, industry experts said. It collected $101.7 million in 1994 from its arrangement with Prudential to market so-called Medigap policies and other health coverage to its members, and an additional $17.7 million in interest income.
Adding $25 million collected from the ITT Hartford Group on auto and homeowners policies and $1.7 million from other insurance sources, the group's revenue from insurance that year -- $146.1 million -- was slightly greater than that from membership dues, $145.7 million.
But recently, the association has been losing customers to the Medicare H.M.O.'s, which provide full coverage to elderly Americans, and to other Medigap insurers that offer lower rates to younger, healthier customers. Because some insurance companies charge higher premiums to discourage older, illness-prone Medigap applicants, the association -- which charges the same for all ages and says that it will continue doing so -- has become an insurer of last resort. Its total of 3.2 million policyholders has not changed much in the last few years, though their average age has gone up.
With costs rising, Prudential's premium revenue from Medigap and other health care coverage for the association's members fell $100 million last year, to $3.4 billion, according to A. M. Best, the insurance-industry research firm. Prudential recently raised Medigap premium rates by 30 percent.
"The association is losing its membership right now to H.M.O.'s," said Clifton F. Crawford, a vice president of Medicare marketing for Cigna. "They want to cut a deal before it all dwindles away."
The association's decision to embrace managed-care plans for the elderly is likely to spur the surging growth of Medicare H.M.O.'s just as the baby-boom generation is beginning to turn 50, the minimum age for joining A.A.R.P. And experts on the elderly say consumers are likely to benefit from A.A.R.P.'s involvement in managed care.
The association could "mediate and protect consumers and let them know what is going on," said James Firman, president of the National Council on the Aging, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.
Mr. Vladeck, the Medicare chief, agreed. "There is a desperate, overwhelming need for better consumer information about the choices between fee-for-service medicine and managed care, and among managed-care health plans," he said.
Still, some patient advocates question how well the association -- or anyone else -- can appraise the quality of H.M.O.'s, given the relative sparseness of objective, long-term research. "We have absolutely no idea how well they are caring for people who are really sick," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Beneficiaries Fund, an advocacy group in New York.
The association plans to endorse managed-care plans for both its younger and older members; the membership is about evenly divided between people 65 or older and those who are 50 to 64. It will do so with the knowledge that employers typically make the choices among health plans for younger, working people, as noted by Tom Elkin, a consultant based in Sacramento, Calif.
Executives at several of the 63 Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations said privately they were concerned about the risk of dividing the enormous A.A.R.P. membership by age, saying that could drive costs even higher for people in their mid-70's and older, who often avoid managed care and stick with their family doctor.
Mr. Haefer said the association looked hard at the trends toward managed health care as Congress and the White House debated proposals to deal with rising Medicare costs. "Our members want a choice," he said. "We are not looking to force people into a particular type of managed-care product."

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday with a front-page article about plans of the American Association of Retired Persons to license its name to health maintenance organizations misstated the organization's 1994 revenue from insurance fees and related interest income. It was $146.1 million, not $164.9 million.

HEADLINE: Antiterrorism Law Gives Immigrants No Second Chances

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your April 25 news article on President Clinton's signing of the antiterrorism bill: 
 In the name of combating terrorism, the nation's politicians have passed thinly veiled anti-immigrant legislation, pandering to an electorate they perceive as disenchanted with the presence of "aliens" in our midst. While highlighting self-righteous displays of supposed antiterrorist bipartisan solidarity, the reporting of President Clinton's signing of the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 failed to disclose the bill's mean-spirited anti-immigration provisions.
The law eradicates significant relief against deportation, which was previously available to non-United States citizens. For example, before the effective date of one provision of the new law, the Immigration and Nationality Act permitted a long-term lawful permanent resident of the United States to have certain crime-related grounds of deportability waived, if it was demonstrated that there existed compelling reasons for an immigration judge to so order. Such relief was granted only after a demonstration of extraordinary equities and compelling arguments against the applicant's deportation.
Countless Americans born in the United States have reaped the benefits of receiving a second chance, to redeem themselves in the eyes of the public and the law.
Not to permit a long-term lawful resident of the United States to avail himself of that same opportunity, the only difference being national origin, is nothing more than xenophobia.
Another unfortunate provision of the bill prevents a person who entered the United States without inspection to apply for another form of discretionary relief known as suspension of deportation.
Under the new law, a person who has built up a thriving business, employed many American citizens, paid taxes and has been a vital contributor to his community and to the American economy, whose only failing is having entered without a visa, is no longer prima facie eligible for such relief. No matter how valuable an asset to this country such a person proves himself to be, he will not get his day in court under the law.
A particularly punitive aspect of the new law is its summary exclusion provision, which severely limits certain asylum seekers' access to adjudication of their claims of fear of persecution. People who fear persecution do not arrive at our nation's airports with fully developed and documented claims for political asylum, complete with letters from their oppressors.
Our politicians are certainly courageous in enacting legislation that curtails the rights of those least able to defend themselves and least likely to finance an electoral campaign.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Absence of Buying by Japan Weakens Dollar Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday, hurt by speculation that the Bank of Japan might soon raise interest rates.
The dollar was also weakened as currency traders took advantage of a national holiday in Japan to sell dollars, believing the Bank of Japan would not intervene to support the dollar against the yen. While Japanese markets were closed yesterday for the holiday, Greenery Day, the Bank of Japan might have left orders with other central banks to buy dollars for yen on its behalf. But such orders did not materialize in the market. 
On Friday, the Japanese central bank bought an estimated $200 million to $500 million for yen, traders said.
"By its absence, the Bank of Japan created a very negative sentiment for the dollar," said Thomas Lapinski, chief dealer at MTB Bank.
The dollar has been weak against the yen since Friday, when a Japanese newspaper reported that the central bank would soon push interest rates up.
Although the report was denied by Bank of Japan officials, the yen rally has not lost any steam. Higher rates would bolster the value of the yen by making deposits denominated in the Japanese currency more attractive.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 104.67 yen, down from 105.55 yen on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.5265 marks from 1.5284 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5069 from $1.5130.
Despite two days of declines, many currency traders and analysts remained bullish on the dollar.
"We would not regard this as any change in direction for the dollar," said John de Beer, who oversees $2 billion in foreign bonds at Loomis, Sayles & Company in Boston. "We still think the general trend for the dollar is up."
While Japan's bond yields and money-market rates have risen as the economy emerges from a four-year economic slowdown, it may be too early to bet on an increase in rates by the Bank of Japan, traders said.
The country's banking system remains under pressure from an estimated $400 billion of bad loans, and several false starts by the economy in the last three years should make the central bank cautious about raising rates, traders said.

It's account decision time for a number of companies both big and small.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ADVERTISERS old and new, big and small -- including Coca-Cola, Sears, Novell and Wired magazine -- have made decisions involving accounts.
The Coca-Cola Company has assigned creative responsibilities for its Cherry Coke soft-drink brand to Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C. The brand had been without an agency since Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., resigned in late May after being acquired by the Omnicom Group, which owns shops that handle soft-drink, fast-food and snack-food accounts for Coca-Cola's principal rival, Pepsico Inc. 
 Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report about Cherry Coke this week in Adweek; billings were not disclosed. Plans for Diet Cherry Coke, which Chiat/Day had also handled, have not been determined, Mr. Bertini said yesterday.
Cherry Coke is the second Coca-Cola assignment for Freeman, which is known for humorous campaigns for clients like Little Caesars pizza and the Staples chain of office-supply stores. Freeman was awarded a Coca-Cola project in October, which Adweek reported involved advertising for two-liter plastic contoured bottles.
The additional work from Coca-Cola may have been what Freeman alluded to last week in announcing that "new assignments and current client business" required a withdrawal from a review being conducted by Driver's Mart Worldwide Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich., a new company owned by a group of auto dealers that plans to open a national chain of used-car stores this year.
As a result, Driver's Mart has restored to its review Warwick Baker & Fiore in New York, a semifinalist that had been eliminated. Warwick Baker will compete against two finalists based in Minneapolis: Campbell Mithun Esty, owned by top managers and the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Carmichael Lynch.
The Driver's Mart billings were estimated at $75 million in the first three years of operations. Tom Shaver, a senior partner at J. D. Power & Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif., which is managing the review, said a decision was expected in mid-May.
In addition to the Cherry Coke change, Coca-Cola awarded its consolidated national media planning account to D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York. The account had been divided among various agencies; though billings were not disclosed, trade publications estimated them at $350 million.
Mr. Bertini said D.M.B.& B., the worldwide creative agency for the Fanta soft-drink brand, was selected after a review that had been narrowed to that agency and another roster shop, the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago. Three others were eliminated earlier: Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, a unit of Interpublic; McCann-Erickson New York, the Interpublic unit that continues to handle national media buying for Coca-Cola, and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
In another media consolidation, Novell Inc., the software company in Orem, Utah, has consolidated the media portion of its account, with billings estimated at more than $50 million, at the San Francisco office of Young & Rubicam Inc. The media duties had been divided between the Martha Felt Group in Salt Lake City, for the United States, and Y.& R. San Francisco, for overseas.
Y.& R. San Francisco, which also handles Novell's worldwide creative account, was awarded its additional assignment without a review.
Turning to Sears, Roebuck & Company, the Chicago-based retailer has selected the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago to handle advertising aimed at black consumers, which had been handled by Vince Cullers Advertising in Chicago for the last 26 years. Billings were estimated at $4 million to $5 million. To work for Sears, Burrell will relinquish a similar assignment from the Kmart Corporation, which it had handled since 1991.
Burrell was awarded the Sears assignment after a review in which the other participants were not disclosed. Adweek listed them as Cullers, Equinox in Chicago, the Mingo Group in New York and the Uniworld Group in New York.
Teresa Fearon, a spokeswoman for Kmart in Troy, Mich., said the assignment that had been handled by Burrell, with billings that were not disclosed, would be placed in review. A decision is expected by early summer, she added.
As for Wired, the magazine has named Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York as the first agency to handle assignments like direct mail, direct response television and advertising on the World Wide Web. Billings have not been determined. Mad Dogs was selected by the Wired parent, Wired Ventures in San Francisco, without a formal review.
Finally, the Topps Company in New York, which markets trading cards, gum and candy, has begun a review for its account after Grey Advertising in New York resigned after two and a half years because, the agency said, Topps was redirecting advertising spending into promotions. Though billings were not disclosed, Advertising Age estimated spending at $2 million.
Marty Appel, a spokesman for Topps, said the company had hired Advice and Advisors in New York to manage the review.

Bond Prices End Lower in Dull Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell in dull trading yesterday, despite a report that showed rising interest rates severely hampering housing sales.
While the report pointed to moderating economic growth, market participants remained concerned that data due to be released this weak would portray an economy growing much faster, with inflation accelerating. 
 By late afternoon prices had recouped some of their losses in thin activity, helped along to some extent by lower commodity prices, which eased some inflation fears.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 of a percentage point, to 89 3/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.79 percent on Friday.
Interest rates at yesterday's regular weekly bill auction were slightly higher in what traders described as a mediocre auction, with only average investor interest. The rate for a three-month bill was 5 percent, up from 4.97 percent last week, while the average rate for a six-month security was 5.08 percent, up from 5.02 percent last week.
Bond prices fell even though the housing sales report was weaker than expected. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell 7.6 percent in March, to an annual rate of 672,000, much weaker than the revised 1.3 percent sales decline in February. It was the lowest rate for monthly sales since May of last year.
Analysts said the market's limited reaction to yesterday's weak housing report could have been caused by the results of a survey of the American Production and Inventory Control Society, which indicated that overall manufacturing activity picked up sharply in April from March. The housing decrease had also been largely expected since interest rates had headed higher since February.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A., a consulting firm, said that while the market was becoming more convinced that the economy's housing sector would slow, the market had yet to come to grips with the fact that the manufacturing could pick up.
"The economy is making a subtle shift in direction, but it will not be an explosion," he said. "However, it appears that the best of the inflation news is behind us, and of course the market is going to be concerned -- but it's nothing to panic about."
The market's focus this week will be on the April employment report, which will be released on Friday. Other likely market distractions this week include the Treasury's expected announcement tomorrow about the size of its next quarterly refunding.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: The Pro-Immigration Lobby

BYLINE: By Roy Beck; Roy Beck is author of "The Case Against Immigration."

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
The forces in favor of reducing legal as well as illegal immigration roared into Washington like a speeding train last year. The momentum appeared to be unstoppable. Polls showed that Americans overwhelmingly favored reductions in the number of legal migrants. Support came from a bipartisan reform commission led by the late Barbara Jordan, from President Clinton and from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who introduced bills to change the current policy, which brought in 720,000 legal immigrants last year.
But in the last month, both houses of Congress rejected or sidetracked these reductions. In the end, almost nobody was for them -- except the American people. 
 By contrast, Congress has managed to agree on some bars to illegal immigration. The Senate is expected to pass a bill this week that will beef up border enforcement and impose greater penalties on those who violate immigration law.
Puzzled Americans -- fewer than 6 percent of whom support current policies, according to a Roper poll released in February -- may wonder why Congress was able to take modest steps against illegal immigration but backed down from limiting the legal influx. People need look no further than the national organizations representing them.
Groups from across the spectrum -- business, labor, liberal Protestants, the religious right, Jews, Catholics, blacks, Hispanics, Republicans, Democrats -- have been on Capitol Hill supporting the current legal-immigration system. Few issues have created such a gap between the views of the people and the actions of their leaders -- who often go their own way when horse-trading in Washington.
Take business executives and professionals. The Roper poll found that they opposed the present high legal immigration levels by 11 to 1. But their leaders and trade groups like the National Association of Manufacturers have been as relentless in protecting the legal importation of foreign labor as the robber barons were a century ago. Well-connected executives -- representing everything from agribusiness to computer engineering -- flooded Washington to fight to maintain this loose labor market, which has helped depress wages for American workers for two decades.
The corporate lobby has been even more powerful than appears at first glance, as we saw after a key House vote on March 20. With a switch in only 28 votes, the House could have cut the continuing entry of citizens' adult relatives, the largest source of cheap foreign labor. But both Mr. Clinton and the Christian Coalition sent last-minute declarations of opposition to the cuts.
The reason for the President's reversal remains vague. But the Christian Coalition's action was widely attributed to pressure from Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, who brought together a network of conservative groups. His tax group's initially puzzling opposition became more understandable after the media disclosed that since February he has been a registered lobbyist for Microsoft, whose industry employs many immigrants.
And labor? The A.F.L.-C.I.O. legislative director, after meeting with immigrant labor leaders opposed to tighter rules on family reunification, joined the business lobby in urging Congress to defeat those provisions.
It was a strange way to represent laborers, native or foreign-born. Roper found that 58 percent of blue-collar workers want to cut the current level of legal and illegal immigrants to below a total of 100,000 a year. Only 2 percent of workers -- and 4 percent of all Hispanic people nationwide -- support today's level.
But group after group in Washington seems to deny that many of its grass-roots members feel that mass immigration has hurt their wages, environment, schools and the social fabric of their communities.
In fact, some members of Congress may be confused about what Americans want. Or perhaps lawmakers have decided that it is riskier to ignore lobbyists than to ignore voters.
In 1981, a bipartisan Federal commission on immigration warned that the public interest was being subverted by the lobbying of two groups -- conservative business interests and a liberal coalition of religious, immigrant and civil liberties organizations. The commission rejected arguments of those lobbyists about the need for high immigration levels.
Then, as now, Congress has listened to lobbyists more than public opinion. If Americans want a different immigration policy, they may need to challenge their own religious, economic and political organizations.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Fell 7.6% in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Rising interest rates bit substantially into sales of new homes in March, driving them down by 7.6 percent, to an annual rate of 672,000, the slowest since last May, the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development reported today.
As a result, the already-lofty inventories of unsold houses climbed to the highest point since 1980. 
 But while the pace last month was weaker than most analysts had expected, industry specialists took comfort in upward revisions for January and February and noted that even the March pace was brisker than the monthly average for 1994 and 1995.
"Sales remain relatively healthy," said Joseph Liro, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in New York. "We expect new-home sales to remain in a 650,000-to-700,000 range for the next several months."
The March decline for new homes was in sharp contrast to a report on Thursday that sales of previously owned homes jumped 6.9 percent during March, a rise attributed in part to buyers' taking advantage of relatively low mortgage rates.
The divergent results mainly reflected the fact that deals involving existing homes are tallied only when completed, while new houses are counted as sold as soon as contracts are signed. Since financing and other aspects of a deal usually take a couple of months to complete, the figures on new houses are considered a better indicator of current market activity.
Mortgage rates have risen rapidly, from an average 7.08 percent on 30-year conventional mortgages in February to 7.62 percent in March, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Increases continued in April, with last week's rate reaching 7.92 percent.
"The higher rates certainly kept home sales from being as high as in January and February, but sales are still pretty strong," said Eileen Neely, senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association. She predicted only a modest dampening of the market in coming months as renewed economic growth, while putting upward pressure on rates, also generated more jobs.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the Nesbitt Burns securities firm in Toronto, called today's figures "the first indications that the run-up in long-term interest rates is beginning to crimp housing."
In an unusual breach of security, the figures were released about five minutes prematurely when an inexperienced Census Bureau employee misread the clock and put the report on a Government electronic bulletin board before the 10 A.M. designated time, according to Jane Callen, a Government spokeswoman.
One organization that noticed was Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, which at 9:58 posted a notice about the data to its clients on the Internet.
Raymond Stone said in a telephone interview from his firm's offices in Princeton, N.J., that he detected no noticeable market reaction before the official release time and that his firm made no trading profits from the advance information since it neither trades securities nor manages money.
But he also said he regarded the information as "right in the public domain" and suggested that it would not be improper for market operators to profit from such an error.
Home sales slumped most in the Northeast, which has long had the least home-building activity of any region. Sales there dropped 21.2 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 52,000, erasing nearly all of February's advance, the report showed.
Activity in the South dropped 10 percent, to a 296,000 annual pace, while sales in the Midwest were about unchanged at 116,000.
Sales in the West eased 4.1 percent, to a 208,000 pace, but Ms. Cooper said "the big story" was the continued strength in that region. Last month's sales of new homes in the West were 25 percent above those of March 1995.
At the end of the month, builders held 379,000 finished but unsold houses, the highest level in 16 years. At the current sales pace, 6.8 months would be needed to deplete this supply, up from 5.8 months in February and the highest since April 1995.
The revisions for earlier months lifted January's sales pace by 20,000, to 729,000, and February's by 27,000, to 727,000, the report also showed. December sales were trimmed 2,000, to a pace of 683,000.
The median sales price of March contracts was $138,000, unchanged from February.

HEADLINE: U.S. Strains With China: 1 Exception

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Despite their strained relations, the United States and China have embarked on a program of environmental cooperation to address problems like rapid urbanization, pollution from energy consumption and the changing agricultural patterns of an increasingly prosperous population.
White House officials said a three-day meeting of senior agency officials from both nations at the White House last week was especially noteworthy because it occurred at a time when Chinese-American relations have been strained by differences over Taiwan and other trade and security issues. 
 They said the talks were the kind of step that Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been calling for in an attempt to put more focus on global environmental concerns as a central element of foreign policy.
"It is significant that this is moving forward with high-level backing when there are so many things going wrong with the relationship," an Administration official said. "The environment is a priority that supersedes those problems."
The meetings involved dozens of fairly senior officials -- assistant secretaries and vice ministers -- from agencies involved in energy, agriculture, environment, urban affairs, disaster relief and other such technical and economic fields. Hui Yong-zheng, vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, led the Chinese delegation. Mr. Clinton's science advisor, Jack Gibbons, attended about half the three-day session, and Vice President Al Gore also took part briefly.
White House officials said Mr. Gore and Prime Minister Li Peng consider the talks a preliminary step toward a permanent, high-level relationship aimed at what specialists call "sustainable development." That philosophy assumes that economic growth, especially in countries that are advancing rapidly, like China, must be carefully managed to ensure that such growth does not impose unacceptable costs in environmental degradation and depletion of resources.
The talks were not intended to be negotiating sessions over particular projects or decisions, such as whether the Export-Import Bank of the United States will subsidize loans to American companies for construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, American officials said. That enormous project has been strongly criticized by environmentalists, and the Administration has recommended against the bank providing financing.
An American participant in the talks said he was impressed with the depth of understanding displayed by the Chinese over the complexities of balancing economic and environmental considerations, the potential for achieving both sets of objectives at once, and the importance of doing so. Chinese delegates emphasized that China's new five-year plan, the Government's central declaration of policies, is a turning point in its explicit and detailed commitments to sustainable development.
China, with its huge population, rapid economic growth and accelerating urbanization, has long been recognized both as a nation with serious environmental problems and as a major market for environmental technologies, an area in which the United States is a world leader.
Among the problems discussed at the meeting, according to American participants, were these:
*China's enormous demand for new electric-generating capacity, which is expected to be met primarily with coal-fired power plants. That causes two main kinds of problems: acid rain in China, and a big source of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases that threatens to cause global warming.
*China's agricultural needs, which are shifting as the population eats more meat, as China imports more grain, and as arable land is converted to industrial and urban uses.
*The difficulties of housing, transportation and pollution control in growing coastal cities, and whether they can be relieved by planning more growth in smaller cities.
"The Chinese appear virtually certain to emerge as one of the largest economies on earth in the next century," an American official said. "With growth of 10 percent a year, their environmental problems can accelerate rapidly, and that can have a profound impact."
Both nations, in different ways, are major players in deciding whether emissions of greenhouse gases can be controlled in the century ahead. The United States is by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. It could be the leader in technologies to cut those emissions, but so far has failed to live up to its pledge to quickly cut its emissions, which continue to grow. China is the leading example of a fast-growing new contributor to the atmospheric burden of carbon dioxide.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ADVERTISING;
Business Groups Hope Ads in Pivotal Electoral States Sway Clinton on Product Liability Bill

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
In a coordinated advertising campaign running in states critical to the Presidential race, several groups financed by business are accusing President Clinton of carrying water for greedy trial lawyers.
The groups say they are advertising in hopes of persuading Mr. Clinton to sign legislation limiting damage awards in lawsuits over faulty products. Mr. Clinton has said he intends to veto the legislation. 
 But Democrats see the advertisements in states like Michigan and Ohio as a proxy assault to weaken President Clinton on behalf of Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee, who for the moment cannot afford to advertise. Mr. Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich plan to hold a joint briefing on Tuesday to call attention to the legislation before they send it to the White House.
The bill, which would cover product liability lawsuits in all Federal and state courts, would limit punitive damages in most cases to $250,000, or two times damages, whichever is greater. Mr. Clinton has said the measure does not provide enough protection for consumers.
Most of the advertisements sponsored by the business groups say that trial lawyers have donated heavily to Mr. Clinton's campaign.
"Even though the President says he puts people first, he plans to veto the product liability bill," says the announcer in one advertisement, paid for by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. "Who's first now, Mr. President?"
Words flashed on the screen ask: "People first? Or trial lawyers first?"
Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, said the advertisements were taking advantage of the political season to reach Mr. Clinton.
"His mind-set is in the electoral college, so that's where we're going to drive a stake through his heart," Mr. Coleman said.
The groups behind the advertisements say they represent hundreds of thousands of businesses and individuals. But Democrats see an effort to help Mr. Dole by big business, and in particular tobacco companies, which together with manufacturers and insurers are likely beneficiaries of the legislation limiting damage awards.
"This is Presidential politics, pure and simple, and the driving force behind this is the tobacco companies," said David Eichenbaum, communications director for the Democratic National Committee.
The Chamber of Commerce and the wholesalers association began running their advertisement on April 23. They plan to take it off the air on Tuesday, said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. He said that, depending on what Mr. Clinton does, it was conceivable that "we will ramp up again in key electoral states on the issue."
He said the advertising campaign was not coordinated with the Dole campaign or the Republican National Committee, but was coordinated with other groups favoring the product liability legislation.
As part of that joint effort, a second advertisement, paid for by Citizens for a Sound Economy, also began turning up last Tuesday in most of the same states. It presents a woman, Peggy Phillips, who says the manufacturer of a medical device she needs may stop making it "because of the threat of frivolous product liability lawsuits."
Addressing the camera, she says, "Mr. President, won't you please sign this bill?"
Both advertisements were produced by the firm Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller. And all three business associations were among the groups sponsoring a print advertisement, which ran last Thursday in newspapers here and in state capitals, suggesting that Mr. Clinton was beholden to trial lawyers.
Citizens for a Sound Economy has received large donations from tobacco companies, said John Canham-Clyne, research director of Congress Watch, an arm of the organization Public Citizen, which opposes the product liability legislation. He said it was also supported by foundations associated with the Koch family, industrialists based in Wichita, Kan., who have donated heavily to Mr. Dole.
William S. Armistead, vice president for campaign development at Citizens for a Sound Economy, said, "We don't reveal who our members are and our donors are."

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
A Course In History, Not Econ

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
THIS season marks the 20th anniversary of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's decision to pull up stakes in Milwaukee and move west to Los Angeles. Abdul-Jabbar embarked on a 14-year run that included five National Basketball Association championships, one of the great legacies for winning in professional sports.
With players turning professional out of high school and leaving college early -- as Marcus Camby and Kobe Bryant did yesterday -- this isn't an anniversary too many care about. But it's something Shaquille O'Neal should keep in the back of his mind as he contemplates a wild free-agent market this summer. 
 Abdul-Jabbar completed four years at U.C.L.A., earned a degree in history and was regarded as intellectual as well as athletically gifted. At that time, college players couldn't even turn pro early; when they began to do so in the early 1970's, they did it with a "hardship" label that carried a negative connotation.
By the time O'Neal came along in 1992, the early exit was in vogue, and something -- perhaps a certain competitive pride -- was lost along the way. In an odd way, this might contribute to Orlando's not winning the N.B.A. championship this season and not really caring whether it does.
Perhaps, along with all the other things young players sell and market, the competitive instinct, the urge to move beyond just being O.K., has been bought as well.
What besides money was the motivation behind Kevin Garnett's turning professional out of high school last year and Bryant's heading straight from Lower Merion High School to the N.B.A. this year?
An assistant coach in the Big Ten bemoaned the fact that players under so much pressure to reach the pros act as if possessions are life and death. They watch sports highlights on cable to see how players at other programs are doing. Who's getting the minutes? Whose getting the publicity?
The element of passion for the game, the intrinsic joy of playing the sport, has been replaced by the quest to sign and spend.
O'Neal came into the pro game early himself, leaving Louisiana State after his junior year to sign a $40 million contract with the Magic. When it expires on July 1, the Magic will offer the entire state to have him stay. Orlando could make him the richest player in the history of basketball. "It's been a good marriage," Pat Williams, the team's general manager, said yesterday. "We want him to stay, but this is going to be the summer of the great unknown."
The greatest unknown may be what O'Neal wants for himself -- beyond the riches he'll be showered with during the free-agent chase.
O'Neal suggests on one advertisement that he wants a championship ring. He has also compared himself and Anfernee Hardaway -- his point guard teammate -- to Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, saying, "We're the Kareem and Magic of the late 90's." But what critics wonder is whether O'Neal wants to play like Kareem and Magic or win like them. Can Shaq achieve that goal in Orlando? Or will the Magic be a young team that never becomes great?
"They're not going to win," said Oscar Robertson, who teamed with Abdul-Jabbar on the Bucks in 1971 to win an N.B.A. championship. "They are a lethargic team. For Shaq's future and for the future of really super big-time basketball in Los Angeles, he should go to L.A. If I were the Lakers, I'd go all out to get him."
Maybe it's not that simple. Shaq shatters backboards. Shaq dunks over mountains. Shaq puts fear in opponents' hearts. But does Shaq have the courage to be a Laker?
When Abdul-Jabbar left for the Lakers in 1975, he was following a path that had been traveled by two of the great centers in N.B.A. history: Wilt Chamberlain, who went from the Warriors to the Lakers and won a championship in 1972, and George Mikan, the league's first great center, who joined the Lakers following the 1947 season and helped them win five titles.
Since Abdul-Jabbar's retirement in 1989, there has been a void in Los Angeles and, by extension, on the West Coast. Shaq can fill that void. Or, he can build the addition on his home in Orlando and stay put.
Shaq, like the talented young players who scurry to leave school ever earlier, will be wealthy wherever he goes. But he'll be richer for the experience of going to Los Angeles and making a mark.
Mikan has his legacy. Chamberlain has his, and Abdul-Jabbar his.
At the moment, all Shaq has is trinkets and Disney World. He owes himself more.

HEADLINE: Court Overturns Damage Award In Downing of Korean Airliner

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court in Ohio today overturned a judgment that had awarded about $15 million to the relatives of five people who were killed in the 1983 downing of a Korean Airlines jetliner, and experts said the decision might be applied to about two dozen cases still pending 13 years after the incident.
Lower courts had awarded the money to the relatives for pain and suffering of the victims, and loss of society and grief of the survivors. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled that the law that should apply is the Death on the High Seas Act, which does not allow such non-economic damages. Korean Airlines was the defendant in the suits. 
 "If it had happened 20 miles further inland, over Sakhalin Island, you could collect everything," said Hans Ephriamson-Abt, the chairman of the American Association for Families of KAL-007 Victims. His 23-year-old daughter Alice was on board; her case is pending in New York. The decision is not binding outside the circuit, comprising Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, but is likely to influence about two dozen cases pending around the country.
The plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan on Sept. 1, 1983, by a Soviet fighter plane after it blundered into Soviet airspace while on the way to Seoul from Anchorage, Alaska. All 269 people aboard were killed.
The case has had a tortured legal history. The Warsaw Convention, which generally governs claims in international air travel, usually limits airlines' liability to $75,000. But in 1989, the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the airline had shown "wilful misconduct," voiding that limit.
But in January, the Supreme Court ruled in another case arising from the crash that the Death on the High Seas Act should apply.
"They have taken away just about every way to recover," said Gerald E. Thurswell, a lawyer who represented the estate of Margaret Zerif, an educator and author. "The court exercised its political wisdom in protecting the economic interest of Korean Airlines."

HEADLINE: Provident Agrees to Acquire Paul Revere for $1.2 Billion

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Provident Companies, the No. 2 seller of individual disability insurance policies, agreed yesterday to buy the No. 1 insurer in the field in a deal that would give it more than one-third of the market.
The $1.2 billion deal would eliminate about 600 jobs, give a big Swiss insurer a toehold in this niche and may presage a big write-off on money-losing policies sold by the insurer that is being acquired, the Paul Revere Company. 
 Last year Provident's insurance units had $2.6 billion in premium revenues and Paul Revere had $1.5 billion. About 57 percent of the combined $4.1 billion in premiums came from disability policies that were sold to individuals.
Provident's next largest competitor, the UNUM Corporation, has about 10 percent of the market.
Paul Revere has been controlled since 1985 by Textron Inc., the maker of Bell helicopters and Cessna planes. Textron acquired the insurer when it bought Avco Financial Services, which makes high interest rate loans to people whose employment and credit histories make them too risky for bank loans.
Textron is swapping its 83 percent stake in Paul Revere for $750 million cash and $225 million of Provident stock. Textron said it would record a $90 million loss on the sale.
James F. Hardymon, Textron's chairman and chief executive, said the sale "reinforces Textron's strategy to focus on its core manufacturing and finance businesses." He said that up to half the proceeds might be used to pay down the company's more than $10 billion of debt or to buy back stock.
Paul Revere's remaining public shareholders will get $26 in cash for each share, Provident stock worth $26, or $20 in cash and Provident stock worth $6.
Paul Revere's shares had closed at $26 each on Friday, so there was no premium in the deal. The shares slipped 12.5 cents yesterday, to $25.875, on the New York Stock Exchange; Textron's shares fell $1, to $86.125. Meanwhile, Provident's shares jumped $2.50, to $34.
After the consolidation, Provident expects to cut $70 million in annual costs, a 15 percent reduction, said Tom White, a spokesman. He estimated that 600 of the combined insurers' 5,100 jobs would be cut.
To finance the deal, Provident is getting a $300 million infusion of cash from the Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, which is buying a 15.2 percent stake in Provident under an agreement allowing it to increase the stake up to 40 percent.
Three analysts said the capital infusion might help pay for write-downs on money-losing individual disability policies sold by Paul Revere in the late 1980's.
Provident, which is based in Chattanooga, Tenn., announced a $423 million write-off on individual disability policies in December 1993. Paul Revere, which is based in Worchester, Mass., has not taken a similar write-off, said John M. Hannon, an analyst at Derby Securities.
"These companies got in trouble because they sold policies that could not be canceled," Mr. Hannon said.
Provident, Paul Revere and other companies have previously said that they had to pay claims on ailments not even known when the policies were written and that many disability claims resulted in larger than expected benefits payments.
The deal drew mixed responses from insurance ratings agencies, which had ranked both companies in the upper tiers, indicating a strong likelihood that they would be able over the long haul to pay claims.
A. M. Best called the deal "positive." But Moody's Investor Services announced it was considering downgrading Provident's ratings because of increased leverage and the general outlook for disability policies. Moody's said it was considering upgrading its rating on Paul Revere's life insurance unit. Standard & Poor's placed two Paul Revere units on its Creditwatch last week, noting that Provident had a slightly lower rating than Paul Revere.

HEADLINE: Gore Urges Cable Industry to Take On the Bells

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 29

 BODY:
The cable television industry is picking up some friends in high places, just when it needs them most.
Vice President Al Gore said today in a speech here to the industry's national conference that cable companies had displayed "good judgment, vision and a willingness to compromise" in their lobbying for telecommunications legislation. His remarks constituted a startling turnabout for a politician who was once one of cable's most strident critics and had led the battle to clamp down on cable rates in the 1980's. 
 In the wake of deregulation, however, the cable industry seems far less able to play the predator than a decade ago. Indeed, the competition unleashed by the new Telecommunications Act -- and the two recent merger announcements by four regional Bell companies -- is quickly putting cable executives on the defensive.
Because the Clinton Administration lobbied hard for the telecommunications law, it now requires that the market deliver the kind of freewheeling, free-market competition that deregulation was supposed to usher in. And so, Mr. Gore's speech amounted to a pep rally for the cable industry, which the Administration is counting on to give consumers a true telecommunications alternative.
Mr. Gore -- who as a senator once referred to John C. Malone, the powerful head of the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. as "Darth Vader" -- today exhorted the industry to take on the telephone companies as aggressively as they could.
"You are the second wire that passes virtually every American home," Mr. Gore said in his speech to the National Cable Television Association. "Use that second wire to make available to America a package of services, including Internet access, that is affordable to every citizen."
For several years, cable executives have predicted that they would soon offer a panoply of communications services, including local telephone service and high-speed data delivery. But so far technological snags and economic constraints have prevented the cable companies from establishing much of a beachhead in either business.
And the phone companies are unlikely to make the cable industry's job any easier.
The pair of proposed multibillion-dollar Bell mergers that have been announced since President Clinton signed the Telecommuniations Act in February -- those of SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Telesis Group, and the Nynex and Bell Atlantic corporations -- have focused almostly entirely on local and long-distance telephone service. And because the Bell companies seem determined to thrive by dominating their core telephone business, rather than branching into video services, some analysts and cable executives said that they would be even more ferocious about controlling access to their monopoly local markets.
"The toughest nut to crack is going to be the incumbent local telephone business," said James O. Robbins, the chief executive of Cox Enterprises' Cox Communications division, which is the nation's fifth-largest cable operator, with 3.2 million subscribers.
Cox is one of three cable operators that allied with the Sprint Corporation two years ago with a mission of building a national wired and wireless phone service, with cable networks providing the direct links to homes and businesses.
But that alliance has been unraveling. And just today the largest of those cable partners, Tele-Communications, served notice that it would choose its local phone markets selectively. The company said that it had filed for permission to offer local phone service in West Hartford, Conn., Arlington Heights, Ill., and San Francisco -- without Sprint or the other cable operators.
Greg Crosby, the vice president of marketing at the Tele-Communications telephone division, said that his company and Sprint had been unable to agree on which would pay for the costly upgrades of the cable network to enable it to carry switched phone traffic. Mr. Malone, the chief executive of TCI, has said he doubts that it makes economic sense to offer wired telephone service to each of his company's 13.7 million cable subscribers.
Cable operators who do go it alone are encountering other problems. Time Warner Inc., the nation's second-largest cable company, filed for permission in October 1994 to offer local phone service in Ohio. But Time Warner has been hobbled by a protracted squabble in that state with the Ameritech Corporation, the regional Bell company there. The dispute involves the rates that Ameritech charges to complete Time Warner calls to Ameritech customers.
The Ohio Public Service Commission imposed "interconnection" terms that were supposed to settle the matter, but Ameritech sued the commission rather than accept the terms. Thomas Morrow, the president of Time Warner Communications, said the company was encountering similar hurdles in Texas from the Bell company there, SBC Communications.
Given these issues, it is not surprising that cable executives spent most of their time today dwelling on other opportunities, like high-speed data delivery and digital television. The General Instrument Corporation and Motorola Inc. are among the manufacturers announcing ambitious plans here at the convention to ship new cable modems and digital set-top convertor boxes.
General Instrument's digital convertor boxes, designed to improve picture and sound quality while increasing the number of channels, are almost two years late, cable executives said. Meanwhile, complications in the development of cable modems have forced major cable operators like Tele-Communications to delay plans to offer high-speed access to the Internet and commercial on-line services.
Still, some cable executives seized on the anticipated announcements as proof that the industry was finally delivering on its lofty promises.
"I believe that this show may begin to put an end to the all skepticism," said Brian L. Roberts, the president of the Comcast Corporation and the chairman of the National Cable Television Association. "It will serve as evidence that we are finally doing what we've said we were going to do."
Mr. Gore, for his part, referred lightheartedly to his old disputes with the industry, noting that cable executives might perceive him as "Washington's answer to Darth Vader."
Still, the Vice President was probably less controversial than the other big name that the association tried -- unsuccessfully -- to lure to the conference: Jim Carrey, the actor who plays a psychotic cable repairman in the soon-to-be-released movie "Cable Guy."

HEADLINE: U.S. Defeated In Its Appeal Of Trade Case

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The United States lost its final appeal today in the first major case brought before the newly created World Trade Organization. A three-judge panel ruled that regulations issued under the Clean Air Act discriminated against foreign oil refiners.
The practical effect of the ruling is that the Environmental Protection Agency will almost certainly be forced to rewrite some of the rules concerning the environmental standards for imported gasoline or face trade sanctions from the countries that filed the complaint, Venezuela and Brazil. Imported gasoline accounts for only about 5 percent of gasoline sold in the United States, but about 20 percent of gas sold in the New York area. 
 The changes seem unlikely to have a major effect on the environment. But the political significance of the decision may be far larger. Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee for President, has long argued that the trade accord that created the trade organization in late 1994 as an international arbiter, runs the risk of surrendering sovereignty over American laws to foreign judges.
Today's rulings bolster his argument that the international organization can effectively force the United States to rewrite its rules. Mr. Dole's office said today that it was still reviewing the decision and had no comment on its contents.
The judges -- from the Philippines, Japan and New Zealand -- concluded that standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency constituted "unjustifiable discrimination" because they set different rules for foreign producers than for domestic refiners. They found that the rules were a "disguised restriction on international trade."
In a brief statement today, the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said that she was "disappointed that the practical result of this case remains unchanged," but "gratified" that the appellate panel ruled for the United States on a number of technical points. Administration officials noted that the panel acknowledged that countries had the right to control air pollution or take other steps to protect the environment -- as long as the rules applied equally to domestic and foreign companies.
The United States faces another potential conflict after the World Trade Organization threatened to scuttle talks over a global telecommunications agreement that faces a deadline of midnight on Tuesday. American negotiators in Geneva said they were not yet satisfied with market-opening offers from Asian nations. The accord among 53 nations would regulate the $500 billion global telecommunications services and equipment industry.
Jeffrey Lang, the deputy United States trade representative and top American negotiator at the talks, said that after American officials made their objections clear, they had not received improved offers from other nations.
Today's decision on gasoline regulations, announced at the World Trade Organization's headquarters in Geneva, was the first ever handed down by the organization's recently appointed Appellate Body, which is essentially the Supreme Court of international trade. It is charged with reviewing decisions issued by panels that hear trade complaints brought by any of the 120 nations that have signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The trade organization's judicial authority has long been a main sticking point for economic nationalists who opposed America's entry into the worldwide trade accord. Opposition has created a disparate group of critics, including consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, trade hawks like Ross Perot and Patrick J. Buchanan and conservatives like Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. They argue that environmental protections, laws against the purchase of goods made by child labor and even steps taken to cut down on drug imports can be challenged as trade barriers.
The Administration has argued that those concerns are overblown: The world organization does not have the power to strike down laws, only to impose trade penalties.
After weeks of haggling with Administration officials over that issue in 1994, Mr. Dole reached an agreement with Mr. Clinton to support the trade accord -- thus assuring its passage -- as long as a commission was appointed to review all decisions that go against the United States. If the commission concludes that three such decisions are capricious, Congress will automatically be asked to vote on whether to pull the United States out of the trade group.
But more than a year and a half later, the commission has yet to be established. The legislation creating it was held up by Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat and an opponent of the trade accord, who said that the appeals commission was not powerful enough.
At the time he struck the deal with Mr. Clinton -- and announced it in a ceremony in the Rose Garden -- Mr. Dole was criticized by the conservative wing of his party, which said he sold out to major corporate donors to his campaign, all supporters of the international accord. Indeed, he will have a hard time blaming Mr. Clinton for agreeing to American participation in the organization. In the end, it was his vote and the votes he brought with him that won the trade accord's passage in the Senate.
The dispute that led to today's decision began three years ago, when Venezuela asked the United States for permission to ship gasoline to the Northeast that probably produced more smog-emitting chemicals than American refiners were permitted to sell.
Under the Clean Air Act, domestic producers are required to meet standards based on the emissions of gasoline they produced in 1990. But many foreign producers did not keep equivalent records of their production then. So a different standard was created: They could ship only gasoline that met an average quality standard in the United States.
The foreign companies argued, successfully, that the rule effectively required them to meet a higher standard than some American concerns were required to meet, putting them at a disadvantage.

HEADLINE: Russia Given a Deal to Repay $40 Billion Debt

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 29

 BODY:
Russia got up to seven years' more breathing space today on repaying more than $40 billion of the accumulated debt it owes to foreign governments, possibly giving another lift to President Boris N. Yeltsin's prospects for re-election this summer.
Russian negotiators went into talks with 18 creditor nations here on Thursday asking for a rescheduling plan that would give them up to 25 years to pay off the credits, seven more years than the creditors' group has ever given before. 
 But after what some participants described as "difficult" talks at the French Finance Ministry that stretched through the entire weekend, the Russians were given a comprehensive debt rescheduling package that included most of what they had wanted.
The creditors, known collectively as the Paris Club, described the agreement as "financial support by the creditor countries to Russia's economic reform policies amounting to over $40 billion, which will be repaid over a period of up to 25 years."
But they said the agreement was intended to be final, replacing or incorporating the terms of three stretch-outs since 1993 on $29 billion of the debt in a way that should enable Russia to repay the entire $40 billion total with no further rescheduling or modification.
Christian Noyer, the chairman of the group, said the terms gave the Russians a grace period on repayment of principal until 2002. Until then, Russia would pay only interest, he said, explaining that it would now owe $2 billion this year, compared with $8 billion it would have owed without any rescheduling. The amounts will increase as time passes and as the Russian economy makes a successful transition to the free market.
"The Russian delegation described the economic and financial difficulties faced by its country and its strong determination to reduce the economic and financial imbalances," the creditors' communique said after the talks ended early today. Mr. Noyer said the agreement was conditioned on Russia carrying out the promises it made to the International Monetary Fund on March 26 to make cuts in its budget deficit and lift tariffs on imports, in exchange for a $10.2 billion loan.
"If the agreement with the I.M.F. falls, the agreement with the creditor countries falls as well," he said.
The Russian negotiators, led by Deputy Prime Minister Oleg D. Davydov, flew to London today for talks with commercial bank creditors who have agreed to a 25-year rescheduling of a further $25.5 billion in loans to Russia.
Germany is the largest government creditor to Russia, followed by France, Italy and the United States. All of them, plus Britain and other European countries, Canada, Japan and Australia, took part in the weekend talks.
France has made no secret of its desire to give Mr. Yeltsin every possible boost over the Communist opposition in his campaign for re-election.
President Jacques Chirac of France wants to include the Russian leader in political as well as economic discussions when leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies see him in Lyons during their annual summit talks at the end of June.
Mr. Chirac's advisers say the timing of the meeting should give Mr. Yeltsin another boost, just after the first round of the Russian elections and before the expected second round in July.

Government to Sell Oil From Strategic Reserve
President Clinton said the Government would begin to sell about 12 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in an effort to head off a surge in gasoline prices during an election year. The move was authorized in the Federal budget agreement reached last week and was envisioned as a way to cut the deficit. But the President attributed his decision to concern about the higher prices at the pump. They have risen to a national average of $1.27 for a gallon of regular from $1.16 a few weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Kansan Drove Woman to Bronx After Killing Her, the Police Say

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
After driving all the way from Kansas with his girlfriend's corpse by his side, a man surrendered at a Bronx police station house Sunday night and confessed to stabbing the woman to death, the police said.
The man, Angel Rivera, 33, formerly of the Bronx and now a resident of Topeka, Kan., told detectives of the 48th Precinct that he stabbed Trudy Poley, also of Topeka, six times during an argument Friday morning somewhere in Kansas, the police said. He told them he had discarded the murder weapon while on the way from Topeka to New York, they said. 
 Mr. Rivera drove east from Kansas apparently to seek advice from his sister and brother-in-law, who live in the Bronx.
"He talked to them, they asked about the girl, and then they advised him he had to come into the police," said Deputy Inspector Patrick Dudgeon, the operations commander for the Bronx detectives.
Inspector Dudgeon said Mr. Rivera, an unemployed restaurant worker, had a record of five or six arrests in Kansas for felonies.
When Mr. Rivera entered the station house, the police said, he told them that they would find his 30-year-old girlfriend lying dead on the passenger seat of his 1993 Mazda.
In suggesting a possible motive for the slaying, the police said Mr. Rivera was apparently agitated over having recently lost his restaurant job.
Mr. Rivera was awaiting arraignment yesterday in Bronx Criminal Court. It was not immediately clear if Kansas authorities would seek extradition, said Charise Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney's office.

HEADLINE: McCall Is Balancing Books and Ambition

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 29

 BODY:
H. Carl McCall, New York State's chief fiscal monitor and one of its most prominent Democrats, often couches criticism in the numbingly dull language of an auditor: a mix of statistics and bureaucratic minutiae.
But when he swept into an assembly hall here the other morning to address a crowd of public school teachers and students, there was suddenly a glimpse not of the accountant, but of a seasoned political brawler. 
 He quickly tore into the Republican Governor, George E. Pataki, comparing his policies to those of Newt Gingrich. Then, as the crowd nodded with approval, he derided a cut in the state's personal income tax as a break for "the Governor and his rich friends."
"Let me tell you about the Governor's tax cut," Mr. McCall said in a biting tone that drew hoots and laughter. "The Governor's tax cut is very good for everyone in this room who makes over $200,000 a year."
The change in his tone is unusual but easy to explain: Mr. McCall, the State Comptroller, is widely regarded as a likely Democratic candidate for governor, despite his insistence that he is not -- yet. Still, he does appear to be field-testing a possible run against Governor Pataki, while he has ruled out running for mayor of New York despite urging from city Democrats.
Mr. McCall has been traveling around the state regularly -- including upstate areas and New York City's suburbs, where his support has been weakest -- speaking to a variety of groups not always directly associated with his present post. They include college students and political clubs, labor union officials, churches and synagogues.
Mr. McCall also plans to send out 100,000 letters in the coming weeks soliciting campaign donations from individuals, a first effort to expand his list of contributors and thus make him less reliant on powerful corporations and lobbying groups, his aides say.
People in both major parties say that Mr. McCall would make a formidable candidate. As the only elected Democrat on the state level since the Republicans took the two other top offices in 1994, he has tried to use the Comptroller's platform to cast himself as a fiscal moderate who can be trusted with taxpayer money.
He routinely cites his skillful investing of the state's $75 billion pension fund -- a pitch he clearly hopes will sell among current and retired state employees, many of whom are upstate and suburban voters who might not otherwise vote for a black New York City Democrat.
Mr. McCall has also apparently tried to distance himself from such old Democratic allies as Mario M. Cuomo, the former Governor. In fact, he has issued a series of audits and financial reports that criticized the former administration's handling of various state affairs, drawing scorn from his former allies and unusual praise from some Republicans.
 
A Job of Moving To the Middle
"I think he's done an adroit job of moving to the middle," said State Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Long Island. "He's picking the right issues and making sure that he targets very key constituencies. He's a leading candidate for governor. No question about it."
But as Mr. McCall considers challenging Governor Pataki in 1998, political analysts say, he must be careful not to seem too partisan in his role as the state's chief fiscal monitor. "It's going to be a real balancing act between preserving the neutrality of the Comptroller's office and maintaining a voice as a political leader with ambitions for higher office," said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie. "But Carl McCall is going to have to pull that off if he expects to climb the political ladder."
The Comptroller's office presents another challenge for Mr. McCall. It is a relatively low-profile position that historically has been a poor springboard to higher office. The last comptroller to become governor was Nathan L. Miller in 1921.
Furthermore, a poll released last week by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showed that Mr. McCall had a faint image around the state. Of the 715 registered voters surveyed April 18-23, 70 percent said they had not yet formed an opinion about him. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.
Mr. McCall has been the State Comptroller since 1993, when he was chosen by the Legislature, at Governor Cuomo's urging, to fill the unexpired term of Edward V. Regan, a Republican, who retired from the post after years of unsuccessful efforts to move on to a higher office. Mr. McCall was elected to the post the following year, becoming the first black candidate to win a statewide office in New York.
Mr. McCall (who dislikes being called by his first name, Herman) was born in the Roxbury section of Boston 60 years ago, the oldest of six children. His father left the family after losing his job as a railroad dining-car waiter, and the children were raised by their mother with the help of welfare.
 
No. 2 Official In U.N. Delegation
Mr. McCall was encouraged by a family friend from church to study at Dartmouth College. After serving in the Army briefly, he went to Andover Newton Theological School and was ordained a minister in the United Church of Christ. But instead of becoming a pastor, he moved to New York City, where he helped register voters in Harlem in the 1960's.
In 1974, he won a seat in the State Senate representing Harlem, and four years later President Jimmy Carter appointed him the second-ranking official in the United States delegation to the United Nations. He held a variety of jobs until 1985, when he was made a vice president of Citibank, where he stayed until he became State Comptroller.
As Comptroller, he is sole trustee of the nation's second-largest state pension fund, auditor of state agencies and local governments, and the chief arbiter of state budgeting and borrowing practices. Mr. McCall has drawn criticism from allies and foes alike during his tenure, as he has tried to demonstrate his independence from both parties.
He has infuriated Mr. Cuomo and the former Governor's supporters for the audits and reports accusing the Cuomo administration of mismanaging a number of state agencies. ("He's very unhappy," Mr. McCall said. "But I think he'll get over it.")
The Comptroller's most recent criticism was in a January audit that assailed the lending practices of two state agencies that tried to foster job growth under the former Governor. The report was released just as the Pataki administration was claiming that it had uncovered gross mismanagement of the two agencies during the Cuomo era.
Mr. Cuomo's allies immediately accused the Comptroller of being a political opportunist, noting that he had been a member of a board that had evaluated and approved loans that the audit criticized.
"He's taking unfair shots to disavow his past ties and the decisions he once agreed with," said David H. Peirez, a lawyer who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo to sit on the board of the Job Development Authority, one of the agencies in question.
"It's totally political," Mr. Peirez continued. "I have no doubt in my mind that he's trying to recreate himself to run for higher office."
Some Republicans have been just as critical.
The Pataki administration recently attacked Mr. McCall's decision to block its plan to move nearly 5,000 state-financed jobs from Democratic strongholds of New York City and Albany to Republican districts.
The administration said the move would have consolidated the state's data processing in vacant buildings to be leased from I.B.M. Mr. McCall questioned the fiscal soundness of the lease deal, opening him up to accusations from the Governor and his aides that he politicized his duties to curry favor with Democrats. But he did approve a scaled-down version of the plan.
 
'Equally Critical Of Pataki'
As Mr. McCall sees it, the attacks from both political sides show he is doing his work impartially.
"This job requires independence," he said. "If Mario Cuomo did something that I felt was inappropriate, then I was critical of him. And I've been equally critical of Pataki."
Mr. McCall keeps the kind of schedule that would exhaust men half his age, typically putting in 12-hour workdays packed with speaking engagements, news conferences, staff meetings and television interviews. He has an easy, approachable manner in public gatherings; in private, he can be surprisingly blunt, and at other times distant and hard to read.
Mr. McCall becomes impassioned when talking to groups about social issues like poverty and race, sometimes drawing from his own experiences. "When I arrived at Dartmouth College," he recently joked in a speech to a group of college students, "I was a member of a freshman class with the largest number of African-Americans ever: There were eight of us."
Not surprisingly, then, he includes among his list of accomplishments his efforts to urge companies in which the state invests to adopt social policies like affirmative action.
But Mr. McCall also keeps reminding people that his first duty has been to strengthen the state's economic foundation -- a stance that political analysts say may help give him the credibility to take on Republicans on one of their biggest issues: their claim that that they are more fiscally responsible than Democrats.
"The Comptroller's office is a good place for Carl McCall to be," said Hank Morris, a political consultant who works for Representative Charles E. Schumer, another potential gubernatorial candidate. "It gives him a chance to establish himself as a fiscal conservative."
For his part, Mr. McCall says it is too early to decide whether he will run for governor. "I'm focusing on doing this job and I'm trying to do this job well," he said. "I don't want to be distracted."

HEADLINE: A Campus Appetite for a la Carte;
Student Tastes Lead Yale to Consider Menus of Other Colleges

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, April 24

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, Yale students, dressed in jackets and ties, were served dinner on fine china by waiters and waitresses in majestic Gothic dining halls. A typical menu in 1937 featured broiled loin lamb chops and tenderloin steak.
Now the university wants to open a food court with cuisine by Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Subway. 
 While Yale and its dining hall workers have been grappling over the revamping of the school's food services -- a monthlong strike just ended with no agreement -- both sides acknowledge that students are dissatisfied with the current cafeteria program.
At colleges nationwide, officials have been scrambling to outdo each other with focaccia grills, 850-seat food courts, make-your-own Belgian waffles, candlelight dinners and around-the-clock service to satisfy the eating habits of today's college students.
"Students come to campus used to eating what they want when they want it and where they want it, and we have to adjust to that," said Emily Lloyd, executive vice president for administration at Columbia University, which is overhauling its dining halls. "The sort of 'Leave It to Beaver' household where everyone, at the same time, eats meat loaf, string beans and mashed potatos followed by apple crisp doesn't exist anymore."
At a time when many undergraduates consider breakfast a dirty word and college dietitians classify midnight snacks as a fourth meal, the traditional Yale food plan -- 21 meals a week at roughly 9 A.M, noon and 6 P.M. -- has become an anachronism.
"For me, the strike didn't make a difference," said one sophomore, Casey Jarrin, over a Greek salad at Yorkside Pizza and Restaurant at 11 P.M. "In two years here, I've had breakfast in the dining hall maybe three times. I end up going out to eat practically every night."
On that particular day, Ms. Jarrin had been up until 3:30 A.M. studying, woke up shortly before a 1 P.M. class, grabbed a bagel with butter on the side at 4 P.M., and then bought a few slices of pizza and frozen yogurt at 6:30 P.M. By 11, like other students at Yale and around the country, she was ready for a fairly substantial late-night meal -- something that Yale does not provide.
A survey by Marriott Management Services, which operates the cafeterias and restaurants at dozens of colleges, showed that half of 20,000 students polled ate regularly between 9 P.M. and midnight. The poll, which did not include Yale, also revealed that one-third said they preferred snacking and eating four to six small meals throughout the day, rather than two or three full meals.
"There's no lunch for me anymore," said another Yale undergraduate, Weatherly Ralph, who has classes from 11:30 A.M. to 2:15 P.M. and "grazes" throughout the day on fruit, bagels and frozen yogurt. When the dining halls were open and she had to rely on the meal plan, she was left in the frustrating predicament of having to "run into the dining hall, make a sandwich and shove it into my mouth" to get her money's worth, she said.
She said the strike had made it possible to eat when she wanted because Yale had provided students with a weekly strike stipend to cover meals off campus. While she said she sometimes liked meeting classmates at the dining hall, she wanted it on her own terms.
"I want Yale to be a service to me, and to take advantage of it when I want it," she said.
Yale has been slower than most colleges in making such a shift, in part, because it involves tampering with a dining system that is steeped in tradition. Although the dining halls moved to cafeteria-style service during World War II, the original intent of the residential college dining system remains a central part of the Yale experience.
Each of these intimate gated and enclosed dormitories, where about 300 students live and dine together, is intended to foster diverse social and intellectual communities to enhance a student's education.
In the last few years, however, a growing number of students have moved off campus, and one of their main gripes has been the dining hall system. The complaints are less about the food than the schedule and students' desires to be able to eat at odd hours with the option to "grab and go."
Yale has acknowledged the need to change. In the last two years, it has extended dining hall hours in some colleges. The university also offered students the option of a 14-meal plan instead of the once-mandatory 21-meal plan. While both programs cost $3,060 a year, the new plan gives students $200 credit at local restaurants.
Yale hopes to take further steps, though school officials and its food workers union are at odds over what pay scale should be applied to the new services and whether they should be union jobs.
Ultimately, the university believes that an updated food service will produce better quality for the same price.
"The whole idea of getting some flexibility here is to provide students with what they want," said Yale's president, Richard C. Levin.
While vowing to maintain the residential dining halls as centers of campus life, he cited a need for the school to provide late-night dining and more options, most notably a food court.
"We're hardly thinking of anything revolutionary," Dr. Levin said. "We're trying to do at Yale what most other schools have done years ago."
There certainly are plenty of examples to follow.
At Rider College in Lawrenceville, N.J., a campus serviced by Marriott, the dining hall recently started opening at 9:30 P.M. for a late meal. A new campus-run convenience store, which lets students charge purchases to their meal plans, does a steady business in hamburgers, pan pizzas and frozen dinners that can be popped into microwave ovens in students' rooms.
The State University College at Oswego, N.Y., recently opened a 350-seat food court that serves about 2,500 meals a day, with a Taco Bell, Sub City, an ice cream shop and hamburger grill. In the dining halls, it offers omelets and soups. It puts out cereal, fresh fruit and other snacks after 8:30 P.M.
"The days of the mandatory board plan are gone, gone, gone," said Craig Traub, Oswego's food services director. "We have to compete for our customer's dining dollar."
Columbia is also trying to catch up with the trend. A couple of years ago, it brought a Pizza Hut and Taco Bell on to campus.
This year, with the cooperation of its food workers' union, it has begun redesigning its meal plan, beginning with a focaccia grill and New York-style delicatessen in one dining hall as well as offering prepackaged salads, sandwiches and other prepared foods.
Over the summer, two dining halls at Columbia are scheduled for renovations, and in September, one will operate around the clock.
These changes are motivated, to some extent, by economics. While universities once considered their students a captive clientele, that is no longer true. At the same time, schools have recognized that improved food services can actually turn a profit and attract faculty and staff.
At some universities, students are provided with debit cards that they can use to charge meals at a variety of different venues, including food courts, convenience stores and dining halls.
Not only are schools offering the fast-food option, dining halls also are adding grills, elaborate salad bars and woks where student can watch the cooking of their stir-fry vegetables. There are increasing numbers of ethnic and vegetarian items.
"A decade ago, students didn't have many choices so they were forced to dine with us," said Dean A. Wright, president of the National Association of College and University Food Services, a trade group based in East Lansing, Mich. "Now, we find they have transportation and can leave campus. They come with a brand name recognition that didn't exist a generation ago. They come with a preconceived idea of what is acceptable and what is good. If we don't meet that, they'll walk."
Mr. Wright, the food services director at Utah State University, oversees an operation that serves 6,000 meals a day, makes fresh pasta and fresh bread every morning and can turn out a tenderloin steak with portobello mushrooms for visiting dignitaries.
An 850-seat food court that opened in March 1995 is expected to have $1.5 million in sales this year.
Things have become more sophisticated, Mr. Wright added, with college chefs usually graduates of culinary schools. The old days of "mystery meat" and casseroles are gone.
"Breaded veal and shepherd's pie -- they were good products, once the classics of college cuisine -- are virtually extinct in campus dining centers," Mr. Wright said. "I haven't seen a breaded veal meal in five years."

HEADLINE: Much Bluster Over 90 Cents

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
As a political matter, the issue of raising the minimum wage is relatively straightforward, like mathematics. As an economics question, it is much more subjective, like, say, religion.
Take the politics first. 
 The issue has proved to be a bonanza for President Clinton and Democrats in Congress. For the first time since Republicans won control of Congress, a significant number of backbenchers have defected from the position of their leaders.
The only reason the Democrats have not yet succeeded in passing a bill that would raise the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, by 90 cents or even $1 is that the Republican leaders have gone to great lengths to prevent a vote.
The Democrats seem to have held the issue in reserve until the election year.
In the 1992 election campaign, Mr. Clinton advocated raising the minimum wage, but the issue was never a central part of his platform. In his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled Congress, he did not mention the issue once in a speech or other public forum. (His staff says the President was too busy dealing with health care, as if Bill Clinton can handle only one issue at a time.)
Then, this year, Democrats began trying to attach an increase in the minimum wage to various pieces of Republican legislation. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and Republican Presidential nominee-in-waiting, was blindsided. He treated the issue as a totem of organized labor, sort of like repeal of right-to-work laws, that most Americans cared little about. In fact, polls show that Americans, by ratios of 4 or 5 to 1, favor raising the minimum wage.
As Senator Dole and his colleagues stumble, Democrats portray the question as one of right and wrong. "It is a moral issue," Representative John Lewis of Georgia said last week. "Raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do."
With stakes that high, Republicans will probably fold their cards rather than continue to fritter away political chips. The prevailing view in the Capitol and among lobbyists downtown is that Republican leaders cannot afford to block a vote much longer and that sooner rather than later Congress will vote to increase the hourly minimum.
Now consider the economics of the matter. On the minimum wage, the advocates on both sides hold views so unshakeable that they resemble articles of faith.
The arguments have hardly changed at all since the Federal minimum wage was first introduced, at 25 cents an hour, half a century ago.
Many politicians and scholars, mostly Republicans and conservative economists, maintain that raising the minimum wage would distort the marketplace and cause a significant loss of jobs. Some of those jobs, they say, would be taken from poor people, the very people the increase was meant to help.
Much of the benefit of an increase, the opponents say, would go to teen-agers and footloose young adults who do not really need the money. Some businesses, especially smaller ones, would suffer and perhaps even go broke, the opponents continue, and inflation would result when businesses raised their prices to offset the higher wages.
Other politicians and scholars, mostly Democrats and liberal economists, argue that people who go to work every day are entitled to a living wage.
The advocates of raising the wage say that the value of the minimum wage has been eroded by inflation, that market forces have failed workers at the bottom of the income scale and that the job losses resulting from a moderate increase would at most be trivial. A fair minimum wage, they say, prevents sweatshops and encourages poor people to leave the welfare rolls and go to work.
This is one of those issues (lowering the capital gains tax is another) where economists know what they believe and often use research and statistics not so much to answer questions as to document what they are sure they already know. They view the same data through completely different lenses.
One side, for instance, argues that 37 percent of those earning the minimum wage are teen-agers. The other side says 63 percent are adults. One side asserts that 62 percent live in homes with someone else who works. The other side, fist banging on the table, declares that 38 percent must live off the minimum wage alone.
Statistics on the number of jobs created and lost are favorites on both sides. Those opposed to raising the minimum wage point out that in the first two years after the wage was last raised, in 1989, the number of jobs in the United States declined by 495,000. Those who advocate an increase observe that 10 million jobs have been created in the economy since 1989.
Those figures are cited even though no responsible economist would say that the increase in the minimum wage was the main reason the number of jobs declined in the recession of 1990-91, just as none would say that keeping the minimum wage steady for the last seven years had much to do with the growth in jobs.
Last year, two Princeton economists, David Card, who won the 1995 John Bates Clark medal for the most outstanding economist under age 40, and Alan B. Krueger, now chief economist at the Labor Department, published a book based on research showing that an increase in the minimum wage in New Jersey in 1992 did not cause jobs to be lost among fast-food workers. As soon as their findings hit the academic journals, economists opposed to raising the minimum wage submitted articles that sought to discredit the Card-Krueger research.
Views on the topic are held so firmly that research is hardly likely to change any economist's mind.
Asked in an interview whether any argument could be made that would change his opposition to raising the minimum wage, Martin A. Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, replied: "No, as an economist, not really. The literature on this goes back 50 or 60 years. It is extremely hard to find any studies that don't find this disemployment effect."
The same question was put to a strong advocate of a minimum-wage increase, Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research center partly financed by unions. "I don't think there's a theoretical argument that would change my mind," he responded. "If someone could show me you were hurting the people you were trying to help, that would change my mind, but I don't think anyone can do that."
The truth of the matter is that raising the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 would probably marginally improve the living conditions of a relatively small number of workers. It would also reduce the profits somewhat of some businesses, mostly in the food industry, and cause a fairly small number of jobs to be lost.
It would, in short, be neither a boon nor a disaster. But you would never know that from the vigorous way the politicians and economists state their cases.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 1, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about the minimum wage cited an outdated affiliation for Alan B. Krueger, an economist who was co-author of a book on increases in the minimum wage. Mr. Krueger returned last August to the faculty at Princeton University; he is no longer chief economist at the Labor Department.

HEADLINE: Home Sweet Hotel;
A Cheap Room With a Kitchen for Long Stays

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
After he was appointed regional manager for the McInnes Steel Company in January, Daryl K. Boe planned on staying in a motel while he looked for an apartment. "But I was driving by here and saw a sign on a new building saying $189 a week," the 29-year-old Mr. Boe said recently, "so I stopped to check it out and here I am."
"Here" is a 120-unit Extended Stay America, an economy hotel for people intending to bunk down not just for a few nights but for weeks or even months. And the guests aren't the usual mix of free-spending tourists and expense-account sales executives who populate pricier hotels. Rather, Extended Stay and a host of other new chains like it cater to the nation's rising number of penny-pinching corporate nomads -- workers who are looking for jobs, workers who have been relocated, workers who are being retrained after their old jobs were abolished, and the legions of consultants who are advising them all. 
 Extended-stay lodging has been around since at least the 1970's. But what differentiates the new wave of providers are the average lengths of stay, from weeks to months, and the lower room rates. By offering comfortable, homelike living conditions at bargain-basement rates, they have become the hottest sector in an industry that is just starting to emerge from the doldrums.
Mr. Boe's setup helps explain their popularity. With his laptop computer and printer, and his access to the hotel's fax machine, he has transformed his room into an office that is instantly reachable from the company's headquarters in Corry, Pa.
And, until he finds an apartment, he is making it into a home away from home. Mr. Boe feels free to rearrange the furniture and even redecorate. On the wall between his work area and television, he has hung a framed reminder: "Time spent playing golf is not deducted from one's life span."
And though Mr. Boe's culinary skills are nonexistent, he likes being able to save on restaurant bills by popping frozen dinners in the microwave and storing yogurt, orange juice and other perishables in the refrigerator. "I'm on an expense account," he said, "but I don't see the sense of costing my company $75 to $80 a night for a room when this is just fine for less than $30 a night."
Five hundred miles away, in Louisville, Ky., Carole Conrad of Los Angeles has been staying at another extended-stay hotel, a $299-a-week Studio Plus. Newly hired by the Orr Safety Corporation of Louisville after her 20-year job as a saleswoman for Alcan, a big Canadian aluminum company, was abolished almost four years ago, she is retraining for a sales job in California.
For Ms. Conrad, too, Studio Plus is a low-cost way to create a homelike atmosphere on the road. "When I was with Alcan I was always in hotel rooms," she said. "You get so sick of eating out each night. Here I have an incredibly inexpensive apartment with dishes, silverware and places to store food and prepare my own meals. There's even an iron and ironing board in my room. I can't tell you how important that is."
It is just such practical features that attract so many long-term travelers. The new extended-stay rooms are often bigger than standard hotel rooms and they typically offer separate working and sleeping areas, refrigerators, microwaves, dishwashers, sinks with garbage-disposal machines, dishes and kitchen utensils and coffee makers. They also have desks with multiple phone lines and voice mail.
But they eliminate minor luxuries like plastic wrappings on glasses. And instead of daily maid service, they offer weekly housekeeping with twice-weekly towel service, and coin laundromats on the premises. To hold down costs even more, front desks at Extended Stay America and Studio Plus are unattended late at night, and Mainstay Suites, the new extended-stay brand of Choice Hotels International, a unit of Manor Care Inc., will substitute an automated check-in system for the traditional 24-hour front desk. Studio Plus properties are run with five employees, about one for every 15 rooms, and Extended Stay Americas with 10 or fewer mostly part-time workers, or one for every 12 rooms. In contrast, full-service hotels employ about two people for every three rooms.
Room rates at most of the new properties will average at least 25 percent less than those at the handful of extended-stay hotels built in the 1970's and 1980's, when big companies were growing, not shrinking. Now more travelers than ever are on tight expense accounts for paying their own way, and are happy to find bargains. "I can't remember a time when a hotel segment was created by so sudden and so pronounced a societal and corporate shift," said Donald J. Landry, president of Choice Hotels International.
Choice plans to spend $100 million for 10 Mainstay Suites by the end of next year, with 25 planned by the year 2,000. Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn, a unit of Bass P.L.C., Doubletree, Summerfield and Wyndham are all trotting out their own versions, with plans for hundreds of such properties within the next few years. And Jack DeBoer, the founder of Residence Inns, one of the earliest extended-stay chains which has since been acquired by Marriott, is joining with Doubletree to start a new low-priced chain called Candlewood.
Extended Stay America is the brainchild of H. Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and Waste Management Inc., and George Johnson Jr., a former Blockbuster official. With four properties in operation and 10 under construction, the Spartanburg, S.C. company recently raised $85.3 million with a view to opening 300 more by the year 2000.
Studio Plus has offered extended-stay properties since 1985, but still has only 25 in eight states, mostly in the South. But it raised almost $150 million in two recent stock offerings, and now plans to have 100 properties by the end of 1998. The company's stock has nearly doubled since its initial public offering last June, as investors embraced the concept of extended-stay hotels.
The growth of extended stay in just the last couple of years has surprised the industry. Last year, travelers staying five or more nights at all hotels (other than for conventions) accounted for 265 million room nights, or more than 30 percent of all room nights, compared with 215 million room nights in 1993, or about 26 percent, according to D.K. Shifflet & Associates, a marketing consulting and research group in McLean, Va. And industry officials say they have barely begun to tap the extended-stay market.
Richard A. Shweder, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, said that such hotels filled a human need for the victims of economic turmoil beyond just the imperative of staying within a tight budget. "When you lose your job, you often lose your bearings," he said. "So the symbolism of a homelike environment can provide an important sense of stability while you're going through this process of having to recast yourself."
Marriott's Towneplace Suites, designed for stays of a month or longer, will have full kitchens and the rates will range between $45 and $60 a day, well below the average $80 at its Residence Inns.
Marriott also plans to develop and franchise as many as 100 Fairfield Suites, designed for budget business travelers staying up to four nights. The first of those properties is under construction in Plano, Tex., near Dallas's high-tech corporations, which by continuously moving and retraining their employees, are expected to keep occupancy rates high.
Many of the newer extended-stay properties are being placed not along highways or in downtown business districts, but in cheaper locations near training centers, corporate headquarters or industrial parks. Studio Plus, whose guests stay an average of five weeks, largely looks for locations near residential areas.
"We have linoleum in the kitchen and bathroom, but carpet in the living room," said Michael M. Wilson, vice president of marketing for Extended Stay America, whose rooms average from $189 to $269 a week, or $27 to $38 a day. "But the rooms are more than adequate for most of our guests, who include many construction engineers, white- and blue-collar workers and people who are moving."
Club Hotels by Doubletree, a new extended-stay brand, will offer a Kinko's self-service business center as well as an Au Bon Pain restaurant. Studio Plus properties have exercise rooms, or arrange for guests to use one nearby.
But many guests seem happy with just the basics, including Bob Carroll, a retired electrical engineer from Gaffney, S.C. Now a consultant to rural electric cooperatives, he had been renting a house for three months while in Columbia before moving into the Extended Stay America. "This gives me all the space I need," he said, "and the price is so reasonable I don't have to check out when I go home on weekends. I just leave my clothes and computer in my room."

Boe's expenses for the week ending April 27 shows that he spent $579.62, or $82.80 a day, while staying in the 120-unit Extended Stay America economy hotel in Columbia, S.C., top. Mr. Boe, above, a regional manager for the McInnes Steel Company, has been staying at the hotel since January as a way to save his company money while he searches for an apartment.
