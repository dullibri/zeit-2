HEADLINE: Suburban Office Market Uneasy but Holding Up

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
To gauge the direction of the commercial real estate market these days, John P. Hannigan, a co-owner of Choyce Peterson, a brokerage firm in Westchester and Fairfield Counties that specializes in representing tenants, relies on his own economic weather vane.
 ''When landlords start calling me, instead of the other way around, I know the winds are shifting and the market is slowing,'' Mr. Hannigan said. ''That's my recession meter -- when I become the hunted and not the hunter.'' 
 But whether the market is just braking temporarily or skidding toward a recession is not clear. Whatever the case, commercial real estate brokers like Mr. Hannigan say that building owners are shifting tactics in two major office markets north of Manhattan: Stamford in Fairfield County, Conn., and White Plains in Westchester County, N.Y. 
 In particular, landlords are said to be worried about rising vacancy rates and bracing for the possibility that some companies -- especially financial firms -- will be clearing out of excess space if the economy continues to deteriorate. This might involve subletting space or declining to renew leases and moving to smaller or cheaper quarters.
 In the White Plains central business district at the end of the first quarter, the so-called availability rate for all office space on the market was 11.9 percent, up from 10.9 percent for the first quarter a year ago, according to Cushman & Wakefield. In Stamford's main commercial area, it was 14.7 percent at the end of March, up from 12.6 percent a year earlier.
 ''When all of a sudden the expansion disappears and there are concerns about contractions, landlords are going to try to make deals,'' said Jim Fagan, a senior managing director for Cushman & Wakefield in both counties.
 The worry seems to be emanating out of Manhattan, he said, where the collapse of Bear Stearns and the vulnerability of other financial firms have raised fears of an office market downturn.
 Rents north of Manhattan are holding steady, however, and even inching up, the slowed economy notwithstanding. That is partly because almost no new office construction has taken place in recent years, and the options for prime Class A office space, the highest category, are limited, brokerage firms report. 
 In the central business district of Stamford, the average annual rent for Class A office space was $45.53 a square foot in the first quarter, up from $39.63 a year earlier. In Westchester, in downtown White Plains, rents for prime office space averaged $35.04 a square foot in the first quarter, up from $30.91 a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield's market reports. By comparison, in the secondary office districts of Manhattan annual rents were $50.28 a square foot downtown and $48.95 a square foot in the Midtown South area. 
 Nevertheless, landlords are being far more accommodating than they were a year ago, giving away things that they used to charge for. Instead of lowering the listed rent, Mr. Fagan said, they are offering free rent for a number of months, free parking (which can amount to $3.50 a square foot annually), new furniture and more generous improvement packages for leased space. 
 But not all landlords are willing to make such concessions -- ''at least not yet,'' said Margaret Carlson, portfolio director of RFR Realty, based in Manhattan and the owner and manager of a seven-building 1.8-million-square-foot Class A Stamford office portfolio, which it acquired last year. RFR's holdings in Stamford represent 29 percent of the city's total 6.2 million square feet of Class A office space. 
 So far, she said, ''we've held firm on our prices and still signed deals.'' RFR's tenants include Merrill Lynch, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Fidelity Investments and Citigroup, among others.
 But in the first quarter of this year, RFR signed only 16,000 square feet of new leases, compared with 47,000 square feet in the quarter last year. Also, the vacancy rate in RFR's portfolio has risen to 10 percent from 5 percent a year ago.
 Still, the company recorded 25,000 square feet in lease renewals during the quarter, which is up sharply from the 9,300 square feet in the first quarter of 2007. In response to the uncertain economy, many tenants are opting to stay in place instead of moving, Ms. Carlson explained.
 And while RFR's official position is that it is not offering concession packages, Gerard P. Hallock, managing director at the brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle's offices in Stamford, said that RFR had expressed interest in trying to strike a deal with a client of his who was unable to pay the landlord's going rent. 
 Some prominent landlords in White Plains seem more aggressive in making deals. Westchester One, an 850,000-square-foot 21-story office building dating to 1976, has weathered a number of downturns in its history, said Greg Frisoli, a senior director for Cushman & Wakefield, which is the building's marketing agent. 
 In the 1970s and '80s, I.B.M. was the major tenant. When it downsized, I.B.M. sublet space and vacated offices as leases terminated.
 The dot-com boom and subsequent decline in the late 1990s and early 2000 represented another cycle. And in 2003, Ameriquest Mortgage leased 300,000 square feet in the building, only to terminate the lease four years later in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. The current tenants include Disney Publishing and APS Healthcare.
 Now, Beacon Capital Partners, the current owner, is offering prebuilt spaces, which have already been finished off at the owner's expense, at Westchester One. These spaces can accommodate a variety of tenants in terms of size -- even companies that need as little as 3,500 square feet -- and Beacon is also offering concessions to make deals. ''In times like these,'' Mr. Frisoli said, ''all landlords need to do that.''
 Maybe not all landlords. In Greenwich, Conn., an affluent town that is home to hedge funds and other financial service companies, the vacancy rate is a mere 2 percent and prime office space goes for $120 a square foot and up, a level relatively rare even in Midtown Manhattan.
 ''In the central business district of Greenwich, there's very little negotiation happening,'' said Mr. Fagan at Cushman & Wakefield. ''There's a cachet to that address, and contrary to what's happening in most other places, there are no bargains to be had in Greenwich. It breaks all the rules.''

HEADLINE: Ladies Who Lunch? Nope, Here's to the Power Players

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
It seems safe to say that no New York restaurant, not even Michael's or the Four Seasons, has seen a power meal to match the one that so exhilaratingly begins Caryl Churchill's ''Top Girls,'' which opened last night in a well-acted revival at the Biltmore Theater.
 Nor can Barbara Walters, Tina Brown or any of their high-rolling sisterhood claim to have assembled a gathering of women like those who share rich foods and richer confidences in this imperfect but important play from 1982. That's because most Rolodexes don't have contact numbers for a dauntless world traveler from the Victorian era, a hell-storming peasant warrior out of a Flemish Renaissance painting, a 13th-century Japanese courtesan turned Buddhist nun, a too-dutiful wife from Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' or a martyred female pope from the Middle Ages. 
 But it also seems safe to say that any contemporary woman of power will find she has much in common with these wine-gulping, centuries-spanning figures, embodied with zeal and finesse by a starry cast that features Elizabeth Marvel, Marisa Tomei and Martha Plimpton. That includes a sad and sobering awareness of the lower depths that lurk at the top for those who have worked, fought and married their way up. As Marlene (Ms. Marvel), the party's 20th-century hostess, asks, ''Why are we all so miserable?''
 Watching that consciousness surface in Ms. Churchill's fantasy dinner in a London restaurant, where Marlene is celebrating her promotion to managing director of an employment agency, makes the first act of ''Top Girls'' not only an inspired gimmick but also one of the most resonant theatrical set pieces of the past 50 years. And it has been done full justice here by a cast rounded out by Mary Catherine Garrison, Mary Beth Hurt, Jennifer Ikeda and Ana Reeder, directed with intelligence and sensitivity by James Macdonald.
 That nothing else in ''Top Girls'' equals its virtuosic opening scene is no fault of this revival, a Manhattan Theater Club production. Even 25 years ago, when the play opened at the Public Theater in New York, it was evident that Ms. Churchill had saved her best for first. 
 This brilliant, adventurous dramatist, though, was not yet practicing the poetic economy evident in later works like ''Far Away'' and ''A Number.'' In ''Top Girls'' she makes the implicit explicit. The themes explored with such stylistic vigor in the first act are parsed and laid bare in the more naturalistic second and third. 
 In these, set in the dawn of Margaret Thatcher's Britain, Marlene is seen in both the unforgiving world of affluence in which she now lives and the equally unforgiving one of poverty she escaped from. (In its published form ''Top Girls'' is two acts; here it has been redivided into three.) 
 These sections are often intellectually engaging. It's fun catching the echoes of ideas about feminine sacrifice, restlessness and moral compromise established in the fantasy sequence. But eventually these later scenes start to feel like predigested food for thought. And there are moments of confrontation that remind you of old-fashioned weepies, albeit spiked with a socialist conscience. (Of course a lot of British dramatists, including David Hare, were writing that way in the Thatcher age.)
 It's the commitment and enthusiasm of Mr. Macdonald's cast that continue to hold your attention. How often, after all, do you get to watch this many actresses at this level of talent sharing a single stage, a meaty subject and the chance to flex underused theatrical muscles?
 Aside from Ms. Marvel, who provides a magnetic center as the ambition-driven Marlene, everyone has more than one part. And it's a delight to see how each settles so comfortably into different complex roles without signaling how clever she is.
 The casting alone in the first act is cause for joy. Ms. Plimpton, with her thundering alto and concrete presence, was made for the adamantine (and possibly apocryphal) Pope Joan, who confidently ruled the Vatican in the ninth century until she gave birth to a child. (The witty, mixed-period costumes are by Laura Bauer.)
 Ms. Tomei, an actress of effortless-seeming nuance, brings fine layers of guilt and determination to the role of the British world traveler Isabella Bird. Ms. Garrison's girlishness with a sting feeds perfectly into Chaucer's Patient Griselda, the obedient victim of some of the sickest spousal abuse in literary history.
 I'm equally hard-pressed to think of better choices for Dull Gret, the laconic peasant warrior, and Lady Nijo, a Japanese emperor's concubine, than Ms. Reeder and Ms. Ikeda, lively counterpoints in crudeness and delicacy. And it's truly thrilling to observe all these actresses navigate the tricky waters of Ms. Churchill's overlapping dialogue.
 They're just as good, if less entertainingly flashy, in the succeeding scenes in which they portray, among other things, the proud-to-be-tough employment agents and their job-seeking interviewees. Ms. Hurt, who appears memorably as the stern waitress in the first act, has a pitch-perfect scene in the second as a middle-aged office manager, newly awakened to anger she has suppressed for years. 
 The third act, in which Marlene returns to the working-class neighborhood of her youth, is the most conventional. In it Marlene and her sister, Joyce (Ms. Tomei), drink, confront, confess and argue over the care and feeding of Angie, Joyce's simple-minded teenage daughter (a totally credible Ms. Plimpton). This all too often has the air of a politicized episode of ''Coronation Street,'' the long-running British soap opera. 
 Then again, without that concluding act, we would miss the silent vision of Ms. Tomei's Joyce, alone onstage, as her eyes register the long stretch of her inevitable hardscrabble future. Or the opportunity to watch Ms. Marvel's Marlene get drunk again and follow a snaking path through sentimentality, guilt, bluster, anger and animal fear.
 It's fear that Ms. Churchill leaves us with. When you look back, you appreciate the eerie appropriateness of Tom Pye's diaphanous sets, which float amid the black maw of a bare stage. That blackness, seen or unseen, is always in Ms. Churchill's plays, whether she's writing about Communist Romania (in ''Mad Forest''), environmental destruction (''The Skriker'') or Anglo-American relations (in ''Drunk Enough to Say I Love You?,'' staged by Mr. Macdonald this season).
 It's this abiding darkness that gives ''Top Girls'' an affecting charge that transcends its schematic side. As always Ms. Churchill is merciless in pointing out that everything in this life is scary, including the landscape of roads taken and not taken that every woman faces, no matter what century she's from.

HEADLINE: A Company Ahead Of Its Time

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
HAD you caught ''Big Ideas for a Small Planet'' on the Sundance Channel on Tuesday night, or read last week's issue of Fortune, you might have been intrigued by reports about the environmentally conscious philosophy of a Portland, Ore., fashion company called Nau. But if you had then visited the company's Web site, you would have discovered a notice that Nau is going out of business. 
 The company, founded three years ago by a group of executives from Nike, Adidas and Patagonia, announced on Friday that it was unable to raise enough capital to continue operating, citing the national economic downturn that has also caused a wave of bankruptcies in retail. Nau's five stores, including one opened last month in the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, were closed over the weekend. Online merchandise at nau.com has been marked down by half. 
 ''I feel like we put together a rock star band, just played a couple of warm-up numbers and then the curtain came down,'' said Mark Galbraith, the vice president for product design.
 The Nau concept had initially attracted several investors, raising $35 million since the company started. It seemed to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for products designed and sold as environmentally friendly, or green. Nau's casual styles were designed with fashion customers in mind, sleeker and more adaptable to office environments than most outdoor apparel, and the materials included a range of recycled fabrics, such as polyester spun from old soda bottles. Five percent of its sales, or about $223,000 since last spring, was donated to charities.
 Ian Yolles, the vice president for marketing, said that investors were becoming skittish about retail companies. But he also recognized there had been some concerns about its retail and design strategies. At its stores, customers were encouraged to try clothes on, but buy them online using computer kiosks. The products were then shipped to their homes at a 10 percent discount. Meanwhile, its commitment to sustainable fabrics often necessitated higher prices than consumers may have expected.
 ''Could we have done things better?'' Mr. Yolles said. ''Absolutely. But it was largely a matter of economic circumstances that we were not immune to.''

HEADLINE: Productivity Increases As Debts Accumulate

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Worker productivity rose by a better-than-expected amount in the first three months of the year while labor cost pressures eased, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. 
 The Federal Reserve Board, meanwhile, reported that consumer borrowing rose in March at the fastest pace in four months, more than double the increase of the previous month.
 Productivity, the amount of output for an hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, slightly higher than the 1.5 percent increase expected.
 In a sign that inflation could be easing, labor cost pressures slowed a bit. Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, down from a 2.8 percent rise in the final three months of last year.
 While rising wages and benefits are good for employees, those increases can lead to higher inflation if businesses are forced to raise prices on their products to cover higher payroll costs. If productivity is increasing, however, businesses can finance higher wages out of the increased output.
 The Federal Reserve monitors productivity trends closely, because wage escalation is often the way that inflation gets out of control.
 Private economists say they believe that the weakening economy will damp inflation pressures, but that the sharp economic slowdown is occurring at the same time that energy and food prices have continued to rise.
 In further evidence of the squeeze on consumers, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday that Americans increased their borrowing at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, compared with a 3.1 percent rate of increase in February.
 The gain was much larger than economists had been expecting and reflected strong borrowing on credit cards. Credit card borrowing was up at an annual rate of 7.9 percent, compared with a 5 percent gain in February, while borrowing in the category that includes car loans jumped by 6.8 percent, compared with a 2 percent increase in February.
 The increase in consumer debt totaled $15.3 billion at an annual rate in March, much bigger than the $6 billion increase that economists had been expecting.
 Consumers have been moving to put more purchases on their credit cards as banks have tightened lending standards for home equity loans in response to the deepening credit crisis.
 The rise in productivity in the first three months of the year occurred as the number of hours worked declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent.
 That reflected layoffs as businesses cut their payrolls in the face of an economic slowdown prompted by a steep slump in housing.
 The 2.2 percent rate of productivity growth in the first quarter was up slightly from a 1.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter of last year.
 Productivity for all of 2007 rose by 1.8 percent, up a bit from the 1 percent gain in 2006. Both of those increases were far below the growth levels of the past decade as productivity experienced a healthy rebound, reflecting investments that had been made in equipment to improve efficiency, like computers.

HEADLINE: A Reclusive Government, Forced to Ask for Help

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
In opening its doors to international disaster relief, Myanmar's military government is breaching a wall of isolation it has built around itself over nearly half a century. 
 The devastation of Saturday's cyclone, which took more than 22,000 lives, has forced the junta to soften its pose of self-sufficiency and ask for help from a world it fears and resents. 
 The request for aid comes less than nine months after the ruling junta rejected the almost universal condemnation it received internationally after brutally cracking down on pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks. 
 Yet the government is showing its reluctance now by accepting the aid it requested only slowly, complicating visa procedures for international donors and apparently seeking to limit the access of foreign relief workers. 
 In Geneva, United Nations officials said travel and visa obstacles were hampering deliveries of aid to an estimated one million people who were believed to be homeless. 
 Relief officials said that some help was reaching Myanmar's main city, Yangon, and elsewhere, but that flooding and road damage had cut off many of the hardest hit coastal areas. 
 Relief agencies said that hunger, thirst and the threat of disease must be urgently addressed. 
 Since a military coup in 1962, Myanmar, the former Burma, has sealed itself off from the outside world in what was once called the Burmese Way to Socialism. That barrier has grown in recent years with the West's imposition of economic sanctions for human rights violations. 
 ''Normally they would be saying, 'We are going to stick it out, we don't need anyone's help,' '' said Zarni, a visiting research fellow at Oxford University who goes by one name. 
 ''That barrier has been broken,'' he said. ''They must know that asking for help means some degree of international involvement in the country's internal affairs, whether poverty reduction or democratization.''
 This aid, if the government fully embraces it, will require a new degree of cooperation with foreign governments and with relief agencies whose operations inside Myanmar have been increasingly restricted. 
 The government runs the risk that foreign relief groups and governments will be seen as the rescuers of people it was incapable of helping on its own. 
 ''I don't think any one country would be able to manage a disaster on this scale,'' said Shari Villarosa, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, speaking from Yangon by telephone. 
 ''They need outside assistance,'' said Ms. Villarosa, the charge d'affaires. ''The international community is ready, willing and able to come in big time and help. Again, their distrust of foreigners is keeping that out.'' 
 She added: ''They are very suspicious. They think that they're up to no good.'' 
 The government also faced the possibility of anger from hungry, homeless people who feel it has failed them. Already it is common to hear complaints from Myanmar that the military, which crushed peaceful demonstrations in September, was nowhere to be seen last weekend. 
 A steep rise in fuel prices was the initial cause of demonstrations in August that swelled into huge protests of the government. Rice price increases were one cause of even larger demonstrations in 1988 that were halted at the cost of many hundreds of lives. 
 ''The experience around the world is that people who don't have enough food and water are desperate and will do desperate things,'' Ms. Villarosa said. 
 For now, most analysts said, people are too concerned with survival to express their anger in any open way. 
 The most likely avenue for change in the long term is within the military, which controls most aspects of life in Myanmar, the analysts said. It is the mood of the military that concerns Myanmar's top leaders more than the general welfare of the people, said U Win Min, a Burmese exile and military analyst. 
 ''This is the only thing that matters to them, not public opinion,'' he said. ''The junta is not relying on public support but on public fear that can be done only by people in the military. Their worry is to have the support of the military.'' 
 The government offered an indication of its priorities when it said it would proceed with a constitutional referendum despite the scale of the disaster. The constitution, which would legitimize its grip on power, is the product of more than a decade of work and is the centerpiece of the junta's policy for the future. 
 The government announced that the vote, scheduled for Saturday, would be postponed for two weeks in the hardest hit areas but would proceed in most of the country. 
 ''They don't prioritize relief, which is an urgent need for the people, but they prioritize their own plans to legitimize their government through the constitution,'' Mr. Win Min said.

HEADLINE: $271 Million For Research On Stem Cells In California

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
California has awarded $271 million in grants to build 12 stem cell research centers in the state, even as one of the political rationales for the building program might soon disappear. 
 The awards, announced here Wednesday, represent the largest chunk of money awarded at one time by California's taxpayer-backed stem cell program, which is slated to spend about $3 billion over about a decade.
 The universities and research institutes that are receiving the money have said they would spend an additional $560 million on the laboratory construction, money they are trying to raise from donations. The resulting total of $831 million would add nearly 800,000 square feet of research space to house 2,200 scientists. 
 One reason the buildings are needed is that the Bush administration now prohibits federal financing of research using any human embryonic stem cells derived after August 2001, because creating such cells entails the destruction of human embryos. That has meant that work involving newer stem cell lines cannot share even a microscope with a project that is federally financed. 
 At the University of California, San Francisco, for instance, stem cell scientists had to work in rented space off-campus for many years. In December 2002, a huge storm caused power failures in the Bay Area, destroying cell lines that were being grown in incubators. Had the work been conducted on campus, backup generators would have kept the incubators operating. 
 ''Several years of work literally went down the drain,'' said Dr. Arnold Kriegstein, director of the university's stem cell program. The university will now receive $35 million to build a $95 million research center. 
 But the restrictions might be lifted by a new president as early as next year. All three main presidential candidates have expressed support for expanded financing of human embryonic stem cell research. 
 ''Now that the money is flowing, those federal restrictions are going to be removed,'' said Jesse Reynolds, a policy analyst at the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland, which supports stem cell research but has at times criticized the California project. 
 Robert N. Klein, the chairman of the board of the California program, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, argued Wednesday that the state could not take for granted that federal restrictions would be lifted. Mr. Klein said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, had expressed opposition to some types of stem cell research. 
 Moreover, Mr. Klein and university representatives say that even if the restrictions are lifted, new laboratory space will be needed to expand research and to recruit scientists, who are already flocking to California because of the research financing. 
 Some officials also said the construction would provide an economic stimulus at a time of a weak economy and a huge state budget deficit. The stem cell program, approved by voters in 2004, is financed by bonds and is largely immune to state budget-cutting pressures. 
 Alan Trounson, the president of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, said the new buildings would allow scientists to work together, accelerating the development of medical treatments. 
 Proposition 71, the 2004 ballot initiative that authorized the program, limits spending on buildings to 10 percent of the total $3 billion. 
 Most of the major universities and research institutes in the state, including 9 of the 10 University of California campuses, will get money for new buildings. 
 Stanford University will get the biggest award, nearly $44 million, to build a $200 million stem cell center. 
 The University of California, San Diego, teamed up with the nearby Burnham Institute for Medical Research, the Salk Institute and the Scripps Research Institute. The team will receive $43 million for its building.

HEADLINE: Acquittal in Nun's Killing Provokes Outcry in Brazil

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Mery Galanternick contributed reporting.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
Human rights advocates and the Brazilian government on Wednesday sharply criticized the acquittal of a man accused of being behind the murder of an American Roman Catholic nun in the Brazilian Amazon forest. 
 On Tuesday, after a two-day trial, a jury in Belem, in Para State, acquitted the man, Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, of conspiracy in the murder of Sister Dorothy Stang in February 2005. 
 The trial was the second in which a jury had considered Mr. Moura's role in the killing. He was convicted and sentenced in May last year to 30 years in prison on charges of ordering the killing of Sister Dorothy, 73, who was a staunch advocate of protecting the rain forest. 
 Under Brazilian law, a retrial is required for first offenders who are sentenced to more than 20 years. This time, the jury voted 5 to 2 to accept the defense contentions that Mr. Moura had no motive to be involved in Sister Dorothy's killing and that it had been carried out solely by Rayfran das Neves Sales, who confessed to shooting her and is serving a 28-year sentence.
 The trials of suspects in her killing have been seen as tests of Brazil's willingness to prosecute murders over land use on the violent and largely lawless Amazon frontier. The case drew international attention because Sister Dorothy, a naturalized Brazilian, was originally from Dayton, Ohio, and she was viewed as a leader in the movement for sustainable development on par with Chico Mendes, the rubber tapper who was killed in 1988.
 Sister Dorothy was shot while visiting a remote encampment near the Trans-Amazon Highway in Para, in a region known for corruption and land violence.
 The Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, vowed in 2005 that his government would ''not rest until the killers are caught.'' Brazil's Supreme Court once considered a motion to have the killing declared a federal crime, which would have taken the case out of Para's courts.
 Paulo Vannuchi, the minister for the government's Special Secretariat for Human Rights, expressed ''vehement disagreement'' with the Belem jury's verdict. The acquittal ''reinforces the feeling of impunity that is so widespread in our country, opening a road to more crime and violence,'' Mr. Vannuchi said.
 As many as 800 settlers, union members and priests have been killed in Para in disputes over land in the last 30 years, according to the Catholic Church's Land Pastoral, which monitors land violence in Brazil.
 ''Economic power continues to rule'' in Para, said Margarida Pantoja, a member of the Dorothy Committee, a group of human rights advocates and religious sisters in Belem from different congregations. ''We will go back to feeling insecure.''
 After the verdict on Tuesday, Judge Moises Flexa ordered Mr. Moura released. He had been in jail since 2005. Ms. Pantoja said her group planned to ask Para's governor for more security in the area, out of concern over possible retribution.
 Mr. Sales was the chief witness in Mr. Moura's new trial. Edson Souza, the lead prosecutor, said on television in Belem that he planned to appeal the acquittal.
 Prosecutors said Mr. Sales was offered as much as $25,000 to kill Sister Dorothy after she fought to preserve a piece of jungle that ranchers wanted to clear for logging and cattle ranching. Mr. Sales said in court that he had acted alone and in self-defense, contradicting previous testimony in which he said he had used Mr. Moura's gun, said Gloria Lima, a court spokeswoman.
 Tom Stang, a brother of Sister Dorothy, said the family was crushed by the acquittal. ''That guy was offered up as a sacrificial lamb,'' he said of Mr. Sales. ''But the darker forces that created him have been allowed to go free.''

HEADLINE: Raid on Sect in Texas Rattles Polygamist Faithful Elsewhere

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and JOHN DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: COLORADO CITY, Ariz. 

 BODY:
As the supper dishes were being cleared away and the rice pudding brought out for dessert, Marvin Wyler's two wives, along with some of their children and a group of friends, began poring over the list.
 The 44-page document, from a court in Texas, gives a glimpse of who is married to whom in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or F.L.D.S. -- and in the hothouse world of religious polygamy, a list like that is a sort of Rosetta Stone to the usually hidden relationships of power, politics and piety. 
 ''We are adding up the number of men who may be going to prison,'' said Isaac Wyler, 42, the eldest of Mr. Wyler's 34 children, who was examining the list on Sunday to see which men may have had wives under the legal age when they married. 
 Scenes like this have played out in recent days in polygamist communities on the Arizona-Utah border as the marriage list and other records, seized last month from the polygamist sect in Eldorado, Tex., along with 462 children in an investigation of possible under-age brides, have filtered west. 
 The information has families like the Wylers talking about some of polygamy's best-kept secrets. Who would have guessed, for instance, that Wendell Nielsen, a high-ranking sect official with family here, had 21 wives in Texas, too? Or that he has 35 children on top of those here?
 As law enforcement officials from Utah and Arizona prepare for what they expect to be a capacity crowd town-hall-style meeting on polygamy on Thursday -- planned north of here in St. George, Utah, before the Texas raid but now proceeding with an added urgency -- polygamist gossip is only one of the many consequences of the raid that they are encountering.
 Rumors of an imminent Texas-style police crackdown -- the authorities say none is contemplated -- are among the new constants of life here, the historic heartland of the F.L.D.S. Some polygamists, who had considered moving to Texas, are putting down roots again here, even cooperating with the authorities. Others are speaking out publicly, trying to distinguish their forms of plural marriage (no under-age brides) from what the authorities say was practiced by the sect in Texas.
 ''Polygamy is not the problem,'' said Marlyne Hammon, who belongs to a group called The Work of Jesus Christ, which practices polygamy in a town just a few miles from here. Ms. Hammon, of Centennial Park, Ariz., said child brides had no place in her group's faith or practice. ''This is about human error, not polygamy,'' she said.
 Fierce winds of change -- from national political attitudes about polygamy to new economic stress and even down to the personal decisions about where to live in a post-Eldorado world -- are buffeting the polygamist faithful.
 Recent statements by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat and the Senate majority leader, calling for toughened enforcement of laws against polygamy, possibly with an expanded federal role by the Department of Justice, have sent a particular shiver, with questions swirling about what the states will do under federal pressure. 
 ''They think they're going to be next -- that there's so much pressure being brought on me that I'm going to raid them,'' said Utah's attorney general, Mark L. Shurtleff, a Republican. ''They hear the rumors, and they call.''
 Mr. Shurtleff said he planned no change in tactics, and no mass raids, which he said would only destroy the trust needed to protect people, including the young girls his office is trying to help. It is a point, he said, that he intends to make forcefully on Thursday night on a shared stage with the Arizona attorney general, Terry Goddard, at the meeting in St. George, about 45 miles from here.
 Mr. Goddard, a Democrat, said he too intended to continue pursuing accusations of abuse case by case, with no mass arrests or seizures in the offing.
 ''I don't know how I can make a case that all the children in Colorado City are in danger,'' Mr. Goddard said. 
 But some polygamist families say paranoia is only natural now. Even the Wylers, who left the sect years ago -- he is 63 and his wives are 63 and 58 (a third wife died years ago) -- are anxious. The 63-year-old wife said she risked losing her job if her name was used in this article. 
 But as the Texas raid's impact is digested here, individual F.L.D.S. families are making new decisions. Over the last month, dozens of families have come forward to cooperate with a court-appointed officer, pay their bills and sign documents that could allow them to stay in their homes here, most of which are owned by a trust once controlled by Warren S. Jeffs. Mr. Jeffs, the F.L.D.S. leader, was convicted last year in a Utah case of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14-year-old. 
 Before the raid, said the officer, Bruce R. Wisan, people would not even answer the door when he knocked. The raid shook something loose.
 ''This raid in Texas just totally exacerbated their concerns and solidified the idea that we're not going to be moving out of here,'' said Mr. Wisan, who is also an accountant from Salt Lake City. ''It's a huge shift, from moving the whole community out, to paying and signing.''
 The F.L.D.S. broke away from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has 13 million members worldwide, decades ago over the practice of polygamy; Mormons disavowed it in 1890 and now excommunicate polygamists.
 The relationship between the sect's core settlement here and its outpost in Texas called the Yearning for Zion ranch, was complex. Families sent to Texas by the sect's leadership were favored and said to have been identified by revelation to the leadership from God.
 ''They were just gradually moving down there as things got ready, but they took the most elite and most chosen first,'' said Shannon Price, the director of a group called the Diversity Foundation that works to help people leaving the fundamentalist groups.
 Now there is a question, Ms. Price and others said, about who might be coming back from Texas -- and whether it might include a few men who do not want to be found by the police.
 The stress rippling out from Texas is also compounding economic woes. A power plant built under the leadership of Mr. Jeffs's predecessor and father, Rulon Jeffs, in 1997 -- with $21.4 million in municipal bonds -- has been in default for years as customers for the power, including the city of St. George, walked away and fuel costs soared. 
 The power station was needed, the Jeffs men said, in anticipation of a prophesied collapse of American society in the year 2000 that would have left the F.L.D.S. humming along in its rural fastness with the lights still on. Now, the bondholders are going to court, and last week, the utility officers began considering a 25 percent rate increase, on top of what is already some of the most expensive electricity in the West, in an effort to stave off financial disaster. 
 The City Council in Hildale, Utah, sister community to Colorado City across the border, is to vote on the proposal later this month.
 ''We are in a financial cash-flow crisis,'' said Jerry Barlow, the utility's manager. ''We will not be able to pay for the power without some kind of adjustment.''
 Meanwhile, in the documents from the Texas court, the tapestry -- if not the dirty laundry -- of familial F.L.D.S. life has become the stuff of dinner table chitchat. 
 The reports hint, for example, at a network of safe houses where sect members can take refuge for reasons undisclosed. In some cases, wives and children are listed as living ''elsewhere,'' in ''hiding'' or living in a ''house of hiding.''
 The Wylers here in Colorado City were also particularly astounded to learn that Mr. Nielsen, the high-ranking sect official who everyone at the dinner table believed kept his wives and children in Arizona, had another family cluster in Texas. 
 According to the records, Mr. Nielsen, who was 67 in August 2007 when his ''family information sheet'' was completed, had 21 wives, ranging in age from 24 to 79, and 35 children, ranging in age from 6 months to 23, who were living at the Zion ranch until the raid.
 The records do not include the dates of marriages, most of which would have been religious ceremonies with no state civil licenses issued. So the lists are more suggestive than conclusive, for now. Under Texas law, no girl under 16 can legally marry, even with her parents' permission.

HEADLINE: City Council In Bay Area Declares Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: VALLEJO, Calif. 

 BODY:
In a potentially ominous harbinger for some cities in California and elsewhere, the Vallejo City Council voted to declare bankruptcy Tuesday night in the face of dwindling tax revenues, the housing market meltdown and a faltering economy.
 The unanimous vote was cast after late efforts to squeeze concessions out of city employees failed and with the city facing a $16 million shortfall for the fiscal year beginning in July. 
 ''We finally realized there are no other options,'' Councilwoman Joanne Schivley, a retired banker, said. ''We were going to run out of cash come the end of June. It's not a decision that any of us took pleasure in, but there are a lot of other cities that are probably be in the same boat shortly.'' 
 What worries some experts is that some of the problems here are all too common, a steep decrease in property and sales taxes and transfer fees as a result of weakness in the housing market.
 ''At one point, bankruptcy seemed beyond the pale, but it's something that one hears about a lot more now,'' said John Quigley, a professor of economics at University of California, Berkeley. ''And in California, you hear about a lot of cities being pushed to this sort of thinking by the housing crisis.''
 A bayside community of 117,000 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, Vallejo is the largest city in California to declare bankruptcy, though Orange County did so in 1994 after a spate of bad investments. 
 ''With Orange County,'' Professor Quigley said, ''there were identifiable bad guys. This is different. Near as one can tell, this is more of a low-level infection everywhere.''
 Municipal bankruptcies are not unheard of, but are often accompanied by scandal or legal losses. County commissioners in Jefferson County, Ala., are considering bankruptcy amid a federal lawsuit over payments to the mayor of Birmingham, the county seat, and a missed bond payment.
 Smaller cities like Half Moon Bay, Calif., and McCall, Idaho, have also flirted with bankruptcy. In Vallejo, Council members and residents fault decisions by past Councils, including agreeing to binding arbitration for contracts with city employees, whose salaries account for nearly 80 percent of the general fund. 
 Like many Bay Area cities, Vallejo has struggled to keep up with demand for services as its population has grown over 20 years. ''We as a state are growing by 500,000 people a year, and that is continuing to put pressure on the cities,'' said Dan Carigg, the legislative director for the League of California Cities, an association for the 478 cities in the state. ''And when you run short, you tend to have two choices. Cut programs or try to raise revenues.
 ''And when it comes to cities trying to raise new revenues, their options are very limited.''
 Because of propositions approved by voters, California strictly limits increases in property taxes. And in Vallejo, public workers say the cutting has already gone too far. 
 ''We've been doing more with less forever,'' said Detective Mat Mustard, vice president of the Vallejo Police Officers Association, which opposed the bankruptcy declaration. ''We're going to start losing people. Who wants to work for a company or a city that's bankrupt?''
 Council members disputed that public safety or the attractiveness to businesses would be reduced. 
 ''This morning, going around town, it's weird, because everyone's saying congratulations,'' Councilwoman Stephanie Gomes said. ''Its kind of odd to say, but the mood among people is that we're finally going to solve the problems.'' 
 Along the main drag, Georgia Avenue, the sentiment seemed to be more bittersweet. 
 ''I'm sad to see it go this way,'' Debbie Rojas, owner of the Georgia Street Grill, said. ''But I'm kind of excited for bankruptcy.''

HEADLINE: Citi to Send A Top Banker To Dubai

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup announced late Wednesday that it was moving one of its most senior investment bankers to the Middle East, hoping to establish a stronger foothold in the oil-rich region. 
 The banker, Alberto J. Verme, a co-head of investment banking, is expected to head to Dubai by the end of the month after spending four years in London. 
 Mr. Verme will continue to oversee Citigroup's investment banking division alongside Raymond J. McGuire, his co-head based in New York. But he will also take a hands-on role in the region, helping develop relationships with new clients and build Citigroup's presence in the Middle East.
 With a surge in oil revenue and with rapidly rising infrastructure needs, the Middle East has become a crucial area for global banks. 
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, has made it a priority as he focuses the company toward growth opportunities overseas.
 Citigroup hopes that having a top executive in the same time zone as its clients will speed up decision-making, allowing local bankers to avoid the delays of awaiting approvals from their bosses in London, New York or Hong Kong.
 The distance will test the leadership skills of Mr. Verme and Mr. McGuire, who have been praised for having a strong partnership in a bank notorious for its politics. 
 Mr. Verme, a Peruvian national who began his career at the World Bank, has spent the last 14 years at Citigroup and its predecessor firms. He joined Salomon Brothers in 1994 as head of investment banking for Latin America. Mr. Verme was head of global energy, power and chemicals investment banking from 2001 to 2004, before taking on his current role.

HEADLINE: City Officials on Investment Trip

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland 

 BODY:
City Hall is headed to Belfast. 
 About a dozen top New York City officials and staff members, including Speaker Christine C. Quinn of the City Council and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, are landing this week for a government-sponsored investment conference. 
 The trip comes at a politically delicate time for Ms. Quinn, a likely mayoral candidate who is trying to maintain her good-government credentials amid a federal investigation into Council finances. Another official with his eye on the mayor's job, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., is attending, as is Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum. 
 The visit underscores the city's growing stake in the economic revival of Northern Ireland.
 In April, four New York pension funds pledged to put $150 million into a private equity fund focused on infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland, the largest public investment in the region to date. 
 Such an investment would have been unthinkable even five years ago, but in 2007, the Catholic and Protestant political enemies here agreed to share power in a regional government, putting aside decades of violent opposition. 
 Mr. Thompson, who as city comptroller oversees the pension funds, said the creation of a stable government had made Northern Ireland ''an excellent investment opportunity.''
 Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn are attending the U.S.-Northern Ireland Investment Conference at the invitation of Ian Paisley, the first minister of Northern Ireland, and Gordon Brown, the prime minister of Britain. Mr. Bloomberg is to deliver a speech on Thursday to attendees, including executives from Citigroup, Nortel and Allstate. 
 Before leaving New York on Wednesday, Ms. Quinn and the Council unveiled a series of changes to the Council's budget practices to make the system more open and less vulnerable to conflicts of interest. 
 Ms. Quinn announced at a news conference that organizations that receive a council member's discretionary funds of more than $10,000 must meet standards set by the city procurement policy, including having a federal tax ID number. They must also register with the state attorney general's office of charities (unless exempt), and undergo a business integrity check. 
 For fund requests of $10,000 or less, organizations will undergo an internal Council staff review.

HEADLINE: A Plunge Disrupts the Recent Calm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Wall Street markets tumbled the most in nearly a month late Wednesday afternoon, casting some doubt on the staying power of the calm that has settled over investors recently after the winter's tumult.
 Stock charts swooned just after 2 p.m. as shares of banks and financial services firms plummeted, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 200 points by day's end. 
 This week, the Dow appeared on track to break even for the year after sharp losses during the credit crisis. Wednesday's sell-off was a reminder that the problems of recent months had yet to fade, though many analysts attributed the decline to simple jitters. 
 ''There are growing concerns over whether the U.S. economy, which is weak already, might continue to buckle under the pressure of higher oil or gasoline prices,'' said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, an investment strategy firm. 
 Some analysts have labeled the recent uptick a bear market rally, and investors appeared to be taking profits on Wednesday in anticipation of difficult times ahead.
 ''We've had a great run since the March lows,'' said Ryan Larson, a trader at Voyageur Asset Management in Chicago. ''Most of April was great, even the beginning of May was good. I think the market got a little bit ahead of itself.''
 The Dow gave up 206.48 points, falling to 12,814.35, after spending much of the day ambling through negative territory. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broadest measure of the American stock market, closed down 1.8 percent, its worst day since April 11. The S.& P. lost 25.69 points, to 1,392.57. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell about 1.8 percent, or 44.82 points, to 2,438.49.
 The sell-off picked up speed in the final hour, not an uncommon occurrence in the jumpy environment of Wall Street, where a pack mentality often prevails.
 ''Selling begets more selling,'' said David Kovacs, an investment strategist at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa.
 The drop also coincided with a speech by the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox, who called for more stringent federal oversight of investment banks. As a pre-emptive measure against collapses like the one that recently led to the sale of Bear Stearns, Mr. Cox said the commission was seeking more disclosure of banks' liquidity levels. 
 Wall Street rarely cheers an increase in regulation, and Mr. Cox's comments may have worried some investors. ''It's a big deal because the S.E.C.'s regulation of the broker dealers has been light,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, a consulting firm that works with investment banks on strategies for risk management. 
 Whether the comments affected the market as a whole was an open question. At least four investment strategists, interviewed after Wednesday's close, said they had been unaware of Mr. Cox's remarks.
 Some of the fear among investors may have been set off by a spate of bad news on the housing front. In remarks at the White House on Wednesday, President Bush vowed to veto a House bill that would help troubled homeowners avoid foreclosure through a federally financed refinancing process.
 The president's announcement that he would scuttle the bill, sponsored by Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, came hours after a real estate agents' group reported that many prospective home buyers were unable to obtain mortgages in March. 
 And on Tuesday, Fannie Mae, the big mortgage lender, cut its dividend after announcing a $2.2 billion loss in the first quarter. Its shares dropped 5.7 percent on Wednesday. Countrywide Financial, another major lender, finished the day off by 7.5 percent. 
 The government also reported on Wednesday that American businesses cut jobs and reduced employees' hours in an effort to save money last quarter. 
 Even as the labor market weakens, Americans are being squeezed by the soaring cost of oil, which affects the price of everyday products like gasoline and household staples like vacuum cleaners and toiletries. 
 Oil reached a new record high on Wednesday, trading at $123.53 a barrel, up $1.69 from Tuesday's price.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 97 6/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.85 percent, from 3.92 percent.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Delta and Northwest Defend a Merger

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chief executives of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines defended on Wednesday their plans to merge, telling a Senate subcommittee that the consolidation was essential to preserve jobs and service to small cities, and to compete with foreign-flag carriers. They also insisted that consumers would not suffer. 
 But members of the subcommittee on aviation were generally skeptical about the economic prospects of the merged airline and the ailing industry in general. Delta and Northwest agreed in mid-April to a $3.1 billion deal that would create the world's biggest airline. 
 Referring to soaring oil prices, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said that even after a merger, ''you're still going to run fuel through your planes.'' Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said it appeared that the airlines were losing money on each ticket and trying to make up for the losses on volume. 
 And John D. Rockefeller IV, of West Virginia, chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, said, ''I don't discount myself entirely from consideration of re-regulation of the airline industry.'' 
 Three witnesses seated at the table with the airlines' chief executives -- the head of a flight attendants' union, the leader of a machinists' union and a consumer advocate -- also raised the idea of re-regulation.
 Despite misgivings among some senators, Congress does not seem poised to block the merger, which is subject to review by the Justice Department. 
 ''I like to have more American airlines competing with each other, and giving the consumer the best service and price,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. But, she added, ''I don't think it's the role of Congress to step in and try to impart our policies on these airlines, at least not as it applies to mergers.''
 The rationale for the Delta-Northwest merger is to save a billion dollars a year, a figure that prompted several lawmakers to ask about the future of reservations centers and other places of employment by airlines. 
 And a merger that sets off a wave of others poses more challenges. Another witness, Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities, said that mergers could be ''messy, time-consuming and, in many cases, disruptive of services.'' If several occur simultaneously, ''it could create, if not done properly, panic among the traveling public,'' he said.
 But, he added, ''This industry is going to have to restructure one way or the other. It's either going to restructure through the guidance of regulators and politicians through orderly mergers, or bankruptcy courts will take care of it.'' He said that future bankruptcies would be ''for real'' and would involve liquidations.
 The consumer advocate, Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, said that without new regulations, the merger would lead to ''fewer choices, higher prices and crummier service.'' But he said that those probably lay ahead even without a merger.
 ''It's time for Congress to consider the proposition that this industry just does not work as an unregulated market,'' he said. 
 The president of the Association of Flight Attendants, Patricia A. Friend, did not speak against the idea of a merger but said that this one was becoming ''a vehicle for union-busting.'' Delta's pilots are unionized, but most of its other employees are not. 
 But the chief executive of Delta, Richard H. Anderson, said that a merger was the only path forward. Mr. Anderson said, ''We're here telling you we want to combine these two great airlines so we can be much stronger and much more durable.''

HEADLINE: The Tax Trickery Spreads

 BODY:
It was bad enough when Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain decided to engage in some petty pandering by calling for a suspension of the federal gas tax over the summer. What they suggested would reduce needed tax revenues and hamper efforts to combat global warming. And it would fail to deliver lower prices while giving oil companies more money. But neither senator is actually running the country, so it might be tempting to chalk it all up to campaign pandering. 
 Unfortunately, their demagoguery is growing into a real problem, setting off a chain reaction of ''me too'' proposals across the country to suspend state gasoline taxes, which tend to be much larger than the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal levy. If the pandering spreads, it would go a long way in setting the nation's energy strategy in precisely the wrong direction.
 Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida is fighting to trim 10 cents from the state gas tax during two weeks in July. In New York, Senate Republicans proposed a bill to cut state taxes by 32 cents a gallon from Memorial Day to Labor Day. In Missouri, the House approved a bill to give drivers a rebate for the 17.6-cent-a-gallon tax during the summer. Calls to suspend or trim the tax have arisen from Texas legislators and candidates for governor in Indiana and North Carolina. 
 These ideas share a common purpose: appearing to be doing something to ease hard-pressed voters' pain at the pump. Not only are they costly, but they will not do that. Suspending the federal tax would cost $9 billion. In New York, the suspension would blow a $500 million hole in state finances. Consumers in some states could benefit from lower state gas taxes because wholesalers could import gas from other states. Still, with refineries producing almost at full capacity, the tax break would prompt a jump in demand that would push up prices.
 As Damien Cave reported in The Times, when Illinois and Indiana suspended about 7 cents of their gas taxes in the summer of 2000, prices fell only 4 cents -- generating savings for drivers of about $2.50 a month at a substantial cost to state budgets. With supplies today tight as a drum, the gain for drivers could be smaller.
 Senator Barack Obama has not joined the call for a tax cut, but Mrs. Clinton stuck to the idea, arguing that economists are elitists so one should not trust their judgment. Mr. McCain's defense is simpler: he has already admitted that he understands next to nothing about economics. 
 Americans must find ways to curb their use of fossil fuels. That will require higher, not lower, prices for gas -- even during a presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: New Vision for Catskill Development, Without Cards

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: THOMPSON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
This once-prosperous resort town, where the ghosts of bustling hotels loom from wooded roadsides, was dealt a serious blow earlier this year when the federal government quashed a decades-long effort to bring casino gambling to the Catskills. 
 But just as the prospect of a Las Vegas-style casino has faded, an unlikely potential savior has emerged in the form of Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester County builder who revamped downtown New Rochelle and brought a Ritz-Carlton to where 99-cent shops used to stand in downtown White Plains.
 Mr. Cappelli, a buddy of Donald J. Trump's who starts his days before dawn and flies jets for fun, has quietly acquired three of the biggest names of borscht belt hospitality lore: the Concord, Grossinger's and Kutsher's. While putting Kutsher's and Grossinger's on the back burner, he is planning a billion-dollar development dubbed Concord Entertainment City at the site of the old hotel.
 Demolition has already begun, and Mr. Cappelli has teamed up with Empire Resorts to move the nearby Monticello racetrack and its slot machines here as part of a new resort that would initially include several hundred hotel rooms and convention space as well as 500 vacation homes. Empire owns Monticello. 
 Although there would not be table games of the kind offered in Atlantic City and Connecticut, the hope is that people would come from New York City (about an 80-mile trip) and elsewhere for a range of amusements in a striking mountain landscape: golf, tennis, hiking, water sports and, yes, slot machines and horse racing. 
 Residents who were whipsawed over two decades by the elusive quest for Indian casinos seem almost relieved to put it behind them. Many say that Mr. Cappelli's investment comes at an ideal time -- the shiny new Bethel Woods Center for the Arts is gaining traction, and an exclusive $50 million private auto racetrack is set to open this summer. And they are hopeful that his infusion of capital and energy could attract other developers to Sullivan County. 
 ''It's bittersweet,'' Anthony P. Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson, said of the demolition of the Concord. ''It's sad to see history going down in a big pile. But we have to move on and bring economic development back to Sullivan County. If anyone can do it, Louis is the guy. His track record is proven.''
 Mr. Cappelli, who is also involved in an ambitious $3 billion plan to redevelop the downtown and waterfront in Yonkers, was one of several investors who snatched up property in Sullivan County in recent years, betting that the area would take off when, and if, casinos arrived. 
 Since 1999, his firm, Cappelli Enterprises, has invested some $100 million in the area. Mr. Cappelli and other investors bought the Concord Resort and Golf Club, which was in bankruptcy, for $10.5 million that year. Soon after, he bought Grossinger's for $6 million, and this spring he negotiated an option to buy Kutsher's Country Club for $35 million. To signal his commitment, Mr. Cappelli gave the Kutsher family -- among the most vocal proponents of casino gambling -- a nonrefundable payment of $2.5 million.
 For years Mr. Cappelli waited as various Indian tribes and development partners sought permission to build casinos. He paid the property taxes, financed some minor site improvements and kept the golf courses going at the shuttered Grossinger's and Concord hotels.
 So why is he so bullish on the Catskills now that the federal government has finally said no to casinos tied to Indian land claims here?
 ''When the secretary of the interior rejected outright the Indian gaming proposal, it focused us on the fact that we had to take this by the horns ourselves and do something with the property,'' he said in a telephone interview, referring to the 1,750-acre Concord site. ''I think it's a beautiful alternative to going four hours on the expressway to the Hamptons. It's an undiscovered jewel that has to be pulled out of the box.''
 Mr. Cappelli started demolition last week at the Concord with little fanfare. That was partly because he had swung the wrecking ball there once before -- in 2000 -- for what was supposed to be a 525-room hotel. He invited hundreds of guests, including Helen Kutsher, to a luncheon to celebrate the start of construction. There were balloons and live jazz. But the Sept. 11 attacks and a lack of progress on the gambling ventures thwarted that proposal, and the demolition was never finished.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Cappelli has been selling his plan around Sullivan County and Albany. To pull off a billion-dollar development in a struggling location at a time of tightened bank lending, Mr. Cappelli says he needs the state to provide some financial assistance. One idea he has floated is a reduction, to 25 percent from 68 percent, in the state's annual share of the revenue from the 1,500 slot machines that he plans to move from the Monticello Raceway.
 Mr. Cappelli argues that such a share would be more in line with what New York State had been prepared to offer the St. Regis Mohawk tribe for a casino at Monticello Raceway. Moreover, he says that incorporating the slot machines into a luxury resort with name-brand entertainment would increase the total state revenue from gambling, even with the reduction. He has met with state lawmakers to propose alternate options as well, including the creation of a special state development zone with generous tax incentives and credits.
 ''Without any help at all, we can't do it,'' Mr. Cappelli said. ''There's no way.''
 State lawmakers who represent Sullivan County support his plan and appear confident that some sort of financial package will be negotiated before the legislative session winds down next month in Albany. ''It's a win-win for Mr. Cappelli and a win-win for the communities around it,'' Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from Mount Hope, said of the proposal. ''It's just what Sullivan County needs -- an upscale resort with the racetrack and the racino all in close proximity.''
 Assemblywoman Aileen M. Gunther, a Democrat who represents Sullivan and Orange Counties, said that ''there's conversation'' in Albany about Mr. Cappelli's proposal and that the reaction seems mostly positive. ''They're talking about it, and Louis has done a road show so people in the area feel comfortable,'' she said.
 Any financial assistance would have to be approved by the Senate, Assembly and governor's office, however. 
 Still, there is a sense among local and state officials that Mr. Cappelli is poised to finally make something happen in an area that despite some recent successes, still has a downtrodden feel, with faded billboards and cracked roadways. They cite his caffeinated personality, his ability to read the real estate market and his already considerable investment in Sullivan County. 
 Those officials see downtown White Plains, with its sleek new apartment and hotel towers bearing names like Trump and Ritz-Carlton, as an example of Mr. Cappelli's real-estate wizardry. His projects, including a retail-and-entertainment complex there called City Center, coaxed empty-nesters to trade in grand homes in Purchase and Rye for $2 million apartments in a city that until recently had soup kitchens but no Starbucks, or even a movie theater.
 ''Of all the things I've seen, his idea for the racetrack at the Concord makes the most sense,'' said Mrs. Kutsher's son, Mark, in a recent interview at the hotel his grandparents started 101 years ago. ''It's achievable. Six weeks ago I didn't know the man. I met him at a town meeting in Thompson, and we hammered out an agreement in a week.''
 As for Kutsher's and Grossinger's, Mr. Cappelli says he is working on master plans for those properties and envisions ''a lot of open space'' with town houses and golf courses. ''It's a fantastic area,'' he said of Sullivan County, where he vacationed as a boy with his extended family. ''The Poconos are being revitalized in Pennsylvania, and there's absolutely no reason that the Catskills can't revitalize also. Everybody had roots in the Catskills -- entertainers, boxers, you name it.''
 Ever the optimist, Mr. Cappelli has not counted out the possibility of bringing casinos to the Catskills -- one day. ''Table games aren't in the cards right now,'' he said, ''but you have to walk before you run.''

HEADLINE: Mural Tests Vermont Law That Forbids Billboards

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BELLOWS FALLS, Vt. 

 BODY:
It was meant to be a throwback to the days of romantic Sunday drives -- a mural painted on the side of a red barn urging passing drivers to ''See Bellows Falls,'' a town whose Main Street conjures up bygone days.
 But despite its retro charm, the sign has become a lightning rod of controversy in a state that, for four decades, has been determined to keep its landscape free of commercial intrusion. 
 In February, a state board ruled that the painting, finished in October, runs afoul of the state's billboard law, and must be removed. In response, the legislature passed a measure on Saturday that exempts this mural and ones like it -- hand-painted signs that urge drivers to visit a designated downtown -- from the law. 
 Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican, has yet to sign the measure, which was attached to a state transportation bill. Line-item vetoes are not allowed in Vermont, and it is unlikely Mr. Douglas will veto the entire $415 million bill when it arrives on his desk in the next few weeks. The select board in the town of Rockingham, where the mural stands and which includes Bellows Falls, unanimously approved the mural Tuesday night, a requirement of the new law. 
 To some, the exemption will help promote downtowns like that of Bellows Falls, which after years of neglect is trying to rebound as an artist's village. Others think the exemption will put the state on the road to mammoth highway billboards. 
 ''That's the fear, of course,'' said John Zicconi, a spokesman for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. ''Time will tell, but clearly here in Vermont we can now have what people classify as billboards. We think it's bad policy. Vermonters are very proud of the antibillboard law. This is the first significant alteration to it, and, frankly, we don't believe Vermonters support it.'' 
 The legislation says the exempt signs must be hand-painted on a structure that has been standing for at least 25 years. They must direct people to a designated downtown no more than three miles away. 
 The Bellows Falls mural was commissioned for about $4,500 last year by the village's Downtown Development Alliance, a nonprofit community-development organization. The alliance asked an artist to paint the mural on a barn that is visible from an offramp on Interstate 91.
 ''To have something beautiful that served the town, we thought it was a great idea,'' said Charlie Hunter, president of the downtown alliance. 
 The alliance received permission for the mural from the local select board, but did not notify the state. Because the mural was outside the immediate downtown, visible from the Interstate and large -- 7 feet tall by 31 feet long -- the state said it had to be taken down. 
 ''Just because a sign is pretty doesn't necessarily mean it's something Vermonters want on the side of their highways,'' Mr. Zicconi said. 
 Mr. Hunter and others concede that they did not notify the proper officials. 
 ''I told the group when they hired me that you can't do this because it's against the law,'' said Frank Hawkins, who painted the mural. ''As a sign painter, it's unequivocally a sign to me.'' 
 Residents and legislators, however, saw the mural as a creative piece that complemented the village's desire to become a destination for artists. Most of them support the billboard law, which was enacted in 1968. Alaska, Hawaii and Maine have similar laws. 
 ''In my thinking it's a beautiful piece of work and people just love it,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''It's not like a trial lawyer's billboard.''
 State Representative Carolyn W. Partridge, a Windham Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said her goal was not to pave the way for large-scale advertisements. 
 ''I'm satisfied that the language is narrow enough that we're not going to have an explosion of billboards in Vermont,'' Ms. Partridge said. ''I just don't see this happening everywhere, and if a similar mural were put up in another town, I wouldn't have a problem with it.'' 
 Mr. Hunter does not agree that the billboard law is at risk. 
 ''It maintains the integrity of the billboard law, which everybody agrees with,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''It's allowing murals that are germane to struggling small villages. It's allowing a broader lexicon of artistic expression.''

HEADLINE: As News Corporation Posts Wide Gains, Murdoch Keeps His Sights on Newsday

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
In the News Corporation's earnings conference call on Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch voiced skepticism that Cablevision can succeed in its bid for Newsday, which is now at the center of a tussle among three New York moguls, even as he vowed not to get into a bidding war for the newspaper.
 Mr. Murdoch spoke on the call with Wall Street analysts and the press after the release of quarterly earnings from the News Corporation, the global media conglomerate he controls. On the call, he said, ''no, I don't think Cablevision will prevail; just be patient for a couple days.'' 
 Several weeks ago it appeared that News Corporation had a tentative deal to buy Newsday, based on Long Island, for about $580 million, but two other bidders have come forward. 
 Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner of The Daily News, matched Mr. Murdoch's offer, while Cablevision, the Long Island cable operator that also owns Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks and Rangers, was a late entrant but upped the ante to $650 million.
 Mr. Murdoch has set his sights on Newsday because he sees it as a way to eliminate losses at The New York Post, a News Corporation property that loses an estimated $50 million a year. By combining Newsday and The Post, the company believes it could earn about $50 million a year in profit.
 Mr. Murdoch said Wednesday that the company was taking separate steps to stem losses at The Post. He said the paper would raise its cover price within the next two weeks to 50 cents, from a quarter. Other initiatives could save the paper roughly $20 million a year, Mr. Murdoch said. Raising the price is risky, given that last year an increase to 50 cents was quickly reversed as sales suffered.
 For the quarter ended March 31, News Corporation reported a 16 percent gain in both operating income and revenue, mainly from growth in the television and cable networks businesses.
 Revenue was $8.75 billion and operating income was $1.4 billion. Earnings per share were 30 cents, slightly lower than Wall Street analysts had anticipated.
 In the period last year, earnings were 27 cents a share on revenue of $7.5 billion.
 The television unit, which broadcasts ''American Idol'' and this year carried the Super Bowl, reported operating income of $419 million, up 53 percent from a year ago. The cable business, which includes the Fox News channel, reported operating income of $330 million, up 17 percent from a year ago.
 ''We delivered growth from established businesses, such as our newspapers, and we delivered growth from our developing assets, such as our international cable channels and Fox Interactive Media,'' Mr. Murdoch said in a statement. ''Our ability to generate returns from a multitude of sources puts us in a great position to maintain our financial momentum even in times of economic uncertainty.''
 News Corporation assets include the 20th Century Fox movie studio, the Fox broadcast network, MySpace and newspapers in Australia, London and the United States.
 Since closing a deal last December to acquire Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, for about $5 billion, Mr. Murdoch has been a busy mogul. In addition to the takeover battle for Newsday, News Corporation has been involved in discussions with both Microsoft and Yahoo about potential combinations with MySpace.
 Fox Interactive Media, which includes MySpace, will fall short of the company's earlier forecast of $1 billion in revenue for 2008. Revenue will be about 10 percent, or $100 million, short of the estimate, the company's president, Peter A. Chernin, said.

HEADLINE: Republicans Focus on Obama as Fall Opponent

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
At least one political party is acting like it knows who the Democratic nominee will be: the Republicans, who have greatly stepped up their criticisms of Senator Barack Obama in recent weeks while practically ignoring Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 For weeks, Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has directed his most pointed barbs at Mr. Obama. The Republican National Committee prominently features an anti-Obama advertisement on its Web site's home page, which has no mention of Mrs. Clinton. 
 And at least one independent group that had prepared advertisements attacking Mrs. Clinton is compiling material to produce new ones attacking Mr. Obama.
 Officials in the McCain campaign and at the Republican National Committee say that they have not counted Mrs. Clinton out, but some Republicans say that the outcome is clear. ''Right now Hillary Clinton may not be able to do the math, but Republicans have been for the last couple of weeks,'' said Kevin Madden, a Republican consultant who worked on Mitt Romney's campaign this year.
 Some of the issues that Republicans are beginning to raise paint a picture of what the fall election strategy against Mr. Obama might look like. Some are traditional, using Mr. Obama's support for withdrawing the troops from Iraq to portray him as weak on national security and his opposition to suspending the federal gas tax this summer to show him as a tax-and-spend Democrat.
 A rotating banner at the top of the Republican Party home page asks, ''Why does Barack Obama want to increase taxes again and drive up the cost of gasoline on Americans?'' It also ties him to the liberal group MoveOn.org, and features an advertisement called ''Barack Obama's Gas Tax Hypocrisy,'' noting that while he now opposes suspending the gas tax, he once supported a similar measure when he was an Illinois lawmaker. 
 ''Barack Obama just doesn't get it,'' a narrator intones. ''Does he understand our economy, and what American families and businesses need? Barack Obama. Out of touch. Not ready to be president.''
 Another line of attack seems to be squarely directed at independent and swing voters, whom both the McCain and Obama campaigns have been courting. The McCain campaign has argued that Mr. Obama lacks a record of bipartisan achievement to back up his calls for healing partisan rifts in Washington and getting things done. That issue was underscored this week when, in a speech on the judiciary, Mr. McCain contrasted his own willingness to vote for President Bill Clinton's judicial nominees with Mr. Obama's votes against President Bush's judicial nominees, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
 ''Senator Obama in particular likes to talk up his background as a lecturer on law, and also as someone who can work across the aisle to get things done,'' Mr. McCain said. ''But when Judge Roberts was nominated, it seemed to bring out more the lecturer in Senator Obama than it did the guy who can get things done. He went right along with the partisan crowd, and was among the 22 senators to vote against this highly qualified nominee.''
 Charlie Black, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, said that the campaign was prepared to face either Democrat in the general election and did not have a preference. ''I guess if you were trying to quantify it, you would certainly say Senator Obama's odds have gone up some,'' Mr. Black said, ''but we continue to believe that you never count Senator Clinton out.''
 A memorandum written Wednesday by Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, however, analyzed the race as if Mr. Obama, and not Mrs. Clinton, would be the opponent. 
 It did not go unnoticed that Mr. McCain began the day after Mr. Obama's North Carolina victory in Michigan, the traditional home of the so-called Reagan Democrats. 
 Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, said that Mr. Obama had reached across the aisle to enact ethics legislation both in the United States Senate and in Illinois. ''None of their attacks surprise, as they don't have a positive record to run on,'' Mr. Burton said. ''The last eight years have been a disaster, and they're going to go back to the same old wheelhouse of partisan hackery to try to win this election.''
 Mr. McCain has -- with the exception of one day in Florida -- avoided talking about Mr. Obama's incendiary former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. But in recent weeks Mr. McCain has questioned Mr. Obama's association with William Ayers, a former member of the radical group Weather Underground, and suggested, after a member of Hamas made a supportive statement about Mr. Obama, that ''it's clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States.''
 Other groups say that they will not be so reticent about Mr. Wright. David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United, an independent conservative group, said that after preparing anti-Clinton material, his group was now beginning to focus on Mr. Obama. He said that they would investigate Mr. Wright, Mr. Ayres and Antoin Rezko, a friend and supporter of Mr. Obama who is on trial in Illinois. 
 ''We will have ads framing Senator Obama as the out-of-touch, limousine liberal that he is,'' said Mr. Bossie, whose political action fund had $800,000 in the bank at the end of March, according to election filings. 
 Mr. Obama girded for the onslaught in his victory speech on Tuesday night. 
 ''Yes, we know what's coming,'' he said. ''I'm not naive. We've already seen it, the same names and labels they always pin on everyone who doesn't agree with all their ideas, the same efforts to distract us from the issues that affect our lives, by pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy, in the hopes that the media will play along.''

HEADLINE: A Tale Of Two Cities, Only One With Sewers

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Gordhandas Soni, the owner of an Indian food company, agreed to relocate his warehouse and factory to Willets Point, Queens, back in 1990, it never occurred to him to ask about some of the more basic amenities -- the sewage system, for example. ''You never ask, 'You have sewers here?' '' said Mr. Soni, whose business is called House of Spices. ''In America, right here, in the heart of New York City? No! It never occurred to me to ask. It would be silly to ask.'' 
 By the time Mr. Soni figured out that there was no modern-day sewage system in place, he said, he was too far along in the deal to back out. But he couldn't have missed some other glaring problems that plague the area, just east of Shea Stadium. It is not unusual for visitors to his factory to get about halfway down his street, Willets Point Boulevard, and then turn around, convinced that no thriving business could possibly have its home there. The streets in the area, bounded by Willets Point Boulevard, 126th Street and Northern Boulevard, lined bumper-to-bumper with auto-body shops and junkyards, are famously puddled, potholed and barely paved. The ride is so uneven, so hard on a vehicle (to say nothing of the passengers), it's as if the road is conspiring with the repair shops to deliver them even more business. 
 Mr. Soni was willing to put up with primitive plumbing and the developing-nation aesthetic of the area, known as the Iron Triangle, for a great deal and a chance to expand. At the time, the city, eager for his business in the area, offered perks like low-interest loans and a freeze on real estate taxes for 20 years. Now, 18 years later, the same city that lured him to the area is trying to coax him away, as it paves the way for a huge, green redevelopment of the area that would include restaurants, housing, a convention center, parks and shops to go hand-in-hand with the Mets new baseball stadium across the street. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation has been trying to strike a deal with House of Spices, searching to find it a site elsewhere, but Mr. Soni says that so far, he and the city have not been able to agree on the true value of his property.
 Mr. Soni's business started when a $10 rent increase put a Jackson Heights grocer out of business and gave Mr. Soni the opportunity to take over the lease back in the early '70s.
 Mr. Soni, who had immigrated in 1964, was a civil engineer when his wife's frustration with finding her favorite spices inspired his business model.
 He started importing spices like tamarind and turmeric to cater to the new wave of Indian immigrants in Queens, eventually building the business into the largest manufacturer and distributor of Indian food in America. It is fairly typical for Indian families living in the United States to have a kitchen stocked with Laxmi chickpea flour, the brand milled by House of Spices, or to bring the company's nut-and-chickpea-based sweets on a visit to someone's home.
 House of Spices is one of those New York businesses that performs a kind of ethnic alchemy, importing ginger from Brazil, grinding it into a ginger-and-garlic paste at the plant in Willets Point, and selling it to Americans, and to Indians living in America, as an Indian product as authentic as any one could find in Mumbai -- all for a market specialized enough that only a teeming multicultural city could create a big enough demand to make the business worthwhile.
 Now Mr. Soni has banded together with 11 other businesses in Willets Point, filing a suit charging that the city has neglected to repair potholes and provide basic services like sewers and snow plowing, in an effort to devalue the property and ease the path to redevelopment. 
 Put in the sewers, and fix the potholes, he and his allies contend, and Willets Point will redevelop itself. The city, in reply, concedes that might be true -- but because the area is on a flood plain, the city couldn't provide sewers without removing the businesses, creating an unfortunate but intractable chicken-and-egg situation. 
 The Economic Development Corporation said that it had gone so far as to make a down payment on a Bronx property that Mr. Soni identified as a potential site, but the negotiations are continuing.
 Even if the city could make him whole, Mr. Soni wonders, why shouldn't he get some additional compensation for the inconvenience of losing his property? As he put it, why should the city ''take away from the small guy like me and give to a billion dollar company just so he can make another billion dollars?'' 
 From the city's point of view, said Seth Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, ''we feel obligated to make sure people are fairly compensated, that we're not wasting the city's resources.''
 Although it's never easy for American manufacturers to compete with their counterparts in India -- especially when it comes to something like an Indian food product -- Mr. Soni says that he would be thrilled with his prospects were it not for this major uncertainty hanging over his head, and the threat that the city could invoke eminent domain to take the property. 
 ''I always thought India would be my competition, that India would run me out of business,'' he said, watching a machine fill jars with a dark, rich tamarind paste. ''I didn't think it would be New York City.''

LENGTH: 1194 words

HEADLINE: An 'Our Town' Stage for the Creative Set

BYLINE: By MEGHAN McEWEN

 BODY:
THREE OAKS was once just another small southwestern Michigan farm town burdened by a sluggish local economy. But in recent years, pioneering Chicagoans with a creative bent have transformed Three Oaks, about 70 miles away, into a hot spot for second-home buyers smitten with the arts.
 Even so, real estate prices are a fraction of what they are along Lake Michigan, just seven miles due west. And cradled by swaying cornfields and still bisected by the tracks of the former Michigan Central Railroad, Elm Street has the charm of a Rockwellian vision.
 Art galleries and newer stores selling bikes, clothes and vintage furniture mingle with longstanding establishments, including a fourth-generation butcher shop, Drier's Meat Market, which the poet Carl Sandburg once patronized. There's a bakery and organic deli, Froehlich's, whose owner, Colleen Froehlich, moved to Three Oaks nearly 15 years ago, when there were 22 empty storefronts downtown.
 These days, there's not a storefront available, and not a chain store in sight. Formerly forlorn streets are being spruced up by the renovating of farmhouses and the landscaping of front yards. 
 Many second-home buyers in the region want waterfront property, but Three Oaks's second-home residents are lured by the land and its striking farmland views. 
 Allen and Lynn Turner, who took up their second residence in Three Oaks in 1991, own what they jokingly call a ''family summer camp'' on 250 acres of woods, farmland and prairie, complete with five ponds, cows, pigs and chickens. (The family has turned 150 acres into a wildlife preserve.) They rebuilt an old farmhouse, which dates to the Civil War, and an Amish barn that now includes a basketball court. 
 ''I'm an outdoors person,'' said Mr. Turner, who fly-fishes on his property every morning. ''When I sit in our kitchen at night, and look at the sunset to the west over my fields, it is spectacular. I step out in the yard, and geese fly above.''
 Mr. Turner, a partner in the Pritzker Organization investment firm and chairman of Columbia College in Chicago, has watched (and helped) Three Oaks change. 
 ''I was there when the stores were empty,'' he said. ''Now it's a thriving community with people interested in the idea of a cultural oasis. This is not a tourist stop. There are no fudge shops or T-shirt stores. It's a real community.''
 Lynn Kean, who lives in Evanston, Ill., recently finished renovating her second Three Oaks rehab. With five grandchildren to accommodate, Ms. Kean had to buy a bigger place with more bedrooms. She fell in love two years ago with a wooden Victorian that was in foreclosure, going for $115,000.
 She hired a ''meticulous local craftsman,'' investing another $100,000 in the renovation, taking the house all the way down to the studs, knocking out walls and creating spacious living spaces from tiny, fractured rooms.
 ''It had good bones,'' she said. ''This house has turned out to be an incredibly magical experience. I'm a working stiff, so I don't have a lot of opportunities to create. This is my creative outlet: taking a tired house and making it beautiful again.''
 The Scene
 Every Saturday night in warm weather, full- and part-time residents, carrying lawn chairs and snacks, stroll to the park for free concerts that range from barbershop harmonies to acoustic rock. Art festivals, gallery walks and outdoor performances, like the annual Shakespeare in the Park, cram the cultural roster throughout spring and summer.
 The Vickers, a renovated art-house film theater, features small-run independent and foreign films, and art galleries outnumber bars. The village has a poet laureate and a volunteer radio station. And every weekend, an organic farmers' market spreads out, displaying produce grown at nearby farms. 
 ''I don't know many other small, getaway towns that are this progressive,'' said Aron Packer, an art gallery owner from Chicago who also owns the Packer Schopf Gallery here. ''There's a silent film festival here every summer. There's an organic grocery store, and a yoga studio above my gallery.'' 
 Mr. Packer also owns a gallery in Chicago, also called Packer Schopf, known for hard-edged contemporary works. 
 ''I haven't had to change my focus here,'' said Mr. Packer, who rents a pied-a-terre in town. ''It's just as contemporary, just as challenging as my Chicago gallery.''
 ''The draw of Three Oaks is the culture,'' said David Fink, who renovated part of a 19th-century corset-bone factory with his partner, Kim Clark, a screenwriting professor and playwright. They paid $90,000 in 2001 for their section, then, after an investment of several hundred thousand dollars, created a loft-like residence and the Acorn Theater, now one of the town's cultural anchors, featuring plays, concerts and improvisational comedy.
 ''You can afford to do things you can't afford to do in the city,'' said Mr. Fink, who splits his time between Three Oaks and Chicago, where he's a board member of the Poetry Center of Chicago. ''There's an incredibly strong creative community, and second-home owners here are willing to do something in the evening other than drink. The people are interesting and wacky, and there's a lot of diversity.''
 Pros
 One of Three Oaks's assets is its proximity to Lake Michigan and Chicago. But Mr. Fink said, ''We're not right on the water, and that's what keeps us safe from overdevelopment.'' 
 The town is part of what is promoted as Harbor Country, eight communities in Berrien County on or near the lake, and Three Oaks is within 10 minutes of the area's biggest vacation draws: white-sand beaches, hiking and biking trails and the Warren Dunes State Park, known for its hard-to-climb dunes and hang gliding. It is also near many Michigan wineries and the antique shops that dot the Red Arrow Highway, which parallels the lake.
 Cons
 If you aren't interested in a fixer-upper or buying land to build on (it goes for about $1,000 an acre), the options are limited. 
 The Real Estate Market
 Three Oaks is certainly not a luxury market. It is a village of 1930s farmhouses and other modest dwellings that come with small price tags -- with the prices of most houses falling between $120,000 and $300,000. Ninety percent of all buyers are second-home buyers, said Bob Khoury, an agent with Olson Real Estate, most from Chicago. 
 He added that the town has changed significantly in the last three years, and that real estate prices are rising, going against the national trend. ''We're blessed with Chicago being so close,'' Mr. Khoury said.
 In the fixer-upper department, Brian Overley and Alan DeBaugh sold a two-story German farmhouse for $289,000 to second-home owners last fall, after renovating it in conjunction with Marco Polo, the vintage home-furnishings store they own in nearby Lakeside. They added a vaulted second-floor master bathroom and a screened-in porch, but their updates were mostly cosmetic, like wall treatments and new countertops and fixtures.
 ''We didn't do anything extravagant, but we did it right,'' Mr. DeBaugh said. ''Everyone said we would not be able to sell it at that price, but it sold at the first open house.''

HEADLINE: Salmon Gone, Fishermen Try to Adapt on a Changing Coast

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, Ore. 

 BODY:
So long, salmon. Steve Wilson is refitting his 51-foot troller to fish for the future. No longer will he cast for the conflicted symbol of Northwest abundance and bitterness. No more fishing for a myth. 
 His new pursuit?
 ''Prawns,'' said Mr. Wilson, nearly bursting out laughing because, here in Salmon Nation, he could not quite believe things had come to this. ''It's what you call a 'developmental fishery.' We don't know if we'll make any money in it, but we figured we could either go broke sitting still or we could go broke working.'' 
 With most of Oregon and California's commercial salmon fishery shut down because of sharp declines in the number of the fish returning to the Sacramento River to spawn, Mr. Wilson and many other fishermen are looking for almost any alternative, trying to diversify along with the rest of the regional economy. In some cases, they are investing money they received from the federal government because of a partial shutdown of salmon fishing in 2006.
 This year, the governors of the three West Coast states, citing what they say will be a $290 million economic loss, have asked Congress to again provide disaster relief.
 Mr. Wilson said he would spend at least $15,000 to convert his boats. If the pursuit of prawns lacks the local lore of hooking Chinook salmon, at least it might pay. Prawns, Mr. Wilson noted, are something of an upper-crust crustacean, ''for the high-end market, high-end restaurants.'' 
 That just happens to be the same market that is slowly making tourism and retirees as important as fishing and logging once were on the Oregon coast, even here on the remote and misty southwestern shore.
 ''You can't even find these around here,'' Mr. Wilson said as he and two crew members carried newly delivered traps out to his boat. ''I've been talking to Canadian fishermen, been looking on the Internet. We've gone from not knowing anything about prawns to probably knowing more about prawns than anybody else on the southwest coast.''
 With the shutdown this year, a slow year in 2007 and the partial closing in 2006, salmon fishermen in Oregon and California are facing the third straight year of trying to find other ways to make a living in the summer. Some have gotten out of fishing altogether, while others have tried to stretch out the winter crab season or go after typically less reliable and profitable black cod or tuna. Farther up the coast, in Newport, Ore., some plan to plow north to near the Washington border, where a very limited salmon season has just opened. Still others say they will head to Alaska.
 In a strong season, a top-performing salmon fisherman might gross as much as $100,000. But the forecast for next year is dim, too, and questions over ocean temperatures, the health of Northwest rivers, environmental restrictions and disputes over water rights make some fishermen and economists question what kind of future commercial salmon fishing has here. 
 While recreational fishing has held relatively steady, the number of commercial salmon boats bringing in significant catches has shrunk. Of the 1,200 or so boats licensed to fish for salmon in Oregon, only about 150 have caught more than $30,000 worth of salmon each year in the decade before 2006, according to Hans Radtke, an economist who analyzes commercial fishing in Oregon. 
 ''As a producing commodity for salmon, we haven't been there for 20 or 30 years, and it's not going to be there,'' Mr. Radtke said. 
 Unlike in 2006, when the partial shutdown affected only commercial fishermen, the shutdown this year also applies to recreational fishermen. Here in Charleston and the rest of the southwestern coast, there is particular uncertainty as the region faces a familiar Northwest struggle. As commercial fishing has steadily declined, logging has plummeted because of environmental fights and market changes. Small one-industry towns ache for renewal.
 The small port town of Bandon has remade itself as a tourism destination, with big houses built high on oceanfront cliffs and a golf course in the dunes. Over in Coos Bay, an old lumber mill has been converted to an Indian casino, the Mill. 
 Yet wages in the new economy are much lower than they were in fishing and logging, economists said, even as housing, gasoline and grocery prices have risen. And unlike some coastal areas to the north in Oregon, the southwestern coast, however stunning, is several hours from any major population center, much less an affluent one.
 ''We like to say that one of our strong points is that we're rural and remote and one of our curses is that we're rural and remote,'' said Les Cohen, head of the Chamber of Commerce in Brookings, just north of the California border.
 Mr. Cohen said the region had been successful at drawing a mix of retirees, owners of recreation vehicles and eco-tourists. He noted, too, that other kinds of recreational fishing are still allowed in the ocean this summer.
 But with gasoline prices high and the housing market in trouble, Mr. Cohen said, news of the salmon shutdown ''was like, 'Oh, my God, how much can happen?'''
 The shutdown in recreational salmon fishing has hurt marine supply shops, charter boats, hotels and restaurants that cater to fishing tourists. 
 Since late last summer, nearly $60 million in federal money has been dispensed to about 1,200 fishermen in Oregon and California, an unprecedented payout, according to Randy Fisher, executive director of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, which administered the program. The direct payments have ranged from a few thousand dollars to more than $60,000 in some cases. 
 The payments, while welcome, have also stirred tension, with some fishermen upset that generally only boat owners received the money. 
 While the money helped some fishermen, like Mr. Wilson, invest in other endeavors, others invested in salmon fishing gear only to have the 2008 season shut down. 
 Adding what many say is a cruel extra kick, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is proposing to raise the cost of commercial fishing licenses, to $350 from $200. 
 ''We've got to have something to pay it with,'' one longtime fisherman, Paul Merz, said at a recent meeting in Coos Bay where state officials outlined the proposal. ''My wallet's empty.''

HEADLINE: A Small Rise, Despite the Increasing Oil Prices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed a quiet session with a moderate advance Thursday, with energy and other commodities companies leading the market as oil prices extended their record-breaking run.
 The price of crude oil swept past $124 a barrel in late New York Mercantile Exchange trading, while gasoline rose to a record of its own at the pump, climbing to a national average of nearly $3.65 a gallon. 
 Although the rising price of oil ignited concerns about inflation on Wednesday, knocking the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 200 points, stocks managed to hold on to their gains even as oil rose Thursday.
 The Dow rose 52.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 12,866.78.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,397.68. The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.75 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,451.24.
 Companies that would benefit the most from higher commodities prices -- the oil companies and metals producers like Alcoa -- helped lift the major indexes.
 April sales results from retailers, while not strong over all, were less gloomy than expected. The data suggested that high energy costs were leading consumers to alter their spending, and Wal-Mart Stores was one of the beneficiaries of that trend. But sales were down at some apparel stores, whose merchandise falls into the category of discretionary items, as consumers budgeted more for gasoline and food.
 Financial stocks were the worst performers of the day. Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis, said investors were still concerned about whether the companies had problems on their books beyond subprime mortgages. ''Our guess is that the worst is not over for the financials on a fundamentals basis,'' he said.
 Mixed economic readings and lofty energy prices could keep the market in a holding pattern through the summer, said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at Oakbrook Investments. ''With oil high and continuing to go up, it's going to be tough to get the market to have a sustainable rally,'' she said.
 Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities, was a bit more optimistic, saying he estimated that the economy was four months away from the end of an average-length recession, so the stock market should resume its climb again soon.
 The aluminum producer Alcoa rose $1.56, to $39.65. Among oil companies, Exxon Mobil rose $1.11, to $89.93, while Chevron was up $2.16, at $97.44.
 Wal-Mart rose 33 cents, to $57.16, but Target fell $1.10, or 2.1 percent, to $52.34, after its same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year -- rose less in April than analysts expected. 
 A weak American consumer weighed on Toyota Motor, which said late Wednesday that profits in the January-to-March period tumbled 28 percent because of to the rising yen and weak North American sales. Toyota's American-traded shares fell $4.20, to $100.56.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, to 100 26/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.77 percent, from 3.85 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Retailers' April Is Mixed, With Discounters Strong

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Wal-Mart and Costco reported April sales that rose more than analysts estimated as American consumers, contending with record gasoline prices, sought discounts on clothing and food.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said sales at stores open at least a year climbed 3.2 percent, surpassing its forecast and sending the shares higher. Industry sales increased 3.6 percent, the most since March 2007, the International Council of Shopping Centers said.
 Consumers facing job losses headed for discounters instead of malls, hurting sales at Gap. Saks sold clothes for as much as 40 percent off to draw shoppers. As customer expenses rise, stores may need to keep up promotions, said C. Britt Beemer, founder of America's Research Group. 
 ''If you didn't have a sale, you didn't have customers,'' Mr. Beemer said in a telephone interview. ''Consumers are having a hard time dealing with inflation in both food and fuel.''
 Target, the second-largest American discount retailer, said same-store sales rose 3.1 percent, falling short of analysts' estimates. The company said sales were ''slightly below'' its plans.
 Sales at Costco and TJX, the owner of the Marshalls chain, both advanced 8 percent. Nordstrom and J. C. Penney posted declines.
 Even a luxury retailer like the Neiman Marcus Group reported a 1.9 percent decline in sales.
 Wal-Mart's shares rose 33 cents, to $57.16. They have increased 20 percent this year, the biggest gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. Costco dropped 88 cents, to $71.20. The Standard & Poor's 500 retailing index fell 1.9 percent.
 Same-store sales figures are derived from 35 chains and do not include sales of gasoline, the New York-based shopping centers council said. April growth exceeded the group's estimate of a gain of as much as 2 percent. Sales rose 1.7 percent from February through April.
 Fifty-five percent of retailers exceeded the estimates compiled by Retail Metrics. Same-store sales are considered the best measure of a retailer's performance because they exclude locations that have recently opened or closed.
 Wal-Mart, which reduced prices as much as 30 percent in January, said customers were spending less before their paychecks arrive at the end of the month, signaling that the economy is getting tougher.
 ''I've never seen numbers like this,'' said Mr. Beemer, who said he believed that the United States had been in a recession since October. ''The numbers of consumers a day who are literally putting everything on hold right now and slowing down is incredible.'' 
 (The Commerce Department has estimated first-quarter growth at 0.6 percent. A recession, by economists' definition, is two consecutive quarters of contraction in the economy.) 
 The largest American retail clothing chain, Gap Inc., said same-store sales dropped 6 percent. Limited Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret, fell 5 percent.
 BJ's Wholesale Club and the discounter Fred's each reported sales gains that exceeded analysts' estimates. TJX and Ross Stores, which sell designer clothes at reduced prices, also exceeded projections.
 Saks said its sales jumped 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by the acceleration of a spring-season clearance sale, but said that promotions might hurt first-quarter profit.
 Sears Holdings and Macy's, the two biggest American department store chains, do not report monthly same-store sales.

HEADLINE: Down and Out in Connecticut

 BODY:
Here is a shameful fact that Connecticut's politicians should ponder: Over the past two decades, of all the 50 states, income inequality increased the most by far in Connecticut -- and not only because of the outsize gains of the state's many hedge fund managers. 
 The gap between the rich and everyone else in the United States keeps widening. But in most other states, the poor have made at least meager gains since the late 1980s. Not in Connecticut. From 1987 through 2006, income in the bottom fifth of the state's families fell by 17.4 percent. Over the same period, the top fifth saw their income rise by 44.8 percent. So what's going on? 
 Over the last 20 years, Connecticut has lost a third of its manufacturing jobs, replacing them with lower paying service-sector jobs. Virtually no additional jobs have been created.
 Connecticut's schools are big underperformers. The gap between the educational performance of low-income and middle- and high-income pupils is the widest in the nation. Only one-third of poor and minority children in elementary schools meet the state's goals for mastery of reading, writing and math. 
 The loss of manufacturing jobs, coupled with an achievement gap, is a recipe for perpetually worsening poverty. 
 Education in Connecticut (as elsewhere) must be improved. But even with better education, the shift from a manufacturing economy to a service economy will continue. So steps must be taken to ensure that service-sector jobs are a road into the middle class, the same as manufacturing jobs once were. 
 Connecticut has raised its minimum wage to $7.65 an hour. That is well above the federal minimum hourly wage of $5.85 but still well short of what is needed in the high-cost Northeast. The state must also extend its social safety net, beginning with unemployment compensation for all service workers, many of whom are not eligible because their wages are too low or their work schedules irregular. Even the eligible, the average weekly benefit is far too low. Like every other state, Connecticut desperately needs universal health insurance. 
 Connecticut's residents should demand that the state's leaders address these problems. When it comes to income inequality, first out of 50 states is shameful.

HEADLINE: Deal to Build At Railyards On West Side Collapses

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Six weeks after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority selected Tishman Speyer Properties to build a vast complex of office towers, apartment buildings and parks over the railyards on the West Side of Manhattan, the deal has fallen apart.
 Gary Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, said the negotiations foundered Thursday afternoon after Tishman Speyer insisted on changing the terms of the $1 billion development, which both parties had agreed to on March 26.
 The change would have substantially slowed the flow of millions of dollars in annual rent and fees to the authority and introduced a note of uncertainty about the pace of construction at the 26-acre site, which straddles 11th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets, he said. 
 ''We were unable to reach a meeting of the minds,'' Mr. Dellaverson said. ''At this point, there is no agreement between Tishman Speyer and the M.T.A. The M.T.A. remains committed to the development of the West Side yards.''
 Robert Lawson, a spokesman for Tishman Speyer, said, ''This is a highly complicated deal and we have been negotiating in good faith with the M.T.A. for several weeks.''
 ''We share the same goal as the M.T.A. and the city, to transform Hudson Yards into a successful and vibrant community,'' he added. ''We still hope to be able to complete this deal and reach an agreement that satisfies the needs of everyone.'' 
 Mr. Dellaverson said he had agreed to a request from Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center and has projects in India, China and Brazil, for a meeting on Monday, which seemed to leave open at least a faint possibility that the deal could be put back together. But he also said that the authority was considering whether to reopen negotiations with one or more of the four other developers who had bid nearly $1 billion each for the development rights.
 But if the authority reopened negotiations with another bidder, it would almost certainly mean that it would get less money for the rights to the property, real estate executives said.
 Developers who a year ago would have gleefully bid any price for a building or a project are now delaying or abandoning projects in New York and elsewhere as the economy has slowed and many lenders have balked at financing real estate projects in the wake of the credit crisis.
 At the same time, the sudden setback in the development of the railyards is a very public embarrassment for everyone involved, including the developer, whose reputation may be at risk; the authority, which was counting on the money for its capital budget; and the Bloomberg administration, which had made the transformation of the once-industrial West Side a centerpiece of its two-term mayoralty.
 ''It would be a real tragedy for the city if the project did not proceed now,'' said Douglas Durst, who had bid for the property in partnership with Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust. ''The M.T.A. must find a way to keep the momentum going.''
 Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber also expressed disappointment that the deal had fallen apart. ''It's very disappointing that six weeks after the M.T.A. picked its proposal from a pool of viable competitors, a deal with Tishman Speyer could not be worked out, but our commitment to transforming the Hudson Yards into a vibrant, mixed-use district remains unchanged,'' he said. ''We will do everything possible to keep the redevelopment process moving forward.'' 
 But critics of the deal said that it should never have been made, especially since the financing for a key element for West Side development, the extension of the No. 7 subway line, had not been resolved. At the same time, plans for the expansion of the nearby Javits Convention Center had collapsed. And given the sour real estate market, critics said the developer was getting an inexpensive development option.
 ''This deal was unhealthy from the get-go,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky. ''It never met the needs of the M.T.A.'s capital plan. The 7-line commitments were never sustainable. And in the end, every single West Side project is in various state of collapse.''
 Still, Jerry I. Speyer, chief executive of Tishman Speyer, is flying from Milan, where he is meeting with investors, to London on Friday to meet with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, according to one city official, who requested anonymity. Mr. Speyer's son, Rob, who is also in Milan, had overseen the negotiations, clashing with city and state officials before ultimately withdrawing from the deal, the official said.
 The railyards do represent a rare find in Manhattan, especially in Midtown -- a large undeveloped parcel near the waterfront. Over the last five years, New York has undergone an explosion in residential development fed by a seemingly insatiable desire for housing at any price.
 But the railyards also present a challenge. Any developer would have to build platforms, columns and foundations over the tracks, at a cost of $2 billion, before the first building could be erected. In addition, the yard on the west side of 11th Avenue must go through the city's land use review process and an environmental review, a process that could take 18 months.
 Tishman Speyer had developed a plan calling for four or five major office towers and seven apartment buildings with a total of 3,053 apartments, as well as 13 acres of open space, a school and a cultural institution. But shortly before the transportation authority selected Tishman Speyer, it lost its financial partner and its anchor tenant, Morgan Stanley. 
 In recent weeks, Tishman Speyer scoured the market for a potential tenant, to no avail. Even two companies that had been allied with other bidders for the project, Conde Nast Publications and the News Corporation, turned it down, according to real estate executives who were briefed on the negotiations.
 The developer also jettisoned its designs by the architect Helmut Jahn of Chicago, the executives said. The authority had initially said it would sign a conditional agreement with Tishman Speyer in early April. But in recent weeks, it repeatedly postponed its deadline. Indeed, one minute before a 5 p.m. deadline on Wednesday, the authority agreed to stop the clock in a final effort to resolve the differences.
 The developer was also negotiating with city officials over other promised West Side projects, including the subway line. If the cost of the subway exceeded $2.1 billion, Tishman Speyer wanted assurances that either the state or the city would provide additional financing. It never got them.

 ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: 'THE UNEXPECTED NEW: LATE PAINTINGS' The German Expressionist painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner is best known for his riotous Berlin street scenes, all sharp elbows and clashing colors. His later paintings, created after a move from Germany to Davos, Switzerland, and a long recovery from a nervous breakdown, appear less strident. Some 20 of these works, made between 1921 and 1935, are on view in this exhibition at the Michael Werner gallery.
 From the relative isolation of the Swiss Alps, Kirchner seems to be channeling Matisse in the patterned tablecloth of ''Wine Glass'' (1927-29) and Picasso in the conjoined bodies of ''Singer at the Piano'' and ''Eaters'' (both 1930). Kirchner's flattened, curvilinear forms also betray a less avant-garde influence, that of the turn-of-the-20th-century Jugendstil decorative arts movement.
 Perhaps in deference to the beauty of the Swiss landscape, Kirchner's palette is more subdued than in his earlier paintings. In the most vibrant works, like ''Two Nudes in the Forest,'' left, pink and orange brush up against blue, green and lavender. 
 The paintings were nevertheless too modern for the Swiss public; they received damning press, and several were rejected by museums. The exhibition's title is inspired by a comment from Kirchner to his brother: ''The unusual new always shocks people at first.''

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ASA AMES: OCCUPATION SCULPTURING,' through Sept. 14. This first show devoted to the American sculptor Asa Ames (1823-1851) is a gem. Its eight carved and painted wood portraits -- roughly two-thirds of the work of Ames's brief maturity -- introduce an artist who translated the style of self-taught American portrait painters into three dimensions, imbuing their artificiality with the sense of suspended life found in 19th-century photography. A crowded, wonderfully bizarre photograph that Ames orchestrated of himself, his work and a friend is a poignant tribute to his ambition. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org.

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'DARGERISM: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AND HENRY DARGER,' through Sept. 21. The great Outsider Henry Darger (1892-1973) was completely unknown as an artist during his own lifetime. Now his epic adventure, ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion'' is famous and a big influence on mainstream artists. This intriguing exhibition presents 12 of Darger's gorgeous, bizarre watercolors and works by 11 contemporary artists who have been inspired by him, including Justine Kurland, Trenton Doyle Hancock and, most surprisingly, Paula Rego. (See above.) (Ken Johnson)
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'EARL CUNNINGHAM'S AMERICA,' through Aug. 31. The folk artist Earl Cunningham (1893-1977) romanticized the American landscape without hyperbole. Cunningham didn't suffuse his paintings with divine light or invoke manifest destiny, like the Hudson River School artists; he simply showed the many small interactions of the Atlantic coastal ecosystem -- a delicate balance of dock workers, harbor pilots, fishermen, farmers, waterfowl and American Indian tribes. Some 50 of Cunningham's cheerful, intensely colored paintings are on view at the Lincoln Square branch of the American Folk Art Museum. Whether you think of Cunningham as a folk artist or a Modernist, his paintings display an intuitive grace. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: '$;MURAKAMI,' through July 13. Bring the kids and the shopping-centered tweens. This survey of Takashi Murakami, the artist frequently called the Japanese Andy Warhol, has it all: immense, toylike sculptures; an animated cartoon that rivals Disney; and a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique (Brooklyn's first!) selling Murakami bags. But it also elucidates the trajectory of an artist who began by recycling Japanese popular culture and then gradually figured out how to go deeper, harnessing Japanese traditions of painting, craft and spirituality. The art-commerce, high-low conundrums are fun, but the steady improvement in the paintings is the real heart of the matter. Along with the animated cartoons, which should please aesthetes of all ages, there is a moral component as well. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,' through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'THE GENIUS OF JAPANESE LACQUER: MASTERWORKS BY SHIBATA ZESHIN,' through June 15. In Japan, before there was plastic, there was lacquer. Shiny, waterproof and lightweight, it made an excellent coating for wooden cups, bowls, utensils and food storage containers. In the hands of a skilled, ingenious artisan like Shibata Zeshin (1807-1891) it was a high art. This beautiful show presents almost 75 objects -- many dumbfoundingly sumptuous -- and paintings by this man, considered the greatest of all Japanese lacquer artists. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ACTION/ABSTRACTION: POLLOCK, DE KOONING AND AMERICAN ART, 1940-1976,' through Sept. 21. With the help of some stupendous paintings and a beautiful installation, the same old story of postwar American painting's glory is told a new way: through the rivalry between its most prominent advocates, the art critics Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg and through their intellectual milieu. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'WARHOL'S JEWS: TEN PORTRAITS RECONSIDERED,' through Aug. 3. In 1980 Andy Warhol produced a series of portraits of famous Jews, including Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and the Marx Brothers. When they appeared at the Jewish Museum that year, the critics hated them. But they were warmly received by Jewish audiences when they were exhibited in museums and Jewish institutions around the country. Viewing them in this return engagement, it is hard to imagine anyone growing very excited for or against such bland, posterlike images. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'GUSTAVE COURBET,' through May 18. Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion and dissent. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ILLUMINATING THE MEDIEVAL HUNT,' through Aug. 10. As part of a conservation effort, the Morgan Library's 14th-century hunting manuscript ''Le Livre de la Chasse'' has been temporarily unbound, affording viewers a rare opportunity to study the individual pages. Fifty illustrated leaves are on view in this show, along with other manuscripts and printed books from the 11th to the 16th century. Gaston Phoebus's authoritative text examines the characteristics of various wild animals, explores different methods of hunting and provides instruction on caring for hounds. ''Le Livre de la Chasse'' was written for medieval aristocrats, but it will appeal to contemporary athletes, nature lovers and dog owners.225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PHILIP GUSTON: WORKS ON PAPER,' through Aug. 31. This enthralling exhibition of 100 works, mostly drawings, tracks Guston's evolution from his Abstract Expressionist efforts of the 1950s to his darkly comic and hugely influential representational pictures of the 1970s. While he went through several radical stylistic changes over those three decades, a determination to work from basic instincts and primal feelings runs throughout, giving the show a powerful autobiographical momentum. (See above.) (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: DREAD SCOTT: 'WELCOME TO AMERICA,' through June 1. Dread Scott's installation with an American flag on the floor caused a flap in 1989 when the first President Bush disapproved, and this New York artist continues to make issue-specific work in a classic political-art mode. The installations, sculptures and videos in this survey dramatize Hurricane Katrina, the incarceration of black males and the Iraq war as if they were all part of a single national problem, and he argues forcefully that they are. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Holland Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'TAKE YOUR TIME: OLAFUR ELIASSON,' through June 30. Near the end of a decade crammed with junk-art collectibles geared to junk-bond budgets, we get bare walls, open space, light and color in this survey of work by an artist, born in Denmark in 1967, who is well known for creating immaterialist magic through bare-bones means: literally, in some cases, mist and mirrors. As optically enchanting as the results are, though, in the end we are left wanting more from Mr. Eliasson's less. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I.'' Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt's most famous painted mural, the ''Beethoven Frieze''; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist's signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'WIENER WERKSTaTTE JEWELRY,' through June 30. Founded in 1903, the Wiener Werkstatte, or Vienna Workshops, set out to prove that the modern world still needed fine craftsmanship and good design. Its first product was jewelry, of which this stunning exhibition presents 40 gorgeous examples. Works in gold, silver and semi-precious stones by the workshop's co-founders, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, and others -- including, most notably, Dagobert Peche -- magically blur the line between personal ornament and miniature sculpture. (See above.) (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'TOMMA ABTS,' through June 29. The small, hard-edged abstractions by this German-born painter, who is based in London and was the 2006 Turner Prize winner, are not showy, but they are intensely absorbing. Basic, formal elements like stripes, arcs, circles, planes and polygons are carefully layered, juxtaposed and interwoven in all sorts of subtly eccentric ways. Ms. Abts's colors are muted but seductive, and she adds highlights and shadows, creating mysterious, three-dimensional illusions. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LIBRARY: 'MONUMENTAL FRANCE: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDOUARD BALDUS' AND SKETCHES ON GLASS: CLICHES-VERRE FROM THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,' through June 28. This pair of exhibitions focuses on the experimental period after the birth of photography (the 1850s through the 1870s). Film had not yet been invented, but glass-plate and paper negatives allowed artists to micromanage the camera's performance or to bypass it entirely. ''Monumental France: The Photographs of Edouard Baldus'' gathers 38 artisanal prints of French architectural landmarks. ''Sketches on Glass: Cliches-Verre From the New York Public Library'' presents prints made with hand-drawn glass plates on light-sensitive paper (no camera required). Together these shows reveal that artists in mid-19th-century France blurred the distinction between the photograph and the unique object. Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 930-0830, nypl.org (Rosenberg)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through May 25. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FLOW,' through June 29. Afropolitanism is the modish tag for recent work by young African artists. What unites them is a shared view of Africa, less as a place than as a concept, a cultural force -- one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean, part of the whole, but with its own tides and temperatures. This idea, or something like it, lies behind ''Flow,'' a fine-textured survey of 20 artists who, with a few exceptions, were born in Africa after 1970 but who now live in Europe or the United States. The show is a worthy successor to ''Freestyle'' and ''Frequency,'' benchmark surveys of new African-American art. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MARY CASSATT: PRINTS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF AMBROISE VOLLARD' The last of three Cassatt exhibitions held at the gallery since 2000, this show focuses on a body of work that passed through the hands of the influential Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939). Together, the drawings and prints here illuminate the working methods of this popular female Impressionist. They include etchings, aquatints, preparatory pencil drawings and pastel counterproofs. Soft-ground aquatints of women at the opera show Cassatt favoring painterly washes over technical precision. Several drypoints featuring charming, chubby-handed toddlers convey empathy and intimacy. Vollard's buy-in-bulk strategy is our gain, illuminating the complexity of process Cassatt brought to her limited purview. Adelson Galleries, 19 East 82nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 439-6800, adelsongalleries.com, through June 6. (Rosenberg)
 WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'THE FIGURE' While best known for his Pop-realist paintings of food products, Mr. Thiebaud has also been a skillful and innovative figure painter, as this fine show of paintings and drawings dating from 1963 to 1992 demonstrates. Outstanding are six oil paintings from the '60s, each depicting a man or a woman against a blank wall. The women are sexy and enigmatic, the men subtly comical. All the paintings have great visual snap and a slightly melancholy, Hopperesque distance. Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, allanstonegallery.com, through May 30. (Johnson)
 'WINE, WORSHIP AND SACRIFICE: THE GOLDEN GRAVES OF ANCIENT VANI' In small but elegant new galleries, a study center founded in 2006 under the auspices of New York University presents its inaugural exhibition. This show offers more than 100 objects unearthed from ancient graves in Vani, a cosmopolitan city established in Colchis -- modern-day Georgia -- in the eighth century B.C. It includes beautiful, intricate gold jewelry discovered in grave sites of the rich and powerful; the life-size bronze torso of a youth made in classic Hellenistic style; and two strikingly exotic bronze lamps with functional parts in the form of elephant heads. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7810, nyu.edu/isaw, through June 1. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 MEL BOCHNER The latest paintings of this erstwhile Conceptualist have gone over to the even darker side, perhaps in honor of our even darker times. The words and mood continue to be hilariously dour and pointedly negative, and to decline into a kind of linguistic entropy. Now the colors -- once cheerfully neon -- match them with shades of gray, forming seething modernist monochromes. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 'SUBSTRACTION' This show of large-scale paintings by six young artists proposes a new fusion of postwar abstraction and graffiti art. Despite an infectious spirit, originality is scarce. Reason for going: three canvases by Sterling Ruby push spray-can painting to new heights of atmospheric toxicity that some are calling ''Gangsta Rothkos.'' Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'DETROIT' The McDermott & McGough Wayback machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Nicholas Robinson consists of extraordinarily lucid, richly colored staged photographs resembling stills from an old film about teenage love, desire, wanderlust and guilt. Nicholas Robinson, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com, through May 17. (Johnson)
 GEDI SIBONY In Mr. Sibony's first solo at Greene Naftali, raw materials like garbage bags, hollow-core doors and galvanized steel pipes are neutralized by the artist's delicate touch and the gallery's clean, light-filled space. Shades of ''greige'' (the decorator's neutral of choice) dominate the main gallery, particularly in two works consisting primarily of carpet remnants. In several more intimate viewing rooms Mr. Sibony exhibits doors and cardboard boxes adorned with bits of paper and tape, and sections of Masonite and plexiglass modified with crude geometric cutouts. Taken as a whole, the exhibition suggests some kind of narrative -- perhaps that of a contractor who walked off the job to pursue a Ph.D. in philosophy. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftali.com; through May 24. (Rosenberg)
 PIOTR UKLANSKI One of the bad boys of contemporary art goes big time and sustains quite a bit of his badness. Diverse works in a labyrinth of galleries move through the pomp and circumstance of the Communist, Roman Catholic and Modernist beliefs; Polish Christmas traditions; and the Solidarity movement, with a closing reference to the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Germans. Festivalist identity-art spectacle is a target; yet a sense of Polish suffering and pride comes across. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com, through May 31. (Smith)

 'NEW YORK COOL: PAINTING AND SCULPTURE FROM THE N.Y.U. ART COLLECTION' This exhibition subjects the late '50s and early '60s -- a period normally seen as a transitional phase between Abstract Expressionism and Pop, Pollock and Warhol -- to intense scrutiny. It reintroduces minor characters like Seymour Lipton, Robert Goodnough and Conrad Marca-Relli, and exposes hidden sides of well-known artists (Miriam Schapiro's early geometric abstraction). It reminds us that the art world of that time was a multifarious scene shaped by artists beyond Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through July 19. (Rosenberg)
 BLAKE RAYNE The abstract paintings in this show, an important one for this impressive New York artist, were made with aerosol spray directed at folded, cut and stitched-together canvas. And the pictures are only part of a larger conceptual package that includes the display of the paintings' shipping containers and has involved closing the gallery for a week. Mr. Rayne's taking apart of art conventions is erudite, visually effective and of a piece: the installation looks like a cross between a paneled library and a spreading bruise. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com, through May 18. (Cotter)
 Out of Town
 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM : 'COLOR AS FIELD: AMERICAN PAINTING, 1950-1975,' through May 26. An overdue, if far from perfect, reconsideration of Color Field painting reintroduces the joyful pictorial derring-do of an art movement partly done in by the single-minded advocacy of its biggest fan, the great American art critic Clement Greenberg. It is wonderful to see some of the best of this work float free of the Greenbergian claims for greatness and inevitability, propelled by the fantastic soft power of brilliant color, big scale and judicious amounts of pristine raw canvas -- especially as wielded by Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski. Perhaps humorless power-lust prevented Greenberg from seeing that if, as he said, Abstract Expressionism was Baroque, then Color Field might be Rococo: beautiful, sometimes frivolous and even comedic. Eighth Street and F Street, NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 KENNETH TIN-KIN HUNG: 'RESIDENTIAL ERECTION' Looking at Mr. Hung's art is like peeking into the fever dream of an overworked political blogger. In a John Heartfield-meets-Monty Python style, his manic, computer-animated montages gleefully skewer all comers, left and right, including President Bush, Rush Limbaugh, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Moore and the current and former contenders in this year's presidential race. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, postmastersart.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS' If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COLOR CHART: REINVENTING COLOR, 1950 TO TODAY' Organized by Ann Temkin, a curator in the museum's department of painting and sculpture, color functions as a ready-made in ''Color Chart'' -- something to be bought or appropriated, rather than mixed on a palette. The show is a rejoinder to the notion of color as the province of formalists, and to the idea that Minimal and Conceptual art comes only in shades of black, white and gray. In the upper section of the lobby a floor created by the artist Jim 
 Lambie surrounds concentric strips 
 of brightly hued tape. In the galleries there are postwar classics by Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Sherrie Levine. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Rosenberg)
 SCOTT OLSON The small paintings in this artist's first solo show filter a loosely Constructivist geometry through the scale and turned-in concentration of manuscript illumination. Their outsize emphasis on process, amplified by contrasting techniques, colors and surfaces, makes them extra engrossing, especially for canvases not much larger than your face. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0212, taxterandspengemann.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION' This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Johnson)
 'UNDER PAIN OF DEATH' This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including ''The Last Supper,'' an Errol Morris-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrom, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 MARK WYSE: 'DISAVOWAL' As curatorial as it is artistic, this work pairs photographs by artists including Caspar David Friedrich and Thomas Ruff, creating diptychs or two-word rebuses whose components play off each other, extracting hidden meanings, contrasting forms, subjects or eras. They add a few twists to the history of appropriation art and sustain interest much longer than you first expect. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Fall in Figure For Jobless Defies Trend

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits dropped much more than expected last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. 
 In its weekly report, the department said that applications for unemployment benefits fell to 365,000, a decline of 18,000 from the previous week. Economists expected a decrease of about 5,000.
 Weekly jobless claims have been exceptionally volatile in recent weeks because of strike-related layoffs in the auto industry and an unusually early Easter, which has played havoc with the government's seasonal adjustment measurements.
 Many economists say they believe that the prolonged housing slump and the severe credit crisis have pushed the economy into a recession. For that reason, they expect layoffs to rise in the coming months as the unemployment rate climbs higher.
 But they also said the downturn might be relatively mild and brief, leading to less-severe job losses than in previous recessions.
 The report on jobless claims showed the total number of laid-off workers receiving benefits dipped slightly, to 3.02 million, for the week that ended April 26 but remained above 3 million for the second consecutive week.
 For the week that ended April 26, drops in initial claims were recorded in 32 states and territories while 21 had increases.
 The biggest increase was in Massachusetts, a rise of 5,591 that was attributed to layoffs in transportation, services and public administration.
 Other states with big increases were New York, 4,648; Kentucky, 3,776; and New Jersey, 3,521.

 CHIEF OF MEXICO'S POLICE
 Assassinated by Gunmen
 Gunmen assassinated the acting chief of Mexico's federal police in the most brazen attack so far in the year-and-a-half-old struggle between the government and organized crime gangs. The Mexican police have been under constant attack since President Felipe Calderon began an offensive against drug cartels that had corrupted the municipal police forces and local officials in several towns. PAGE A6 
 DEATH OF FINANCIER CONFIRMED
 The death of the financier Robert L. Vesco, confirmed by documents and interviews, has ended one of Washington's longest fugitive hunts. Mr. Vesco was accused of swindling investors out of $200 million, illegally contributing to Richard M. Nixon's presidential campaign and trying to induce the Carter administration to let Libya buy planes in exchange for bribes to United States officials. He also was charged with drug trafficking.

 A TALE OF TWO SKELETONS
 A body at rest tends to stay at rest, unless it is suspected of being that of the German writer Friedrich Schiller. For nearly 200 years, candidates for that honor have been disinterred and examined. The latest inquiry, brought by a documentary film crew, used DNA tests to determine which of the two leading contenders was the real Schiller. The answer was neither. PAGE A8 
 OUT OF OFFICE FOR ONE DAY
 Russia's Parliament overwhelmingly confirmed Vladimir V. Putin as prime minister, completing his managed departure from the presidency in a manner that left him the country's dominant politician, with a firm grip on power. Mr. Putin was out of office only a day before the resolution confirming his new post was handed to his protege and presidential successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who promptly accepted it. PAGE A15 
 AMERICAN IN EYE OF BOLIVIAN STORM
 Since Ronald Larsen, an American farmer, drove his pickup truck to Bolivia from his native Montana in 1969, he has lived a quiet life, farming corn, herding cattle and amassing vast land holdings. But he has suddenly found himself in the middle of a battle between President Evo Morales, who plans to break up large rural estates, and the wealthy light-skinned elite in eastern Bolivia, which is chafing at Mr. Morales's land reform project.

 HEPATITIS C INFECTIONS 
 Grow to 84 From 7
 The infection with hepatitis C of seven patients treated at a Las Vegas endoscopy clinic has grown into one of the largest outbreaks of the liver disease ever in North America, with 77 new cases now identified. Since the outbreak began in February with the reuse of syringes among multiple patients, officials have contacted 40,000 people that visited the clinic to tell them they should be tested. PAGE A16 
 TEXAS TOWN BREATHES EASIER
 It appears that the little East Texas oil town of Daisetta will survive. A gaping sinkhole that grew to 600 feet by 900 feet and almost 300 feet deep -- one of the largest ever -- looks to be stabilizing. The already fallen include two trucks, two grain tanks, utility poles and some pine trees. PAGE A16 
 CLINTON CAMPAIGN SHORT ON CASH
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's most immediate concern in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination may not be how many pledged delegates or popular votes she is behind Senator Barack Obama. Before deciding how to overcome those numbers, the Clinton campaign, which is increasingly strapped for cash, must find a way to pay its bills. PAGE 18 
 DEAL MADE TO PRESERVE RANCH
 A deal between the Tejon Ranch Corporation and five major conservation organizations will keep as much as 90 percent of Tejon Ranch, which encompasses 270,000 acres of varied ecosystems in Southern California, free from development. PAGE A17 
 A PACIFIC NORTHWEST SHIFT
 Most of Oregon and California's commercial salmon fishery is shut down this year because of declines in the number of fish returning to spawn, so many fishermen are casting about for an alternative. One choice is prawns, which, though falling short of Chinook salmon on the local lore front, have the decided advantage of being available. PAGE A16 
 SPORTS
 PATRIOTS' FILM OFFERINGS 
 Warrant a Look
 The number of videotapes attributable to Bill Belichick has grown, providing opportunities anew for the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. He has already assessed fines totaling $750,000 for Belichick and the Patriots and forced the team to forfeit a first-round draft pick. Not enough, Harvey Araton writes in Sports of The Times. PAGE C14
 THE CUBAN CONNECTION
 It has been the path for perhaps 150 baseball players: defect from Cuba, ply trade. It has not generally been so for Cuban soccer players, but Maykel Galindo, who defected during the Concacaf Gold Cup in 2005, has become one of the top M.L.S. scorers. And there are other players hoping for their chance. PAGE C14
 TRIPLE CROWN CHALLENGE
 Casino Drive has two half-brothers that are the last two Belmont Stakes winners. Casino Drive, out of Japan, will have his first test in the United States, the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park on Saturday. The result could decide whether his bid to win a Triple Crown race is credible and speak to Big Brown's chances of a Triple Crown sweep. PAGE C17
 BUSINESS
 NEW APPROACH SIGNALED
 By Citigroup Moves
 Vikram S. Pandit is doing some serious spring cleaning at Citigroup, selling or closing branches, unloading the headquarters building in Tokyo, ditching loans and the Diners Club credit-card franchise. The moves stand to raise billions of dollars, but more than that also send a signal about how Mr. Pandit plans to run the bank: differently. PAGE C1 
 FOOD PRICES EASE DOWN
 The prices of rice, wheat, soybeans and several other foods have come down recently, but don't take that to mean the days of inexpensive food are back. Prices remain volatile and quite high by historical standards, and experts say that shoppers may not see much benefit from the recent price dips. PAGE C1 
 DREADFULLY CONFUSING
 Shades of Lewis Carroll, a sort of ''loans yesterday, loans tomorrow, never loans today'': When times were sunny, banks promised companies money for a rainy day. Rain is now falling in buckets, and the banks, hard pressed themselves, are worried they will have to keep their promises. PAGE C7 
 PANEL APPROVES MORTGAGE AID
 The House approved legislation that seeks to broadly expand the availability of mortgages insured by the federal government, defying a veto threat by President Bush on a vote cast mostly along party lines. With the White House opposition, and Senate Republicans appearing increasingly reluctant to sign on, the bill's main champion, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, conceded that its future was in doubt.

 TOYOTA EXPECTS DROP
 Toyota said that its annual profit would probably drop for the first time in nine years because of the slowdown in the United States economy, accelerating a shift into emerging markets like China and Latin America and the Middle East and underscoring the declining stature of the United States in the global economy.

 MIXED MONTH FOR RETAILERS
 Wal-Mart and Costco reported April sales that rose more than analysts had estimated as American consumers looked for discount stores instead of malls. That hurt retailers like Gap. ''If you didn't have a sale, you didn't have customers,'' one analyst said. PAGE C6

 STATE BEGINS INVESTIGATION
 Into Benefits to Lawyers
 Hundreds of lawyers across New York have been illegally granted state pension fund benefits by governmental entities, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said. The problems, which Mr. Cuomo said had potentially cost the state millions of dollars, often involve politically connected lawyers who work as independent contractors for regional school districts but are classified as public employees.

 A SQUEEZE ON SCHOOLS
 Parents in New York City consider it a sacred tenet: Moving into a good elementary school's zone guarantees that your children can go there. But the baby and building boom in Lower Manhattan has left some of the highly regarded schools in the neighborhood with a glut of children and nowhere to put them. And a growing chorus warns that similar problems could crop up in other neighborhoods. PAGE C13

 IN NEW YORK,
 They Come for the Waters
 New York once had more mineral baths than any other state, the water laced with magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron, sulfur and the like. Resorts and sanitariums drew upon the waters, promising curative powers. Most of them failed after World War II, but interest is rising again. ''Towns are realizing that they're sitting on gold mines,'' said a board member of the New York Spa Alliance. PAGE D1

 THE EVOLUTION OF TERRORISM
 In his new book, ''Terror and Consent: The Wars for the Twenty-First Century,'' Philip Bobbitt writes that terrorists, and therefore terrorism, have changed so much over the years that ''it will take some time before the nature and composition of these wars are widely understood.'' Misunderstandings, he argues, have led to a flawed American strategy in Iraq, among other things. PAGE B36

HEADLINE: The Lucrative Art of War

 BODY:
Congress is finally moving to shut one of the more egregious forms of Iraq war profiteering: defense contractors using offshore shell companies to avoid paying their fair share of payroll taxes. The practice is widespread and Congressional investigators have been dispatched to one of the prime tax refuges, the Cayman Islands, to seek a firsthand estimate of how much the Treasury is being shorted. 
 No one will be surprised to hear that one of the suspected prime offenders is KBR, the Texas-based defense contractor, formerly a part of the Halliburton conglomerate allied with Vice President Dick Cheney. According to a report in The Boston Globe, KBR, which has landed billions in Iraq contracts, has used two Cayman shell companies to avoid paying hundreds of millions in payroll, Medicare and unemployment taxes. 
 Unfortunately right now there is nothing illegal about this. The House has approved legislation to plug the dodge by treating foreign subsidiaries of defense contractors as what they are -- American employers required to pay taxes. The Senate must quickly follow suit and not buy the contractors' line that listing American workers at offshore companies is a cost saving passed on patriotically to the war effort. No less insulting, the Cayman dodge has been blocking Americans from the protection of labor and anti-discrimination laws. 
 The House has taken on another shamefully common abuse: voting to deny future government contracts to any company that fails to pay its corporate taxes, including an estimated 25,000 defense contractors keeping billions due the Treasury. The Senate should approve that legislation as well. 
 Companies enriched by taxpayers in the war boom should not be able to compound their profits by not paying their fair share of taxes. Congress must do far more to bring them to a full accounting.

HEADLINE: Air Travelers Need to Pack More Money

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Air travel these days is an adventure with many surprises, some of them unpleasant. 
 That also describes the process of simply buying a ticket. 
 Airlines have raised fares or increased surcharges, partly to cover the rising cost of jet fuel, at least 10 times so far this year -- most recently on Thursday, when American Airlines and Delta Air Lines raised ticket fees again. The increases have wiped out many of the discounts the carriers offered in 2007 to fill planes.
 Full-fare coach tickets on some transcontinental routes, like Los Angeles to Philadelphia, now cost more than $1,000 round trip. Leisure fares, bought in advance, are back to what passengers paid in 2006, or about $230 round trip on average, according to Robert Harrell of Harrell Associates, which tracks air fares. Business-class tickets are up 30 percent from the recent lows touched three years ago, when Delta cut fares sharply, Mr. Harrell said. 
 But those figures do not include higher charges and fees, particularly for the higher price of fuel, which has jumped more than 63 percent over this time last year. 
 On some airlines, fuel fees are more than $100 round trip for domestic flights, and $300 and up for overseas flights lasting nine hours or more.
 The fare and fee increases are an attempt by airlines to alleviate the latest wave of financial pain afflicting the industry. A number of major carriers posted losses in the first quarter, while a half-dozen smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection or announced plans to cease operations during the past month. 
 High fuel prices are pushing big airlines like Delta and Northwest to merge, while US Airways and United are discussing a deal. Several major airlines have announced plans to eliminate flights over the next few months in a bid to reduce expenses. Fewer seats in the sky give the airlines more power over pricing, allowing them to push through these increases even as the economy softens.
 It can be hard for travelers to keep track of all the new fees. For example, airlines like American, Delta, Northwest and United now charge $25 to check a second bag, which has long been free.
 Other airlines, like Spirit, are charging to check bags at all ($10 if space for bags is reserved online, or $20 if a traveler shows up at the airport without a baggage reservation). 
 An in-flight meal, also once free, can add $10 to a trip. JetBlue is charging $10 to reserve seats that have extra legroom, while US Airways will soon charge $5 to $30 to reserve a window or an aisle seat in the front of the plane under its Choice Seats program, according to SmarterTravel.com, a Web site that offers consumers travel advice. Until now, those seats have mainly been reserved for frequent fliers or full-fare-paying passengers.
 ''If summer travelers are expecting to see the same sorts of air fares they saw last summer, they're going to be very unpleasantly surprised,'' said Tim Winship, editor of SmarterTravel.com. ''With both the net air fares and what people end up paying because of the additional fees, everything is going to be higher in summer 2008 than in summer 2007.'' 
 Leila Stollman of West Bloomfield, Mich., soured on flying after recently spending several days trying to find a reasonably priced flight to Colorado to visit her daughter. She wound up spending $446 round trip, or $150 more than she had planned to pay, based on earlier trips. 
 ''I can't begin to tell you how frustrating that was,'' she said. ''The airlines are already nickel-and-diming us to death, and now tickets have gone up.''
 Mr. Winship said many travelers are frustrated by trying to figure out exactly what is included in the price of a ticket. There is no standard practice on airline Web sites for explaining extra fees. They simply have to provide the information in some fashion.
 ''Not only is there no transparency, there is no consistency to the way the airlines are not transparent,'' Mr. Winship said. ''It adds insult to injury.''
 Delta.com, for example, breaks out the price in terms of the air fare and the fees when a passenger is quoted a ticket price.
 But United and American post only the total air fare, meaning passengers have to explore further to find out how much of what they are paying is for the ticket, and which portion is for fees.
 For example, a $435 ticket on United from Chicago to Los Angeles includes $70 in fees, explained when a passenger clicks on ''view price breakdown.'' 
 Likewise, American posts the total fare until a passenger clicks through to complete the reservation. Then the price is spelled out in terms of the air fare plus fees and taxes, which were $21 on a trip from Dallas to Chicago.
 Airlines say fares may rise further, given the steady climb of the price of jet fuel. ''Fuel is a substantial hit, and we do need to cover the cost of fuel in our ticket prices in the long run,'' said Edward Bastian, Delta's president and chief financial officer.
 ''We'll be looking for opportunities'' for further fare increases, Gary C. Kelly, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, added last month. 
 At some point, the fares will reach a level where consumers decide to stay home, or drive instead -- when they can.
 Sylvie Foley, who lives in suburban Detroit, has watched the fares to Paris soar for her semi-annual trips home. For instance, she paid about $500 round trip during the summer of 2005. But the best fare she has been able to find for a late summer trip this year is $1,100. ''I'll have to see whether I can afford to go back or not,'' she said. 
 Chris Tobias, a steel company representative from Hartford, said his company was pushing its employees to book tickets as far in advance as possible in order to get the cheapest fares. He is paying 20 percent more round trip for the flights he regularly takes to Chicago and Minneapolis.
 ''This could make it harder to do my job,'' he said. ''The surcharges for gas haven't helped.''
 For vacationers, however, there is no one to pick up the extra tab. Stephanie Barga recently paid $350 for a round-trip ticket back home to Houston, about $100 more than she paid in 2007. 
 Said Ms. Barga, a speech pathologist from Toledo, Ohio: ''Thank goodness I'll be moving to Houston soon.''

HEADLINE: In a Weak Economy, Quirky Restaurant Ads Yield to Tried and True

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
ONE of latest victims of the sagging economy is a sass-talking ''spokes- apple'' that briefly starred in a campaign for Applebee's, the budget restaurant chain.
 Applebee's introduced the apple -- a regular-looking red one that exhorted people to get together and go out to eat -- in October. The campaign, on television, the Web and in print, was supported by a budget of $180 million.
 But now the apple is gone, its mission far from accomplished. 
 Early tests showed mixed results -- some people loved the apple's attitude, though others found it off-putting -- but the real problem was that the fruit in question failed to give the company's bottom line an immediate lift. 
 And Applebee's was in no mood to be patient. Throughout 2007, the company had not shown a quarterly increase in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, and its customers were being pummeled by the mortgage crisis, leaving little money to spend on dining out. Rather than give the campaign time to catch on, Applebee's pulled the plug in late February.
 ''Typically you would give a campaign a couple rounds of testing to give it a chance to work,'' said Shannon Scott, Applebee's executive director for creative services. ''We walked away quicker than we normally would have, because we had to get people in the seats now.''
 There was also a certain cringe factor for some people, a few of whom complained in blogs. In one commercial, the chatty apple sits on a park bench with a young man who is sending text messages to his friends. The apple, in the voice of the stand-up comedian Wanda Sykes, asks, ''That's how you carry on a friendship, baby? With your thumbs? Of course, it ain't my business.''
 Applebee's is not the only restaurant to withdraw a quirky new branding symbol in these tough times. A similar situation has played out at Wendy's, which dropped its ''red wig'' campaign in late January after eight months. In the ads, young men wore pigtails reminiscent of the Wendy's character and demanded fresh burgers.
 Some strong parallels exist: not only did the red wig campaign fail to lift Wendy's sales in a significant way, its tone -- perhaps too arch for a family-oriented chain -- was called into question. Both campaigns were meant to attract younger diners.
 Advertising and restaurant executives point to several reasons that neither campaign was a hit. The bizarre red wig commercials were too much of a departure from Wendy's folksy brand; the apple was not a strong enough image to represent Applebee's. It is unlikely, though, that either one would have been ended so quickly in better economic times.
 Instead, both marketers have opted for a more recession-proof approach: glamour shots of food that are intended to make mouths water and prompt consumers to reach for their wallets.
 For the last two months, Applebee's, of Overland Park, Kan., has been running ads that star its food -- none of it making conversation -- and a voice-over by John Corbett (Aidan of ''Sex and the City'') encouraging viewers to take advantage of lunchtime specials. The campaign is the second one created by Applebee's new agency, McCann Erickson, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies; the spokesapple one had been the first. 
 Wendy's has taken a similar approach. Its new spots feature lingering shots of cheeseburgers and fish sandwiches, and the script talks up fresh ingredients and Wendy's ''promise'' of quality food. The ads hew much closer to the restaurant's down-home image. 
 Wendy's, based in Dublin, Ohio, turned to a different agency, Kirshenbaum Bond and Partners, a unit of MDC Partners, to compose its ads. The red wig campaign had been the first effort for Wendy's by Saatchi & Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe. 
 Bob Holtcamp, senior vice president for brand advertising at Wendy's, said that regardless of economic circumstances, it was important to keep the focus on meals, something the red wig campaign had failed to do. 
 ''The consumers are now seeing the quality of our food in our advertising,'' Mr. Holtcamp said. ''The economy can go back and forth, but our brand is built on the quality of our food as opposed to other fast-food restaurants.''
 Perhaps a lesson from these failed efforts is that difficult times are not the right times to try to create momentum for a quirky corporate mascot. ''Building an icon takes time,'' said Hayes Roth, chief executive of the branding firm Landor Associates, a unit of the WPP Group. McDonald's, he said, has spent decades using Ronald McDonald in everything child-related that the company does, making him one of the most recognizable characters in the world. ''That's how you build an icon,'' he said. 
 But the irreverent mascots tried by Wendy's and Applebee owe less to Ronald McDonald than they do to the King from Burger King, whose slightly unnerving presence Mr. Roth likened to the Wanda Sykes apple. But the King has proven highly effective in reaching Burger King's core audience of younger men, now that he has been given the time to take root. 
 Some see a missed opportunity for Applebee's. The apple ''really did cut through the clutter,'' said Malcolm Knapp, a restaurant analyst and consultant who has his own firm in New York. ''It was good and sassy, and gave some attitude to a brand that was lacking it.''
 ''Applebee's is not a cool brand,'' he said. ''If they are going to become cool, they are going to have to find a way to resonate with consumers.''
 Perhaps the current strategy is paying off for Applebee's. The chain, which was acquired by IHOP for $2.1 billion last year, reported a 0.5 percent increase in same-store sales for the first quarter. Among company-owned stores (and excluding franchisees), the increase was 2.1 percent.
 ''The first quarter release is our first positive same-store sales in two years,'' Ms. Scott of Applebee's said. ''It's safe to say this campaign is working for us, so we're going to stick with it.''
 Wendy's, which is being bought by Triarc, the parent of Arby's, for $2.3 billion, showed a 1.6 percent drop in same-store sales in the first quarter in contrast to a 0.9 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2007. 
 On the plus side, Wendy's says that its new ads are scoring much higher with focus groups than the red wig ads, particularly in important categories like ''makes me want to eat at Wendy's.''

HEADLINE: A Little Pity, Please, For Lenders

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris asks whether central bankers should worry more about inflation in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
General Motors thought it had found a safe and profitable business, far away from the ups and downs of the automobile business that was causing so many headaches. Instead, it found an albatross that is now forcing the company to put up billions of dollars just to stay in business and hope for a turnaround.
 That business was residential mortgages, and G.M. went into it in a big way. It bought one of the more aggressive lenders around, Ditech, and came to specialize in the kind of innovative mortgages that flourished in recent years. 
 By early 2006, most of the mortgage loans that it issued required that borrowers pay only the interest -- no principal at all in early years -- or allowed them to pay even less than that. Ditech was a pioneer in offering 125 percent loans, in which the borrower could get more than the property was worth. It specialized in low-documentation mortgages, which became known as ''liars' loans'' because many borrowers falsified their income.
 The result has been a wave of defaults and foreclosures, bringing on big losses for both the company and for those who bought securities backed by those mortgages. 
 Now the mortgage company is warning that it may not be able to pay its bills, and has set out to force those who lent money to it to agree to accept only a fraction of what they are owed. It appears that its lenders have little real choice. If they insist on being paid all that they are owed, they will go to the back of the payment line, with the risk they will get nothing.
 The mortgage industry has bitterly opposed legislative proposals that bankrupt homeowners be able to ask judges to reduce the amount they owe. But that is what this company hopes to accomplish through the threat of a bankruptcy filing. The lender in trouble is known as ResCap, short for Residential Capital. It is a subsidiary of GMAC, which was formerly owned by G.M. Now the automaker's stake is down to 49 percent, with the majority stake held by Cerberus Partners, a private equity fund.
 When it was riding high, ResCap took lots of risks. It was a major lender in California, a market where home prices are falling and foreclosures are increasing. It invested in home developments, and bought model houses in subdivisions, hoping to sell the homes later at a profit. It expanded into many countries, including Australia, Mexico, Britain, Germany and Spain. Now it has problems in many of those countries, and has suffered losses on the model homes. 
 ResCap has recently modified thousands of mortgages to make them more affordable, but those changes have almost all involved changing the interest rate, not reducing the amount owed, as ResCap is demanding from those who lent money to it.
 Back in 2005, when ResCap was formally separated from the rest of GMAC, the idea was to insulate the profitable mortgage business from the troubled auto finance business. Now the situation is reversed, and the mortgage losses are producing red ink for GMAC, even though its other businesses are profitable. GMAC is being forced to invest billions more to keep ResCap afloat, and on Thursday G.M. pointed to ResCap's problems as it wrote down the value of its investment in GMAC by $1.5 billion.
 Owners of some notes issued by ResCap are being asked to trade them in for new bonds with face values of as little as 80 cents on the dollar. Other holders are being offered the chance to sell back bonds to the company, for as little as 65 cents on the dollar. GMAC has bought back some ResCap bonds in the public market, paying around 50 cents on the dollar.
 ''We believe bondholders have little choice in this situation, as the alternative could be a filing'' for bankruptcy, wrote Richard Hoffmann and Adam Steer of CreditSights, a bond analysis firm.
 As part of the package, GMAC would put another $3.5 billion into ResCap. The company says that any current bondholders who reject the exchange offer would have their debt subordinated to the new loan from the GMAC parent, as well as to the new bonds being issued.
 The immediate risk for ResCap is that without the exchange it could run out of cash as early as next month as it must repay borrowings that it cannot refinance. With the exchange, and with the capital from GMAC and asset sales, it probably can buy time.
 But even if it does get time, it is not clear it can put it to good use. Nearly all the mortgage loans it is making now are being sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises, and it may be at a disadvantage to better-financed competitors.
 ''ResCap has not proven it has a business model that can produce the required operating cash flow to service and ultimately repay'' its debts, Moody's said last week in reducing the company's bond rating to a very low level of junk. ''Even after this exchange, we believe ResCap's debt levels will remain inconsistent with its long-term earnings,'' said Craig Emrick, a Moody's vice president. 
 ResCap reported high profits in the good years, but its recent losses have been greater than the profits ever were. General Motors still has plenty of problems with the car business, but it has been forced to divert capital to a mortgage venture that may never be able to recover. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The High and Low Finance column on Friday, about a mortgage company that is seeking a reduction in the principal it owes its lenders, misspelled the surname of an analyst for CreditSights who wrote about the situation. He is Richard Hofmann, not Hoffmann.

HEADLINE: Putin Is Installed as Prime Minister, Picking Up Where He Left Off as President

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; David Stout and Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia's Parliament overwhelmingly confirmed Vladimir V. Putin as prime minister on Thursday, completing his managed departure from the presidency in a manner that left him the country's dominant politician, with a firm grip on power.
 Mr. Putin, out of office only a day, received 392 votes in the 450-seat Duma, Parliament's lower house, before the resolution confirming his new post was handed to his protege and presidential successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who promptly accepted it.
 Only 56 members of Parliament, all Communists, voted against the appointment. Their party leader issued a scathing assessment of Mr. Putin's eight years of rule, saying they were marked by lost opportunities. Two members of Parliament were not present. 
 The dissenting speech was broadcast live on national television, unusual in a country where criticism of Mr. Putin has been blocked from television for years.
 But Mr. Putin, with the guarantee of 315 votes from United Russia, the party he leads, once again commanded the stage. Before the vote, he delivered a 45-minute speech proposing a series of domestic policy initiatives. While the speech included many of Mr. Medvedev's campaign themes, it was largely indistinguishable from Mr. Putin's presidential addresses over his two terms. 
 ''Great and grandiose tasks lie before us,'' he said. Mr. Medvedev sat silently. 
 The proposals included efforts to reduce double-digit inflation; tax breaks for education, housing and medical costs; and more spending for housing, infrastructure and military equipment. 
 He also proposed tax reductions for the oil sector and a law to stop corporate raiding, and said his government would work to revive agriculture and spur domestic food production. 
 Mr. Putin, 55, suggested that he would move quickly and that legislators would receive draft legislation in August. 
 The underlying message centered on continuing the economic rebound, both to raise living standards and economic security for Russia's citizens and to secure Russia's path as a resurgent world power, themes that Mr. Putin developed as president.
 In Washington on Thursday, the State Department said that Russia had ordered the expulsion of two American military attaches working at the United States Embassy in Moscow. ''We believe that the expulsions were not justified,'' Sean McCormack, a department spokesman, said. ''But as we all know, in the world of diplomacy, sometimes these things happen from time to time.''
 He said department officials were not making ''any particular connection'' between the expulsions and earlier dust-ups between Washington and Moscow. 
 Mr. Medvedev, 42, was sworn in as Russia's third post-Soviet president on Wednesday. His path to office had been assured since December, when Mr. Putin, who under the Constitution could not seek a third consecutive term, endorsed him.
 Mr. Medvedev's inauguration as head of state and Mr. Putin's confirmation as the leader of government created a new model for Russian power, which has become known here as a ''diarchy.'' But much remained undone.
 There was no public indication of the shape of the new government or of the assignments of the ministers and advisers who made up Mr. Putin's entourage. 
 Although Mr. Putin spoke at length about prosperity, he passed more quickly over Russia's corruption problems, which one legislator called ''a scourge.'' Corruption, already widespread in the post-Soviet world, became a daily facet of Russian life under Mr. Putin, from bribes for school admissions to reports of kickbacks and forced corporate takeovers touching the highest reaches of Kremlin power.
 Mr. Putin also sat through a rare public critique, as Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, explained why his party would not support Mr. Putin as prime minister.
 During Mr. Putin's rule, Mr. Zyuganov said, Russia's population declined and many highly educated citizens moved away. Food and utility prices have climbed, he said, and infrastructure, factories and heavy machinery have fallen into disrepair.
 While commodity prices rose severalfold, he said, the country did not revive agriculture or manufacturing, invest enough in education or develop a high-technology sector. And democratic development stopped. 
 ''With this course and this team,'' he said, ''we shall not be able to make any progress and will end up with the stagnation of even those achievements you are so proud of.''
 Mr. Zyuganov's address had little effect. A few minutes later, Mr. Putin received most of the votes in the chamber. The legislators rose for a standing ovation.

HEADLINE: The Conservative Revival

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
For years, American and British politics were in sync. Reagan came in roughly the same time as Thatcher, and Clinton's Third Way approach mirrored Blair's. But the British conservatives never had a Gingrich revolution in the 1990s or the Bush victories thereafter. They got their losing in early, and, in the wilderness, they rethought modern conservatism while their American counterparts were clinging to power. 
 Today, British conservatives are on the way up, while American conservatives are on the way down. British conservatives have moved beyond Thatcherism, while American conservatives pine for another Reagan. The British Conservative Party enjoyed a series of stunning victories in local elections last week, while polls show American voters thoroughly rejecting the Republican brand. 
 The flow of ideas has changed direction. It used to be that American conservatives shaped British political thinking. Now the influence is going the other way. 
 The British conservative renovation begins with this insight: The central political debate of the 20th century was over the role of government. The right stood for individual freedom while the left stood for extending the role of the state. But the central debate of the 21st century is over quality of life. In this new debate, it is necessary but insufficient to talk about individual freedom. Political leaders have to also talk about, as one Tory politician put it, ''the whole way we live our lives.''
 That means, first, moving beyond the Thatcherite tendency to put economics first. As Oliver Letwin, one of the leading Tory strategists put it: ''Politics, once econo-centric, must now become socio-centric.'' David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, makes it clear that his primary focus is sociological. Last year he declared: ''The great challenge of the 1970s and 1980s was economic revival. The great challenge in this decade and the next is social revival.'' In another speech, he argued: ''We used to stand for the individual. We still do. But individual freedoms count for little if society is disintegrating. Now we stand for the family, for the neighborhood -- in a word, for society.''
 This has led to a lot of talk about community, relationships, civic engagement and social responsibility. Danny Kruger, a special adviser to Cameron, wrote a much-discussed pamphlet, ''On Fraternity.'' These conservatives are not trying to improve the souls of citizens. They're trying to use government to foster dense social bonds.
 They want voters to think of the Tories as the party of society while Labor is the party of the state. They want the country to see the Tories as the party of decentralized organic networks and the Laborites as the party of top-down mechanistic control.
 As such, the Conservative Party has spent a lot of time thinking about how government should connect with citizens. Basically, everything should be smaller, decentralized and interactive. They want a greater variety of schools, with local and parental control. They want to reverse the trend toward big central hospitals. Health care, Cameron says, is as much about regular long-term care as major surgery, and patients should have the power to construct relationships with caretakers, pharmacists and local facilities.
 Cameron also believes government should help social entrepreneurs scale up their activities without burdening them with excessive oversight.
 This focus means that Conservatives talk not only about war and G.D.P., but also the softer stuff. There's been more emphasis on environmental issues, civility, assimilation and the moral climate. Cameron has spent an enormous amount of time talking about marriage, families and children. 
 Some of his ideas would not sit well with American conservatives. He wants to create 4,200 more health visitors, who would come into the homes of new parents and help them manage day-to-day stress. But he also talks about rewriting the tax code to make it more family friendly, making child care more accessible, and making the streets safer.
 Some of this is famously gauzy, and Cameron is often disdained as a mere charmer. But politically it works. The Tory modernization project has produced stunning support in London, the southern suburbs, the Welsh heartlands and the ailing north. It's not only that voters are tired of Labor. The Conservatives have successfully ''decontaminated'' their brand. They're offering something in tune with the times.
 Cameron describes a new global movement, with rising center-right parties in Sweden, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, California and New York (he admires Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg). American conservatives won't simply import this model. But there's a lot to learn from it. The only question is whether Republicans will learn those lessons sooner, or whether they will learn them later, after a decade or so in the wilderness.

HEADLINE: Not the Mayflower, but the Titanic

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland 

 BODY:
At least he got the name of the ship right.
 In remarks to top government leaders here on Thursday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg explained that his traveling companion, Christine C. Quinn, the New York City Council speaker, had an unusual tie to Belfast. Ms. Quinn ''traces her ancestry right back here to Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, adding, ''Her mother was one of the few survivors of the Titanic,'' which was built in Belfast.
 Her mother? 
 Nope. It was her grandmother, Helen Shine Callaghan. Twenty years old at the time, she managed to escape her steerage accommodations on the Titanic in 1912, becoming one of about 700 people to make it to safety after the ship struck an iceberg. More than 1,500 people died.
 Standing at Mr. Bloomberg's side, Ms. Quinn interrupted his remarks in mock horror. ''Grandmother!'' she shouted, as laughter erupted among the local dignitaries and economic development officials.
 ''Great-grandmother,'' Mr. Bloomberg responded, playing it safe. 
 Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn are among about a dozen city officials and employees on a whirlwind tour of Belfast, the location of a major investment conference this week. The purpose of the conference is to lure investors to Northern Ireland now that a stable government shared between Protestants and Catholics has replaced decades of violent conflict.
 Last month, four New York pension funds agreed to invest $150 million in infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland. 
 A little later, Mr. Bloomberg gave the line another try. Speaking on the steps of the Northern Ireland Parliament at a news conference with Ian Paisley, the first minister of Northern Ireland, he introduced Ms. Quinn as ''the speaker of our City Council, whose grandmother came from Northern Ireland, and, actually she came on a boat, which didn't make it, but she did.''
 ''We are all pleased her grandmother did, or you would not be here, I suppose,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, nodding toward Ms. Quinn.
 The Mayor on Marketing
 Mr. Bloomberg, who is working on a new book about management, found an audience eager for his advice in Northern Ireland. 
 In his keynote address at the conference inside Parliament, Mr. Bloomberg explained to Northern Ireland's top government officials that ''attracting tourists is like any other business: You have to market your product.''
 He said that to lure big companies to the region, Northern Ireland would need ''good schools and a well-educated work force,'' not to mention ''good infrastructure, especially transportation links to other commercial hubs.''
 He warned that to become a destination, the region must let investors and tourists know that the decades-long violent conflict between Catholics and Protestants is over. 
 ''It's all here -- but you need people to know about it,'' he said, and if it was not already obvious, Mr. Bloomberg added, ''We're eager to share strategies that have worked well in New York.''
 Elected leaders and business heads heaped praise on the mayor, treating him like a head of state and speaking in reverent tones about the health of New York City under his watch.
 Introducing Mr. Bloomberg at a news conference, Jim Rodgers, the lord mayor of Belfast, said, ''New York City is in an Ivy League all its own.''
 The Political Interest
 City politics do not end at the water's edge. 
 At least two potential candidates for mayor traveled to Belfast as part of New York's delegation, and both seemed ever-eager to reach out to the Irish community, a powerful voting bloc in the city.
 Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker, frequently discussed her ties to the region and emphasized her familiarity with the political landscape. 
 ''Here comes Gerry Adams, and he knows my name,'' Ms. Quinn said at one point, referring to the head of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the Irish Republican Army.
 Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. may not be on a first-name basis with Mr. Adams, but he does oversee the pension funds that have pledged to invest in Northern Ireland. 
 That was enough for Mr. Bloomberg, who ribbed the comptroller about his investment choice: ''While some cynics back home might say that Bill is just courting the Irish voters back home -- can you imagine that? -- it's actually a perfect example, seriously, of how good policy can also make good politics.''

HEADLINE: Thinking About November

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The fight for the Democratic nomination seems to be winding down. It's not completely over, but the odds now overwhelmingly favor Barack Obama. 
 Assuming that Mr. Obama is the nominee, he'll lead a party that, judging by the usual indicators, should be poised for an easy victory -- perhaps even a landslide.
 Yet Democrats are worried. Are those worries justified? 
 Before I try to answer that question, let's talk about those indicators.
 Political scientists, by and large, believe that what happens on the campaign trail, while it gives talking heads something to talk about, is more or less irrelevant to what happens on Election Day. Instead, they place their faith in statistical analyses that identify three main determinants of presidential voting.
 First, votes are affected by the state of the economy -- mainly economic performance in the year or so preceding the election. 
 Second, the approval rating of the current president strongly affects his party's ability to hold power.
 Third, the electorate seems to suffer from an eight-year itch: parties rarely manage to hold the White House for more than two terms in a row.
 This year, all of these factors strongly favor the Democrats. Indeed, the Democratic Party hasn't enjoyed this favorable a political environment since 1964. Robert Erikson, a political scientist at Columbia, tells me: ''It would be difficult to find any serious indicator that does not point to a Democratic victory in 2008.''
 What about polls that still seem to give John McCain a good chance of winning? Pay no attention, say the experts: general election polls this early tell you almost nothing about what will happen in November. Remember 1992: as late as June, Gallup put Ross Perot in first place, Bill Clinton in third.
 There's just one thing that should give Democrats pause -- but it's a big one: the fight for the nomination has divided the party along class and race lines in a way that I believe is unprecedented, at least in modern times.
 Ironically, much of Mr. Obama's initial appeal was the hope that he could transcend these divisions. At first, voting patterns seemed consistent with this hope. In February, for example, he received the support of half of Virginia's white voters as well as that of a huge majority of African-Americans. 
 But this week, Mr. Obama, while continuing to win huge African-American majorities, lost North Carolina whites by 23 points, Indiana whites by 22 points. Mr. Obama's white support continues to be concentrated among the highly educated; there was little in Tuesday's results to suggest that his problems with working-class whites have significantly diminished.
 Discussions of how and why Mr. Obama's support narrowed over time have a Rashomon-like quality: different observers see very different truths. But at this point it doesn't matter whose fault it was. What does matter is that Mr. Obama appears to have won the nomination with a deep but narrow base consisting of African-Americans and highly educated whites. And now he needs to bring Democrats who opposed him back into the fold.
 It's possible that this will happen automatically -- that bad feelings from the nomination fight will fade away of their own accord. In recent decades, Democrats have had little trouble unifying after hard-fought primary campaigns. 
 But this time the division seems to go deeper than ordinary political rivalry. The closest parallel I can think of is the bitter intraparty struggles of the 1920s, which pitted urban, often Catholic Democrats against Protestant farmers. 
 So what can be done to heal the party's current divisions?
 More tirades from Obama supporters against Mrs. Clinton are not the answer -- they will only further alienate her grass-roots supporters, many of whom feel that she received a raw deal. 
 Nor is it helpful to insult the groups that supported Mrs. Clinton, either by suggesting that racism was their only motivation or by minimizing their importance. 
 After the Pennsylvania primary, David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, airily dismissed concerns about working-class whites, saying that they have ''gone to the Republican nominee for many elections.'' On Tuesday night, Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist, declared that ''we don't have to just rely on white blue-collar voters and Hispanics.'' That sort of thing has to stop.
 One thing the Democrats definitely need to do is give delegates from Florida and Michigan -- representatives of citizens who voted in good faith, and whose support the party may well need this November -- seats at the convention. 
 And to the extent that campaigning matters, Mr. Obama should center his campaign on economic issues that matter to working-class families, whatever their race.
 The point is that Mr. Obama has an extraordinary opportunity in this year's election. He should do everything possible to avoid squandering it.

HEADLINE: Senator's Ties To Real Estate Draw Criticism

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 

 BODY:
He has made millions as a title insurance executive, landlord and real estate developer in this college town, where the economy, despite trouble nationwide, is still growing nicely. Now, as a United States senator, with the mortgage mess fueling a national economic slowdown, Richard C. Shelby has more say over the revamping of housing finance laws than almost anyone else in Congress. 
 Mr. Shelby, 74, does not run a key Congressional committee. Instead, as the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, he is using his clout and the Democrats' slim majority in the Senate to help determine what gets in, or almost as important, what is left out, of legislation. 
 He will soon play a major role in deciding the fate of one such bill, to help struggling homeowners, that the House passed, 266 to 154, on Thursday. 
 But over the years, his critics say, Mr. Shelby's ties to the mortgage industry and the Alabama real estate market, and the generous campaign donations he receives from financial services companies, have distorted his perspective and led him to delay critical legislative remedies.
 Indeed, Mr. Shelby's legislative and business worlds have often intersected. For instance, while on the Banking Committee, he financed an apartment complex he owns in Tuscaloosa with a $5 million loan from Freddie Mac, the same government-sponsored mortgage company whose regulation his committee is reshaping. 
 Even his efforts to steer federal money to the University of Alabama, where a recently built $60 million science building is named after Mr. Shelby and his wife, Annette, have benefited him. The tens of millions in earmarks have helped the university, his alma mater, grow and attract more students. The tenants of his apartment complex are mostly students.
 Mr. Shelby said in an interview his business dealings posed no conflict.
 ''It doesn't affect me at all. I'm going to put the interests of the nation first,'' he said. His stubbornness over housing laws, he said, stems from his free-market philosophy and opposition to using tax dollars to bail out people who acted recklessly. ''We can't bail out everything,'' he added.
 Others see it differently. ''Senator Shelby would have prevented anything going through that the industry was not happy with,'' said Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina, who has pushed legislation to crack down on predatory lending, an effort that has stalled in the Senate in part because of Mr. Shelby's reservations. ''That's the sense from all the people who are involved in the issue.''
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who leads the House Banking Committee and has won points for working with the Bush administration on housing issues, said he had been surprised by Mr. Shelby's unwillingness to accept several proposals like a permanent increase in the cap to $730,000 from about $360,000 on home loans that can be federally insured.
 ''I think he has been the major obstacle,'' Mr. Frank said, calling it ''a serious problem in getting things done.''
 The son of an Alabama steelworker, Mr. Shelby was elected to the House in 1978, after working as a trial lawyer, prosecutor, magistrate and state senator in an up-by-the-bootstraps career that saw him earn a wide political base as a conservative Democrat in the deep South. 
 Eight years later, he won election to the Senate, but his ties to the Democratic Party ruptured with Bill Clinton's election to the White House in 1992. Mr. Shelby blasted Mr. Clinton for what he considered his liberal tax-and-spend ways, and in 1994 he became a Republican, a split that caused lingering tensions with former colleagues.
 A tall, imposing man, Mr. Shelby has adopted a much lower profile in the last few years after he and his office were the targets of an F.B.I. criminal investigation into the possible leak of classified information concerning a National Security Agency intercept on Sept. 10, 2001, indicating possible terror attacks in the works. No one was charged in the case, but the leak provoked tensions with the White House.
 Mr. Shelby has become considerably richer in his years in Congress, with a net worth of $9 million to $32 million, according to his 2007 financial disclosure form.
 The single biggest source of his new wealth is the 124-unit apartment complex -- complete with a pool and a tennis court -- that he built in Tuscaloosa with his wife in 1995 on land that had been assessed at a few hundred thousand dollars. Now, with the 13 new apartment buildings, it is worth nearly $8 million, property records show.
 The financing on the apartments, Yorktown Commons, a few miles from the University of Alabama, shows the complications of serving on the Senate Banking Committee while also developing real estate.
 A $5 million mortgage on the apartment complex, arranged in October 2002 by the Reilly Mortgage Group of Virginia, now owned by Wells Fargo Bank, was financed by Freddie Mac. Mr. Shelby said he did not know Freddie Mac would assume his loan. ''This was just a plain-vanilla commercial loan,'' said a Wells Fargo official, who asked not to be named because bank rules prohibit public discussion of loans.
 While serving as chairman -- a post he held until Democrats took control of Congress in 2007 -- and more recently as the ranking Republican, Mr. Shelby has called for allowing Freddie Mac's regulator to demand increases in the capital cushion the company must keep to back up its own debt and the mortgages it guarantees. 
 But Mr. Shelby has for years blocked legislation that would have restrained Freddie Mac and its sibling, Fannie Mae, on the grounds that the bills did not go far enough. In doing so, the mortgage financiers were able to expand rapidly. His positions on other housing issues have frequently been in line with those advocated by the Mortgage Bankers Association, whose legislative agenda was devised in part by Tom Szydlowski, a senior executive at Reilly Mortgage, the bank that arranged Mr. Shelby's $5 million loan and sold it to Freddie Mac. Mr. Szydlowski joined Reilly a month after the loan to Mr. Shelby.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association and Mr. Shelby opposed a provision in a Senate bill debated this spring that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to lower the principal on certain loans for homeowners facing foreclosure. Housing advocates viewed the provision as their highest priority, but Mr. Shelby and the mortgage bankers argued it would push up lending costs. It was removed from the measure.
 Mr. Shelby and a spokesman for Mr. Szydlowski said there was no relationship between Mr. Shelby's legislative views and the loan. What guides his positions, Mr. Shelby said, is his confidence in free markets, tempered by proper government oversight and disclosure requirements.
 ''I want the market to work if it can, and most of the time it will, but not without some pain,'' Mr. Shelby said in an interview.
 But Bill Buzenberg, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington ethics group, said Mr. Shelby should not be playing a central role on legislation that would affect mortgage bankers and Freddie Mac.
 ''Even if everything is by the book, it looks bad, it just smells,'' Mr. Buzenberg said. 
 Questions about the intersection of his two careers, in real estate and politics, have come up before. Just two blocks from the county courthouse here is the headquarters of Tuscaloosa Title, a real estate title insurance company Mr. Shelby has controlled since 1974.
 When the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2002 proposed rules to save homebuyers hundreds of dollars in closing costs by allowing a single, discounted package that would include items like the appraisal and title insurance, Mr. Shelby objected, saying the rules would hurt small businesses. Tuscaloosa Title, in a one-story office building that he owns, employs about a dozen people. 
 ''Only the larger institutions would have the market power and volume of business that would permit them to offer volume discounts,'' he said in a 2003 speech to the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.
 The agency, under pressure from Congress, ended up withdrawing the proposal.
 Since his early days in Congress in the 1980s, Mr. Shelby has won support from the banking industry, collecting fees for speeches before industry groups and, since 2000, raising nearly $1 million from industry powerhouses.
 On occasion, the timing of the contributions and Mr. Shelby's official positions have overlapped. Last June, Mr. Shelby pronounced in a television interview that Congress should not increase the taxes on private equity firms like Blackstone Group.
 Six days later, campaign finance records show, Mr. Shelby collected nearly $25,000 in donations from Blackstone executives. Mr. Shelby said executives at Blackstone have long supported him. ''That is not relevant to any decision I made, whether I raise money or don't raise money,'' he said.
 Mr. Shelby, who has a reputation on Capitol Hill as a populist, has also taken certain positions that have alienated the banking and financial worlds and earned him admirers among some Washington consumer advocates. He has been particularly dogged in fighting for goals like privacy protections on the financial information of consumers and corporate reporting requirements. 
 ''I'm on the taxpayers' side,'' Mr. Shelby said in the interview.
 Whatever the issue, the Democrats' slim majority in the Senate helps explain Mr. Shelby's outsize influence. There are 49 Democratic senators and two independents who usually vote Democratic, but Senate rules require 60 votes to cut off debate on controversial legislation. Democrats realize they need Mr. Shelby to pass a deal. 
 ''He may be slow, he may be cautious, he may be frustrating,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who is the Banking Committee chairman. ''But once he makes the deal, it happens.''

HEADLINE: Blue-Light Specials at Citigroup As Its New Chief Plans a Revival

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Vikram S. Pandit is doing some serious spring cleaning at Citigroup. 
 Since becoming chief executive in December, Mr. Pandit has been clearing out the corporate attic of weak businesses and unloading worrisome assets at bargain-basement prices.
 In an effort to streamline the sprawling company and placate restive shareholders, Mr. Pandit has sold or closed more than 45 branches in eight states. He has also disposed of Citigroup's headquarters building in Tokyo and its investment-banking base in New York and ditched more than $12.5 billion in loans used to finance corporate buyouts. And he has jettisoned the Diners Club credit card franchise, Citi's commercial leasing divisions and a big pension administration unit.
 Mr. Pandit is not done yet. After months of false starts, Citigroup is now trying to sell Primerica Financial, a life insurance and mutual fund company, according to people close to the situation. He is also looking to sell its back-office outsourcing unit in India and its Smith Barney brokerage firm in Australia. Some speculate he also may try to sell 340 bank branches in Germany, possibly to Deutsche Bank. 
 Together, all these sales could raise billions of dollars for Citigroup at a time the bank is feverishly raising capital. Yet the moves also reflect a crucial shift in how Mr. Pandit plans to run the bank. 
 Mr. Pandit will lay out his vision on Friday in his first major presentation to investors and Wall Street analysts. Mr. Pandit is intent on keeping Citigroup together, rather than carving up the financial conglomerate, as some investors are urging. But in a break from the financial supermarket model championed by Sanford I. Weill, who built Citigroup through acquisitions in the late 1990s, Mr. Pandit plans to focus on businesses and regions where Citigroup can generate the fattest returns. 
 At the same time, Mr. Pandit vows to ''break apart the culture'' and demand better performance. To do so, he has brought in executives and overhauled compensation so his managers have incentives to focus on what is best for the entire company, rather than their own corner of it. 
 ''If it's only thinking about my profits and losses, I'm going to hold that person accountable,'' Mr. Pandit said in a recent interview. 
 The big question is whether Mr. Pandit can pull off this plan. His predecessor, Charles O. Prince III, made similar promises but lacked the operational skill to keep the company on track. Many investors are skeptical, and with good reason: Citigroup's share price has fallen 17 percent this year and is down 55 percent in the last 12 months. Many Citigroup employees are doubtful, too. 
 Some Citigroup bankers complain that Mr. Pandit has failed to communicate his vision, especially for the consumer banking businesses, which account for more than half of the bank's profit. Decisions, they say, get bogged down by internal politics and a new top-down hierarchy. (Insiders say power rests with Mr. Pandit and a group of top advisers nicknamed the G-5. Mr. Pandit denies that.) 
 Overhauling Citigroup will be a long slog, and Friday's presentation will show how forthright Mr. Pandit will be about the challenges ahead. It took more than three years before big rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo saw similar efforts start to pay off. 
 Those companies, unlike Citigroup, had the benefit of proven managers and a flush economy. Citigroup, by contrast, has suffered more than $40 billion in write-offs and is likely to absorb billions more. That will eat away at the money Mr. Pandit can invest to fuel the company's future growth. The clock is ticking.
 Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said in a recent interview that selling sideline businesses was one way that Citigroup hoped to plug the holes in its balance sheet. Profits will be allocated to faster-growing businesses, including many overseas. ''There is no particular urgency to sell any particular asset,'' he said. ''These are good businesses that are for sale, and we want to work with buyers who see them as a strategic fit.'' 
 Citigroup has been down this road before, and the last time, things did not end well. In July 2004, Mr. Prince announced that the bank would hold a ''garage sale'' to sell businesses. Citigroup sold its Travelers Life and Annuity business and asset management arm, and part of its commercial leasing operations. It also quietly sold stakes in banks in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, and the Nikko Cordial brokerage firm in Japan. But then, a few years later, Mr. Prince embarked on a $26 billion acquisition spree and strangely reinvested in many of those same areas, including buying all of Nikko Cordial.
 These days, Citigroup is employing a five-step process to decide what businesses to sell, close or keep. Executives examine industry growth trends, market positions, geographic growth rates, business plans and financial results. Mr. Pandit and his team then make the final call. 
 Citigroup is hawking tens of billions of dollars of mortgage assets and buyout loans at deep discounts. It is closing bank branches in places like Florida and Connecticut, and finance offices in Mexico and Japan, after barreling into those regions a few years ago. It closed its mortgage lending warehouse division, sold a stake in Visa and a Brazilian credit card business, and will soon spin off the Nikko asset management group in Japan. 
 In mid-April, the company swallowed an after-tax loss of $325 million when it sold CitiCapital, a domestic equipment financing unit with about $13 billion in assets. And Citigroup said it would restructure Old Lane, the hedge fund it bought from Mr. Pandit for $800 million, after virtually all of its outside investors pulled out.
 Executives say that as Citigroup retrenches in some areas, it will bulk up in more profitable ones, especially in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. 
 But many analysts say more Citigroup businesses will be up for sale. Citigroup's stand-alone consumer units, like its auto and student lending operations, are natural candidates. But the company might wait for better market conditions before pursuing a deal. Another business that might eventually be spun off is Citigroup's large credit card operation, which Mr. Pandit has kept separate from the company's consumer operations and which has been hampered by sluggish domestic growth. 
 Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment on speculation.
 Some analysts worry that Mr. Pandit might even go too far and sell too much at fire-sale prices. Doing so might sacrifice future earnings and market share. 
 ''Today, they are more focused on dumping ballast,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''Then, they will have to turn their attention to growth.''

HEADLINE: Europeans And British Leave Rates Unchanged

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: ATHENS 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent on Thursday, saying that the region's economy remained resilient despite nearly nine months of financial turmoil. 
 Also Thursday, the Bank of England kept its benchmark rate at 5 percent, pausing to study the effects of three interest rate cuts it has made since Dec. 6. Both decisions were expected.
 The president of the European bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in Athens that information on business confidence, consumers' mood and the service industries had been mixed, but that broadly, Europe had been largely untouched by the credit crisis and the slowdown in the United States.
 ''Latest data and survey information on economic activity confirm previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first half of 2008,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''Over all, the euro-area economy has sound fundamentals.''
 While European stock markets have risen in recent weeks, the credit markets -- particularly among banks -- remain tense, reflecting uncertainty about whether the damage linked to the American mortgage market has run its course. 
 Though sanguine, Mr. Trichet's message fell short of the one given last week by the Bank of England, which hinted that financial assets backed by mortgages had become undervalued because of an overly gloomy outlook.
 Like the Federal Reserve in Washington, the Bank of England is facing the need to balance declining housing prices and slower growth with its desire to combat rising inflation.
 The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2 percent, giving investors a strong incentive to buy higher-yielding short-term European assets. Among the major economies, only Japan's overnight rate, at 0.5 percent, is lower.
 Jennifer McKeown, European economist at Capital Economics in London, predicted that with inflation in Europe running at a 3.3 percent pace, the bank would maintain rates ''for some months yet.'' Ian McCafferty, chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, said it was ''no surprise that rates were kept on hold this month.''
 ''Energy and raw material prices continue to climb,'' Mr. McCafferty said, ''meaning inflationary pressures are intensifying as producers are forced to pass these on.''
 The announcements in Europe came after the South Korean central bank left its own rate unchanged Thursday.
 Policy makers in many regions of the world are grappling with cooling economies, even as soaring commodities prices, particularly oil, reduce the profits of businesses and create hardship for many consumers.
 As the South Korean central bank left its main rate at 5 percent, it issued a statement saying, ''The recent economic conditions at home and abroad are increasing both the downside risks to economic growth and upside risks to inflation.'' 
 Economists had expected the banks to leave rates steady on Thursday, though the Bank of England is expected to cut by a quarter-point, to 4.75 percent, at its June 5 meeting.
 With British inflation running at 2.5 percent, which is still above the bank's comfort zone, the governor, Mervyn King, and his colleagues have sought other means to ease credit availability since the market began to tighten last summer.
 The Bank of England said last month that it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed securities valued at about $100 billion for government bonds in an effort to restore calm to financial markets there.

HEADLINE: Toyota Expects Decline in Annual Profit

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation said on Thursday that its annual profit would probably drop for the first time in nine years because of the slowdown in the United States economy, accelerating a shift by it and other Asian car manufacturers into emerging markets like China, Latin America and the Middle East.
 The shifting emphasis to those markets is part of a broader trend in the industry, and underscores the declining stature of the United States in the global economy. A rising portion of sales for both Asian carmakers and American rivals like General Motors have come in emerging markets that were not even a factor a decade ago. 
 Toyota, now in a dead heat with G.M. to be the world's largest car company, said most of its recent profit growth had come in new markets like Brazil, China and Russia. It said the growth helped offset sluggish sales in the United States, traditionally Toyota's largest and most profitable market, and other mature economies like Europe and Japan. 
 ''Our profit structure has become more geographically balanced, with growing contributions from resource-rich countries and emerging countries,'' Toyota's president, Katsuaki Watanabe, said in a statement.
 Declining American sales along with the weakening dollar and rising prices for materials prompted Toyota to forecast a 27.2 percent decline in net profit, to 1.25 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) during the current fiscal year that ends in March 2009. Last month, Honda Motor projected an 18 percent drop in net profit this fiscal year, citing similar reasons.
 Despite the weaker outlook, Toyota showed it remained in an enviable position compared with Detroit's ailing automakers. On Thursday, Toyota reported record earnings of 1.72 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) in the fiscal year ended March 31, bolstered by robust sales of high-mileage autos like its Yaris subcompact and Prius hybrid. That was up 4.5 percent from the year before. 
 While emerging markets offer the promise of new sales, analysts warned they could also create challenges for established auto companies like Toyota. China and India have spawned homegrown car manufacturers, which in time could threaten Toyota in the same way Japanese auto companies have humbled Detroit.
 These new companies are already turning into formidable competitors in their own markets, threatening Toyota's growth there. The Indian carmaker Tata, which has introduced an ultra-low-price subcompact called the Nano, has exposed a potential weakness of Toyota, whose cars are still priced beyond the reach of the fledgling middle class in emerging countries.
 On Thursday, Toyota said income in North America fell nearly a third last year, to 305.3 billion yen ($2.9 billion). The company blamed losses at its financing unit and stagnating sales, which rose just 15,653 vehicles, to 2.96 million vehicles. In particular, Toyota said higher gasoline prices hurt sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, including its recently remodeled Tundra pickup, though it relies less heavily for profits on these kinds of vehicles than Detroit. 
 Toyota said it expected total United States vehicle sales in 2008 to fall into the low 15 million range from last year's 16.1 million. Toyota still relies on the United States for a third of its sales.
 In Japan, its home market, which has a saturated auto market and a quickly aging population, Toyota said vehicle sales fell by 84,763 vehicles, to 2.19 million. It also said growth rates were sluggish in Western Europe.
 By contrast, Toyota said its strongest sales gains came in the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand, Africa and Latin America -- once minor markets that are still lumped together as ''other'' in Toyota's earnings statements. Last year, sales in these regions rose by a combined 231,353 vehicles, to 1.53 million vehicles, Toyota said.

HEADLINE: Homeowner Rescue Bill Passed Despite Veto Threat

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Rachel Swarns contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hoping to throw a rescue line to at least half a million families in danger of losing their homes, the House on Thursday approved legislation that seeks to broadly expand the availability of mortgages insured by the federal government.
 The House vote, 266 to 154, defied a veto threat by President Bush and was cast mostly along party lines, with only 39 Republicans supporting the bill. Not a single Democrat voted against the measure, and the Republican votes in favor came predominantly from lawmakers in states at greatest risk of foreclosures. 
 Among the Republicans in favor were Nevada's two Republican representatives, seven Republicans from Florida, five from Michigan, four from Pennsylvania, three from North Carolina and two each from Ohio and Illinois. 
 With the White House staunchly opposed to the plan, and Senate Republicans appearing increasingly reluctant to sign on, the bill's leading champion, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, conceded that its future was in doubt. ''I don't know what it means for the final situation,'' Mr. Frank said after the vote. ''I can't predict it.'' 
 What remains unclear is whether the Bush administration will negotiate with Congress on efforts to help homeowners refinance into more stable and affordable loans, or if, in an election year, it ultimately wants to deny Democrats any credit if the plan were to work.
 Under the Democrats' plan, lenders could limit their losses from potential foreclosures by agreeing to reduce the principal balances of loans at risk of default. The borrowers, many with expensive adjustable-rate loans, could then apply to refinance with a more stable, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage insured by the federal government. 
 In addition to paying interest and principal, the borrower would pay a monthly insurance fee, which would go into a fund to protect taxpayers from losses. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 500,000 refinancings would be generated over the next five years, at a cost to taxpayers around $2.7 billion. 
 To sweeten the package for the administration, Mr. Frank's legislation included two measures that Mr. Bush has long demanded -- a modernization of the Federal Housing Administration and tighter regulation of the government-sponsored lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Mr. Frank made several other changes while drafting the bill to address concerns raised by the White House, but Mr. Bush and aides have denounced the legislation as a bailout for irresponsible home buyers and greedy lenders.
 After Thursday's vote, the White House scolded Democrats for persisting with their effort. 
 ''House Democrats passed bills that they know will never become law,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary. ''Most Americans understand that we shouldn't create a taxpayer-funded bailout for lenders and speculators.'' 
 Mr. Bush's veto threat on Wednesday was interpreted by many lawmakers as a signal to Senate Republicans to kill the housing legislation. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking Committee, has been struggling to get Republican support for a similar bill. 
 Several Republican members of Mr. Dodd's committee represent states where foreclosures are not a major problem, including the senior Republican, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. Even Senator Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican who is a member of the committee, has expressed reluctance in recent days to oppose the Bush administration, which says it can help more homeowners without new legislation. 
 In an announcement Thursday that coincided with the House vote, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced new details of a plan to expand an existing program intended to help homeowners, called FHA Secure. 
 Since it was created in August, that program has helped about 2,000 homeowners who were in default because of increases in their adjustable interest rates.
 Democrats call that a minuscule number, considering that by some estimates, as many as two million homes may be in danger of foreclosure this year. 
 Under the expanded program, beginning in July, the Federal Housing Administration for the first time would charge higher insurance premiums to borrowers viewed as presenting a higher credit risk. Currently, all borrowers pay the same premiums for mortgages insured by the federal government. 
 In addition to the mortgage refinancing plan, the House approved other measures as part of the housing package, including a number of tax provisions aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing and a bill to provide $15 billion for states to buy and repair foreclosed properties. The package also provides authority for state and local housing agencies to use tax-exempt bonds to refinance bad mortgages.
 In debating the main housing bill on the House floor Thursday, several Republicans complained that it would shift risk from private lenders to taxpayers, which would be unfair to the vast majority of American mortgage holders who pay their installments on time. 
 Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee said the bill would ''reward recklessness and provide a safety net for irresponsibility.''
 Democrats said their plan included a number of safeguards, including a restriction that only borrowers seeking to refinance a loan on their primary residence could qualify. 
 Mr. Frank also said that homeowners seeking help amid the current economic downturn would not be encouraged to make further mistakes. ''No borrower going through this program will come out and say, 'Oh, that was fun -- where do I buy a ticket to get back on Space Mountain?' '' he remarked. 
 Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and a sponsor of some of the housing legislation, said, ''If we can help Wall Street, we certainly can help the people who vote for us every day.''

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students share ideas about the origins and use of negative stereotypes, and view a video of a Muslim-American's response to this issue. They then create visual representations of images from a variety of media that depict specific stereotyped groups and offer ideas about how to confront or change those stereotypes in their school.
Author(s):
Sarah Shmitt, The New York Times Learning Network
Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance: An hour or more
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Define "stereotype" using word webs.
2. Generate ideas for confronting negative stereotypes by reading and discussing "Young Video Makers Try to Alter Islam's Face."
3. Design visuals to represent stereotypical as well as accurate representations of specific groups, with strategies for changing negative views of that group among their peers.
4. Share their ideas for confronting stereotypes with their peers and their school community.
Resources / Materials:
-classroom board
-student journals
-pens/pencils
-LCD projector with Internet connection
-Overhead projector (or handout of discussion questions for the in class activity)
-Copies of the New York Times article "Young Video Makers Try to Alter Islam's Face" found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080509friday.html (one per student)
-Old magazines, newspapers with photos, etc. (enough for students to share)
Activities/Procedures:
NOTE TO TEACHERS: This lesson embraces a potentially delicate subject: stereotypes. Some words associated with negative stereotypes may be used in class as an academic exercise, so students should be briefed on maintaining a respectful environment throughout the lesson.
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW
Before students enter class, have the word "Stereotype" written on the board with a circle around it. Ask students to come up with a definition of stereotype and write it in their journals. Then, with input from the whole class, create one definition of stereotype that everyone agrees with, such as "A generalization about what people are like; an exaggerated image of their characteristics without regard to individual attributes" (from the Teaching Tolerance Web site found at http://www.tolerance.org/teach/web/power_of_words/pdf/power_words_lesson_5.pdf). Alternatively, you may provide this definition for them at the beginning of class.
Brainstorm a list on the board of groups for which there are clear stereotypes (such as those based on religion, race, ethnicity/nationality, physical ability, sexual orientation, etc.) along with the slang name for that group. Or, if you prefer to emphasize more local concerns, include common school social groups (cheerleaders, skateboard punks, geeks, jocks, etc.).
Ask students to write the class definition for "stereotype" at the top of a new sheet of paper and to put the word itself at the center of a web on that sheet. Have students spend five minutes creating a word web for the word "stereotype" below their definition. Tell them that some words may be the offensive terms they brainstormed earlier; caution students to use these words respectfully.
Next, create a web on the board using the most salient words from students' webs (this activity may lead to some challenging and enlightening discussions that could serve as the foundation of future lessons).
If technology permits, tell students you would like to share with them one strategy that a young Muslim-American woman, Lena Khan, composed to confront stereotypes about Muslims. Then, using an LCD projector, play Ms. Khan's video "A Land Called Paradise" for students, found at http://www.linktv.org/onenation/winners.
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Young Video Makers Try to Alter Islam's Face" (found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080509friday.html) focusing on the following questions:
a. How many Muslims are there in the world today?
b. What is Ali Ardekani's complaint about how Muslims are depicted on the Internet?
c. How is Mr. Ardekani trying to "change the public face" of Islam?
d. Who is the "role model" for young Muslims in America and why?
e. Why, according to Ms. Khan, are the new videos and blogs by young Muslim Americans so popular?
f. Some viewers have criticized Murad Amayreh's "I Am A Muslim." What do they find fault with?
g. What universal cultural tradition does Mr. Ardekani poke fun at on his blog? Why do you think he chooses this tradition as the object of his good-natured ridicule?
h. How has Mr. Ardekani's success as a blogger/video-artist changed his life?
3. Organize students into small groups. Have each student group choose, by consensus, one stereotyped group as the focus for the project (described below). Display the following questions on an overhead (or distribute a handout). Ask students to discuss them in their groups with regard to the stereotyped group they have selected for their project. The answers to these questions ought to inform their homework assignment:
-What is the "picture in your head" when you think of this group?
-Where did you learn or acquire the slang term for this group?
-Where else have you seen or heard it?
-What are the hidden implications (connotations) of it? Are they positive, negative or neutral?
-Which traits does the term emphasize?
-How does the use of this term harm the people that it supposedly describes?
-How does it harm those who use it?
-What are some strategies that could be used to confront or change this stereotype among your student peers? How could you educate yourself or others to reduce the use of stereotypes?
After the discussion, have each group create a poster, presentation, skit or video that addresses stereotypical as well as accurate representations of their stereotyped group, using images and/or sound bites they collect from various media (provided in class or brought in by the students). Their final product should also include a list of three ways to confront or change the stereotype of that group in a positive way, as the Muslim-Americans profiled in the article did with their videos.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK
If projects were not completed in class, allow time for groups to finish them. Finally, have student groups present their work to the class and discuss. Explore the possibility of displaying projects around your school building or of designing a follow-up activity that confronts stereotypes in the school community.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Should amateurs like Mr. Ardekani be encouraged to dispense advice about religion and morality to troubled adolescents?
-Some people assert that all stereotypes are based on some measure of truth. Do you agree or disagree? Why or why not?
-What language do you hear in school halls or at school events that reinforce stereotypes? What can you do about this?
-Why do stereotypes exist? What purpose do they serve?
-What organizations are you aware of that promote stereotypes? Why do you think they thrive?
-How has the Internet helped or hurt groups that are often targeted?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated on active and respectful participation in the group activities, and completion and publication of the culminating project on confronting stereotypes.
Vocabulary:
Stereotypes, zealots, outsize, dissects, lampoons, garnered, darkly, extol, deprived, pious, jihad, notorious, spoof, stratospheric, contradict, sober, sentiment, enlightened, extremism, alter ego, broadsides, secular, queries, credentials, imam
Extension Activities:
1. Refer students to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Web site at www.tolerance.org. Have them implement a strategy from the Web site for dealing with hate speech or stereotyping at your school.
2. If student work from this lesson is displayed in the school building, tape butcher paper to a wall in a public area such as a cafeteria and provide markers for students to "talk back" to stereotypes. Collect student comments and responses for a school newspaper article or editorial on prejudice.
3. View a video of one of Anna Deveare-Smith's one-woman shows. Using her work as a model, choose an individual from history who had to confront prejudice and write a monologue in that person's voice that examines his/her reaction.
4. Research ways in which excerpts from and/or translations of religious texts have been used in service of or against specific groups of people (Mormons, Jews, Christians, women, homosexuals, Muslims, etc.).
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Fine Arts- Using clips from popular music, create a soundtrack that explores the use of negative stereotypes.
Geography- Graph the growth of a variety of religious populations in a number of countries using the Web site www.worldmapper.org.
Media Studies- Compare and contrast the depiction of Muslims in America as represented in the media since 9/11 and write a report on your findings.
Social Studies- Explore stereotypes of women throughout American history and create a timeline that uses quotes from historical documents to depict the evolution of the stereotype.
Teaching with The Times- Read The Times for coverage about Muslims in America for the next month and then write an analysis based on your findings. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
Background: There are a number of Web sites that help students and teachers talk about or examine prejudice and its role in history:
www.facinghistory.orgwww.tolerance.orgwww.TeachersAgainstPrejudice.org
References: Some ideas in this lesson were adapted from the lesson on the power of words offered by Teaching Tolerance at http://www.tolerance.org/teach/web/power_of_words/pdf/power_words_lesson_5.pdf

HEADLINE: Illegal Farm Workers Resort To Health Care in the Shadows

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: MADERA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The curandera is weary from work. Three, four, five times a day, the immigrant farm workers knock on her apartment door, begging her to cure their ailments. 
 They complain of indigestion, of rashes, of post-traumatic panic attacks. Then there are the house calls that compel her to crate up her potions and herbs and drive across town, often after midnight, to escape the notice of immigration police. 
 ''I've done so many cures that I'm exhausted; it gives me no time to rest,'' said Herminia L. Arenas, 55, the curandera, or traditional healer, who has practiced in this Central Valley town since migrating 14 years ago from Oaxaca, in southern Mexico. ''I want to retire, but I feel like I was sent here to help these people.''
 The people need help because they are in the United States illegally and because they are poor. Few have health insurance, but the backbreaking nature of their work, along with the toxicity of American poverty, insure that many are ailing. 
 They may visit a clinic or hospital if they are severely ill. But for many illegal immigrants, particularly indigenous Mexican groups like the Mixtecs, much of their health care is provided by a parallel system of spiritual healers, home remedies and self-medication. 
 Stories abound here of people who died -- of cancer, diabetes, even gangrene -- because they did not make it to an emergency room until it was too late. Public health officials also worry that the lack of access to conventional care may contribute to the spread of communicable diseases. They warn that the rampant use of antibiotics, often without medical direction, may speed the development of resistant bacterial strains.
 While acknowledging that some traditional treatments can complement modern medicine, they point out that others do considerable harm. Powders used to quiet colicky babies, for instance, have been found to contain heavy doses of lead. Without legal status, the immigrants have little protection against dangerous or fraudulent practices.
 Immigrants interviewed amid the vineyards of Madera and the cantaloupe fields of Mendota said they had faced numerous obstacles to pursuing conventional medical care. Above all, they said, was cost, but other factors included fear of deportation, long waits for treatment in medically underserved areas, and barriers of culture and language.
 Some said they supplement their care on trips to Mexico or Central America, seeking out less expensive doctors and stocking up on pharmaceuticals before trying the risky crossing back. 
 The healers, like their American counterparts, tend to specialize. There are hueseros, who set bones, and sobadors, who massage away pain. The curanderos use herbs and incantation to return the spirit to its equilibrium. 
 Farm workers, community leaders and health researchers said many immigrants devised their own antidotes. They brew recuperative teas from exotic herbs and roadside weeds. They enlist neighbors to inject them with vitamins and antibiotics from Mexico. Some of the medicines are sold under the counter at flea markets and botanicas, where amulets and incense share shelf space with Advil and Afrin. 
 Though the unlicensed sale of pharmaceuticals is not legal, and though some healers approach the edges of practicing medicine without a license, local police say enforcement of the laws is rare. 
 A recent visit to Ms. Arenas's nondescript apartment found her in the middle of an eight-day cleansing ceremony, or limpia, for Maria de Jesus, a 28-year-old illegal farm worker. Ms. de Jesus explained that she had been having headaches since a car accident three months earlier. 
 ''I feel like my heart is going to come out, it beats so fast,'' she said. In visits to a clinic and an emergency room, she had been given pills for high blood pressure, to little effect. She said the doctors also had no answer for the grotesque swelling in the crook of her left arm, where she carries her tomato bucket. 
 At wits' end, her husband delivered her to Ms. Arenas. ''I have faith in the curandera,'' Ms. de Jesus said. ''That's why I am here.''
 Ms. Arenas stepped outside to collect herbs from her garden. After mixing them with dashes of a Mexican cologne, she wrapped the sodden clumps around Maria's head, waist and limbs with cloth tourniquets. Her cures come to her, she explained, in a flash of revelation, sometimes as she studies the movements of a broken egg yolk. 
 ''Please bless this lady,'' Ms. Arenas prayed. ''Take all the bad spirits out and help me to heal her with your healing hands.''
 Leaving her patient to rest, Ms. Arenas drove with Ms. de Jesus's husband to the site of the accident, where he dug a hole and she sprinkled in rose petals, salt and holy water dispensed from a Gatorade bottle. After stomping in dirt, she waved Maria's clothing and prayed for her spirit to return home.
 Over the next few days, Ms. de Jesus reported feeling calmer and said her headaches were gone. The swelling in her arm had not subsided, however, so Ms. Arenas recommended seeing a physician. Ms. Arenas asked for $500 to cover her fee, as well as room and board, and the woman's husband paid with a check (a more typical visit costs $10 to $60 and lasts a few hours, she said).
 Studies find that many Latino immigrants arrive in the United States healthy, but then develop the trademark afflictions of their new home: diabetes, obesity, asthma, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Long hours in the fields often leave them with muscular and skeletal injuries, as well as rashes and burning eyes from pesticides and dust.
 There is no firm projection of the medical costs incurred by the estimated 11.1 million illegal immigrants in the United States, a fourth of whom live in California. A RAND Corporation study in 2000, the most recent year available, pegged the cost at $6.4 billion, including $1.1 billion from public sources. It found the share of medical costs attributable to illegal immigrants was half as large as expected for their share of the population.
 Health demographers estimate that half to two-thirds of California's illegal immigrants are uninsured. Women may receive occasional checkups because they qualify for prenatal and obstetrical care under Medicaid. But RAND found that half of illegal immigrant men had not seen a doctor in the previous year, compared with 25 percent of men born in the United States; one in six illegal immigrant men had never seen a doctor. 
 Studies also find that newcomers are only half as likely as natives to use emergency rooms, which are required to treat patients regardless of immigration status. The California Hospital Association estimates that 10 percent of the state's $9.7 billion in uncompensated care last year was for illegal immigrants, said Jan Emerson, a spokeswoman. 
 ''A lot of people assume the emergency room overcrowding problem is due to undocumented immigrants,'' Ms. Emerson said. ''That's not what we see. They show up when they truly need emergency care.''
 Jurley Cortez, 20, an illegal immigrant, has not been to an emergency room, doctor or dentist in her nine years in the United States, except for the perfunctory physical her school required for athletics. Now a high school graduate, she picks tomatoes and cantaloupe near Mendota.
 Three years ago, when Ms. Cortez injured a knee in the fields, her mother could not afford a doctor and took her to a sobadora. After $20 treatments of ointment and massage, the swelling subsided. ''It still hurts when it's cold,'' Ms. Cortez said. ''I just take Tylenol or Advil.'' 
 Even if farm workers in Mendota can afford the local clinic's sliding-scale fees, they often cannot afford to miss work while waiting up to six hours to be seen. Sarah B. Horton, a University of Montana anthropologist who is studying health care in the Central Valley, said the lack of access to conventional care reinforced a culture of self-medication. There is a preference for potent Mexican drugs, Ms. Horton said, delivered, if possible, by syringe. 
 Rosie Q. Valdovinos, 57, a lettuce picker, recently completed a self-prescribed regimen of three penicillin injections, given by a friend, to combat a cough.
 ''Penicillin or ampicillin will work on anything: a cough, a problem with your chest, or if you have an infection of your kidneys, even for a tooth,'' she said. ''There's no choice but to take them sometimes. To go to a doctor, you miss a day of work. You miss a day, and the next day you're gone.''
 Ms. Valdovinos, an American citizen who said she had immigrated when she was 3, is insured several months a year through the Dole Food Company, but still prefers the ease and economy of Mexican medical care. In the few weeks between the end of lettuce season and her policy's expiration, she hops a Greyhound to Mexico and stockpiles pharmaceuticals -- including Prozac, Valium and antibiotics -- for herself and others.
 ''You pay a doctor $30 for a prescription, and they'll give you the medicine,'' she said. ''I'll spend $500 down there, and that will take care of me for six months.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Holders Find It Hard To Walk Away From Their Homes

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
As American homeowners fall behind on their mortgages in growing numbers, bankers and policy makers worry that while many of these people cannot pay, some simply will not. 
 Millions of Americans are ''upside down'' on their mortgages -- they owe more on their homes than their homes are worth. So far, however, there is little evidence that people who have the means to pay are walking away from their homes as values sink.
 The blogosphere is full of tales of homeowners who supposedly are choosing to mail the house keys to their lenders rather than keep their depreciating homes. And yet ''jingle mail,'' the term for those tinkling packages of keys, appears to be far rarer than many seem to think. 
 Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored mortgage company, estimates that just 0.14 percent of the defaulted mortgages in its portfolio involved properties that were abandoned by borrowers. Fannie Mae, another mortgage company, puts the figure in the single digits. Both companies deal in relatively conservative loans, so the total rate may be somewhat higher. Industry officials say they have no way of knowing for sure. 
 Even so, the idea that some people are simply refusing to pay their mortgages has gripped the popular imagination. The notion picked up momentum in the last few weeks after ''Inside Edition,'' the celebrity-focused TV news program, reported that Jose Canseco, the former American League most valuable player who made millions during his baseball career, abandoned his $2.5 million mansion outside Los Angeles to move into a smaller property.
 ''You look at the Jose Canseco issue and say that it's a walkaway, but he is probably the only person on his block that did that,'' said Robert Padgett, director of loss mitigation for Freddie Mac. ''Those types of stories garner a lot of attention,'' he added, but they are ''isolated occurrences.''
 Many economists agree. The low numbers from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are consistent with past housing busts, like the ones that occurred in Texas in the 1980s and in the Northeast and California in the early 1990s. Homeowners typically do not walk away from homes they live in unless they are unable to pay the mortgage, usually because of job loss, a death in the family, divorce or a big jump in their monthly payments. Real estate speculators, of course, do abandon properties when prices fall.
 In fact, researchers say the rich are no more or less likely to walk away -- ''ruthlessly default'' is the economic term for it -- than those of more modest means. A person's credit history is usually a better indication of how he will behave than his income. How much money a person put down on the house when he bought it also makes a difference.
 Investors ''are going to default right away because they have negative equity,'' said Robert Van Order, an adjunct professor of finance at the University of Michigan. ''But that's different from people who moved into the house.'' 
 Owners who live in their homes do tend to default more when home prices fall. That is because being under water leaves borrowers fewer options if they run into financial trouble. When prices are rising, borrowers can usually sell their houses for more than they paid or refinance their mortgages.
 Most homeowners default when there is ''an intersection of two events: they don't have equity in their houses and they run into trouble,'' said Mr. Van Order, a former chief economist at Freddie Mac.
 An estimated 9 million American households, or 10.3 percent of all single-family homes, owe more than their home is worth, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. By comparison, 4.8 percent of home loans were in foreclosure or delinquent by 60 days or more at the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 For a variety of reasons, most homeowners find walking away difficult and expensive.
 A foreclosure can make it hard for borrowers to get other loans and sometimes even an apartment. Economists refer to these as ''transaction costs'' that offset the benefit borrowers might get from defaulting on an underwater home loan.
 Lenders can also pursue deficiency judgments against borrowers to recoup the difference between what is owed on the debt and what the property is sold for after foreclosure. Such claims are time-consuming and expensive to win, so most lenders do not pursue them. In the past, some lenders have sought judgments against a few borrowers to deter others from walking away, said Grant S. Nelson, an emeritus law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 In an attempt to reduce the incentive to default, Fannie Mae recently increased to five years, from four years, the time borrowers have to wait after a foreclosure to get another Fannie Mae loan. The company will make exceptions under extenuating circumstances. 
 The Bush administration has said that the only people who deserve housing relief are those who cannot pay, not those who will not pay. 
 ''Let me also emphasize that any homeowner who can afford his mortgage payment but chooses to walk away from an underwater property is simply a speculator,'' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in late March. ''Washington cannot create any new mortgage program to induce these speculators to continue to own these homes, unless someone else foots the bill.''
 Nonetheless, some real estate professionals, particularly those in markets where home prices are falling fast, say borrowers who can pay may be tempted to walk away. 
 Brett Barry, a real estate agent in the Phoenix area, said some of his clients owe $100,000 more than their houses are worth. Single-family home prices have fallen 24 percent from their peak in the summer of 2006 in the region, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index, and the decline shows no sign of abating.
 While some of Mr. Barry's clients are having a hard time making payments, others who can afford to keep paying are also thinking about leaving because they worry their homes will be under water for many years to come.
 ''These markets are driven by psychology,'' Mr. Barry said. ''If people see that the market will continue to decline and they are already in the hole by 50 to 100 grand'' they will leave.
 One of his clients, a woman named Vivian, recently mailed the keys to her second home to the bank and walked away.
 She and her husband bought the house outside Phoenix in 2004 in hopes of retiring there near one of their daughters. They put 20 percent down on the $240,000 house and at first made their payments without struggle.
 But her husband, who was the primary income earner in the family, died suddenly last year from a staph infection. Vivian said she could no longer afford to keep paying the mortgage on two homes, because her only source of income now was a monthly Social Security check.
 ''I can't sell it, I can't pay for it,'' said Vivian, 64, who spoke on the condition her surname not be used. 
 Though no two stories are exactly the same, such cases are not uncommon, housing specialists say. 
 The boom of recent years left many Americans financially vulnerable because they had borrowed too much against their homes, thinking prices would not go down. Others speculated by buying multiple homes. The housing and mortgage industries championed the notion that home prices had never declined nationally and that buying a home, even in a frenzied market, was always a good investment.
 Jon Madux, a founder of the site YouWalkAway.com, which helps borrowers leave their homes, said a majority of the site's clients default because of financial hardships. But in the Southwest and Florida, more of its customers are investors who bought multiple condos or houses and are now not able to find renters or sell for more than they owe.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association estimated that the owners of 18 percent of the homes in foreclosure as of September 2007 did not live in those properties. Many used riskier loans, which are defaulting faster than more conventional mortgages.
 Peter Chinloy, a real estate and finance professor at American University in Washington who has studied how borrowers behave when home prices fall, said policy makers should recognize that the problems are most severe in a few states in the Southwest, the Midwest and in Florida, and should aim relief in those places. It is also most severe for loans made between 2005 to 2007, when credit was at its easiest.
 ''One of the thing that has not gotten much attention,'' he said, ''is how localized the problem is.''

HEADLINE: Home-Grown, Everyday Sadism

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
If Ellen Page ever worried that her roles in ''Juno'' and ''Smart People'' would too securely set her image as a feisty know-it-all, she chose well to appear in ''An American Crime,'' a film that manages to wrench all the placid innocence from her bones. The movie, which appeared at the Sundance Film Festival last year and which makes its debut on Showtime on Saturday, calls for none of her verbal wood chopping. Indeed, it demands a listless opposite, turning Ms. Page's body into a cadaver long before her character becomes one, speaking to us softly, phlegmatically and from the grave. Ms. Page is all dreamy, spectral passivity; she mesmerizes. But so much is done to her that it is hard to know what she is actually doing. 
 Children are victimized so frequently on television these days -- the babies left in Dumpsters on ''Law & Order: SVU,'' the boys or girls raped or chained up on ''Medium'' -- that we may think we've become inured to depictions of such abuse. But ''An American Crime'' is such a shocking study of the will to defile, so forensic in its details, that it arrives as an act of vengeance against our habituation. 
 Based on the true story of Sylvia Likens, a teenage girl in Indianapolis in 1965 who found herself subjected to cruelties any adjectives applied here would only cheapen, the film almost begs us to look anywhere else. Her parents, carnival workers, leave her and her younger sister in the temporary care of a local laundress named Gertrude Baniszewski. Sylvia is burned, bruised, beaten and sodomized, the horrors magnified by the viral quality of her steward's sadism. Before long, it isn't merely Baniszewski drawing the blood, but her lot of vacant-looking children and a whole neighborhood of young novices bored into violence. 
 Tommy O'Haver, the film's director and co-writer, tips us to its agenda in the economy of his title. Sylvia had the misfortune to be born to parents who were comfortable leaving her with a stranger, but she also had the bad luck to grow up in a time and a place where ignorance was understood as its own brand of wisdom. The 1960s haven't yet sounded the nation's social alarm clock. Images of Vietnam flicker on television sets (Mr. O'Haver gives us President Johnson making a speech about General Westmoreland) but no one in an Indianapolis of church picnics and girl-group pop is paying heed. 
 Sylvia's community, we learn, did nothing to save her. An older neighbor of Baniszewski's, in cheap makeup that she seems to think will dignify her, had a faint hint of what was going on, but testifies at Baniszewski's murder trial that she simply couldn't judge a hard-working woman who seemed to be struggling. 
 Despite all the visual terror in ''An American Crime,'' the single most disturbing moment is aural: Sylvia explaining in post-mortem voice-over, quite matter-of-factly, that her parents kept working, leaving her younger sister behind again, after the trial, this time with a local district attorney.
 Mr. O'Haver understands the inexplicable nature of horrors like this one and he never panders to our reductive wish for clear answers. Gertrude Baniszewski, portrayed brilliantly by Catherine Keener, was clearly a woman who struggled: she had respiratory problems, multiple children with different men and virtually no money. But Mr. O'Haver doesn't redeem her with a more extensive biography, a litany of whatever deeper mistreatments she surely endured. 
 Ms. Keener takes on the role as if she were built on a skeleton of rusty needles. Looking at her, we know plenty. Baniszewski hates the purity of Sylvia, a quality she can neither reclaim for herself nor bequeath to her daughters, whose young lives already seem destined for similar miseries.
 ''An American Crime'' is the most brutal evocation of wrongdoing to appear in quite a while; it is hardly a pleasure to watch. But it is also one of the best television movies to appear in years.

HEADLINE: Big Drop in Imports Narrows Trade Gap

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Domestic demand for imports fell in March by the most since 2001, the latest indication that the economic slowdown has forced Americans to rein in their spending habits, the government reported Friday. 
 Americans shied away from buying imported automobiles, with sales down 9.3 percent in March, and oil, which dropped 8.9 percent. With oil prices rising, the March dip in oil imports was expected to be temporary. Declines were reported in a variety of other goods, ranging from clothing to toys and furniture.
 At the same time, exports decreased for the first time in 12 months, a troubling sign for American businesses struggling with a pullback among domestic consumers. Foreign purchases have helped prop up the American economy amid the current slowdown. 
 For the month, the Commerce Department reported, the trade deficit narrowed to $58.2 billion, from a downwardly revised $61.7 billion in February. The 5.7 percent decrease was more than economists had expected.
 Imports were down 2.9 percent in March, to $206.7 billion, from $212.8 billion in February, the sharpest decline since December 2001. Sales of foreign cars, telecommunications equipment and crude oil all fell, even as demand perked up for health care goods and clothing. 
 ''Consumers struggling with high inflation, negative wealth effects, falling home prices and increased job insecurity mean imports will fall back much further this year,'' Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank in London, wrote in a note to clients.
 Export sales dropped 1.7 percent, to $148.5 billion, from $151.1 billion in February, as demand eased for American-made automobiles, capital goods, and -- strikingly -- civilian aircraft, sales of which fell 31.9 percent. Purchases of American foods and beverages increased.
 The trade deficit with China narrowed to $16.1 billion, the lowest level in two years, and also narrowed with South America and France. Over all, the trade deficit with Europe widened slightly, to $7.1 billion, from $6.8 billion in February.
 The deficit with Canada rose slightly, up 0.4 percent, to $6.5 billion, while the deficit with Japan rose 8.9 percent, to $7.5 billion.

HEADLINE: If Your Appliances Are Avocado, They Probably Aren't Green

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I DON'T know about you, but I'm a little tired of the whole green thing. Not the idea that Americans need to sharply cut their energy use (the words carbon footprint will not pass my lips). And not the idea that there are some relatively painless actions we can all take that will help -- although I know real change will not be made without real sacrifice.
 But I am growing a little cynical about the consumption-oriented part of the movement, the urging to buy our way out of environmental problems. From organic jeans to compact fluorescent light bulbs, it is getting harder and harder to know what represents genuine progress and what is a marketing gimmick. 
 Take my refrigerator (please!). It is 10 years old and is a side-by-side, which wastes more energy than one with a freezer on the top or the bottom. It has a water and ice dispenser in the door, which is also a no-no for energy conservation. And it was made before 2001, when the most recent federal energy-efficiency standards for refrigerators went into effect. 
 It is the definition of an energy hog.
 After reading enough about how much this elderly refrigerator could be costing in emissions alone -- it might be pumping out a ton of carbon dioxide annually -- I began lobbying my husband for a new one.
 The only trouble is, ours works fine. And I priced a new energy-efficient Kenmore with a top freezer and no water and ice dispenser at $1,100 on sale.
 Besides the money, is this really a good idea environmentally, to get rid of an appliance that is operating just fine to buy another one, even if it does have better energy standards?
 ''It takes energy to make a product,'' said Noah Horowitz, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''You don't want to replace perfectly good products.''
 He gave me his rule of thumb for refrigerators. 
 ''If it's avocado or brown-colored, it's time to retire it,'' he said. Refrigerators from the 1970s, the last time I believe those particular appliance colors were in vogue, use three to four times the power of today's models. 
 A spokeswoman from the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees the Energy Star program along with the Department of Energy, told me that, generally, any appliance over 15 years old probably should be put out to pasture. The good news is that about 80 percent of a refrigerator or a clothes washer is recyclable. 
 Getting rid of an old appliance ''is not without some environmental impact, but because so much can be recycled and reused, if you have a guzzler, you're better off sending it to the landfill,'' said Jennifer Amann, a senior associate at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
 Try to find a place that will pick up your old refrigerator for recycling, either the company you are buying your new one from or see if your state or local government has a recycling program. 
 Even if they are brought to the landfill, Ms. Amann says, most of the appliances' parts are then recycled, because they take up too much space.
 What environmentalists do not want you to do is place the old one in the garage to hold two six-packs of beer. If you really need it, Mr. Horowitz suggested, leave it unplugged until, say, holiday time when you need the extra space for those pumpkin pies.
 And do not resell it. Retiring the energy-inefficient model is the best thing to do.
 When we do buy a new one, we will look for top or bottom freezer models and make sure it has an Energy Star. As I learned, the Energy Star is a program that allows companies to promote energy-efficient products voluntarily. To rate an Energy Star label, the appliances -- as well as computers, lighting and about 50 other products -- generally use 20 to 30 percent less energy than required by federal standards.
 There is a cool site, www.energystar.gov, that shows how much you could save by buying an Energy Star appliance. Put in the age, size and model of your refrigerator and the cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity in your state (the site offers a national average if you do not know) and it spits out how much you could save replacing it with an Energy Star product. My refrigerator, the site told me, costs $113 a year to run, versus $55 for an Energy Star model.
 Once I started looking into this, I began wondering about our other appliances. After checking with the previous owners of our house, it turns out that our clothes washer is just about 15 years old, while our dishwasher, given to us by a friend who was remodeling, is about eight years old. They may not be as pretty as new ones, but they work. Still, are they costing us a lot, both in money and environmental cred?
 It turns out that clothes washers and dishwashers have pretty much the same criteria as refrigerators -- they have become much more energy-efficient. So if yours is inching toward 15 years, consider replacing it.
 For clothes washers, the new front-loader models use much less water and spin clothes dry much more thoroughly, so you are spending less time -- and power -- drying. 
 I also learned something interesting about washing dishes. Unless you are an extremely frugal hand dishwasher, you are certainly using more water hand-washing dishes than a dishwasher does, Ms. Amann said. And with a newer model, do not even pre-rinse by hand.
 ''A good dishwasher can use just four to seven gallons of water to wash a full load of dishes,'' she said. If you do not have a full load, but are afraid the food will get stuck on, a good feature is rinse and hold, which uses less than a gallon of water.
 Wow. Easier and ecologically good. A win-win. 
 New federal standards for washing machines will go into effect in 2011; for dishwashers, in 2010. If you are interested to see if your appliance predates a federal standard, or if you want to wait to buy one until the new standard goes into effect, check out www.standardsasap.org/federal.htm.
 Although clothes dryers are big energy suckers, there is not much that can be done to make them less wasteful. So just hang onto yours until it gives up the ghost. One good feature of newer models is a moisture sensor, so the dryer stops when clothes are dry.
 The federal government does not issue Energy Stars for dryers, because there is not much difference in energy use among the models.
 The greenest dryer, is, of course, the clothesline.
 As we move toward summer, it is a good time to replace an ailing central air-conditioner. New federal standards just started two years ago. But if you are keeping your old one, check to see if the ducts are leaking. You can waste about 30 percent of energy through leaking ducts, Mr. Horowitz said. 
 For those of us, especially in New York, who use window-box air-conditioners, they are inexpensive enough that it is worth swapping an old one for an Energy Star model. The more recent ones also have a thermostat that will shut off the air-conditioner when the room gets cool enough. Sometimes the local utility company will pick up old boxes through an ''early retirement program.'' 
 As weary as I am of hearing about how I can ''go green,'' I have to admit that it is interesting to learn some really painless ways to cut down on energy use, like eliminating the screen saver on your computer. ''You can save $50 to $100 a year just by turning off the screen saver,'' Mr. Horowitz said, and letting the computer go to sleep. 
 So I think we will look for a new window-box air-conditioner to replace the one in my son's room that may date to the Carter administration, the last time we were all so focused on this issue. But we will hang onto our old refrigerator for a little longer now. Maybe I should start worrying about the food inside. Are those carrots organic?

HEADLINE: A.I.G.'s Quarterly Loss Depresses Dow

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended the week with a big decline as investors grappled with two of the biggest threats to the economy: fallout from turmoil in the credit market and surging energy prices. All three major indexes showed losses for the week.
 The insurer American International Group helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down about 120 points after posting a $7.8 billion first-quarter loss that rekindled anxiety about the strained state of the global financial system. 
 Rising crude oil prices remained a source of worry for investors, as they had for much of the week and in recent months. Oil futures rose above $126 a barrel for the first time, further stoking Wall Street's concerns that inflation could curtail consumer spending. 
 Light crude oil rose as high as $126.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before settling at a record $125.96. For the week, oil jumped nearly $10.
 Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said investors retreated primarily because of the A.I.G. news.
 ''That news came as something of a surprise to some and a wake-up call to most that the financial service companies are not yet out of the woods,'' he said.
 The Dow fell 120.90 points, or 0.94 percent, to 12,745.88.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.40 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,388.28, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.72 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,445.52.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.50 point, or 0.07 percent, to 720.05, but finished the week down 5.69 points, or 0.78 percent, at 720.05.
 For the week, the Dow fell 2.39 percent, the S.& P. 500 declined 1.81 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.27 percent.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to 100 29/32. Its yield was unchanged at 3.77 percent.
 The Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit narrowed in March as demand for imports registered the biggest decline since the last recession was ending. The deficit stood at $58.2 billion, a decrease of 5.7 percent from February. The 2.9 percent drop in demand for imports was the steepest monthly decline since December 2001 -- a month after the last recession ended.
 Noman Ali, portfolio manager of United States equities for MFC Global Investment Management in Toronto, does not expect the market to test its March lows and said some of Wall Street's angst over rising oil prices was overdone.
 ''Our view is still positive on the market. Obviously oil is hurting, but I think the consumer fiscal stimulus package is going to help,'' he said, referring to rebates the federal government is now distributing.
 He contends that the wealthier Americans who account for an outsize percentage of American consumer spending will not stop reaching into their wallets because of higher oil prices and that overall spending will hold up better than some on Wall Street are predicting.
 A.I.G. fell $3.87, or 8.8 percent, to $40.28, after reporting its loss. The stock was by far the steepest decliner among the 30 that compose the Dow industrials.
 Citigroup said it hoped to sell $400 billion to $500 billion in assets and increase revenue by 9 percent over the next few years as it tries to recover from big losses tied to deterioration in the mortgage and credit markets.
 Citi, one of the Dow 30 stocks, fell 67 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $23.63.
 General Motors, also a Dow component, fell 86 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $20.29 after reporting in a regulatory filing that it would provide financial support to help settle the 10-week strike at an auto parts supplier, American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings.
 The consumer electronics chain Circuit City Stores said it received a letter from Blockbuster that the company's largest shareholder, the financier Carl C. Icahn, was prepared to buy Circuit City even if the video rental chain could not win the necessary financing or shareholder approval.
 Circuit City jumped 28 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $5.07, while Blockbuster slipped 2 cents, to $2.66.
 Investors' caution Friday precedes what will most likely be a busy week of economic news now that the flow of quarterly earnings reports is beginning to ebb.

HEADLINE: GAS PRICES SEND SURGE OF RIDERS TO MASS TRANSIT

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
With the price of gas approaching $4 a gallon, more commuters are abandoning their cars and taking the train or bus instead.
 Mass transit systems around the country are seeing standing-room-only crowds on bus lines where seats were once easy to come by. Parking lots at many bus and light rail stations are suddenly overflowing, with commuters in some towns risking a ticket or tow by parking on nearby grassy areas and in vacant lots.
 ''In almost every transit system I talk to, we're seeing very high rates of growth the last few months,'' said William W. Millar, president of the American Public Transportation Association. 
 ''It's very clear that a significant portion of the increase in transit use is directly caused by people who are looking for alternatives to paying $3.50 a gallon for gas.'' 
 Some cities with long-established public transit systems, like New York and Boston, have seen increases in ridership of 5 percent or more so far this year. But the biggest surges -- of 10 to 15 percent or more over last year -- are occurring in many metropolitan areas in the South and West where the driving culture is strongest and bus and rail lines are more limited.
 Here in Denver, for example, ridership was up 8 percent in the first three months of the year compared with last year, despite a fare increase in January and a slowing economy, which usually means fewer commuters. Several routes on the system have reached capacity, particularly at rush hour, for the first time.
 ''We are at a tipping point,'' said Clarence W. Marsella, chief executive of the Denver Regional Transportation District, referring to gasoline prices. 
 Transit systems in metropolitan areas like Minneapolis, Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth and San Francisco reported similar jumps. In cities like Houston, Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Charlotte, N.C., commuters in growing numbers are taking advantage of new bus and train lines built or expanded in the last few years. The American Public Transportation Association reports that localities with fewer than 100,000 people have also experienced large increases in bus ridership.
 In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reports that ridership was up the first three months of the year by more than 5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, while M.T.A. bus ridership was up 10.9 percent. New York City subway use was up 6.8 percent for January and February. Ridership on New Jersey Transit trains was up more than 5 percent for the first three months of the year.
 The increase in transit use coincides with other signs that American motorists are beginning to change their driving habits, including buying smaller vehicles. The Energy Department recently predicted that Americans would consume slightly less gasoline this year than last -- for the first yearly decline since 1991.
 Oil prices broke yet another record on Friday, climbing $2.27, to $125.96 a barrel. The national average for regular unleaded gasoline reached $3.67 a gallon, up from $3.04 a year ago, according to AAA. 
 But meeting the greater demand for mass transit is proving difficult. The cost of fuel and power for public transportation is about three times that of four years ago, and the slowing economy means local sales tax receipts are down, so there is less money available for transit services. Higher steel prices are making planned expansions more expensive.
 Typically, mass transit systems rely on fares to cover about a third of their costs, so they depend on sales taxes and other government funding. Few states use gas tax revenue for mass transit.
 In Denver, transportation officials expected to pay $2.62 a gallon for diesel this year, but they are now paying $3.20. Every penny increase costs the Denver Regional Transportation District an extra $100,000 a year. And it is bracing for a $19 million shortfall in sales taxes this year from original projections. 
 ''I'd like to put more buses on the street,'' Mr. Marsella said. ''I can't expand service as much as I'd like to.'' 
 Average annual growth from sales tax revenue for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a rail service that connects San Francisco with Oakland, has been 4.5 percent over the last 15 years. It expects that to fall to 2 percent this year, and electricity costs are rising.
 ''This is a year of abundant caution and concern,'' said Dorothy W. Dugger, BART's general manager, even though ridership on the line was up nearly 5 percent in the first quarter of the year.
 Nevertheless, Ms. Dugger is happy that mass transit is winning over converts. ''The future of mass transit in this country has never been brighter,'' she said. 
 Other factors may be driving people to mass transit, too. Wireless computers turn travel time into productive work time, and more companies are offering workers subsidies to take buses or trains. Traffic congestion is getting worse in many cities, and parking more expensive.
 Michael Brewer, an accountant who had always driven the 36-mile trip to downtown Houston from the suburb of West Belford, said he had been thinking about switching to the bus for the last two years. The final straw came when he put $100 of gas into his Pontiac over four days a couple of weeks ago.
 ''Finally I was ready to trade my independence for the savings,'' he said while waiting for a bus.
 Brayden Portillo, a freshman at the University of Colorado Denver, drove from his home in the northern suburbs to the downtown campus in his Jeep Cherokee the entire first semester of the school year, enjoying the rap and disco music blasting from his CD player.
 He switched to the bus this semester because he was spending $40 a week on gas -- half his salary as a part-time store clerk. ''Finally, I thought this is stupid,'' he said, and he is using the savings to pay down a credit card debt.
 The sudden jump in ridership comes after several years of steady, gradual growth. Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation last year, up 2.1 percent from 2006. Transit managers are predicting growth of 5 percent or more this year, the largest increase in at least a decade.
 ''If we are in a recession or economic downturn, we should be seeing a stagnation or decrease in ridership, but we are not,'' said Daniel Grabauskas, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which serves the Boston area. ''Fuel prices are without question the single most important factor that is driving people to public transportation.''
 Some cities are seeing spectacular gains. The Charlotte Area Transit System, which has a new light rail line, reported that it logged more than two million trips in February, up more than 34 percent from February 2007.
 Caltrain, the commuter rail line that serves the San Francisco Peninsula and the Santa Clara Valley, set a record for average weekday ridership in February of 36,993, a 9.3 increase from 2007, according to its most recent public calculation. 
 The South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which operates a commuter rail system from Miami to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, posted a rise of more than 20 percent in rider numbers this March and April as monthly ridership climbed to 350,000.
 ''Nobody believed that people would actually give up their cars to ride public transportation,'' said Joseph J. Giulietti, executive director of the authority. ''But in the last year, and last several months in particular, we have seen exactly that.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the increase in commuters who are turning to mass transit because of high gasoline prices misstated the increase in ridership on Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses in the first three months of the year. Ridership on the M.T.A.'s three bus agencies was up about 2.3 percent, not 10.9 percent. (The 10.9 percent increase in bus ridership referred solely to the M.T.A. Bus Company, which operates local and express bus routes around New York City.)

HEADLINE: Con Ed Seeks Another Rate Increase and Draws Fire

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Just a few weeks after sending out bills that reflected a $425 million rise in electricity rates, Con Edison is asking for an even bigger increase next year. 
 Con Ed, which provides power to New York City and Westchester County, said on Friday that it would ask state regulators for at least $557 million more in annual revenue from its customers. The company is filing two requests, one for a three-year schedule of increases and, as an alternative, a plan that would lock in an increase for just the year that starts on April 1, 2009.
 Its preferred three-year plan, if approved as submitted, would raise rates by 4.9 percent a year through March 2012, or a total of $1.67 billion over the three years, Con Ed said. For the typical residential customer, that would amount to a monthly bill that grows by more than $5 each year. 
 The request drew immediate fire from Michael N. Gianaris, a Democratic state assemblyman whose district in Queens suffered through a nine-day blackout in July 2006.
 ''These rate hikes are substantial and shocking,'' Mr. Gianaris said. ''At a time of economic hardship, they will have a real impact on people's wallets and people's budgets. What I don't understand is, why should there be an assumption that rates should go up every year?''
 The proposed overall increase of 4.9 percent would comprise a 6.8 percent increase for residential customers and a 4.3 percent increase for businesses.
 Con Ed said its typical residential customer now pays $78.90 a month, up from about $70 before the last increase kicked in a month ago. Under the three-year plan, that bill would rise to $84.27 a month in 2009, then to about $90 in 2010 and $96 in 2011, a Con Ed spokesman said.
 If regulators at the Public Service Commission decide to grant just a one-year increase, Con Ed is asking for a larger annual increase, $654 million, or 5.8 percent. That amount would translate to a monthly bill of $85.08 next year for the typical residential customer, Con Ed said.
 The company notified regulators that it would then seek increases of 4.2 percent in 2010 and 3.7 percent in 2011. It said one reason it needed to raise rates again was that property taxes assessed on its facilities were rising. Another is the escalating cost of materials used to upgrade and expand its network, it said. 
 Big increases in the prices of copper and steel, for example, have driven up the cost of installing a small underground network transformer to $34,200 from $26,600 in 18 months, the company said in a statement.
 The New York State Consumer Protection Board, which represents consumers before the Public Service Commission, said in a statement that it was ''concerned'' about the rate request. It said it would conduct a detailed analysis to ensure that the request ''does not include an excessive profit rate for the company and other elements that are not in the best interest of ratepayers.''
 Con Ed's chairman and chief executive, Kevin Burke, said in the company's statement, ''Our rate application reflects our commitment to continue to invest in the long-term future of New York and to maintain a reliable delivery infrastructure.'' Mr. Burke received $5.52 million in compensation last year, up almost $800,000 from his pay in 2006.
 It takes state regulators as long as 11 months to decide how large a rate increase to grant. They usually grant smaller increases than Con Ed requests. The $425 million one-year increase granted this year began as a request for $1.2 billion a year ago.

HEADLINE: Hints of a Shift at OPEC About a Rise in Oil Output

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As prices jumped to another record, a member of OPEC signaled on Friday for the first time in months that the oil cartel might increase its output to prick the price bubble. 
 The comments, from Libya's senior oil official, Shokri Ghanem, suggested a possible shift in OPEC's position. Since the cartel's last meeting in March, OPEC has argued that the market was not lacking in oil supplies and blamed speculators for driving up prices. 
 But in recent weeks, prices have come under renewed pressure because of a string of export disruptions from Nigeria. Prices have been above $100 since early February. Crude oil for June delivery closed up $2.27, at $125.96 a barrel in New York on Friday, after rising as high as $126.25 during the day. 
 Since OPEC last increased oil supplies in September, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have argued that the higher prices had more to do with investment flows than with supply and demand. 
 The problem for OPEC is that prices have, at times, run counter to real market factors, analyst said. As the dollar continues to decline and the United States economy slows, investment funds have moved into commodities like oil or gold, which they consider safer and more profitable than stocks.
 But the political cost of rising energy prices, especially in the United States, which is in the midst of a presidential election, is making OPEC's position increasingly delicate. Economic growth in the United States has slowed and gasoline demand is set to fall this year for the first time since 1991. 
 The record high oil prices have pushed gasoline prices higher. Retail gasoline rose to a record of $3.67 on Friday, according to AAA, the automobile club.
 The pressure is also rising in Washington to blame OPEC for the high prices. Last week, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, introduced legislation that would compel the government to act against OPEC's ''anticompetitive practices and illegal export quotas on oil.'' While the bill has little chance of passing, it highlights Washington's growing exasperation with OPEC's conduct. President Bush is scheduled to tour the Middle East next week, and the question is bound to come up during his stop in Saudi Arabia. 
 So far, producers have been pretty inflexible. OPEC, which accounts for 40 percent of the world's oil exports, is not scheduled to meet until September. At its last gathering in March, OPEC leaders ignored calls from President Bush and other industrialized leaders to bolster production, opting to keep their output steady. 
 At a meeting of oil producers and suppliers in Rome last month, many OPEC delegates, including Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said there were not enough buyers to justify an increase in production. But analysts say some producers are becoming increasingly uneasy with the runaway prices. 
 ''We would consider among other options the possibility of increasing output as a way to ensure market stability,'' Mr. Ghanem, the Libyan official, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying Friday. ''I expect a meeting before September. I am not calling for one, but I would support one.''
 Another OPEC delegate, quoted by Reuters, also raised the prospect of an early OPEC consultation to increase production before the next meeting. The delegate, who was not identified, said OPEC would have to increase its production level by more than 500,000 barrels a day to have a meaningful impact on prices.
 ''They are playing with fire,'' an analyst at Lehman Brothers, Adam J. Robinson, said. ''Every time the price goes up, and we break a new psychological mark, they risk killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Their biggest fear is triggering something they can't control.''
 There is no suggestion at this point that the cartel will be meeting soon. On Thursday, the organization's secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, issued a statement from the group's headquarters in Vienna, saying there was ''clearly no shortage'' of oil in the market.
 ''In recent month, oil prices have become increasingly volatile, mainly driven by financial market developments and the increased flow of speculative funds into oil futures,'' the statement said. 
 But he left the door open for OPEC to step in. ''The organization stands ready to act if the market shows a need for any further measures,'' he said.
 Separately, Brazil repeated its intention to one day join the oil cartel. In an interview with a German weekly, Der Spiegel, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that his country was gearing up to be a major oil exporter after discovering huge offshore oil fields. 
 ''We want to join OPEC,'' Mr. da Silva said, ''and try to make oil cheaper.''
 Last year, OPEC's membership rose to 13 as Angola and Ecuador joined the group. Indonesia, which joined in 1962, two years after the group was founded in Baghdad, signaled it might leave the cartel after becoming a net oil importer.

HEADLINE: Bush and House G.O.P. Team Up to Present Show of Strength

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was just like the old days. President Bush and House Republican leaders strode purposefully out of the White House to the waiting microphones, where the president celebrated their mutual views on housing, energy, war spending and terrorist surveillance bills taking shape in Congress.
 ''These are dear friends of mine who are committed to doing what's right for the country,'' Mr. Bush said last Wednesday as House leaders looked on, sharing the presidential limelight. 
 But it is not 2002 or even 2006, when Mr. Bush and his Republican allies could impose their will on Capitol Hill. Instead, what Mr. Bush was talking about was his determination to veto a string of emerging Democratic bills, encouraging House Republicans to stand by him in the effort even though they have to face the voters in November, when he is packing for Crawford.
 The adjustment by the president and House Republicans to the new Democratic majority in Congress has been rocky. But the final months of the relationship are threatening to produce a train wreck, given the president's veto posture against top Democratic initiatives, the backing he still commands from Congressional Republicans and the increasing willingness of Democrats to confront him.
 Mr. Bush at the moment has veto threats looming over the housing foreclosure bill the House approved on Thursday, the emergency war spending bill set for a House vote next week and a new farm bill produced in bipartisan negotiations.
 If the Democrats move ahead with a terror surveillance bill that does not grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies, he will most likely veto it, as well.
 And he has no patience for any energy plan that would impose new taxes on oil companies or eliminate tax breaks that the companies now enjoy, a position that led Speaker Nancy Pelosi to describe Mr. Bush's energy policy in these colorful terms: ''Veto and drill, veto and drill, veto and drill.'' 
 Some Democrats are not all that unhappy with the coming clashes, sensing an advantage that could play well for them in the November elections. They say the president's refusal to give ground on issues like added unemployment benefits and foreclosure relief, a plan supported this week by 36 House Republicans, reinforces the Democrats' message that Republicans are unsympathetic to the economic struggles of many Americans.
 Yet top House Republicans say they are willing to stand against Democratic initiatives they see as flawed, even though they might have some natural election-year appeal.
 ''There really are things we disagree with, and we are going to work to stop,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, who makes no apologies for joining with Mr. Bush. ''We have worked very closely together -- the White House, House Republicans, Senate Republicans -- to stop bad things from happening and trying to move our own agenda. We have had a very close partnership.''
 Democrats have learned a few things over the past 16 months after coming out on the losing end of veto fights over Iraq war money and children's health insurance, to name two. The House Democratic leadership set out to construct its version of the war bill to give it some chance of success and to make sure Republicans paid for any opposition or failure to override a veto.
 Under the House bill that could be up for a vote in the next week, Democrats tried to stay in the ballpark of Mr. Bush's $178 billion request for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and international food aid, with their alternative coming closer to $195 billion. 
 The Democrats' extras include an expansive college benefit for veterans, a provision they view as almost untouchable, as well as extra unemployment pay that they say the sour economy justifies. 
 And requirements for a troop withdrawal needed to push the bill through the House are expected to disappear in the Senate. The thinking was that Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans would have a tough time explaining a rejection of the measure over unemployment assistance and help for veterans. 
 But that thinking was apparently wrong, as Mr. Bush's budget director told The Associated Press that the president considered such packaging a cynical move and that he would veto such a bill. Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking on Friday on a conservative radio station in Mississippi, also disparaged the Democratic plan.
 The farm bill has its own veto issues. Though the measure has come under fire as being too generous at a time when farm income is improving, all senators and most House members represent farmers or agriculture interests and provoke them at their peril. 
 On top of that, farmers are a crucial Republican constituency in many parts of the country, a constituency that might not be happy with a veto in a year when Republicans need all the votes they can get. Mr. Bush's refusal to back drought relief in 2002 was seen as contributing to a narrow Republican Senate loss in South Dakota.
 Senator Ken Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, set the tone on Friday when he called the veto threat hanging over the farm bill ''a slap in the face'' to farmers and ranchers.
 Mr. Bush, who vetoed just one bill, a stem cell measure, when the Republicans ran Congress, appears dug in. He seems willing, in the words of Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, to ''go out in a blaze of vetoes.'' 
 The question is whether Republicans can use those veto threats as muscle to win some victories of their own or end up joining Mr. Bush in retirement.

HEADLINE: At Daimler, Sales Follow the World's Oil Riches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
An extended version of this interview is online at nytimes.com/business.

 BODY:
DAIMLER A.G., the maker of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, will deal with slowing auto sales in the United States in part by shifting sales to Russia, China and the Middle East, says Dieter Zetsche, Daimler's chief executive. And the company, based in Stuttgart, Germany, expects to be the first to introduce a car with a lithium- ion battery, the technology that is seen as critical to creating all-electric vehicles, he says. 
 Mr. Zetsche was previously based in Detroit as head of Chrysler, then owned by Daimler, before the Germans decided to sell majority control to private equity investors. Most recently, Daimler reported a 32 percent decline in earnings in the first quarter of this year largely because the value of its remaining 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler fell. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation conducted by telephone from Stuttgart: 
 Q.How is Daimler doing post-Chrysler?
 A. We are on a good path in all our businesses. The Mercedes division is beating historical records for profitability and it's doing very well in comparison with its peers. Daimler Trucks, despite a sluggish North American truck market, is having a strong performance. And Daimler Financial Services is not suffering any significant impact from the financial crisis. We have about 12 billion euros ($19 billion) in net liquidity, I think the company is very strong operationally and financially.
 Q.How is slow growth in the American market going to affect your sales?
 A. Year to date, we have shown growth with the Mercedes brand in the United States. We've also had sales of the Smart car, which we didn't have in the prior year. Altogether, year to date, we have shown an increase of 6 percent. We were the fastest-growing premium brand in the United States in the first quarter.
 Q.Do you expect further consolidation among major automakers, or have chief executives reached the conclusion that the cultural difficulties are just so great that mergers don't make sense?
 A. I would tend to the latter point of view, which does not exclude one or two moves. But I don't see a major push for more consolidation. 
 An important trend is that we will see new global players coming from China and India, adding to the existing number of global players. So even if one or two companies would combine and merge, the overall number of manufacturers will stay flat or perhaps even increase.
 Q.With the United States market in decline, where will you at Mercedes find new growth?
 A. The markets of North America, Europe and Japan are slow, flat or declining. Within those markets, Mercedes is gaining market share. But the main growth comes from emerging markets, in particular from Russia, the Middle East and China.
 Q.So the oil wealth that's going into the hands of Russia and the Middle East is buying lots of expensive Mercedes vehicles?
 A. That is very correct. They're buying lots of Mercedes and, in particular, lots of S-Classes, Maybachs and high-range upper-end Mercedes. We are the brand selling the most vehicles above the $40,000 price point. More than 25 percent of the vehicles being sold above $100,000 are Mercedes-Benz cars. That is our footprint around the globe. After the United States, China is the strongest S Class market in the world.
 Q.How big is the market in the United States for your Smart car, which is just eight feet long and gets more than 40 miles per gallon?
 A. It's very promising. In only the third month after introduction, the United States market has become the third-largest market for Smart in the world. We sold 3,500 units in the first three months, starting toward the end of January. The only limiting factor is the supply.
 Q.Which is your favorite Mercedes vehicle to drive?
 A. I appreciate that you assume it's a Mercedes. I like the new SL, with a very fresh new face and cutting-edge technology. It's a lot of fun to drive.

HEADLINE: West Side Railyards Project Gets New Push From Mayor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and MICHAEL BARBARO; William Neuman reported from New York and Michael Barbaro from London.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Friday that he would push to revive a $1 billion deal to develop the railyards on the Far West Side of Manhattan as he met with the developer whose negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had collapsed. 
 ''The plan isn't dead by any means,'' the mayor said in London, where he was also meeting with local officials. ''Hudson Yards is the most exciting opportunity New York has.'' 
 The mayor has made development of the Far West Side, including the railyards owned by the transportation authority, a priority since taking office in 2002, but his plans have been repeatedly frustrated. The breakdown of talks on Thursday between the developer, Tishman Speyer, and the authority loomed as an especially bitter setback, since just days earlier officials had said the deal was almost ready to be signed. 
 Officials of the authority agreed to meet again with the developer on Monday, but they made it clear that Tishman Speyer would have to alter what they described as an 11th-hour demand that would have changed the basic economics of the deal. 
 ''I'm not going in with an expectation,'' said Gary Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, when asked about Monday's meeting. ''They've taken a position which I've articulated to them was quite clearly unacceptable. They've asked to meet, therefore I'm meeting with them.''
 Negotiations on the deal had been dragging on for weeks longer than anticipated after Tishman Speyer was chosen in March from among several bidders vying for the right to build a complex of office towers and apartment buildings on concrete platforms over the railyard. Then last week, officials reported progress and set a deadline of 5 p.m. Wednesday to complete the agreement. 
 But on Tuesday, according to Mr. Dellaverson, the developer began to raise issues with a key part of the agreement. It was not until Wednesday, however, in a series of phone calls with Rob Speyer, the developer's lead negotiator, who was traveling in Europe, that Mr. Dellaverson said he came to understand that Tishman Speyer was trying to change the basic terms of the deal. 
 ''It came out of the blue,'' Mr. Dellaverson said. ''I did not expect it and I conveyed to the proposer that I felt as though they had wasted an awful lot of the M.T.A.'s time.''
 Officials at the authority said the developer wanted to put off closing the deal until the city had finished rezoning the western portion of the railyards. The rezoning process was expected to take at least 18 months and a delay would have meant the authority had to wait longer before beginning to receive payments. 
 But it also meant that if the rezoning failed to match the developer's plans, Tishman Speyer could have walked away from the entire deal, leaving the authority to begin the process all over again. 
 ''It involved a free warehousing of the deal for 18 months,'' said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the authority's chairman. He said that changing the deal in such a fundamental way took it beyond the basic terms that the authority's board had authorized and would have been unfair to other bidders, which had been told that such an arrangement was not allowed.
 ''They went outside the bounds that were set up that we could live within,'' Mr. Hemmerdinger said. The authority gave the developer a day to reconsider and then on Thursday afternoon informed it that the deal was off.
 Robert Lawson, a spokesman for Tishman Speyer, said he was not able to provide details of the talks with the authority.
 Meanwhile, Mayor Bloomberg insisted on Friday that there was still room to negotiate.
 ''My hope is that the state government, really the M.T.A. in this case, can get together and solve the problems they have and that Tishman Speyer has, so that they can come together,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in London. 
 He said that he would ''see if the city can do anything it can to get that project back on track'' and reaffirmed the city's commitment to developing the area, which includes providing about $2 billion in financing for the transportation authority to build a westward extension of the No. 7 subway line.
 ''It's going to get done,'' he said. ''And the No. 7 line is going to get done. And it will be so far along before I leave office that nobody is going to be able to stop it.'' 
 After making his comments, Mr. Bloomberg met with Mr. Speyer and his father, Jerry I. Speyer, Tishman Speyer's chief executive, who flew in from Italy. Representatives for the mayor and the developer refused to provide details of the meeting, which took place at the mayor's apartment in London.
 ''We still hope to be able to complete this deal and reach an agreement that satisfies the needs of everyone,'' the Speyers said in a written statement. 
 If a deal cannot be worked out with Tishman Speyer, the authority could seek to reopen negotiations with other developers who had bid on the project. 
 In a related development, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky proposed that a new state authority be created to buy the railyards from the transportation authority for $1 billion and take charge of development in the area. It would come up with a master plan and find builders for individual parcels over time.

HEADLINE: The Leader of the Country Is the Father of the Bride

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
Yes, the economy is in the dumps. Yes, the war in Iraq drags on. But it's hard to imagine even his harshest critics begrudging President Bush the father-of-the-bride grin he has worn around the country lately.
 In March, Mr. Bush warmed up the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce by joking about the ''difficult spending decisions'' and ''sensitive diplomacy'' that are a part of wedding planning. In a commencement speech last weekend at a Kansas high school that had been ripped apart by a tornado a year earlier, he thanked 18 seniors for rescheduling their graduation ceremony so it would not conflict with his daughter's big day. 
 This week, after taking questions about soaring prices of gasoline and food, he told viewers of a morning network news program that he had erected a giant limestone cross on his ranch here as the site of a wedding altar. And on Thursday, as he boarded Air Force One to travel here from Washington, he beamed at reporters and stuck out his arm as if rehearsing for the walk with his daughter down the aisle.
 ''Neither one of us are nervous,'' Laura Bush told reporters at a White House briefing that had been called to criticize the Myanmar government's response to a cyclone that left tens of thousands dead. ''It's a very interesting passage of life when you get to that time in your life when your child is getting married.''
 A child's wedding marks a turning point for any parent, but the marriage here on Saturday of Mr. Bush's daughter Jenna to Henry Hager, scion of a Virginia Republican family, also happens to coincide with the beginning of Mr. Bush's transition from president to private citizen. 
 Rather than staging a lavish wedding to be seen around the world, or choosing an elopement at some secret location, the Bush family has managed to have it both ways. The president has repeatedly used his daughter's nuptials as an applause line in appearances before a country that increasingly feels he has put it on the wrong path. And Jenna Bush and the first lady have capitalized on public interest in the wedding to promote a new children's book.
 Still, no members of the news media will be allowed into the ceremony to capture the exchange of vows or Mr. Bush dancing with the bride. Robert Draper, author of a biography about the president, said the press blackout was consistent with an approach, followed by Mr. Bush since he first got into politics, intended to keep the harsh light of public life off Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara. (No, it has not always worked. Two words: under-age drinking.)
 In any event, if the president's role as father of the bride this weekend strikes some as a preview of a private life back here in Texas, it is unlikely that he will much regret it.
 ''For previous presidents, leaving the White House felt like a terrible loss,'' said the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Of Mr. Bush, she added, ''This wedding reinforces the feeling that going to Texas will be a welcome relief to him.''
 Theodore Roosevelt so worried that the end of his presidency would come as a ''dull thud'' to him, Ms. Goodwin said, that he embarked afterward on a yearlong hunting expedition across Africa.
 As an aide to, and later confidante of, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ms. Goodwin was privy to his bouts of cold feet as the end of his presidency neared. She said politics had been the center of Johnson's life for so long that he could not bear the idea of being a lame duck, and once told her that leaving the White House felt like ''stepping off a cliff.''
 Ms. Goodwin said Jimmy Carter had told her that his first months out of the White House were unbearably boring until he came up with the idea for the Carter Center. 
 Richard M. Nixon, she said, played a lot of golf and began work on a series of books to keep himself occupied.
 And Gerald R. Ford told her that he missed being at the center of some of the world's biggest decisions.
 ''My sense,'' Ms. Goodwin said, ''is that the transition will be much less difficult for President Bush. Everything about him seems rooted in going back home. To me, that's the reason they chose to have the wedding in Crawford rather than the White House. Symbolically, it marks the beginning of the countdown until they are able to move there for good.''
 In his seven years in office, Mr. Bush has demonstrated a noticeable disdain for White House pomp and circumstance. He has hosted only five state dinners, and Mark Knoller, a CBS News correspondent who keeps a meticulous log of the president's schedule, said Mr. Bush had spent some 437 days at Camp David and 406 others here at Crawford.
 Mr. Bush's plans after leaving office are almost as hard to glean as details about his daughter's wedding. Mr. Draper said the president had told him that he planned to buy a place in Dallas, which will be the home of his presidential library, and to spend his time shuttling between there and the ranch.
 Beyond that, Mr. Draper said, ''I'm not sure President Bush has thought much about what life is going to be like for him.''
 ''He's self-aware enough to know there's going to be a postpartum jolt,'' Mr. Draper said. ''But he hasn't figured out how he's going to deal with it day to day.''

HEADLINE: Housing Bailout Bill Seems on Shaky Ground

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even as the housing foreclosure crisis deepens, legislation to rescue homeowners and their lenders appears to be in significant political jeopardy.
 The bill, which passed the House on Thursday, is quickly becoming a casualty in a battle between the Bush administration, which says it opposes any taxpayer bailout that would only further encourage risky lending practices, and Democrats who say that homeowner assistance is the only way to contain the damage to the broader economy.
 Despite pledges by the White House and Democrats to work together, the bill produced partisan recriminations the day after it passed the House. Democrats are charging that the administration has sent mixed signals on whether it even wants a bill. In a twist, Democrats sought to claim the support of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who this week called on Congress to help mortgage holders. That claim prompted a spokeswoman for Mr. Bernanke to deny that he was favoring any piece of legislation over another. 
 The Democrats also said that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. appeared at first to encourage their bill, or at least not stand in its way. But Mr. Paulson's spokeswoman vehemently denied that.
 The Bush administration on Friday said it would only support legislation that did not require taxpayer funds. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House-passed measure would refinance as many as 500,000 homes over the next five years, at a cost to taxpayers of about $2.7 billion.
 ''Taxpayers shouldn't be taking on the risk of foreclosure,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. 
 The measure now goes to the Senate, where it faces opposition among Republicans who have tapped into a broad wave of bailout resentment in states less affected by the crisis. And the failure of the House to adopt it by a veto-proof margin is likely to further embolden recalcitrant Republicans in the Senate who have so far managed to block action, Democratic supporters of the measure said on Friday.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, said Friday that he was hoping to quickly complete negotiations with the ranking Republican on the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, and have the committee vote on a measure next week.
 ''We're getting very close to a compromise but I can't promise it will happen,'' Mr. Dodd said. He said any measure that did not have Republican support would almost certainly fail. He also said that if the committee failed to adopt a measure quickly, there was probably not enough time in the Congressional session to try again.
 Under the voluntary plan that was approved by the House, borrowers at risk of default would be able to refinance their loans at a more affordable 30-year fixed-rate mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. 
 In exchange for avoiding foreclosure, lenders would have to agree to reduce the principal balance. The borrowers would pay a monthly insurance fee that would go to a fund to protect taxpayers from losses. A consensus was emerging on Friday that if Congress adopted a measure, it would likely be far more modest than the one passed by the House, which itself has been criticized by housing groups for being too small. 
 Still, there is a clear split among Republicans, and perhaps within the administration, over how to proceed. Last month, Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, sharply pivoted and called for government aid to homeowners in danger of losing their homes. 
 His plan was more modest than the Democratic plan. But it was notable because, only a month earlier, he had warned against broad government intervention to solve the mortgage crisis, saying it was ''not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers.''
 Democratic strategists said the change reflected the importance on the electoral map of states like Florida, Ohio and Michigan, all hit hard by the crisis.
 Other prominent officials, including the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have recently urged Congress to take steps to assist borrowers to avert broader economic problems. 
 Last week, Sheila C. Bair, chairman of the F.D.I.C. and a former assistant secretary at the Treasury Department in the Bush administration, proposed a $50 billion government loan program to help struggling borrowers. The Bush administration publicly distanced itself from the proposal.
 After administration officials engaged in talks with House Democrats over their measure, President Bush said on Wednesday that he would veto it. The Democrats say they made several changes sought by the administration in an effort to gain its support. But in a statement of administration policy, the White House said the legislation was burdensome and prescriptive.
 ''It would force the Federal Housing Administration and taxpayers to take on excessive risk, and jeopardize F.H.A.'s financial solvency,'' the statement said.
 Even lawmakers who have criticized some elements of the House measure said they were hearing mixed signals from the Bush administration.
 ''I was surprised by the White House threatened veto,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican who served earlier in the Bush administration as the secretary of housing and urban development. ''The White House message has not been consistent.''
 Mr. Martinez said that the ''obtuse'' nature of the veto threat suggested to him that the administration had issued it as a negotiating tactic.

HEADLINE: Snapshots of a Frenetic Campaign

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Sen. Clinton and the Campaign'' (editorial, May 9):
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement that ''Senator Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again'' is a backhanded use of the race card. It's also a fallacy.
 Her argument is simple: Since they prefer me, they won't vote for him. But one doesn't follow from the other. Black voters prefer Senator Barack Obama, but they would still very likely vote for Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee. 
 It is possible that some working-class white Democrats, particularly racist ones, might vote for Senator John McCain instead. But surely the vast majority of them would side with the Democratic nominee after eight years of the disastrous Bush administration and the promise of four more under Mr. McCain.
 Now is the time for Mrs. Clinton to realize that both logic and justice demand that she start unifying the Democratic Party rather than continuing to divide it along racial lines. 
 Kirk Savage Pittsburgh, May 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The right to vote and have that vote counted is the one opportunity a citizen has to influence the course of leadership in this democratic society. So I respectfully disagree that it will be a ''terrible mistake'' if Hillary Rodham Clinton ''launches a fight over the disqualified delegations from Florida and Michigan.'' 
 Democrats in those two states are being punished for the sins of their leaders. There is time for the Democratic Party to demonstrate its refusal to let process trump this sacred American right. Revotes should be scheduled in both states. 
 Even if self-interest were the only consideration, I do not see how it would enhance Senator Barack Obama's chances if voters in crucial states like Florida and Michigan were outraged by this disregard for their rightful role in our election process. 
 Stanley E. Cohen Chevy Chase, Md., May 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Thinking About November'' (column, May 9):
 Paul Krugman is right about the need for the Democratic Party to unify; for Barack Obama to focus on major issues like the economy; the need for Mr. Obama to address actively the concerns of white, blue-collar America; and the need for his supporters to stop behaving in ways that will further alienate Hillary Rodham Clinton's primary supporters.
 But there are two sides to the coin. Yes, Mr. Obama and his supporters are obligated to do all these things, but Mrs. Clinton is also obligated to actively support him in doing so. 
 When this primary season is over, she is obligated to help Mr. Obama unify the party, to campaign hard and sincerely for Mr. Obama, and to show her supporters why it is essential to support the Democratic nominee in November.
 Chris Conti Boston, May 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Too-Long Goodbye,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, May 8):
 Back off, Mr. Kristof! You're geared up to blame Hillary Rodham Clinton for Barack Obama's defeat should he become the Democratic nominee. 
 Please know that there is as much racism as sexism out here in the hinterlands. Neither of these candidates may be electable, but almost half of us Democrats believe that Mrs. Clinton would be the better president. 
 We support Mrs. Clinton even though she is a woman with a history. Many of us, because we are old, understand and appreciate history, both hers and our country's. 
 I'm not ready to give up yet on my dream of health care reform, for example. She's not ready to give up her dream of leading our country to a better place. Clearly, she is prepared, motivated and thoroughly tested. 
 Dorothy M. Doyle St. Louis, May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof may be correct that many of Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters feel resentment about sexism in the campaign. 
 But I disagree that this year ''the bar is probably higher for a woman candidate for president than for a black candidate.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton was the front-runner for more than a year, but badly miscalculated by assuming the campaign would be over on Super Tuesday. She was also hurt by the decision of the legislatures (and other state politicians) of Michigan and Florida to move their primaries ahead of the officially sanctioned dates. 
 Had Michigan and Florida played by the rules, it is highly likely that Mrs. Clinton's Super Tuesday strategy would have paid off. 
 Sexism aside, Mrs. Clinton ran a flawed campaign and has only found her voice recently, when it was already too late for her to catch up to her opponent.
 Scott Dougan Athens, Ga., May 9, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''The Torch en Route,'' by Gail Collins (column, May 8):
 Ms. Collins describes how elderly nuns from South Bend, Ind., were turned away from the polls during Tuesday's primary because they lacked the proper identification required by an Indiana law that was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. 
 This should raise fear in the hearts of everyone who someday may be too old to hold a valid driver's license and who lacks the mobility to obtain an appropriate substitute.
 Yet we have just heard that John McCain would appoint Supreme Court justices similar to John Roberts and Samuel A. Alito Jr., whose recent appointments were in part responsible for this ruling. Regrettably, the Democrats are likely too involved with their intramural squabbles to realize that they have been presented with the best ''Free Willie Horton'' issue in a long time. 
 Allen Baum Pittsburgh, May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Gail Collins says that ''extremely old people'' comprise Hillary Clinton's most loyal demographic. But many of us do not fit that stereotype. 
 At 81, I am a proud supporter of Barack Obama. I live in a retirement community where the majority of registered voters are Democrats, and close to 50 percent of us voted for Mr. Obama in our Virginia primary. 
 Ms. Collins is right about us, however, in one important respect: We are ''knee-jerk good citizens.'' We lived through the Great Depression, and we know what a difference a president can make.

HEADLINE: A Peek Behind the Price at the Pump

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
FROM Capitol Hill to Wall Street to the campaign trail, the recent surge in oil prices is quickly threatening to supplant the mortgage crisis as the country's leading economic issue. Last week, prices for crude set another record, finishing at $125.96 a barrel on Friday, while gasoline prices closed in on $4 a gallon.
 But even as the presidential candidates debate whether to cut federal gas taxes this summer and legislators look at other ways to ease prices at the pump, a harder-to-control factor is emerging as a main reason behind the increase in energy costs: the sinking dollar. 
 While no one disputes that China and other emerging economies are craving more crude, the stunning rise of oil from $62 a year ago is hard to explain as only a matter of supply and demand. After all, analysts have noted adequate inventories. 
 Over the same period, the dollar has declined nearly 15 percent against the euro, and the jump in oil prices ''is very much driven by the dollar,'' says Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. 
 Simply put, buying oil has become a way for hedge funds, pension funds and other institutional investors to offset their exposure to dollar-based assets like United States stocks and bonds, Mr. Diwan says. And many traders have followed the market's momentum, aggravating the trend.
 ''The problem is that the market for dollar-denominated assets is orders of magnitude bigger than the oil market,'' Mr. Diwan says, so this hedging can have a disproportionate effect on oil prices. ''It's like a lake and a pond, and the lake is overflowing into the pond.''
 While it's hard to pinpoint the impact, it's clear that money has been pouring into commodities over the last five years. In the first quarter of 2008 alone, commodity assets under management rose $30 billion, to $225 billion, according to estimates by Barclays Capital. 
 Much of that increase can be attributed to simple price appreciation, but five years ago, total commodity assets under management equaled just $20 billion, according to Barclays. 
 The dollar's weakness isn't affecting just oil. Other commodities that are priced in dollars -- like wheat, rice and other foodstuffs -- are also soaring, with ramifications felt worldwide. 
 ''I don't think there's any doubt that the devaluation of the dollar is having an impact on all global commodities, including oil,'' says James E. Newsome, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where energy and metals are traded.
 While critics say that short-term investors -- some would call them ''speculators'' -- drive up prices unfairly or manipulate the market, Mr. Newsome doesn't buy it. ''The dollar has become a fundamental,'' he says. ''And the floor of the exchange is littered with former funds and traders who tried to bet against fundamentals and failed.''
 Based on more traditional fundamentals like the cost of finding, producing and shipping crude, oil should be in the mid-$60s, says William H. Brown III, an independent energy consultant in Chappaqua, N.Y., who monitors investment flows in the energy sector. ''I'm not blaming anyone,'' he says, ''but this price is hard to justify.''
 In Washington, however, the blame game has begun. In a speech on May 1, Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cited the weak dollar, as well as the role of ''speculators'' on commodity exchanges.
 And last Wednesday, Senate Democrats proposed legislation that, among other things, would impose substantially higher margin requirements on oil traders, in an effort to dampen speculation. 
 That might take some air out of the overblown oil market -- and help drivers more than a gas-tax holiday would this summer. But it faces fierce opposition from industry advocates like Mr. Newsome, who formerly led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the Nymex and other exchanges.
 ''The margin issue is one I'm very emotional about because it has absolutely nothing to do with the price of oil,'' says Mr. Newsome, previewing arguments that are likely to dominate the debate over links between Wall Street and energy prices in the next few months.
 The argument over whether traders are to blame for high energy prices has lasted for years, but it has intensified of late. Raising margin requirements -- even temporarily -- might be worth a try and might at least settle this dispute.

HEADLINE: Good Times at Sotheby's

 BODY:
As the housing market continues to implode, financial markets go haywire and recession looms, there is nothing like an art sale in New York to reassure everyone that it is still fun to be rich. 
 By the presale estimates for the big auctions of contemporary art this week, the market could fairly be characterized as rosy. Sotheby's estimates it will raise a record $375 million to $477 million. Christie's hopes for $280 million to $390 million, also a record. Both hope to sell paintings at prices once reserved for large corporate jets or small islands: Sotheby's expects to get $70 million for a triptych by Francis Bacon, almost $20 million more than the record for the artist set last year.
 Reassuring as it may be to see a least some consumer spending booming, the art world's ever rising valuations are a symptom of a growing imbalance in the American economy: the unprecedented concentration of the spoils of growth at the very top. This is not a healthy thing for any country, especially one that eschewed royalty a long time ago. 
 To understand how large the gap has grown, consider 1993. Then, the richest 1 percent of families pocketed 14 percent of the nation's income. By 2006, their slice had grown to 23 percent. If that seems extreme, consider that two years ago the 15,000 families in the top 0.01 percent of the population drew 5.5 percent of the nation's total income, an even higher share than during the gilded age. Income inequality is growing in other rich countries as well as among the stars of the developing world, including Russia, China and Brazil. Fast economic growth is creating new plutocrats who do their shopping on Fifth Avenue and pick up the odd masterpiece. Given the dollar's weakness, pretty much everything is a bargain. 
 The question is, where does that leave the rest of us? It was difficult to avoid a sense of schadenfreude as Bear Stearns's former boss, James Cayne, saw his stake in the failed bank plummet from $1 billion to $61 million. 
 Such gloating would probably be short-lived. The moneyed who stash million-dollar art in their vaults tend to bounce back from bad times. What's needed, rather, is to build a social contract that will share economic rewards more equitably. Maybe that will leave a little less money for an oligarch to pay for a Bacon, but at least everyone else could afford regular trips to the museum.

HEADLINE: Could Parking Space Become the Next Living Space?

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
GENERATING both praise and criticism in a suburban New York region with plenty of expensive housing but not much of the budget-friendly kind, a Westchester County Department of Planning report urges towns and villages to use land in existing office parks for new housing -- some of it for moderate-income families.
 Richard Hyman, an independent housing and planning consultant hired by the county for the study, said there were two big reasons he thought the plan would work. To start with, office parks are typically created with more parking than they need, to meet standard zoning requirements. Additionally, the complexes are often built in campuslike settings, with room for more construction -- in this case, new residential buildings. 
 The plan to retrofit office parks is one of the first of its kind, Mr. Hyman said. Many mixed-use projects nationwide offer residential, office and commercial spaces, but they are mostly designed either from scratch on vacant land or as major redevelopment projects in downtown areas.
 The recommendations came in response to a severe shortage of moderate-income housing in Westchester. Demand is expected to reach more than 19,000 units by 2015, yet from 2000 to 2005 only 970 units were built, said Deborah DeLong, the county's housing director.
 Because office parks already have roads and utilities, the study asserts, further development of those properties would not be as costly for developers.
 Builders could afford to set aside as much as 15 percent of the housing for moderate-income families without relying on public money, Mr. Hyman said.
 Put another way, said Robert F. Weinberg, a developer of mixed-use projects in Westchester: ''Here we have already cut down all these trees, put in the sewer and water lines, so there's no hole to be dug, no addition of parking lots and no extra runoff. It makes sense economically and environmentally.''
 Mr. Weinberg, the president of the Robert Martin Company, is a shareholder in Mack-Cali Realty, which owns more than 25 office buildings and several office parks in Westchester. He was an adviser during the preparation of the report -- one of several business executives whom the county interviewed, said Mr. Hyman, who explained: ''We didn't want just an academic study. We wanted a report that was realistic.''
 Five office parks in the county were cited in the report as examples of where the housing could be built. 
 One of them, Talleyrand Office Park, a complex owned by Mack-Cali on White Plains Road in the village of Tarrytown, has 178,000 square feet in two six-story office buildings and a restaurant, on a 75-acre wooded site. It also includes an apartment complex with 300 units, 60 of them designated as moderate-income.
 Village officials in Tarrytown were less than receptive to the report's suggestions. ''On the surface it all sounds wonderful,'' said Thomas T. Basher, the village's deputy mayor, ''but only if the office park has enough extra space for that. In our office park, it would be like squeezing 10 people into a Volkswagen, and I don't mean a bus. It just won't hold it.''
 Mr. Basher also asked why Tarrytown should shoulder more responsibility for moderate-income housing when ''we've already done more than our share.'' 
 During the 1990s, Tarrytown built 123 units of such housing, 56 more than the county had allocated for the village under a plan developed by the Housing Implementation Commission, created by the County Board of Legislators.
 But the panel issued a new plan in 2005, updating the benchmarks for Westchester's 43 municipalities to a 2015 timetable. According to that plan, Tarrytown has built only 6 of 111 additional allotted units. 
 Ms. DeLong, the county's housing director, explained that the case studies in the report were meant only as examples of the feasibility of using office parks for moderate-income houses and not directives for what any particular municipality should do.
 She said the report would be circulated to other towns and villages throughout the county in coming months. So far, only Tarrytown and Greenburgh have reviewed it.
 Existing office parks are attractive sites for housing in part because they are already zoned for high-density development, although new regulations would be needed in some cases to permit residential use.
 The plan would also enable municipalities to meet allocations established for moderate-income housing by the county without using undeveloped land, which is often in short supply.
 THE other four sites used as case studies are also along White Plains Road, but in the adjacent town of Greenburgh, where county officials met with Town Council members two months ago. 
 ''There was no opposition here,'' said Paul J. Feiner, the supervisor, ''but no commitment either.''
 ''In principle, though, if people can live close to where they work, they will spend less on gas, which is one of the reasons mixed-use developments make sense,'' Mr. Feiner added.
 Mr. Hyman observed that local zoning laws governing small towns like those in Westchester -- as opposed to downtown areas -- were adopted before the concept of mixed-use development was revived late in the 20th century.
 Especially in suburban areas, zoning regulations enacted after World War II separated residential, commercial and industrial areas to protect property values, but at the same time they increased dependence on automobiles.
 The planning department hopes that as the report circulates, its ideas will gain favor. But because private companies own the office parks and municipalities control zoning, both groups must be convinced. 
 As Mr. Hyman noted, all the county can do is suggest and advise. ''In the end,'' he said, ''zoning is the prerogative of the municipalities, so it's going to be up to them.''

HEADLINE: Selling Isn't Poetry

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THERE was one last full-floor condominium lingering on the market in a meticulously restored and expensive prewar Park Avenue building at East 75th Street. So Elliott P. Joseph, the project's developer, jumped on what he thought was the perfect sales sweetener: two free Lexus hybrids with the purchase.
 Soon, however, Mr. Joseph sent a reporter a haiku-like text message reconsidering: ''2 car idea / Still an idea / Not a reality yet.'' 
 After meeting with his broker, Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens, and her boss, Hall F. Willkie, Mr. Joseph agreed to trim the asking price instead of offering inducements to sell the 11th-floor apartment at 823 Park Avenue.
 The apartment has a 46-foot-wide living room and library (with mahogany paneling) facing Park Avenue, five bedrooms and nearly 4,200 square feet of space; the building has classical marble columns and a polished marble floor in the lobby. 
 Mr. Joseph agreed to lower the price by $500,000, to $14.9 million from $15.4 million.
 As the peak spring selling season unfolds, owners of other co-op and condos lingering on the market have also been trimming asking prices, hoping to get ever-more-cautious buyers to give their properties a second look. 
 In the last 30 days, prices were cut on about 17 percent of the co-ops and condos in Manhattan, according to an analysis of listings on Streeteasy.com, a Web site that compiles information from most brokerage firms. Prices rose on around 2 percent of all Streeteasy listings. Among the most expensive properties -- those listed for $10 million or more -- there were fewer price changes, but price cuts outnumbered price increases by a ratio of 10 to 1.
 That is one result of the cooler winds blowing through the Manhattan market, despite continuing high prices for completed co-op and condo transactions last month. Brokers say deals are being done, but they are showing apartments less often, and everyone is more cautious.
 ''I am having fewer showings, but more of the buyers who look at apartments are serious buyers,'' said James Lansill, the senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.
 Among the price cuts listed on Streeteasy.com was one at the Dakota, at Central Park West and 72nd Street, where the price of a 10-room apartment was reduced by $1 million, to $18.5 million from $19.5 million. ''As fabulous as your fantasy,'' notes the listing at Warburg Realty by Craig Schiller and Meredith Specht.
 At 1040 Fifth Avenue, the 17-story co-op designed by Rosario Candela at 86th Street, the asking price on an 11-room, five-bedroom apartment was cut by $3 million on May 5, to $21 million, four months after it was listed by Alina Pedroso of Brown Harris Stevens.
 ''Buyers are out there expecting to get good deals,'' said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. ''Some people who want to sell are more open to it.''
 That isn't evident from actual sales data from deeds and tax records filed with the city's Finance Department. Preliminary data showed that prices rose last month, with the average sale price on a co-op or condo reaching $1.45 million, up 17 percent from a year earlier. The median price was $927,500, also up 17 percent. 
 At 823 Park Avenue, Mr. Joseph and his partners at the Property Markets Group thought they would be sold out by now, with total sales of about $166 million. They paid $60 million for the building, after the previous owner bought out the last of the rental tenants. 
 At first, the 11th-floor apartment quickly went into contract, to a couple expecting a baby, but with construction delays, Mr. Joseph returned their deposit and raised the price to $15.4 million.
 Among the buyers in the building was Brendan Shanahan, the New York Rangers forward, who paid $13.4 million for the seventh floor.

HEADLINE: Change We Can Stomach

BYLINE: By DAN BARBER. 
Dan Barber is the chef and co-owner of Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns.

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 COOKING, like farming, for all its down-home community spirit, is essentially a solitary craft. But lately it's feeling more like a lonely burden. Finding guilt-free food for our menus -- food that's clean, green and humane -- is about as easy as securing a housing loan. And we're suddenly paying more -- 75 percent more in the last six years -- to stock our pantries. Around the world, from Cairo to Port-au-Prince, increases in food prices have governments facing riots born of shortages and hunger. It's enough to make you want to toss in the toque.
 But here's the good news: if you're a chef, or an eater who cares about where your food comes from (and there are a lot of you out there), we can have a hand in making food for the future downright delicious.
 Farming has the potential to go through the greatest upheaval since the Green Revolution, bringing harvests that are more healthful, sustainable and, yes, even more flavorful. The change is being pushed along by market forces that influence how our farmers farm. 
 Until now, food production has been controlled by Big Agriculture, with its macho fixation on ''average tonnage'' and ''record harvests.'' But there's a cost to its breadbasket-to-the-world bragging rights. Like those big Industrial Age factories that once billowed black smoke, American agriculture is mired in a mind-set that relies on capital, chemistry and machines. Food production is dependent on oil, in the form of fertilizers and pesticides, in the distances produce travels from farm to plate and in the energy it takes to process it. 
 For decades, environmentalists and small farmers have claimed that this is several kinds of madness. But industrial agriculture has simply responded that if we're feeding more people more cheaply using less land, how terrible can our food system be? 
 Now that argument no longer holds true. With the price of oil at more than $120 a barrel (up from less than $30 for most of the last 50 years), small and midsize nonpolluting farms, the ones growing the healthiest and best-tasting food, are gaining a competitive advantage. They aren't as reliant on oil, because they use fewer large machines and less pesticide and fertilizer.
 In fact, small farms are the most productive on earth. A four-acre farm in the United States nets, on average, $1,400 per acre; a 1,364-acre farm nets $39 an acre. Big farms have long compensated for the disequilibrium with sheer quantity. But their economies of scale come from mass distribution, and with diesel fuel costing more than $4 per gallon in many locations, it's no longer efficient to transport food 1,500 miles from where it's grown. 
 The high cost of oil alone will not be enough to reform American agriculture, however. As long as agricultural companies exploit the poor and extract labor from them at slave wages, and as long as they aren't required to pay the price for the pollution they so brazenly produce, their system will stay afloat. If financially pinched Americans opt for the cheapest (and the least healthful) foods rather than cook their own, the food industry will continue to reach for the lowest common denominator.
 But it is possible to nudge the revolution along -- for instance, by changing how we measure the value of food. If we stop calculating the cost per quantity and begin considering the cost per nutrient value, the demand for higher-quality food would rise. 
 Organic fruits and vegetables contain 40 percent more nutrients than their chemical-fed counterparts. And animals raised on pasture provide us with meat and dairy products containing more beta carotene and at least three times as much C.L.A. (conjugated linoleic acid, shown in animal studies to reduce the risk of cancer) than those raised on grain. 
 Where good nutrition goes, flavor tends to follow. Chefs are the first to admit that an impossibly sweet, flavor-filled carrot has nothing to do with our work. It has to do with growing the right seed in healthy, nutrient-rich soil. 
 Increasingly we can see the wisdom of diversified farming operations, where there are built-in relationships among plants and animals. A dairy farm can provide manure for a neighboring potato farm, for example, which can in turn offer potato scraps as extra feed for the herd. When crops and livestock are judiciously mixed, agriculture wisely mimics nature.
 To encourage small, diversified farms is not to make a nostalgic bid to revert to the agrarian ways of our ancestors. It is to look toward the future, leapfrogging past the age of heavy machinery and pollution, to farms that take advantage of the sun's free energy and use the waste of one species as food for another.
 Chefs can help move our food system into the future by continuing to demand the most flavorful food. Our support of the local food movement is an important example of this approach, but it's not enough. As demand for fresh, local food rises, we cannot continue to rely entirely on farmers' markets. Asking every farmer to plant, harvest, drive his pickup truck to a market and sell his goods there is like asking me to cook, take reservations, serve and wash the dishes. 
 We now need to support a system of well-coordinated regional farm networks, each suited to the food it can best grow. Farmers organized into marketing networks that can promote their common brands (like the Organic Valley Family of Farms in the Midwest) can ease the economic and ecological burden of food production and transportation. They can also distribute their products to new markets, including poor communities that have relied mainly on food from convenience stores. 
 Similar networks could also operate in the countries that are now experiencing food shortages. For years, the United States has flooded the world with food exports, displacing small farmers and disrupting domestic markets. As escalating food prices threaten an additional 100 million people with hunger, a new concept of humanitarian aid is required. Local farming efforts focused on conserving natural resources and biodiversity are essential to improving food security in developing countries, as a report just published by the International Assessment of Agriculture Science and Technology for Development has concluded. We must build on these tenets, providing financial and technical assistance to small farmers across the world.
 But regional systems will work only if there is enough small-scale farming going on to make them viable. With a less energy-intensive food system in place, we will need more muscle power devoted to food production, and more people on the farm. (The need is especially urgent when you consider that the average age of today's American farmer is over 55.) In order to move gracefully into a post-industrial agriculture economy, we also need to rethink how we educate the people who will grow our food. Land-grant universities and agricultural schools, dependent on financing from agribusiness, focus on maximum extraction from the land -- take more, sell more, waste more. 
 Leave our agricultural future to chefs and anyone who takes food and cooking seriously. We never bought into the ''bigger is better'' mantra, not because it left us too dependent on oil, but because it never produced anything really good to eat. Truly great cooking -- not faddish 1.5-pound rib-eye steaks with butter sauce, but food that has evolved from the world's thriving peasant cuisines -- is based on the correspondence of good farming to a healthy environment and good nutrition. It's never been any other way, and we should be grateful. The future belongs to the gourmet.

HEADLINE: Belt-Tightening Can Bring Change, or Misery

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
 It was a long, hard winter for the homeless in New Haven. 
 They filled the city's main shelter, called Columbus House. For the first time they also took up all of the 75 beds set up in the basement of a nearby drug treatment center to serve homeless men from November through April. To handle the overflow, another makeshift shelter with 35 beds was set up for six weeks. 
 But, it turns out, next winter could be a lot worse. Because of a $14.2 million hole in the city's budget, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. last week announced a series of tough cutbacks, including reducing spending on the homeless to $1.1 million from $1.6 million. That would pretty much cover Columbus House but nothing else. 
 The mayor laid blame for the cuts on a state budget, agreed on last week, that gave Connecticut cities far less state money than they had expected. The legislature and Gov. M. Jodi Rell blamed collapsing state finances, which went from a projected $263 million surplus to an estimated $80 million deficit. It's not clear whom the homeless will blame, but it won't make much difference either way.
 It's been clear for a year that the subprime lending fiasco and its attendant ripples were going to cost a lot of people their homes. But who ever thought it would even cost those without homes their threadbare barracks of cots in the basement of a detox center?
 Of course, not every cut that's announced becomes a cut that's enacted. And there's plenty of gamesmanship going on in the budget machinations by legislators eager to avoid raising taxes and big-city mayors trying to make the case that if their constituents are unhappy with cuts in local services, they should be mad at the legislature, not their local government.
 That's why the mayors of most of Connecticut's major cities -- Mr. DeStefano, Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, Eddie A. Perez of Hartford, Michael J. Jarjura of Waterbury and others -- showed up at the Capitol in Hartford last week to voice their displeasure. 
 ''This is the politics of Herbert Hoover,'' said Mr. DeStefano, a Democrat who ran for governor against Mrs. Rell in 2006. ''The General Assembly and the governor had a chance to provide leadership, and they decided to take a walk on the people of the state of Connecticut.''
 For all the somewhat stagy politics, two things are going on.
 The first is politics for hard times -- a pretty familiar refrain across the nation these days. After all, Gov. Jon S. Corzine proposed a budget for New Jersey that called for reducing the state's work force by 3,000 people, closing three departments and pruning expenses for services including colleges and hospitals.
 And, of course, for all the anguish from big-city mayors, the chatter in coffee shops and on message boards is often not very sympathetic. ''Sooner or later the state and town governments are gonna have to face the facts,'' one person wrote on a Hartford Courant message board. ''The gravy train has derailed, and there ain't no mo' in our pockets to pick.''
 The second, which may or may not ever get traction, is politics beyond hard times. As Mr. DeStefano says, the main issue is not a one-time decision by the legislature, it's a state tax code that in his view cheats cities and the poor. Critics have long said that Connecticut's reliance on the property tax for local revenue cripples cities, which have more than their share of the poor and of tax-exempt institutions like hospitals and much less of the expensive residential real estate.
 In New Haven, for example, one-third of the housing units are some form of public or subsidized housing.
 So maybe the homeless will get their shelter, and maybe they won't. Maybe the legislature next session will leave the cities happier, and maybe it won't.
 But, whether hard times bring some real reform, whether they lead to a tax code that's more likely to help bridge the divide between rich and poor in a state where the gap is hard-wired into the state's economy and geography, is a much bigger issue. 
 And not just in Connecticut. The current downturn, one hopes, will eventually end. But in rich states like Connecticut and poor ones like Alabama, any serious attempt to reduce poverty needs to include a re-examination of the state tax codes, a task far tougher than scraping together funds to keep a shelter open. 
 There's not a lot on the horizon that would make one confident, but Mr. DeStefano says maybe it's time. 
 ''It's like a hole in the roof,'' he said. ''It leaks a little bit and you let it go and put a bucket under it, and eventually you've got a five-foot hole in the ceiling, the basement's flooded, the lights are shorted out, the toilets don't work and then you figure, 'You know what? We've got to deal with this.'
 ''It's like Winston Churchill said: 'Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other possibilities.' ''

HEADLINE: Matching Newcomer to College, While Both Pay

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: ATHENS, Ohio 

 BODY:
When Xiaoxi Li, a 20-year-old from Beijing, decided she should go to college in the United States, she applied only to Ohio University -- not that she knew much about it. 
 ''I heard of Ohio, of course,'' Ms. Li said. ''I knew it was in the middle, and has agriculture.'' 
 What brought her here was the recommendation of a Chinese recruiting agent, JJL Overseas Education Consulting and Service Company. For about $3,000, JJL helped Ms. Li choose a college, complete the application and prepare for the all-important visa interview. 
 ''Everyone I know used an agent,'' she said. ''They are professionals. They suggested Ohio University might be the best for me. They have a good relationship with Ohio University.'' 
 Actually, JJL has more than a good relationship with Ohio University. Unknown to Ms. Li, it has a contract, under which the agent gets a $1,000 commission for each undergraduate it sends. 
 British and Australian universities have for years paid commissions to overseas recruiting agents, and as a result have attracted a growing share of international students. Now the practice is spreading in the United States, especially at community colleges and public universities eager to enroll more international students, who may pay several times the in-state tuition. Many institutions that use agents, including some small private religious colleges, are not well known; without recruiters, they have little hope of attracting students from around the world to diversify their campuses. 
 But the use of agents is raising uncomfortable questions and strong feelings, with some education officials queasy about a system in which those who advise students on their college selection have a financial stake in the choice, an approach they fear could make the college-admissions process into a global bounty hunt. 
 ''Putting recruiters on any kind of commission makes them out and out sales agents,'' said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
 Like JJL, many agents collect hefty fees from both sides -- the students they advise, and the universities they contract with -- leaving some to question whose interest is being served. Even some advocates of recruiting agents see a need for an ethics code. 
 ''We should be doing this, but we should be doing it right,'' said Mitch Leventhal, vice provost of international affairs at the University of Cincinnati, which has contracts with agents. ''And I don't think it's right for students to have to pay a lot if the agent is also getting paid by the university. I don't think it's ethical.''
 Agents range from huge operations like JJL to mom-and-pop outfits -- and from reputable to fly-by-night. No one keeps track of how many agents there are, how many receive commissions from universities or how many students they send to the United States. But those familiar with the flow of international students say that thousands, mostly from Asia, use agents to come to American institutions, particularly community colleges with intensive English programs. 
 Some agents are paid mostly through commissions from universities; others are paid entirely by the students, with the university never knowing that an agent was involved. The State Department also operates hundreds of offices worldwide advising students on study in the United States.
 Many colleges see contracts with overseas agents as a win-win proposition, helping to bring in far more tuition dollars than are paid out in commissions. They also see the foreign students as attractive both for their contributions to the local economy and the international bridges they help to build. Ohio, where many institutions are contracting with agents, recently adopted a strategic higher-education plan specifically calling for international recruiting. 
 But Mr. Nassirian argues that the process has invisible losers. ''If there is a natural limit to the capacity of our educational system to take foreign students, isn't it better to get the best qualified rather than those with the ability to pay?'' he asked. 
 A Legal Exception Overseas
 A legal disparity makes matters still murkier. Federal law forbids universities to pay recruiters based on how many American students they enroll, a ban meant to block aggressive recruiters from signing up unqualified students for college, including welfare recipients, in order to pocket the commissions -- knowing the students would be likely to default on federal student loans. 
 The law makes a specific exception for overseas students, who are not eligible for such loans. But some policy experts say that to keep the profit motive out of college recruiting, the practice should not be allowed overseas, either.
 Still, those who use overseas agents say they can play a valuable role. For Asian families who speak little or no English, but have a powerful longing to get their children a prestigious education, agents help navigate the bewildering process of producing transcripts, selecting a college and getting a visa. For American universities that are not well known abroad, and cannot afford to send admissions officers on expensive recruiting trips, local agents may be the way to compete in the globalized world of higher education. 
 ''We can get on this high horse of pure behavior, that we will not pay an agent for recruiting students, while British and Australian and Canadian universities do it, and we can see all the students go elsewhere,'' said Josep Rota, Ohio University's associate provost for international affairs. ''The old model of international students was that we sat here in the foothills of Appalachia, saying, dear world, come here and we will welcome you, and that worked until 9/11. But then they stopped coming. If we want to continue to bring them here, we have to recruit.'' 
 Ohio University, a public institution with more than 20,000 students, has done well with commissioned agents, especially in China, the source of more than half its foreign undergraduates. JJL has sent more than a third of them. 
 ''I came on a plane with about 30 other students who all used JJL,'' said Fei Peng, a 20-year-old from Shanghai who arrived in Ohio in August. 
 Ms. Peng, like Ms. Li and all the Chinese students interviewed on campus, did not know the university paid the agent for each student who enrolled. While a few said the commissions gave them pause, they were generally satisfied with their agents' services, both in selecting a university and in preparing them for the visa interview. 
 ''They give you a lot of questions, and you practice good answers,'' said Ms. Li, who has wire-rimmed glasses, black nail polish and an earnest manner. 
 Many of the Chinese undergraduates come from big cities and appreciate the quiet of small-town Athens, although some say life here can be boring, if they have no car, and are not interested in partying. They see study in the United States as a back-door route to success in China, where most failed to win admission to the top Chinese universities. Most come from one-child families, with parents who are very involved in planning their success, and willing to pay the United States' high tuition costs -- about $18,000 a year at Ohio University, double the in-state tuition. 
 Mr. Rota said he was delighted that his campus had 113 Chinese undergraduates this fall, four times as many as the previous year, and that generally, they were doing well. But he remains wary. 
 ''We know that working with agents is potentially dangerous, that many of them are not honest, and that we have to be extremely selective,'' he said. ''One condition for them to continue working with us is that they send the kind of students we want, who will stay here and succeed, not come and use their visa for inappropriate purposes and disappear into the woodwork.'' 
 'A Lot of Gouging Going On'
 Still, he hopes to use more agents to increase the international enrollment; the university already has agents in Turkey and Taiwan, and is looking for partners in Vietnam and Korea. Throughout Asia and to a lesser extent other parts of the world, thousands of agents offer help to students seeking admission to an English-speaking university, charging them fees that may be a few hundred dollars, or far more. ''Some agents charge as much as $30,000,'' said John Robert Cryan of the University of Toledo, which works with agents, but pays no commissions. ''There's a lot of gouging going on.'' 
 JJL, which is licensed by the Chinese government, sent about 2,000 students to American colleges over the last year, and many more to Australia and the United Kingdom. Li Zhen, the vice manager of JJL's United States department, said students paid fees ranging from about $2,000 to apply to a community college to about $5,000 for the most selective universities, for which the agency charges extra. JJL helps students apply anwhere they want, including universities that pay no commissions. 
 ''My personal record, my best, was getting a student to U.C.L.A.,'' he said. 
 Just as agents vary, so too do the commissions. Ohio University is on the low side, paying $1,000 for each undergraduate, or 10 percent of tuition for the English language program. 
 ''The market range is anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of tuition,'' said Visakan Ganeson, director of international programs at Skagit Valley College in Mount Vernon, Wash., which gets about half of its 200 international students through commissioned agents. ''How much you pay depends on your position in the market.'' 
 The most selective universities, deluged with applications, do not contract with agents. 
 Overseas recruiting agents have long been used on the West Coast, especially by community colleges like Skagit Valley, which offer intensive English courses to prepare students for college-level work. 
 Linh Nguyen, 17, who came to Washington last fall after finishing 11th grade in Vietnam, applied to Skagit Valley on her agent's advice. ''They told me that it's a small college, but it has a good quality,'' said Ms. Nguyen, who paid $300 to her agent. 
 Bates Technical College, an open-admissions institution in Tacoma, Wash., pays 15 percent of the first year's tuition to its agents in Taiwan and China, according to Cheri Loiland, the associate vice president for extended learning. 
 Mr. Leventhal of the University of Cincinnati, who formerly worked for a huge Australian recruiting agent, has been preaching the gospel of commission-based recruiting. The flow of international students to American universities has increased slowly in recent years, while the number going to Australia more than doubled, he said, largely because American universities recruit poorly in Asia. 
 ''Most American universities do helicopter marketing,'' Mr. Leventhal said. ''They drop in for college fairs and road shows and then they take off. There's no continuing presence overseas, no one on the ground who speaks the language and can answer questions any time. That's something a lot of parents want.'' 
 Persuasive Point of View
 His message has been persuasive. This spring Mr. Leventhal took representatives of several universities to visit agents in China, India, Korea and Vietnam. Wright State University, in Dayton, made the same trip last month. Even Oberlin, a selective private college that will not pay commissions, has talked to overseas agents -- though it has not accepted any student they have sent.
 Mr. Leventhal is also advocating a code of ethics, modeled on Australian practice, under which American universities would pay agents a 10 percent commission, if the agents agreed to charge students only a nominal fee. 
 Still, many educators remain ambivalent about the practice. Philip G. Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College, said he had a knee-jerk aversion to commissioned agents. ''There are a lot of bottom feeders out there,'' he said. 
 But he has come to realize that overseas agents can help faraway families. 
 ''In a globalized world, where some people need a lot of guidance to get here, there may be a legitimate place for responsible middlemen,'' he said, then added, ''although I really hate it.''
 To American families, who devote so much time and attention to choosing a college, there may be something disquieting about overseas agents steering students to programs with which they have contracts, dispatching them, almost randomly, to far-flung parts of the United States. But colleges like the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, a small Baptist university in Belton, Tex., are thrilled to land more international students, like the 25 Chinese students who arrived this year, through new agreements with commissioned agents. 
 ''We like these students from two perspectives,'' said Elizabeth Tanaka, the director of international students. ''Looking outward, we are a Christian university, and we like these students on our campus, not necessarily to convert them, but to give them an opportunity to discover Christianity. And looking inward, our student population is typically from the tri-county area, and they think anything outside of Texas is exotic. If we bring the world to them, that is a heart-opening, mind-opening experience.''

HEADLINE: Can a Bargain Rent Have Staying Power?

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
FOR landlords and some tenants in rent-stabilized buildings, few issues are more important than ''preferential rent'' -- rent that is lower than the legal regulated rent registered with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 Among the questions that surround those rents are whether they carry over to a subsequent renewal and how the answer to that question affects a tenant in a rental building that is being converted to a co-op or a condo.
 Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan lawyer and an adjunct professor at New York Law School , said that before 2001, the courts held that a preferential rent would continue throughout the tenancy, even if the lease provided otherwise. 
 In 2001, however, an appellate court held that the lease would govern and that if a preferential rent was not ''for the duration of the tenancy,'' that provision should be honored.
 In 2003, however, the State Legislature amended the Rent Stabilization Code to provide that preferential rents would terminate upon vacancy or renewal, allowing landlords to end preferential rents when leases expired. 
 But despite that change, in a 2003 decision, in a case known as Colonnade Management v. Sturgis Warner, another appellate court ruled that the increase to a higher rent was permissible only if the lease unambiguously allowed it. Based on that decision, Mr. Ferrara said, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal last month updated its fact sheet on preferential rents, which is issued as a tenants' aid. 
 First, he said, if the lease makes clear that the reduced rent will apply only for a limited duration, the preferential rent will end at the time specified in the lease. 
 But, Mr. Ferrara said, if the agreement provides that the preferential rent will apply for the entire tenancy -- or if the landlord fails to disclose the legal regulated rent in the lease -- the reduction may not be rescinded. 
 And if the lease is ambiguous or silent about the duration of a preferential rent, the ambiguity is generally resolved in favor of the tenant and the preferential rent continues throughout the tenancy.
 Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that owners who want to make sure a preferential rent will end must make that clear in the first lease set at the reduced rent.
 The duration of preferential rents can be important when a building is being converted.
 Errol A. Brett, a real estate lawyer in Floral Park, N.Y., says he is representing several tenants who were given preferential rents during the conversion process but whose landlords -- now that the conversion is complete and the tenants are no longer eligible to buy -- are trying to increase the rents to the legal regulated amount. He believes that those rents cannot be raised.
 Under the law that governs conversions, he said, a tenant in occupancy has only 90 days after the plan is accepted for filing by the attorney general to buy at the ''insider price.'' By increasing the rent to the legal maximum after that period has expired, the landlord is essentially giving the tenant three options: buy at market price; pay the higher rent; or leave the apartment.

HEADLINE: When Health Insurance Is No Comfort

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Even the Insured Feel the Strain of Health Costs'' (front page, May 4) should scare and enrage anyone with pre-existing conditions -- which means anyone over 40. 
 The moral point of health insurance is to pool resources so that the ill can get the care they need. But the high-deductible plans now being marketed to employers as a way to lower costs ultimately increase costs for everyone, because they discourage people from getting care before they become very ill. 
 Anne Cohen San Francisco, May 5, 2008
 The writer is the director of Disability Health Access, health care consultants.
 To the Editor:
 The situation is even worse than you report. Many top doctors in New York and elsewhere are now opting out of Medicare, forcing older patients to pay full costs with no hope of reimbursement. My wife's oncological surgeon did not accept Medicare, so we paid $20,000 for her radical hysterectomy. Hospital costs were covered, but not the surgery. 
 For follow-up chemotherapy, he recommended another oncologist who was board certified and did accept Medicare reimbursement. However, his office was a travesty -- a crowded waiting room, inadequate bathroom facilities and consultations that were limited to three or four minutes. After two months, my wife elected to return to her surgeon, for which we paid $4,000 per chemo treatment. She died after 27 months.
 Larry Hulack New York, May 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I was dismayed that mental health services were not discussed in your article about costs for the insured. As a practicing psychologist in New York, I see firsthand the stress that the economic downturn and fear of job loss are having on my clients. 
 I think I speak for a lot of my colleagues when I talk about the wonderful mental health parity rules in New York, called Timothy's Law, and the effect this has had on being able to provide treatment for those in need. However, with so many individuals' health care tied to employers, parity laws mean nothing if people lose their jobs. 
 I fear that most people's access to mental health treatment may be vanishing at a time when they need it most. This is a tragedy in the making.
 David Brandwein Union, N.J., May 4, 2008
 The writer, an associate professor of psychology at Kean University, is director of the university's Community Mental Health Clinic.
 To the Editor:
 The skyrocketing costs of health insurance are the result of onerous government regulations, such as mandatory benefits. 
 Many states require insurance plans to include benefits like chiropractor care or in vitro fertilization. Such mandatory benefits raise insurance costs by about 20 percent to 50 percent, according to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance. 
 More fundamentally, mandated benefits violate an individual's right to contract freely with insurers and providers according to his rational judgment for his best interest. Instead, a bureaucrat decides how the individual must spend his own money.
 Eliminating these mandates would make health insurance available to millions of Americans who desperately want it but cannot now afford it. 
 The proper solution to the health insurance crisis is not more government, but a free market.
 Paul Hsieh Sedalia, Colo., May 4, 2008
 The writer, a doctor, is co-founder, Freedom and Individual Rights in Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 Your article about middle-income Americans squeezed by health care expenses does not mention where their money is going. Although we are in a recession, insurance companies continue to post profits.
 Too often Americans who do manage to pay their insurance premiums find out too late that they are not adequately covered for the care they need after an accident or serious diagnosis. As long as insurance companies and hospitals are permitted to maintain for-profit status, their ultimate responsibility will be to their shareholders and not their patients.
 Only a publicly financed health care system would eliminate this huge administrative waste and help Americans hold onto the money they need for other essentials.
 Tanya Brown Berkeley, Calif., May 4, 2008
 The writer is a nursing student. 
 To the Editor:
 I was underinsured when I learned I had breast cancer. I was terrified that I would die because I could not afford treatment. I am one of the many people who have insurance but are unable to afford the co-payments that are required to get through surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. 
 I was determined to live. I searched for help and found the Patient Access Network, which helps insured patients with the out-of-pocket costs of expensive treatments. Thanks to this group, I am able to continue my drug therapy to prevent a recurrence. They and others have saved my life.
 I don't know the answer to our health care crisis, but I am grateful that such help does exist for patients like me.

HEADLINE: Vote Like Thy Neighbor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. GALSTON and PIETRO S. NIVOLA. 
William A. Galston and Pietro S. Nivola are senior fellows in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Along with David Brady, Nivola edited Volumes 1 and 2 of ''Red and Blue Nation,'' from which much of the research for this essay was drawn.

 BODY:
The buzz these days is that American politics may be entering a ''postpartisan'' era, as a new generation finds the old ideological quarrels among baby boomers to be increasingly irrelevant. In reality, matters are not so simple. Far from being postpartisan, today's young adults are significantly more likely to identify as Democrats than were their predecessors. Along with colleagues at the Brookings and Hoover institutions, we recently completed a comprehensive study of the nation's polarization. Our research concludes not only that the ideological differences between the political parties are growing but also that they have become embedded in American society itself. 
 Large events made some increase in polarization inevitable. In the wake of the Vietnam War, the post-World War II foreign-policy consensus collapsed. Less than a decade after President Nixon declared that ''we are all Keynesians now,'' stagflation and soaring interest rates spawned the controversial tenets of supply-side economics. Social movements and the Supreme Court put long-suppressed, highly divisive cultural issues back on the public agenda. 
 But polarization has proceeded even further than these shifts made necessary. The great majority of voters now fuse their party identification, ideology and decisions in the voting booth. The share of Democrats who could be called conservative has shrunk, and so has the share of liberal Republicans. The American National Election Studies asks voters a series of issues-based questions and then arrays respondents along a 15-point scale from -7 (the most liberal) to +7 (the most conservative). These data indicate that 41 percent of the voters in 1984 were located at or near the midpoint of the ideological spectrum, compared with only 28 percent in 2004. Meanwhile, the percentage of voters clustering toward the left and right tails of the spectrum rose from 10 to 23 percent. 
 Most strikingly, political polarization has become akin to political segregation. You are less likely to live near someone whose politics differ from your own. It's well known that fewer states are competitive in presidential races than in decades past. We find similar results at the county level. In 1976, only 27 percent of voters lived in landslide counties where one candidate prevailed by 20 points or more. By 2004, 48 percent of voters lived in such counties.
 What accounts for the decline of ideologically mixed localities? Bill Bishop, a journalist, and Robert Cushing, a sociologist, who have studied this issue, stress that the age of ''white flight'' to the suburbs is over. Instead, during the past two decades, many whites have moved to one group of cities and many blacks to another. Meanwhile, young people have deserted rural and older manufacturing areas for cities like Austin and Portland. Places with higher densities of college graduates attract even more, so that the gap between such communities and less-educated areas widens further. Zones of high education, in turn, produce more innovation and enjoy higher incomes, generating communities dominated by upper-middle-class tastes. Lower-educated regions, by contrast, tend to be more family-oriented and more faithful to traditional authority. 
 Not surprisingly, this demographic sorting correlates with a widening difference in political preferences. What's more, according to Bishop and Cushing, once a tipping point is reached, majorities tend to become supermajorities. This is consistent with the findings of recent political science and social psychology: individuals in the minority of their group tend to shift their views toward the majority, while members of the majority become more extreme in their views. In such circumstances, discussions within groups often intensify, rather than moderate, the underlying polarization.
 Our study shows that this geographical sorting worsens polarization in several ways. When counties become more homogeneous, it becomes harder to use redistricting to create more competitive Congressional districts. (Recent research indicates that gerrymandering accounts for, at the very most, one-third of noncompetitive districts in the House of Representatives.) When states become more homogeneous, presidential campaigns begin by conceding a large number of contests to the opposition, disheartening their supporters in those states and increasing the majority's electoral advantage. Polarization feeds on itself.
 Because politics is a contact sport, hard-hitting partisan competition is unavoidably part of the game. A party system that differentiates sharply between alternatives has virtues, not the least being that it engages more voters, offers clearer choices and enhances accountability. But hyperpartisan politics also do damage, not least to public trust and confidence in government -- and many Americans understandably yearn for less polarization. Because the underlying structure of our politics remains so deeply divided, the 2008 election may not requite their wish.

HEADLINE: In Animal Shelters, Reminders of the Economy

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ON Valentine's Day, a loved one named Riley found himself being led back into the same noisy institutional building where he was also known as No. 08-447. The floppy-eared 2 1/2-year-old Rottweiler-Doberman pinscher mix had been adopted as a puppy a year earlier from the Stamford Animal Care and Control municipal shelter. 
 Riley's return wasn't a behavioral issue; according to Linda Hollywood, Stamford's animal control officer, he is a sweet, easygoing dog who gets along well with other animals and children. 
 ''He was clearly well cared for and loved by this family,'' Ms. Hollywood said. ''But their home had just gone into foreclosure, and they were unable to find an apartment that would permit pets. In general, only the more expensive rentals allow them.''
 Riley could be a poster pup for a growing problem at animal shelters nationwide and in Connecticut: pets given up for adoption or abandoned when their owners lose homes owing to foreclosure or tough economic times. 
 The extent of the problem is impossible to quantify, because some people merely abandon pets on the street or decline to give reasons for surrendering them to shelters. But pets left homeless are putting such a strain on shelters that the Humane Society of the United States has begun a nationwide Foreclosure Pets Grant Program to help animal control agencies, shelters and pet owners cope.
 ''We find kittens in the mailbox, dogs tied to our dumpster,'' Ms. Hollywood said. ''Some people find it too upsetting to come in. But for care and adoption purposes, we'd at least like to know the animal's age and vaccination history -- whether it gets along with other dogs or cats.''
 The more a shelter knows about an animal, Ms. Hollywood, the easier it is to find a home for it.
 Adrienne Stafford, shelter director at PAWS, a privately run shelter in Norwalk, said it has noticed a slight increase in people giving loss of home as a reason for giving up a pet. ''We're also getting more calls from folks worried that they can't afford to keep their pets.''
 Ms. Stafford and the volunteers at PAWS collect donations of food and supplies to help, along with information on financial options, such as no-interest medical care credit cards that can help owners pay veterinary bills over time. 
 Municipal shelters must accept surrendered pets, whenever they arrive. 
 ''It's just horrible now -- every day,'' said Jimmy Gonzalez, animal control officer for Bridgeport. ''But honestly, it's always bad here.'' He said that his shelter is the busiest in the state, averaging 5 to 10 ''owner releases'' a day, and that those numbers have stayed fairly steady over the last few years.
 Mr. Gonzalez said that half of his shelter's population was abandoned cruelly and indifferently, on the streets or in vacated dwellings. But lately, during his intake interviews with people bringing in their pets, he has seen more signs of owners feeling guilty about releases attributed to economic problems.
 ''People are coming out and saying that they're losing their homes and can't keep the pet,'' he said. ''It's such a big problem now, they seem to feel able to tell you the exact reason, beyond a simple 'I'm moving.' ''
 Even the owners showing the steeliest resolve as they fill out the paperwork have difficulty with the questions Mr. Gonzalez gently asks to make sure they want to leave the pet behind. ''Usually, they break down,'' he said. ''Or I find them outside in the back afterward, crying. Really, they've just given up a child. I hate to see that pain. I hate to lead the pet away. You can't imagine the stress in this job.''
 Mr. Gonzalez and his staff of three must manage adoptions, intake and care for a capacity of 40 dogs and 25 cats (soon to be increased to 80 dogs and 52 cats in a new facility, without any growth in the staff). He said that nearly every day, his team arrives at work to find dogs tied to the fence outside. They field constant calls from panicked landlords and real estate agents. ''They'll send someone in to clean a just-vacated apartment or home and find five cats or three pit bulls inside.''
 Hope does spring eternal, yipping and purring, within the cages. ''Adoptions are high here,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''Yesterday, 62 people came in to look, and we had 13 adoptions.'' Still, as the animals continue to arrive, he feels as if he's trying to plug an ever-weakening dike. ''It's an awful thing to see. I've had tough gang bangers come in to look around and go, 'Man, is it that bad out there?' ''
 The Internet has been a boon to shelters and rescue groups trying to place animals. And it was a mouse click that changed Riley's luck. In Wethersfield, Michael Morreale, the owner of a floor covering company, found Riley's photo and description on Petfinder.com. He drove to Stamford with Max, the family Doberman, to see how the two might get along. 
 ''I paid $1,000 for Max,'' Mr. Morreale said. ''He's a great dog. But I've always felt that guys like Riley should have a chance, too.'' 
 Max and Riley hit it off, and off they went to a comfortable home with a big fenced yard; two eager children, Alexa, 9, and Nicholas, 15; and Mr. Morreale and his wife, Annamarie.
 ''Riley has been a total gentleman from day one,'' Mr. Morreale said. ''He's great with the kids, and we often find him in my daughter's room. He seems to find a lot of comfort there. It makes me think there was another little girl who loved him.''
 The name and cellphone number of Riley's former family cannot be disclosed by the shelter. The family did not respond to an interview request, relayed to them by Ms. Hollywood. 
 ''I think they're still in Stamford,'' she said. ''We know Riley's had a very happy landing. I wish we could be as certain about that family.''

HEADLINE: Eye Candy, but Definitely Not the iCar Ready for Its Hollywood Close-Up

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
IF Smart USA, distributor of the Smart microcar, could get every person who shouted, whooped, ran into the street, stopped traffic and corralled me for a chat to actually buy a Fortwo like the one I drove around Los Angeles, Daimler's factory in France would have to run 24/7.
 There is no great secret to the car's appeal: the Smart Fortwo may be the cutest and most unusual-looking production vehicle to arrive in this country since BMW's front-loading Isetta 300 of the 1950s. 
 To see if the Smart was more than a fashion statement -- the charm of its shape and colors draws admirers as if it were the latest gadget from Apple -- I drove the company's better-equipped model, the Passion, for two weeks, scooting around the San Fernando Valley suburbs and across the freeways to Venice, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. 
 Starting at $14,235 ($15,475 as tested), the Smart Passion came with many features Americans have come to expect: air-conditioning; power steering, windows and door locks; CD player; front fog lights; and a huge moon roof. For all the bells and whistles -- it even comes with an electronic stability system -- cruise control was left off the list. Perhaps Smart's product planners didn't think many drivers would take their cars for extended freeway trips. 
 But I did. The 3-cylinder 1-liter engine had no problem getting up to speed, joining the flow and cruising at 80 miles an hour, the prevailing off-peak pace of Southern California freeways.
 But once at speed, the engine thrashed and the car was buffeted by the wake of passing tractor trailers, giving me pause when I thought about taking one hand off the wheel. The experience was akin to crossing the upper level of the George Washington Bridge in a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle on a windy day. 
 Rounding curves on city streets, the body roll was pronounced, causing a friend to reflexively grab the dash. When accelerating, the dreadful 5-speed automated manual transmission shifts awkwardly and slowly. It may be enough to make you reach for the Dramamine: the engine temporarily slows as the car is about to upshift, jerking the driver forward and then back with each shift. Several times, my wife threatened to walk home.
 This may bring back fond memories of your first pathetic attempt to drive a manual transmission car. The solution -- if you can time it right -- is to lift your foot off the accelerator when you think the transmission is about to shift, something I was able to pull off about 50 percent of the time. 
 The air-conditioning was strong enough to cool the interior even during a recent spate of 90-degree days. But the fan was noisy and seemed to have a mind of its own, speeding up and slowing down as the compressor kicked in. 
 In Europe, the Smart is a pint-sized solution to narrow, congested streets, thimble-sized parking spaces and astronomical gas prices. In Los Angeles, though, most city streets are as wide as Italian autostradas, and parking spaces are defined by meters and lines. Finding a space on the street is usually possible, even if you are driving an S.U.V. in Beverly Hills on the weekend.
 While the car is teensy on the outside, the Smart's generous headroom lets you quickly forget that you're in the smallest car sold in the United States -- until you turn around and wonder, like Ronald Reagan's character in ''King's Row,'' ''Where's the rest of me?''
 The interior has two supportive and attractive seats and a small shelf behind them, and that's it. A clock and a tachometer, whimsically mounted like crustacean eyes on the fabric-covered dash, were cute and easy to read. 
 The shelf is large enough to carry one standard suitcase and a carry-on bag, but not much else. You can increase carrying capacity by folding the passenger seat forward, though that requires pulling a lever awkwardly placed between the seats. My wife summed it up best: ''This is a car for people without much of a life.''
 In the mileage department, the Smart also failed to live up to expectations. Even with its tiny engine, the two tankfuls of gas consumed while I had the car worked out to readings of only 30 and 34 miles a gallon. That was less than the 36 m.p.g. E.P.A. rating for combined city/highway driving, and certainly not ''amazing'' as Smart's press materials proclaim.
 ''That's worse than my Honda,'' a man yelled indignantly at me in a Santa Monica parking lot. He expected the Smart to do better, and so did everyone else I asked. In an informal survey of friends, relatives, people who stopped me on the street and even the U.P.S. deliveryman, the consensus was that a car this size should go 50 to 60 miles on each gallon. Learning that premium fuel is recommended was an added downer.
 With its limited carrying capacity, seemingly mediocre fuel economy, erratic handling and fitful acceleration, one question that potential buyers in this part of the world should be asking is, what's the point?

HEADLINE: How to Tell if a Rally Is Real

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN fits and starts, blue-chip stocks have been climbing higher since mid-March. But many market watchers aren't convinced that the worst of this market storm, which began in October, is behind us.
 ''This was certainly a marketbottom, and a pretty good market bottom,'' said Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, the asset management firm in Boston. ''But I don't know if it was the bottom.''
 For that, investors will have to look for signposts in the future -- not the past. 
 For instance, if stocks are rallying on the belief that the economy is indeed on the mend, investors will need to see signs that it is actually strengthening. ''There's been a lot of stimulus put into place, and you've got to look for evidence that that's working,'' Mr. Richardson said. 
 One important gauge will be corporate earnings -- namely, profits among companies outside the financial services sector. 
 ''The world has figured out that the financial sector has serious problems, but the assumption is that the rest of corporate America seems to be doing O.K.,'' said Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at GMO, an investment management firm in Boston. 
 While overall earnings of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to fall nearly 6 percent in the second quarter, profits for the nine nonfinancial sectors are predicted to rise nearly 8 percent.
 But can investors count on this trend continuing?
 ''It's our significant worry that corporate profits in the nonfinancial part of the system are likely to be weak over the next couple of years,'' Mr. Inker said. ''If we're right, and corporate profits are going to start to deteriorate outside the financials, it will cause another round of problems.'' 
 Here are some other factors to watch in coming weeks:
 SMALL-STOCK PERFORMANCE An indication that investors are gaining courage after a market scare is a renewed willingness to own speculative assets.
 Small stocks generally perform better than large-capitalization shares in the first few months of market recoveries. Since 1979, for example, the median gain for small stocks in the three months after market bottoms, has been 19.6 percent, according to a study by Ned Davis Research. By comparison, big, blue-chip shares have risen more modestly -- by 13.6 percent.
 Since March 17, the S.& P. 600 index of small stocks has gained 9.3 percent while the S.& P. 500 index of large stocks is up 8.8 percent. Continuing strength in small stocks through June could offer confirmation that this rally is for real.GROWTH VS. VALUE As markets recover from severe downturns, ''growth stocks eventually come back into favor,'' said Robert E. Turner, chairman and chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa. 
 Because growth stocks are considered a more aggressive bet than dividend-paying value shares, a growth rally is an indication that ''the sellers are done selling and the buyers are ready to come in,'' Mr. Turner said.
 Since mid-March, growth stocks in the Russell 1000 index of blue-chip stocks are beating their value counterparts -- but by less than a percentage point. So this indicator is sending mixed signals for the moment. 
 SENSITIVE SECTORS If markets are rallying because the economy is on the mend, it stands to reason that the most economically sensitive stocks should fare best after a market bottom.
 The two sectors that have historically led market recoveries are technology and consumer discretionary stocks. 
 On average since 1974, the tech sector has gained 27.7 percent in the three months after a market bottom and consumer discretionary stocks have risen 23.3 percent in the same period, according to Ned Davis.
 Since March, technology has been one of the best performers, but consumer discretionary stocks are trailing the overall S.& P. A surge in the consumer sector would be expected, if the market has hit rock-bottom.
 STRENGTH OF THE DOLLAR A climb in the dollar against the euro for the remainder of this year would suggest that the Fed was nearly done trimming interest rates and that the economy was truly on the mend. 
 A strengthening dollar would also tell global investors that this could be a good time to invest in United States stock markets.
 ''If people get a double benefit because our markets are rising and our currency is improving,'' Mr. Turner said, ''it will only add interest in U.S. equities.'' 
 And that, in turn, would provide yet more support for a market rally.

 SUDAN QUELLS BOLD ATTACK 
 By Encroaching Rebels
 Darfurian rebels staged a bold attack in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. For the first time they spilled into the city's suburbs, a possible sign of new instability. Government forces managed to contain the rebels but only after after declaring a citywide curfew, deploying attack helicopters and hundreds of troops. Page 10
 RUNOFF IN ZIMBABWE
 Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's opposition, said that despite attacks on hundreds of his party's workers and fears for his own life, he would soon return home to face President Robert Mugabe in a runoff election. Insisting that he had been cheated in the earlier balloting, Mr. Tsvangirai said the runoff could end Mr. Mugabe's 28 years of control. PAGE 10

One of the six is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-professed planner of the attacks. PAGE 26

 A LEADER WHO MANAGED

 In ''Nixonland,'' George F.

 Viewers of ''The Daily Show'' rightfully consider Fareed Zakaria, above, a semiregular.

HEADLINE: Losing a Home, Then Losing All In Self-Storage

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. 

 BODY:
The foreclosure crisis is hitting yet another American locale: the self-storage center.
 As they lose their homes, people are turning to these humble cinderblock and sheet-metal boxes to store their stuff. But some people cannot keep up with their storage bills any better than they could handle their mortgage payments, and storage companies are auctioning off their property for a pittance.
 A cottage industry has developed to profit from these lost and abandoned items. The other day in this Chicago suburb, Stephanie Donahou and her son Marcus had only a moment to decide whether to bid on a unit in default. They could see a couch, a sewing machine, a fish tank, a washer and dryer, lots of Christmas wrapping paper, a television and other trappings of daily life. 
 ''This is someone's house,'' Mrs. Donahou said. Her bid, for $160, was the highest. Mr. Donahou was not impressed. ''Ma, you bought a junker,'' he said, rooting through the material. They began to fill their U-Haul. Good material they would auction on eBay; middling stuff would go to yard sales. 
 The auctioneer, Blair Auction & Appraisal, has been conducting sales at self-storage facilities in the Midwest for more than a decade. ''If a site used to have 10 auctions, these days it has 15 or 20,'' said Wayne Blair, the owner. At one site in Detroit, he auctioned off the contents of 45 units.
 Subprime mortgage loans had low ''teaser'' rates to lure borrowers. Many storage facilities offer the first month for free.
 ''You tell yourself, 'I'm only going to put my things in for a short time,' '' Mr. Blair said. ''Before you know it, you're behind. Then you have to pay penalties and interest. You owe $400 to $500. If you lost your job, you can't come up with that, not if you want to feed your family.'' 
 Nearly non-existent 35 years ago, self-storage has become ubiquitous, with 51,000 facilities nationwide. Even as the larger economy falters, the industry is flourishing. Executives say the mortgage crisis is one reason.
 Dean Jernigan, chief executive of the U-Store-It chain, says people generally rely on storage when they are dealing with major milestones: marriage or divorce, a relative's death, a job transfer or, in boom times, remodeling or building new homes. 
 Now he's adding foreclosure to the list. ''People are moving back down the property ladder,'' Mr. Jernigan said. 
 Bill Martin, a 50-year-old former manager in the technology industry, lost his house in the Southern California community of Lake Forest last August. His local self-storage company sent a truck and driver to pick up his things, a service it offers all new customers. 
 ''Storage has my hopes in it,'' said Mr. Martin, who sleeps on a foldout bed in his mother's guest room. ''I don't tell anyone this, but at least once a week I go over and look at my couch, my refrigerator, my TV stand, my mattress and realize I did have a life, and maybe there's a way to go back to it.''
 Investors agree that hard times for homeowners like Mr. Martin will yield good times for storage firms. U-Store-It's stock is up 33 percent this year. Extra Space is up 18 percent. Public Storage is up 18 percent.
 ''People might lose their home but they're not going to lose their things,'' said Charles Ray Wilson of Self Storage Data Services, a research firm.
 Yet some evidence suggests that is exactly what is happening. It is impossible to put precise numbers on the phenomenon, partly because the industry is highly fragmented -- the majority of facilities are locally owned -- and also because the topic is not one the industry cares to dwell on. But auctioneers who dispose of units in default, as well as the bidders who try to buy their contents, say they see increasing signs of strain. They note that more auctions involve people who appear to have had their homes foreclosed. 
 Fred Reger, an auctioneer in Washington and its suburbs, is seeing two trends, which he calls ''matching luggage'' and ''residential units.''
 The first means that he often sees a bunch of over-stuffed plastic bags when he opens a unit. ''People used to put their belongings in boxes,'' Mr. Reger said. ''But Hefties are a lot cheaper. These people came in under stress, which explains why they defaulted a few months later.''
 A ''residential unit'' is one where the renter tries to illegally live in the unit. ''We used to see one or two residential units a month,'' Mr. Reger said. ''Now I'm seeing 6 or 8 or 10. At one facility in D.C. the other day, we had three residentials.''
 Not every area is seeing an increase in auctions. Neal Grossman, who runs auctions at storage facilities in Ohio, said a higher percentage of storage customers are rescuing their possessions at the last minute.
 When renters default on their monthly payments, facilities replace the lock with one of their own. That way, the renter cannot come around at the last minute and empty out his unit.
 Mr. Grossman cut locks on 87 units in March but, as many people paid at the last minute, ended up auctioning only 21 of them in April. Both numbers were down from a year ago, he said, suggesting ''the worst is behind us.''
 In Chicago, on the other hand, the ranks of the dispossessed seem to be swelling. Storage facilities in Illinois that intend to auction off units in default must publish a legal notice alerting the owners. The suburban Daily Herald ran notices for 62 auctions in the Chicago metro area on a recent Monday, some of them involving more than 10 units.
 Brook Snyder runs the Chicago operation for Blair Auction. A good-humored 34-year-old with a penchant for bright shirts and three-day stubble, Mr. Snyder has made a career of delivering bad news: He has been an assistant to court officers doing evictions as well as a process server delivering legal papers to people being sued.
 ''I try to treat everyone with respect,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''Anyone can have hard times.''
 On auction days he drives from site to site, trailing a caravan of hopeful bidders. When everyone is assembled in front of a defaulted unit, he takes off the lock. Forbidden to enter or touch, bidders make offers based on a glimpse and well-honed instinct. The entire process is over in a moment.
 In three brisk days, Mr. Snyder held auctions at 23 U-Store-It facilities. At the first site, in Gurnee north of the city, he raised the door on an indoor unit, revealing what was essentially a one-room apartment: bed raised high, recumbent bicycle in the corner, file cabinet, vacuum cleaner and, for power, many extension cords. The contents sold for $675.
 The next warehouse, in Waukegan, brought a unit full of -- depending on how you look at it -- cherished household possessions or somebody's trash. Most of the bidders took the latter view, disdaining an offer. Tonya Boyd bought the bulging plastic bags for all of $6. ''It looks like someone had some troubles,'' said Ms. Boyd, an employment specialist. There were piles of clothes, brand-new women's shoes, old chairs, a dirty fan, kitchenware. 
 For some units, $6 is too much. ''A dollar bill, first dollar bill takes it,'' Mr. Snyder implored in front of one unit. ''Come on, this is everything they own!'' To no avail.
 This is the eternal mystery of self-storage. If the material was worth money, it was foolish to let it go to default. If it was not worth much, why spend at least $50 a month to store it?
 Mr. Jernigan, the U-Store-It executive, says budgets are stretched tight. ''People pay their cellphone, rent, credit card before they get down to their storage unit,'' he said.
 Self-storage site managers describe an irrational tendency in some clients. One said she had seen customers who lost their possessions at auction come back and rent another unit. Mr. Snyder said he had removed a lock from the same delinquent unit six times in one year. Five times the renter had paid up at the last minute; the sixth time, a few weeks ago, it was auctioned. 
 ''His luck ran out,'' Mr. Snyder said.

HEADLINE: 1958: The War of the Intellectuals

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO. 
Rachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
Much has been made of 1968 -- the student uprisings in Paris, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the full flowering of youth culture. But what of its more unassuming antecedent, 1958? Fifty years ago, Eisenhower was in the White House, the country was in a recession and the American intellectual scene was crackling with energy. 
 The year saw the advent of everything from Chuck Berry's ''Johnny B. Goode'' and Dr. Seuss' ''Yertle the Turtle'' to ''Doctor Zhivago'' by Boris Pasternak, that year's Nobel laureate in literature; the first American edition of Vladimir Nabokov's ''Lolita''; Truman Capote's ''Breakfast at Tiffany's''; John Kenneth Galbraith's ''Affluent Society''; Philip Roth's story ''Goodbye, Columbus''; and Jack Kerouac's ''Dharma Bums'' -- not to mention Samuel Beckett's ''Krapp's Last Tape,'' Harold Pinter's ''Birthday Party,'' Alfred Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' and Orson Welles's ''Touch of Evil.'' Robert Frank captured the uncertain tenor of the time in his 1958 photography book, ''The Americans,'' as did Jasper Johns in his 1958 painting ''Three Flags,'' in which he superimposed three American flags, each smaller than the next, transforming the familiar into the abstract, the iconic into the unsettled. 
 It's hard to generalize about any historical moment, but in the intellectual journals of the era, some central themes emerge: a debate over the merits of the Beat movement, and the attempt by some influential critics to preserve the quickly dissolving distinctions among highbrow, middlebrow and lowbrow culture that had previously held sway. At the same time, the distinction between artistic achievement and commercial success, which American intellectuals had long assumed to be mutually exclusive, was losing its hold.
 From their redoubts at ''little magazines'' like Partisan Review and Commentary -- whose cultural authority far surpassed their low circulation -- writers like Leslie Fiedler, Dwight Macdonald, Norman Podhoretz and Lionel Trilling were trying, in their different ways, to preserve the idea of serious literature against the rising tide of mass culture. ''The '50s really was a period when to be a highbrow meant that you had to really have problems with middlebrow and lowbrow and commercial culture,'' said Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard and a staff writer at The New Yorker who is writing a cultural history of the cold war. Among the intellectuals, for example, ''there was a feeling the Beats were not serious,'' Menand said. And back then, ''serious'' was the benchmark of high praise. 
 When Kerouac's impressionistic second novel, ''The Dharma Bums,'' hit the scene one year after ''On the Road,'' Allen Ginsberg called it an ''extraordinary mystic testament,'' a ''record of various inner signposts on the road to understanding of the Illusion of Being.'' In ''the present American scene in prose,'' Ginsberg wrote in The Village Voice, Kerouac was ''the great master innovator.'' But ''don't expect much understanding from academic journalists,'' he warned, ''who, for all their pretense at civilization, have learned little but wicked opinion.''
 The critics seemed eager to live up to this billing. In the Book Review, the novelist Nancy Wilson Ross praised Kerouac's descriptions of food and nature but found his ''philosophical final statement'' in a contemporary ''autobiographical sketch'' -- ''I don't know. I don't care. And it doesn't make any difference'' -- ''curiously juvenile.'' Was Beat rebellion in the exuberant American tradition of Whitman and Emerson, some wondered, or was it a kind of anti-intellectualism and abdication of adult responsibility? As Time magazine wrote in a review of a 1958 anthology, ''The Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men,'' ''are these self-appointed spokesmen for the 20th-century young moving in a quest for meaning, or a flight from it?'' 
 The highbrow New York intellectuals were even harsher in their assessment. They found the Beats intellectually bankrupt and politically incoherent. In ''The Know-Nothing Bohemians,'' an essay in Partisan Review, the young Norman Podhoretz wrote that ''the Beat generation's worship of primitivism and spontaneity is more than a cover for hostility to intelligence; it arises from a pathetic poverty of feeling as well.'' Podhoretz detected a ''suppressed cry'' of ''brutality'' in the Beats, which he summarized as ''kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time, kill those incomprehensible characters who are capable of getting seriously involved with a woman, a job, a cause.'' 
 Yet for all their differences, the Beats and their intellectual critics were both in open rebellion against middlebrow culture and values, which Dwight Macdonald saw epitomized by the Book of the Month Club and the New York Times best-seller list. In the January 1958 issue of Commentary, Macdonald wrote a scathing critique of James Gould Cozzens's ''By Love Possessed,'' a literary romance set in small-town Pennsylvania that spent months atop the best-seller list (replacing ''Peyton Place''). ''He is a 'serious' writer, and never more serious than in this book,'' Macdonald wrote with scorn. ''That so uncompromising a work, written in prose of an artificiality and complexity that approaches the impenetrable -- indeed often achieves it -- that this should have become what the publishers gloatingly call 'a runaway best-seller' is something new.'' 
 Macdonald went on to accuse Cozzens of anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism and a lack of awareness for ''the real nature of his characters.'' Praise from distinguished literary reviewers like Howard Nemerov in The Nation, Richard Ellmann in The Reporter and Brendan Gill in The New Yorker indicated a ''general lowering of standards,'' Macdonald wrote. In his view, Cozzens's critical success also marked ''the latest episode in the Middlebrow Counter-Revolution,'' in which critics were rebelling against the exclusive elitism and ''destructive superiority'' of the avant-garde and trying to connect more with popular taste. ''The requirements of the mass market explain a good deal of bad writing today,'' Macdonald continued. ''But such reviews, such enthusiasm, such unanimity, such nonsense!'' 
 Macdonald would go on to defend this line even more vigorously in his 1960 essay ''Masscult and Midcult,'' an exhaustive taxonomy of the American cultural scene, from high literature to middlebrow magazines to low arts like television. This was a moment of uncertainty for critics. The leveling process taking place in the culture ''destroys all values, since value judgments require discrimination, an ugly word in liberal-democratic America,'' Macdonald wrote. Masscult, he added, ''is very, very democratic; it refuses to discriminate against or between anything or anybody.'' 
 Macdonald wasn't the only one weighing in on this transition. In ''The Un-Angry Young Men,'' an essay in the British monthly Encounter in 1958, Leslie Fiedler wrote that American popular culture ''has never been in a duller or less promising condition.'' Meanwhile, ''everyone, and not least the highbrows, wants to read about popular culture'' -- to the point that ''the study of popular culture threatens itself to become a branch of popular culture.'' American sensibility, he argued, needed to rebel against something, starting with the snobbish intellectualism of the critics. (Fiedler later wrote admiring essays on pop cultural subjects including ''Tarzan of the Apes,'' comic strips and horror films, while Macdonald wrote a movie column for Esquire.)
 Of course, momentous things were happening outside the journals, too. NASA was founded in 1958, and something else came along that year: integrated circuitry, which paved the way for the microchip, then the personal computer, then the Internet -- which collapsed all the old cultural hierarchies. In today's blog-crazy culture, everyone's a critic. What would Dwight Macdonald say? 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An essay on May 11 about the American intellectual scene in 1958 referred incorrectly to Jack Kerouac's ''Dharma Bums,'' published that year. It was his fourth novel, not the second. It followed ''The Town and the City'' (1950), ''On the Road'' (1957) and ''The Subterraneans'' (also 1958)

HEADLINE: A Buyer's Guide to Inventions, in Plain English

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
INVENTORS and companies like to court each other. Inventors need companies to move their ideas forward, and companies need inventions to help their businesses grow. But suitors sometimes have trouble finding that perfect partner. Now a Web-based service under development, the USA National Innovation Marketplace, offers a new tool intended to help with the matchmaking. 
 The marketplace is an online registry that will have descriptions of inventions for browsing by prospective buyers. But it will have an unusual twist: before inventions are listed, the registry will provide in-person or online workshops to help inventors recast their often technical prose in jargon-free descriptions for the business and industrial customers that are expected to shop at the site. 
 The registry and its translation service are the brainchild of Doug Hall, chief executive of Eureka Ranch Technology, a consulting firm in Cincinnati. It has developed workshops over the last five years for transforming the language of patent abstracts and other arcana into simpler prose.
 Mr. Hall said listings for the marketplace would have prose makeovers to ensure quick, easy perusal by the intended readership. ''Most people in business simply don't have the time and resources to translate the language of difficult-to-understand technologies into real products that consumers will buy,'' he said. ''It's one of the business buyer's biggest problems.''
 The listings will have other improvements, too, he said. Company software will evaluate the invention's probable cost to the buyer before the first sale as well as other business angles, and add the information to the capsule description.
 Inventors will pay a fee for the listing of no more than $2,000, Mr. Hall said. The registry, which will be at www.planeteureka.com, will not open officially until April 2009, but Mr. Hall says he has received many inquiries both from prospective buyers and sellers.
 Lesa Mitchell, a vice president at the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., says she thinks the registry has tremendous possibilities. ''Mr. Hall understands that there is a lot of innovation lying dormant that could be packaged so that the commercial marketplace could understand it,'' she said. ''Businesspeople don't have the time or patience to reformat and translate technical information. And we don't have enough translators in this space.'' 
 Post-doctoral researchers at American universities might benefit from a service like Mr. Hall's, she said. ''We have an abundance of scientific expertise that is not necessarily attached to industry,'' she said. ''We need to support them in developing their translational skills to get the benefit from the research funding that we have in the U.S. economy.''
 Many geographic regions, too, might be helped by simply worded listings of inventions.
 ''In larger hubs like Boston, entrepreneurs work closely with university scientists and local industries,'' she said. But far from large cities, it's a different story. ''There are many dormant innovations that haven't been harvested by entrepreneurs,'' she said.
 Mr. Hall's partner in developing and refining content for the registry will be a nationwide group of organizations that participate in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a Commerce Department program aimed at helping manufacturers, including small and midsize businesses. For instance, M.E.P. centers in Utah, Washington, and Virginia will offer Mr. Hall's workshops this year. Small companies that have products they want larger companies to commercialize are particularly interested in attending, Mr. Hall said, as well as independent inventors and university researchers in need of industrial partners.
 Inventors can sign up at the Planet Eureka Web site. ''When we are in their region, we will notify them so they have a chance to attend a translation workshop,'' he said. Eventually, he plans to provide online training at the Web site. 
 SMALL and midsize businesses connected to the project through local M.E.P. centers will get the first crack at inspecting inventions, for the initial 100 days. After that, the listings will be wide open. Mr. Hall is seeking buyers as well as sellers, with advice from his advisory panel, which includes Best Buy and Future Works, a division of Procter & Gamble. 
 Sandy Johnson, chief executive of the Mid-America Manufacturing Technology Center in Overland Park, Kan., which receives some M.E.P. funding, wants to use the registry's services to help small manufacturing concerns in Kansas. 
 ''A business may have a brilliant idea,'' she said, ''but if they need a small piece of technology to make it work, it's virtually impossible to find right now,'' because of incomprehensible descriptions.
 But there are times when clear writing is not the solution. To protect their ideas, Mr. Hall said, inventors planning a listing at the marketplace should first file a preliminary patent. If they don't, a bit of concealment is in order, he said.
 ''They should leave out key procedural details in the description,'' he said, ''and just tell the benefit.''

HEADLINE: You Can't Make This Stuff Up, or Can You?

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR a long time, I spent my days as an independent producer by morning, a law professor by afternoon and a dog fancier by night. I would hatch ideas for television shows and movies, take them to studios and pitch them and, once in a while, some kindly soul would buy one and, even more rarely, one would be made.
 My son is just now finishing his first year of college. People ask me what I would like for him to do. I always say, ''Whatever the dear boy would like to do.'' But in my heart, I would like for him to be a real-life counterpart of a character on my latest imaginary TV series brainchild: ''The Hedges of Greenwich, Conn.'' (It sounds a bit like ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' no?) 
 This is my hypothetical series about powerful hedge fund traders and private equity players in Greenwich, whose wealth is so immense that they can live like maharajahs. But far more important, they have so much money -- put up by Harvard and Yale endowments, among others, and then magnified by leverage -- that they can plunge world markets into turmoil. 
 In my first episode, a cagey old trader and wheeler-dealer who lives in splendor surrounded by his German short-haired pointers and his cats, is about to be visited by his mysterious young mistress. Little does he know, she is about to give him a shot of lead because his private equity fund bought, ripped, stripped and flipped her father's company in Lima, Ohio, putting her father out of a job and driving her mother to suicide. His son, meanwhile, is plotting to sell short the bonds his father issued, putting his father's whole empire in jeopardy.
 You see the many directions in which my febrile brain goes, and all because nice people have asked me why the high price of oil does not act the way that Econ 101 says it should: by suppressing consumption, bringing on new supplies and lowering the price. Here's why: the Hedges of Greenwich.
 Look at oil and gasoline and natural gas. They have immense uses as consumer products. They power our cars. They heat our homes and our swimming pools. When their prices rise here in the United States, drivers, homeowners and swimmers cut back on the use of these fuels.
 But there is much more to the story than that. First, the price we pay is denominated in dollars, and as the dollar falls, the price in dollars rises. Buyers who pay in euros or won do not see the same price appreciation because their currencies have been rising against the dollar. Hence, the commodity in question may be higher in dollars -- suppressing demand here -- but may be barely changed in euros day to day. This is one reason that worldwide demand is not much affected. 
 In fact, demand for some energy sources is softening ever so slightly in the United States, but world demand continues strongly upward.
 This has little to do with the oil companies -- usually called the ''big'' oil companies to distinguish them from the small oil companies we all have in our backyards. They just float along with the tide, the way we consumers do. They are at the mercy of the traders, as we all are.
 And consumer prices, when left to themselves, are behaving more or less the way prices are supposed to -- rationing supply and adjusting demand.
 But there is another hugely important factor now in world energy markets: the pricing of energy as a speculative item. Traders can and do buy vast amounts of energy futures. Right now, there is a worldwide mania to invest in them. In this situation, when investors and traders are pouring buckets of money into thimbles of energy quanta, to use a phrase from my pal Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, the price is bid higher and higher.
 And, as the price goes up, demand does not fall. It rises, because investors and traders think that it will keep rising and they will make money on it in the future. (Oil, gasoline and natural gas can be stored indefinitely.) 
 It's like the bubble in Miami Beach condominiums. As the price of them soared, traders did not stay away. Instead, they kept buying, anticipating more or less endless gains.
 Right now, the Hedges of Greenwich are bidding up the prices of hydrocarbons into the stratosphere by buying energy futures. Your switching from a Cadillac to a Prius won't tilt the balance back to falling energy prices. Your earnest little efforts at conservation mean nothing when compared with the upward push coming from the speculative bubble.
 And now the big boys have been joined by you and me. Little folks like us can buy our very own energy baskets of exchange-traded funds and the like, and are doing so in big numbers. 
 Now, the alert reader will notice two truths at this point: One, bubbles always end, and almost always end badly. So will this one. There is always some supposed reason that ''this time is different,'' but it never is. Second, the fact that small players are getting into the game is almost always a sign that the end of the bubble is near.
 This will be good news for us drivers, homeowners and swimmers. But it will be bad news for those who thought that buying baskets of commodities would make them rich.
 OH, and how will the bubble end? When the crafty old guy with the German short-haired pointers is recovering from his gunshot wounds and wakes up, calls in his associates and says, ''Boys, it's time to sell.'' The word flies from the Bentley dealer to the yacht harbor, and, pretty soon, light Brent crude is in full meltdown.
 But what's this? Somehow the equally cagey son found out and bought puts -- hmm, how did he know? Was the source his father's seemingly caring nurse? And why does she look so much like the mistress who shot him?

HEADLINE: Arriving in London: Hotels Made in China

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
TRAVELODGE, one of the largest budget hotel chains in Britain, is a company in a hurry.
 Founded in 1985, it operates 330 hotels throughout Britain and has plans to build 40 more a year for the next 12 years.
 ''We plan to take 10 percent share of the U.K. hotel market by 2020,'' said Shula Gillam, a spokeswoman for the company, which was bought in 2006 by Dubai International Capital for about $1.4 billion. (The Travelodge chain in the United States is under separate ownership.)
 It is also Travelodge's goal to be the biggest hotelier in London during the 2012 Summer Olympics, with 7,000 rooms in and around the city. ''Our expansion plans are very aggressive,'' she said. 
 Indeed, the company recently announced that it would pay a fee to anyone who helps it find a site for a new hotel. The reward is $:500 (or about $1,000) for each room that is ultimately built, to a maximum of $300,000. (The average Travelodge has 100 rooms, according to Paul Harvey, the company's director of property and development.)
 Ms. Gillam said that ''we want to know about every possible site that we could potentially build a hotel on.'' 
 Since the offer was made last fall, ''hundreds and hundreds'' of tips have come in, according to Ms. Gillam, 10 of which are being seriously considered.
 Once the company finds a location, it turns to a construction partner with equally aggressive plans: Verbus Systems, a London-based company that builds rooms in metal containers in factories near Shenzhen, China, and delivers them ready to be stacked into buildings up to 16 stories tall.
 Verbus Systems' commercial director, Paul Rollett, said his company ''can build a 300-room hotel anywhere on the planet in 20 weeks.'' 
 Right now, Verbus is working on two Travelodge hotels: one in the Uxbridge neighborhood of West London, with 120 rooms, and another near Heathrow Airport, with 307. The Uxbridge hotel is scheduled to open in August, and the Heathrow hotel in December, according to Ms. Gillam.
 The Uxbridge rooms are already in place; the Heathrow rooms, Mr. Rollett said, ''are finished and on a ship headed for England.''
 When they arrive at Heathrow, the containers will be hoisted into place by crane. The containers, which are as large as 12 by 47 feet, will support one another just as they do when they are crossing the ocean by ship, Mr. Rollett said. No additional structure is necessary.
 But, he noted, the two London hotels were designed by Travelodge before it decided to use the prefabricated rooms, so both buildings have steel structures that won't be necessary in future modular hotels.
 Even so, he said, the Uxbridge hotel is being built for about $10 million, not the $12 million it would have cost without prefabrication. For larger hotels, he said, economies of scale make the cost difference even more dramatic.
 The cost and time savings ''translate into lower-priced rooms for consumers,'' Mr. Harvey said. When the Uxbridge hotel opens, rooms will start at about $:30, or around $60 a night. (Rates at Travelodges range from roughly $:20 to $:100, or $40 to $200, Mr. Harvey said.)
 Barckley Sumner, a spokesman for the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians in Britain, said he was ''appalled'' that Travelodge was shipping construction jobs overseas.
 But Mr. Rollett said that there was a shortage of skilled construction workers in Britain. ''If the rooms weren't being built in China, we would just have to bring the Chinese laborers to the U.K.,'' he said.
 Mr. Harvey said: ''The bigger perspective is that building hotels this way enables us to build more hotels, more quickly, and when we've got more hotels we provide more direct employment to local communities. We believe from an employment perspective, it's a positive, not a negative.''
 Travelodge expects to use the modular technique for about half of the 40 or so new hotels it plans to build each year, Mr. Harvey said. The modular system could also help in creating temporary hotels, which would be built for music festivals or sporting events and later disassembled, he added.
 Travelodge is not the first hotel company to try modular construction. In the United States, Holiday Inn and Marriott, among others, have experimented with modular buildings over the years, according to Simon Dragan, the president of Whitley Manufacturing, a modular construction company in South Whitley, Ind. Mr. Dragan said his own company had decided not to build hotels. ''I looked into it,'' he said, ''but decided to stay out because that business is too cyclical -- feast or famine.'' 
 But DeLuxe Building Systems, a modular construction company in Berwick, Pa., has recently completed modular hotels in Holtsville and Harrison, N.Y., both of which operate as Hampton Inns.
 DeLuxe, which builds its rooms in wooden frames, not steel containers, employs union workers at its factory in Pennsylvania. Jeff Myers, the company's sales manager, said he was aware of Verbus's outsourcing.
 ''It's probably not a bad business model,'' he said, ''but it's not our business model. I guess everybody has their niche.''
 DON CARLSON, the editor and publisher of Automated Builder, a trade magazine based in Ventura, Calif., said that in hotels, ''modular is definitely the wave of the future.'' Modular buildings, he said, are stronger, and more soundproof, because stacking units -- each a fully enclosed room -- ''gives you double walls, double floors, double everything.''
 Mr. Rollett agreed, saying that with the steel shipping container approach, ''You could have a party in your room, and people in the next room wouldn't hear a thing.'' Mr. Rollett said that this was less of a selling point in the United States, where travelers were accustomed to ''stick built'' hotels with thin walls. He said that he had met with several American hotel operators but had yet to make a sale.
 He is working with his British clients, which, he said, include a Travelodge competitor, Premier Inn, to make the best possible use of the assembly-line method. ''We're increasing the degree of modularity,'' he said, noting that the latest units come with fully fitted bathrooms and ''even the paint on the walls.''
 The only thing they don't have, he said, ''is the girl to put a chocolate on your pillow.''

HEADLINE: The Dollar: Shrinkable But (So Far) Unsinkable

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
If the United States were any other country, these would surely be days of panic and austerity in Washington. With debts spiraling higher, a trade deficit exceeding $700 billion a year, and its currency plunging for years, the government would be forced to cut spending and jack up interest rates in a frantic bid to attract investment.
 But the United States is not any other country. For more than half a century, Americans have enjoyed a unique privilege in the global economy: The dollar has been the world's dominant currency, the money used in most transactions and the repository for the national savings of many countries, including China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. 
 Come what may -- a financial crisis here, a military misadventure there -- Americans could count on money sloshing up thick on their shores. Virtually limitless demand for American government bonds has supported the dollar's value, and kept domestic interest rates down. Americans have been emboldened to spend in blissful disregard of their debts, secure that foreigners would always supply finance. And that devil-may-care spending has in turn fueled economic growth around the world. 
 This dynamic may be so deeply embedded in the workings of the global economy that it could endure for many years to come: The costs of weaning the United States from its credit habit would ripple far and wide.
 But what are the chances that a day of reckoning is coming, when the dollar would be so weak that America would have to play by the rules that apply to every other country? Recent signs do suggest some fraying in the American relationship with its many foreign creditors. The balance of trade has gotten so lopsided and the question marks hovering over the American economy so thick that some foreign governments are beginning to hedge their bets on the dollar. 
 Russia has been diversifying its hoard of foreign exchange, plunking more into other currencies like the rising euro. In the oil-drenched Middle East, signs suggest a slight shifting to other flavors of money. And markets have been parsing every utterance from Beijing for hints that China may moderate its voracious appetite for dollars.
 Meanwhile, China, Russia and Middle Eastern nations have been injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into state-controlled investment pools known as sovereign wealth funds, which have mandates to seek out better gains on their capital than they get from American government bonds.
 ''These central banks know that holding these low-yielding Treasury bills is just an aid program to the United States, and they want to get out of that business,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. ''They are very keen to diversify.'' 
 Over all, dollars have never been purchased in as large quantities. But, that said, the dollar has been slipping as a percentage of total foreign currency reserves, as nations increasingly sock away other currencies as well, to cushion themselves against crisis. Between 2001 and the end of 2007, the dollar's share of the world's total foreign exchange reserves shrank from about 73 percent to 64 percent, as the euro expanded from about 18 percent to more than 25 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
 That change does not reflect a selling of dollars, the monetary fund reports. Rather, it captures how the dollar has fallen in value against many currencies, making the total value of dollars a smaller percentage of all money. ''It hasn't been an active diversification,'' said John Lipsky, first deputy managing director at the fund. ''Central bankers tend to be the most conservative investors. Whatever they do is going to be done with exceeding caution.'' 
 Now, however, people in international financial circles detect a subtle shifting of the ground in confidence about the dollar. A few years ago, the suggestion that another currency could rival the dollar would have been ridiculed. Today, some economists say the dollar could begin surrendering some of the advantages of dominance to the euro over the next decade or two. Longer term, the dollar could find itself eclipsed by China's yuan as the primary money in usage in the world.
 For Americans, losing that status could be painful, sending interest rates higher and raising the costs of buying homes and cars. A country that has been operating with essentially unlimited credit might have learn to live within a budget.
 But many economists say that chatter about the demise of the dollar is overblown. The United States, despite its problems, has been a remarkably solid place to put money, making it singularly able to attract savings, they point out. The dollar is likely to continue to shed value, and the American economy will grow far slower than India's and China's, they acknowledge. Yet the dollar, they argue, remains one of the few entities that seem to have fundamental staying power in an age of risk and obsolescence. The size of the United States military alone reinforces confidence that America will endure to honor its debts.
 Yes, foreigners have been lending alarming amounts of money to Americans, who have spent extravagantly in excess of their means, economists say. One day, balance will be restored in line with the basic laws of economics -- perhaps chaotically, and probably via a substantial fall in the dollar's value. 
 But ''one day'' could well get pushed into the future for a long time to come, for the simple reason that codependence governs the global economy: The current flows of capital lubricate world commerce, giving the American consumer the wherewithal to keep buying; those purchases, in turn, generate business and employment from Asia to Latin America.
 When Americans head to the mall, backed by foreign largesse, they drive there burning gasoline made from oil pumped abroad, notably the Middle East. They drive home carrying electronics and clothing churned out in Chinese and Japanese factories. Making these goods absorbs commodities -- energy from Australia and Africa; cotton from Texas and California; iron ore from Brazil and India.
 Keeping this global assembly line humming has become a primary development strategy for China, as it continues a wrenching transformation from a predominantly agricultural nation into a rapidly industrializing trading power whose factories employ millions of poor farmers streaming toward cities. 
 China subsidizes many factories, handing out low-interest loans and making land available at below-market prices. Buying up United States Treasury bills helps goose production: China's central bank buys dollars in part to keep the yuan valued lower, making Chinese goods cheaper on world markets. And by helping keep interest rates lower in the United States, China ensures that American consumers can keep buying. 
 The Chinese ''recognize that they have to lend us the money if they want to maintain those markets,'' said Michael P. Dooley, an economist and a partner in Cabezon Capital, a hedge fund specializing in emerging markets.
 China's leaders fear anything that threatens to crimp exports; that would eliminate jobs and send angry peasants back to their villages. So, with more than $1 trillion already invested in dollar-denominated assets, China is loath to do anything that could drive the dollar down precipitously. If it started selling dollars, that could trigger a panic that would send the dollar plummeting. 
 But some analysts wonder how much longer China can continue to win at this game. Investing money in the United States requires spending that much less on enormous problems at home, like pollution and a shortage of health care. By indirectly making mortgages cheap in the United States, China has helped foster the boom that saturated Miami with glittering condos even as tens of millions of Chinese live in dilapidated concrete block apartments.
 On this side of the Pacific, the great real estate bonanza has, of course, ended badly. Some economists point to the real estate bubble as a prime example of the dangers of too much cheap money washing in: Speculators drive prices sky-high, setting markets up for a punishing fall. 
 ''You can have too much of a good thing,'' said Brad Setser, a former Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations. In this view, if the dollar maintains its status as the global reserve currency, that would be good news for Americans only in the way that another offer for a credit card is good news for a family about to land in bankruptcy: It may stave off foreclosure for another spell, but it makes the ultimate day of reckoning that much worse.
 ''We continue to run deficits, and a larger share of our income goes to support this,'' Mr. Setser said. ''Our attitude seems to be, 'Lord give us the strength to resist temptation, but not quite yet.' ''

HEADLINE: Information That Doesn't Come Freely

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
NINA BERNSTEIN, a Times reporter, wrote a front-page article last June about the deaths of prisoners in the fastest-growing form of incarceration in America, immigration detention.
 Civil rights attorneys believed that, since the start of 2004, about 20 people had died while in custody facing possible deportation, but a spokeswoman for the federal immigration agency told Bernstein a surprising fact: the number was 62. Bernstein asked for details, like who they were and how they died. The spokeswoman refused, so Bernstein did what reporters often do -- she filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, known as FOIA, for what she believed should be public records. Although the law required the agency to answer such a simple request within 20 business days, Immigration and Customs Enforcement initially responded the way many agencies do -- with silence. 
 Bernstein, who has a busy beat, immigration in the New York area, wrote her article without the details and moved on. But months later, right around Thanksgiving, she received an envelope containing a chart listing the people who had died in immigration detention -- now 66 of them -- with their dates of birth and death, the locations where they had been held, where they had died and the causes of death. Her FOIA request had been granted. That led Bernstein to a front-page article published last Monday about Boubacar Bah, a 52-year-old tailor from Guinea, who fell while in detention, received no medical care for 15 hours and died of severe head injuries.
 Times reporters use FOIA aggressively, and it has been central to two major stories in just the last three weeks -- Bernstein's and an article by David Barstow on April 20 about a Pentagon program to cozy up to military analysts on television and radio in hopes of generating favorable coverage of the administration's war on terror. But it is increasingly difficult to pry records that should be open out of federal agencies. A study last year by the Coalition of Journalists for Open Government found that FOIA requests were becoming more backlogged, waits for information were getting longer and agencies were saying ''no'' more often, using one of nine exemptions in the law for such considerations as national security or privacy.
 Though late, at least Bernstein got records without having to go to court. The Times was not so fortunate in Barstow's case, which seemed to show that an agency that does not want to obey the law can find a million creative ways to delay coughing up information that the public has a clear right to know.
 Barstow first asked more than two years ago, on April 28, 2006, for records describing the Defense Department's involvement with the analysts, most of them retired officers, many with business dealings with the Pentagon. He said he wanted transcripts of briefings and conference calls, records of trips and any documents describing the Pentagon's strategy and objectives in what turned out to be a carefully planned program to try to, as Barstow's article said, ''transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse.''
 As the law provides, he asked for expedited handling of his request. He was turned down, though he said the Pentagon did not tell him for a month after the decision. It said the information he wanted did not deal with ''a breaking news story of public interest.''
 Barstow appealed, arguing that the war on terror was by definition a breaking news story and certainly of public interest. The appeal was denied on Aug. 20, 2006, with bizarre reasoning familiar to anyone who has tried to wrest public information from a federal agency that does not want it released. ''Your request is not for information on the war on terror,'' the denial said. ''It is for Department of Defense interactions with military and security analysts who discuss the war on terror. Therefore, you did not establish a compelling need for the information you requested.''
 Barstow kept pressing and two months later received 687 pages of documents, mostly, he said, talking points and other briefing documents representing only a small portion of what he had requested.
 A long succession of phone calls and written appeals, some from David McCraw, a vice president and assistant general counsel for The New York Times Company, prompted a trickle of additional material. Last summer, the Pentagon gave Barstow transcripts of briefings received by the analysts, with large portions blacked out. Barstow appealed the deletions, saying it was ''ludicrous'' to withhold material disclosed to selected representatives of the news media in a briefing. Two months later, the Pentagon relented -- and on the same day gave Barstow another transcript, of a briefing with Donald Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, with more deletions.
 The Times, committed to spending resources on important FOIA matters even during a time of economic stress for newspapers, took the Pentagon to court last fall. Under the supervision of a federal district judge, Richard J. Sullivan, The Times and an assistant United States attorney representing the Pentagon agreed to deadlines for producing the records Barstow wanted. The Pentagon kept missing the deadlines.
 At a hearing in February, Sullivan said the Pentagon was playing ''cute'' and refused to give any more extensions. ''Two years is a long time,'' he said. But in April, the parties were back in his courtroom, with the Pentagon pleading for more time. Sullivan was having none of it. ''My orders have been issued since November,'' he said. ''I am not used to having to do this five or six times.'' The judge threatened to bring Pentagon officials into court ''to explain the delay and why they shouldn't be held in contempt.''
 With the records it had already obtained, The Times published Barstow's article the following Sunday. Three days later, the Pentagon gave Barstow 2,800 more pages. His reporting continues. FOIA, he told me, has become ''a cruel joke.''
 Late last year, Congress passed the Open Government Act of 2007, with the intention of forcing better compliance with FOIA and heading off situations like Bernstein's and Barstow's. (Full disclosure: I testified in favor of the law as a representative of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of 10 news organizations.) President Bush signed it on the last day of the year, but his administration quickly set about trying to dismantle one of its key features, an independent ombudsman who could mediate FOIA disputes before they turn into expensive lawsuits, like the one The Times is still pursuing. 
 The administration proposed no financing for the new office and tried to move its responsibilities to the Justice Department, which defends agencies trying to withhold information. Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and John Cornyn of Texas wrote to the White House last week to protest the transfer of the ombudsman, saying it would violate the law. 
 Leahy is a liberal Democrat and Cornyn is a conservative Republican, and while they do not agree on a lot of issues, they agree that bad things can happen when a government tries to hide the records of its actions.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Are Up and Politicians Are Angry. Yawn.

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
There is seemingly no more combustible mix than high oil prices and a hotly contested election. With gasoline closing in on $4 a gallon, Washington is awash in proposals to bring down prices -- once more turning the energy debate into political football. 
 There have been calls for a gasoline tax ''holiday'' this summer, cries to force OPEC to pump more oil (or else!), appeals by President Bush to allow ''environmentally friendly'' drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and demands to tax Big Oil's billion-dollar-plus profits. 
 But what can the White House, Congress or competing presidential candidates do to reduce gas prices in the near term? The short answer, alas, is not much. 
 No industrialized economy is as reliant on oil, or as obsessed with gasoline prices, as the United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil. But the oil market is largely immune to Washington's machinations, and prices have more than quadrupled over the last six years for reasons that are increasingly disconnected from what happens in the United States. 
 The reality is that oil is a globally traded commodity, and Americans must pay international prices to get their share. And those prices reflect the fact that global supplies are stretched and struggling to meet a booming demand that is being driven by growth in developing countries, notably China and India. This has left the world with a very slim cushion of extra production.
 ''Gasoline prices have reached the boiling point in political terms,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. ''But you have to look at the root causes of this. Spare capacity is very tight. And a very tight market is very vulnerable to crises.''
 Geopolitics have played a big part in the steep price increases. Nigeria remains in the grips of a militant insurgency bent on crippling its oil industry. The Middle East is mired in familiar crises and conflicts. Oil traders say they fear a possible interruption of Iran's oil exports or terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia's vast oil industry. 
 Then there is Iraq. On the eve of the war, five years ago, oil was trading at about $30 a barrel. On Friday, it closed at $125.96 a barrel. Over that period, Iraq's oil production has been stuck at about 2.2 million barrels a day, far below its potential. 
 These factors have build ''an almost-permanent security premium'' into the price of oil, Mr. Yergin said.
 Dealing with these complex issues is beyond the scope of the current political debate, which in an election year is focused on the immediate concerns of voters. But, election or not, the nation's energy debate has rarely resulted in a coherent policy. Oil imports have been rising for the past three decades, for instance, while fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks are the lowest among industrialized nations. Attempts to develop biofuels are being blamed for higher food prices.
 In the long term, there are only two ways to reduce prices: boost supplies or reduce demand. The country's energy policy does exactly the opposite: it encourages consumption by keeping energy taxes low and discourages exploiting new supplies because of environmental concerns and not-in-my-backyard political objections. 
 ''Politicians talk a strong game on energy policy,'' said David G. Victor, the director of the program on energy and sustainable development at Stanford University. But, ''they focus on bromides like 'energy independence' that poll well yet are meaningless or harmful in practice. And then the political system dithers on action that would yield real leverage on oil consumption.'' 
 Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, estimated that the nation's oil import bill would probably reach $450 billion this year, up from $120 billion in 2002. ''Our energy policy is bankrupt,'' he said. ''It is not prudent any more to ignore the supply side of the equation.''
 In recent weeks, some analysts have started to talk about prices rising to $200 a barrel. But not everyone is so glum. Some experts say that today's prices have resulted from a speculative bubble that is increasingly disconnected from reality. Energy economists at Lehman Brothers argue, for instance, that oil prices are just as likely to fall to $80 a barrel as they are to rise to $200 a barrel.
 The investment bank predicts that supplies will increase as a result of new offshore discoveries and that the huge growth in demand from China will begin to slow.
 ''We're going to see a real falloff in global demand just as the outlook for energy supplies is getting more robust,'' said Edward Morse, the chief energy economist at Lehman.
 Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, said that if today's higher prices are the result of a speculative bubble, then Congress should raise the bar on how much money investors must set aside before trading oil contracts, and beef up regulatory oversight of some commodity markets. 
 Since investment funds have placed a lot of money in commodities, raising the margin requirements to trade oil, which Congress is currently considering, would discourage speculation. ''That is fundamental to how markets work,'' said Roger Diwan, an energy analysts at PFC Energy, a Washington-based consulting firm. ''Every other measure is knee-jerk.''
 One proposal Democrats and Republicans could agree on is to insist that the Bush administration stop filling the strategic oil reserves. This month alone, the Energy Department will add 3.8 million barrels to the strategic stocks. That's not a big amount -- representing just 0.6 percent of the 635 million barrels that will be consumed this month in the country. But with triple-digit oil prices, every drop counts.
 The Bush administration has always refused to use the strategic reserves to increase the supply in order to lower oil prices, preferring instead to safeguard the reserves in case supply shortages result from a geopolitical crisis or a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005.
 Another factor in the steep rise in prices has been the slump in the value of the dollar, which recently plummeted to $1.60 against the euro. 
 ''Oil has become a financial asset,'' Mr. Yergin said. ''People are hedging against a falling dollar by buying oil and that hits the price. The most important thing that could be done would be for the dollar to rebound. But that is not something you can legislate.''

HEADLINE: Big Rescues Can Work. Just Ask New York.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AS the great American credit crash continues to reverberate, we still have nothing that resembles an intelligent and comprehensive plan for dealing with mass foreclosures and the economic consequences associated with the debacle. 
 Democrats in the House passed two bills on Thursday that would have the government insure up to $300 billion in mortgages to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. It would also provide $15 billion to states to buy and renovate foreclosed properties. Prospects for neither bill are bright; the White House has promised to veto both. 
 Even as the housing crisis deepens, it has become fashionable to argue that the markets should be allowed to fix the problem. Doing nothing is preferable to a Washington solution, the argument goes, because lawmakers so often compound the problems they set out to solve. 
 And so we drift, with the usual ideological battle lines drawn. Liberals want to help borrowers, and conservatives decry anything that smacks of a bailout. Foreclosures, meanwhile, could reach 2.5 million this year, and house prices continue to fall. 
 Yes, this problem is maddeningly big and complicated. But America is full of smart and caring people; surely there exists a handful of wise men and women who can stow their axes and their differences to right the ship.
 To that end, I spoke with Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and former ambassador to France who is vice chairman of Lehman Brothers. A central player in the 1975 plan that saved New York City from bankruptcy, he seemed a good person to consult on how to approach the foreclosure mess. 
 The solution back then was to create an entity called the Municipal Assistance Corporation that raised money selling bonds backed by sales tax receipts and stock transfer taxes. The goal was to revive the city's economy while balancing its budget. It worked. A few years later, the budget was balanced and New York was back on its feet.
 Every crisis is different, of course. And the one that pushed New York City to the brink was considerably smaller than today's. The city had $12 billion in debt outstanding, and the upheaval was regional, not global. 
 Still, interesting parallels exist. Then, as now, banks had been too easy with their lending, and borrowers -- city officials -- thought the party would never end. The dollar was in a tailspin as it is now, and a broad-based denial of the problem's depth held sway. 
 Echoing those who maintain that ''greedy borrowers'' should get no help today, many in Washington in 1975 argued against a rescue of New York. Mr. Rohatyn recalled the spokesman for President Gerald R. Ford comparing New York City to a wayward daughter hooked on heroin. ''You don't give her $100 a day to support her habit,'' the official said. 
 IN May 1975, with the city three weeks away from bankruptcy, Mr. Rohatyn was enlisted to help it raise $900 million. After that, the city needed $1 billion a month for each of the next three months. Once that hurdle was overcome, it would need an additional $4 billion in 1976. 
 ''We did not have time for theoretical analysis,'' Mr. Rohatyn recalled. ''What we needed was for people who had never really worked together before -- and some who had antagonistic relationships -- to cooperate quickly and on hugely difficult political and economic matters.'' 
 Shared sacrifice was the first order of the day. ''We knew the only sources we could look to were the people who had created the problem in the first place,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. That meant the unions with their rich contracts, he said, and the banks, which had lent too much to the city.
 After considerable wrangling and brinkmanship, city unions agreed to job cuts and a wage freeze while investing some of their pension money in M.A.C. bonds. The banks, for their part, agreed to exchange billions of dollars in short-term debt for long-term bonds. 
 Keeping the public apprised on the efforts to save New York was an important lesson, Mr. Rohatyn said. ''I could try to lie to the newspapers about the condition of the city, but I thought it was better to tell them the truth,'' he said. Not easy, but certainly the right thing to do.
 One of the beauties of M.A.C., Mr. Rohatyn explained, was that it was completely bipartisan. ''We had Democrats working with Republicans, business working with labor; we had a virtuous circle,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''It wasn't without emotion or heat, but ultimately we were all going in the same direction.'' 
 Other partnerships emerged. Lewis Rudin, then head of one of the city's real estate dynasties, persuaded his industry colleagues to prepay a year's worth of their real estate taxes. 
 But all this collaboration met a brick wall when Hugh L. Carey, the governor of New York at the time, and Mr. Rohatyn went to Washington for financial help. William E. Simon, the Treasury secretary, was against providing any aid and urged Mr. Carey to raise taxes instead. 
 In late October, Mr. Ford gave his infamous speech at the National Press Club, vowing to veto any bill that would provide federal money to New York. The famous Daily News headline -- ''Ford to City: Drop Dead'' -- ran the next day.
 By November, however, school districts in other states were having problems selling bonds, and banks were increasingly worried about their exposure to a New York default. The turning point, Mr. Rohatyn said, came at an economic summit outside Paris sponsored by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. Mr. Ford was there with other world leaders.
 ''When they were told the city was about to go bankrupt, they said to Ford, 'You're going to have a global dollar crisis,' '' Mr. Rohatyn recalled. Mr. Ford changed his mind. 
 The federal government gave the city $2.3 billion of seasonal financing and three years to balance the budget. By 1981, the city could again sell bonds to the public. 
 MR. ROHATYN plays down his role in the success of M.A.C., identifying Mr. Carey as the hero of the moment: ''We would have gone bankrupt under any other governor; he took the heat and the responsibility.'' Mr. Rohatyn said his association with M.A.C. was the most rewarding experience in his professional life. 
 M.A.C. saved New York City with a sound financial structure, shared sacrifice and a remarkable collaboration among adversaries. Its operations were open, not secretive. Discipline was combined with federal aid. 
 There was a will to do what was necessary in 1975 that is missing today. 
 Maybe the current problems will indeed work themselves out as many seem to expect. But to miss such an opportunity for leadership does seem a shame. 
 For all of us.

HEADLINE: Roaming The World, Detecting Fashion

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
Fresh Starts is a monthly column about emerging jobs and job trends.

 BODY:
LINDA DeFRANCO recalls a meeting five years ago where her boss, the head of trend forecasting at Cotton Inc., came back from a research trip with some interesting photographs. While strolling the streets of Stockholm, she had seen teenagers wearing their jeans rolled up a few inches to make them tighter around the legs.
 Ms. DeFranco, a fashion trend forecaster at the time and now associate director of product trend analysis, said she and her colleagues predicted a coming trend -- skinny jeans -- and relayed that to their retail clients. ''At the time a lot of '80s fashion was coming back into style, and this look clearly fit with that,'' she said. The team's hunch was right -- by 2006, skinny jeans were all the rage. 
 The industry has used trend forecasts for 40 years, but the forecaster's role has changed substantially from the late '60s and early '70s. Then, forecasters were simply trend-spotters, taking photos and reporting on what people were wearing in clubs and on the streets of Europe, said David Wolfe, who did that himself in London in the late '60s. 
 ''European ready-to-wear styles were becoming interesting to American designers and retailers, and there was a hunger for this kind of information,'' he said. ''We were like foreign correspondents, only for fashion.''
 Mr. Wolfe now directs 20 trend forecasters at the Donegar Group in Manhattan, which provides global market trend analysis to the fashion industry.
 Today, fashion forecasting is focused as much on market analysis as on spotting street trends. Forecasters commonly work for trend analysis firms like the Donegar Group, WGSN and Stylesight, or retailers like Macy's and J. C. Penney. 
 Entry-level trend forecasters travel the world with cameras and laptops, photographing people, food, furniture, public art and anything else that might influence fashion and design. They send their photos and notes via e-mail to forecasting teams back home who put the information into context, considering things like the political and economic climate and trends in music, food and interior design. 
 ''You become a translator, looking at cultural signposts and connecting things that appear to be disparate, but aren't,'' said Helen Job, who teaches trend-spotting at Parsons the New School for Design and is head of East Coast content for WGSN, both in New York.
 Ms. Job recently traveled with another forecaster to Austin, Tex., for the South by Southwest music and media festival. ''We took about 4,000 photos of what people were wearing, but we also looked at what bands seemed to be influential in terms of fashion, what companies were sponsoring them and at the graphics on fliers and CD sleeves,'' she said. 
 Forecasters provide reports about trends expected to materialize a year or two in the future within narrow market segments, like footwear, accessories, activewear or men's underwear. Reports include information about fabrics, color, silhouettes and styling.
 About 1,000 to 1,500 people work as fashion trend forecasters, according to Evelyn Brannon, author of ''Fashion Forecasting'' (Fairchild), and others in the industry. That number is likely to grow with demand for trend information, driven by competition in the fashion industry.
 ''Competition is tremendous, so there is a lot of pressure to get the first stage of product development right -- color, fabric, styling concepts,'' said Mark Messura, an executive vice president at Cotton Inc., a trade group for the cotton industry that provides trend forecasts to retailers and manufacturers. 
 Although the profession is small, there is no shortage of candidates. ''This is a dream job,'' Ms. DeFranco said. ''Especially if you love to travel, love fashion and are creative.'' 
 Carly Beumel, a trend forecaster for the retailer Anthropologie and adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, says trend forecasting is not easy to break into, but can be glamorous and exciting. ''I get to go to garment factories in Asia, the Grand Bazaar in Turkey and to India to do fabric research on cottons and silks,'' she said. 
 THE starting salary for a trend forecaster is generally in the low to mid-$20,000s, said Frank Bober, chief executive of Stylesight in New York, which has more than 60 trend reporters and forecasters. For senior management it can reach the low to middle six figures, he said.
 Those who hire forecasters say that much of the skill required for the job is intuitive, but many forecasters come from a fashion or design background and have degrees from institutions specializing in those fields.
 Karolyn Wangstad, vice president for trend merchandising at J. C. Penney, says business acumen is also essential. She looks for a background in merchandising, product development or entrepreneurship. 
 Perhaps most important, said Mr. Wolfe of the Donegar Group, is broad intellectual curiosity. ''A red flag for me when I'm hiring is someone who says 'my whole life is fashion.' You have to be interested in much more than fashion,'' he said. ''You have to understand the world if you are going to understand what people want to wear.''

HEADLINE: Station Site Envisioned As Village

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
A TRANSIT village consisting of an estimated 1.2 million square feet of commercial, residential, retail and industrial development, tied together by a new Long Island Rail Road station, is being explored for the Route 110 corridor near Republic Airport.
 ''We are going to develop a comprehensive vision plan that would make sense from an environmental, housing and economic development perspective,'' said Steven C. Bellone, the supervisor of the Town of Babylon, which includes the site in East Farmingdale. ''By taking this comprehensive approach, we can get more people on board.'' 
 A previous plan to encourage the Long Island Rail Road to reopen the Republic station, which was closed in 1986, had called for the development of a transportation hub at that site.
 That hub drew criticism from residents who feared worse traffic congestion, and railroad officials said they were reluctant to reopen the station until this more extensive plan was proposed.
 ''In the past, we looked at that station as an attractor for customers'' going to New York City, said Elisa Picca, the railroad's chief planning officer. But the new plan would also make Republic a destination station for those who would live and work along the corridor, she said.
 The railroad formerly had a stop near Republic Airport that was created to serve employees of the Fairchild Republic Company's aircraft factory. That plant was closed in 1987, putting hundreds out of work.
 To study the feasibility of reopening the station, the railroad plans to spend $3.5 million in its next capital program. Ms. Picca said that should be before 2010.
 Frank P. Petrone, the Town of Huntington supervisor, said that until the railroad study is completed, the towns intend to do preliminary work of their own. (The northern section of Route 110 is in Huntington.)
 Among the things the towns will consider is creating a bus route that would loop around the Route 110 corridor, taking passengers to their homes and work. Mr. Bellone said he envisioned buses making a five- to seven-mile run up and down Route 110.
 ''This would be the one place on Long Island that would have a north-south mass transit connection,'' he said. ''We will be studying whether to have a dedicated lane for the buses and studying the cost.''
 Although 125,000 people work in businesses along the Route 110 corridor, Mr. Petrone said that there was room for growth and that efforts would be made to attract more businesses.
 Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat from Huntington, said, ''The real beauty of this project is that it is not one of these sprawling developments where we would need to bankrupt ourselves to buy gas getting there.''
 He said the transit village, which officials say would be the first one on Long Island, would be self-contained. ''As oil prices continue to climb, such developments are all the more important,'' Mr. Israel said. 
 Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, a business group, pointed out that the Broad Hollow Bioscience Park on the campus of Farmingdale State University along Route 110 was expanding and needed housing for its employees.
 Ms. Kamer, who is a board member of the park, said that a second incubator for bioscience companies would be opening later this year on the campus.
 ''Once we develop a bioscience cluster, it will spill over into the general business community along the Route 110 corridor and we will need housing for them,'' Ms. Kamer said.
 Mitchell Pally, a board member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent of the Long Island Rail Road, said that if a Republic station was opened, it would be a new station on Conklin Avenue.
 ''This is the way the railroad is working with local government on transit-oriented development,'' he said. ''There is some transit-oriented development in Great Neck, Huntington and other areas, but this would be the first time we would be integrating a station into a brand-new development.''

HEADLINE: The New New World

BYLINE: By JOSEF JOFFE. 
Josef Joffe is the publisher-editor of Die Zeit in Hamburg and a senior fellow at Stanford. His latest book is ''Uberpower: The Imperial Temptation of America.''

 BODY:
THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD 
 By Fareed Zakaria. 
 292 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $ 25.95. 
 Every 20 years or so, the end of America is nigh -- ever since the 18th century when, in France, Comte de Buffon fingered the country as a den of degeneracy while Abbe Raynal slammed its cultural poverty: America had not yet produced ''one good poet, one able mathematician, one man of genius.'' In 1987, in his book ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' the Yale historian Paul Kennedy saw the United States on the road to perdition -- this, four years before the suicide of the Soviet Union, which left America all alone in the penthouse of global power. Now, two decades on, it is the much-hyped ''great power shift'' toward Asia that will turn the United States into a has-been.
 At first blush, ''The Post-American World,'' by Fareed Zakaria, seems to fall into the same genre. But make no mistake. This is a relentlessly intelligent book that eschews simple-minded projections from crisis to collapse. There is certainly plenty to bemoan -- from the disappearing dollar to the subprime disaster, from rampant anti-Americanism to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that will take years to win. 
 Yet Zakaria's is not another exercise in declinism. His point is not the demise of Gulliver, but the ''rise of the rest.'' After all, how can this giant follow Rome and Britain onto the dust heap of empire if it can prosecute two wars at once without much notice at home? The granddaughters of those millions of Rosie the Riveters who kept the World War II economy going are off to the mall today; if they don't shop till they drop, it's because of recession, not rationing. 
 The real problem, Zakaria argues, is the rise of China, trailed by India. China's is indeed the most incredible success story in history -- a tale of almost 30 years of growth in the 7-to-10-percent range that seems to defy the laws of economic gravity. The United States, Germany and Japan had similar tales to tell in the late 19th century, but bust was the price of boom, and for Germany as well as Japan (add Russia, too), headlong industrialization ended in the horrors of 20th-century totalitarianism.
 But for China it's up, up and away. As Zakaria memorably puts it, ''China today exports in a single day more than it exported in all of 1978.'' Authoritarian modernization just hums along. The Party's message reads ''Enrich yourselves, but leave the driving to us,'' and most of 1.3 billion Chinese seem happy to comply -- and to consume. With power safely lodged in the Politburo, China does not conform to the historical pattern of ''first rich, then rowdy,'' which led to Tokyo's and Berlin's imperialist careers.
 So why worry? ''The problem is size,'' Zakaria writes. ''China operates on so large a scale that it can't help changing the nature of the game.'' True, but let's play another game, that of compound interest. China's (nominal) G.D.P. is about $3 trillion, while America's is $14 trillion. Assume indefinite Chinese growth of 7 percent. That will double G.D.P. to $6 trillion in 10 years and double it again to $12 trillion by 2028. Assume now that the United States will grow at its historical rate of 3.5 percent. By 2028, G.D.P. will measure $28 trillion. This is a silly game, but no more inane than those projections that see China overtaking the United States as early as 2020. American output would still be about one-quarter of the world total, the average for the past 125 years, as Zakaria reminds us.
 What about the shifting tides of power? In the affairs of nations, ''power'' is more complex than in physics. The ''hard stuff'' -- military clout -- is certainly central. China's defense budget may be the world's No. 2, but in dollar terms, America spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined. Hence, might -- at least American might -- doesn't just ''grow out of the barrel of a gun,'' as Mao Zedong famously had it; ''it's the economy, stupid.'' Will America stay on top -- devaluation, deficits and all?
 So, let's look at a related determinant of power: culture. Again, Zakaria proceeds more subtly than the run-of-the-mill declinist by stressing American advantages not captured by growth rates and export surpluses. He rightly takes on the old saw to the effect that China produces 600,000 engineers a year, India 350,000 and the United States only 70,000. This is true if you include ''auto mechanics and industrial repairmen'' in the Asian totals. Subtract them, and America ''actually trains more engineers per capita than either India or China does.'' 
 The larger point is that ''higher education is America's best industry'' -- never mind the creeping demise of Detroit's Big Three. ''With 5 percent of the world's population, the United States absolutely dominates higher education, having either 42 or 68 percent of the world's top 50 universities'' (depending on who is counting). In India, he adds, ''universities graduate between 35 and 50 Ph.D.'s in computer science each year; in America the figure is 1,000.'' Now, Beijing is pouring oodles into its universities, but so did Austin, Tex., in the oil-rich '70s, and Stanford et al. are still on top.
 In the industrial age, hardware mattered; today it is software, a k a ''culture.'' This is a grab bag: skills, openness, innovation, opportunity, competition. ''It's brains, stupid,'' Bill Clinton might exclaim today. And youth. China, Japan and Europe are aging rapidly; the United States will remain a young country way into the 21st century. And why? Immigration is ''America's secret weapon.'' In my Stanford class, the A's regularly go to students called Kim, Zhou, Patel or Vertiz; these are not the ''huddled masses,'' but their children -- the gifted and hungry who will slough off the old and drive the new. ''First rich, then fat and lazy'' will not be America's fate.
 What's the problem, then? ''America remains the global superpower today, but it is an enfeebled one.'' It has blown wads of political capital, but it is still better positioned to manage the ''rise of the rest'' than its rivals. Europe is rich, but placid and graying. Resurgent Russia is too grabby. China is more subtle in its ambitions, but still a classic revisionist that wants more for itself and less for the whole. It craves respect but will choose bloody repression in the crunch, as in Tibet.
 The United States, too, has acted the bully in recent years, and it has paid dearly. Still, why does it retain ''considerable ability to set the agenda,'' to quote Zakaria? How can it muster the convening power that brings 80 nations to Annapolis? The short answer (mine) is: America remains the ''default power''; others may fear it, but who else will take care of global business? Maybe it takes a liberal, seafaring empire, as opposed to the Russian or the Habsburg, to temper power and self-interest with responsibility for the rest. 
 And maybe it takes a Bombay-born immigrant like Zakaria, who went from Yale to Harvard (where we were colleagues) and to the top of Newsweek International, to remind this faltering giant of its unique and enduring strengths. America will be in trouble only when China becomes home to tomorrow's hungry masses yearning to be free -- and to make it.

MUQTADA 
 Muqtada Al-Sadr, the Shia Revival, and the Struggle for Iraq. 
 By Patrick Cockburn. 
 226 pp. Scribner. $24. 
 When it comes to the cat's cradle of Iraqi sects, tribes, families, ethnicities, parties, regions and seemingly eternal animosities, there is hardly a better candidate for teasing apart those crisscrossing threads than Patrick Cockburn. The Iraq correspondent for The Independent in London, he has been visiting Iraq since 1977 and has written two previous books on the country. Cockburn lives up to those credentials in his important new book, ''Muqtada,'' which goes a long way toward helping us understand the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr by following his family through the modern history of Iraq.
 In late March, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki threw nearly 40,000 Iraqi Army and police forces, backed by American air support, into an assault on the southern city of Basra, figuring it would take him a few days to smash the Shiite militias in control of many of the city's neighborhoods. Instead, the Mahdi Army, the militia led by Moktada, initially fought the government to a standstill. 
 There was probably not a single adult Iraqi who missed the strong historical resonances of that confrontation, and few Americans who did catch them. Understandably so: not even a Trivial Pursuit champion is likely to know that it was Moktada's father-in-law, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, who formed a Shiite religious party called Dawa, or ''the Call,'' under the nose of Iraq's last king. Dawa not only outlasted the king, who met a bloody end in 1958, but became so influential that it threatened the regime of a later Iraqi head of state named Saddam Hussein.
 Although Hussein had Muhammad Baqir executed, no one in charge of Iraq would ever figure out how to stop the wily Sadr family from expanding its power. As Cockburn shows, the ultra-suspicious Hussein was essentially conned into believing that Moktada's father would act as a clerical stooge for the Baath Party, when in fact he was secretly building an underground organization that later mutated into the Mahdi Army and the Sadrist political movement. And after the 2003 invasion, the American viceroy in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, called in overwhelming firepower against the army run by a man he clearly despised, Moktada, but achieved at most narrow military victories that left Bremer's adversary vastly stronger, both socially and politically. By untangling these historical and biographical threads, Cockburn enables us to understand the extraordinary power Moktada wields.
 The freshness and even brilliance of the book's best chapters are that they do not rehash the ways in which the supposed blunders of the Western powers after the invasion helped create the current chaos in Iraq. Instead, Cockburn largely examines the peculiar internal dynamics of Iraq, as created by the twisting strands of revolution, assassination, religious authority, political oppression and prominent Shiite families like the Sadrs.
 In telling this story, Cockburn argues that early descriptions of Moktada as some mix of Mafia don, opportunistic thug and renegade holy man had it wrong. No one disputes that Moktada draws much of his support from the poor and the rampantly unemployed lower classes, and that many of the young males who fill the ranks of the Mahdi Army are among the most not-nice people in Iraq. But Cockburn argues that Moktada had the chance to muster that support because he was clever enough to stay alive under Hussein and become his family's representative to the people after the death of his father and two brothers, who were killed by Hussein in 1999.
 Hussein disavowed any involvement in those murders, fearing another Shiite uprising like the one that followed his disastrous retreat from Kuwait in 1991; government officials duly attended the mourning ceremonies for Moktada's father. Cockburn points out that far from behaving like a ''firebrand cleric,'' as he would later be characterized, Moktada undertook the first of the tactical retreats that would become one of his hallmarks. ''He neither accused the Iraqi security forces of murdering his father and brothers, nor did he play any role in the sporadic uprisings that followed,'' Cockburn writes. Moktada understood the lesson of Hemingway's guerrilla commander in ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'': in politics and warfare the most important thing is to continue to exist.
 For Moktada, it would be the first in an endless series of feints, temporary retreats, questionable truces and convenient cease-fires that he would become more and more adept at using to confound any force that his Mahdi Army could not defeat head-on. The political benefits of his strategy are visible on any given day all over Sadr City, the poor Shiite enclave in Baghdad named for his father that contains at least two million people and forms the base of Moktada's power. Banners and signs everywhere show him glaring in his black turban between two thickly bearded chaps, his father and father-in-law. He has become the Sadr brand.
 This book is not especially strong in delineating Moktada's personality, perhaps because Cockburn apparently never actually met the elusive cleric. But it may also be because Moktada does not have much of a personality. Although his father is remembered as quick with a joke, Moktada has publicly adopted a lugubrious manner that seldom varies, possibly to fend off charges that he is a young lightweight (he was born in 1973). In private, Moktada is ''businesslike, moody and at times short-tempered,'' Cockburn's sources tell him.
 ''He can't endure any question or fact to be repeated,'' one of Moktada's supporters told Cockburn. ''And if the topic has deviated from the topic under discussion he will return to the main point quickly. His own comments are short.''
 The book's narrative often jumps around, in a way that seems casual and sloppy. But its biggest disappointment is a series of thinly sourced, broad-brush chapters at the end that depict Iraq as a cartoon of disaster brought on by those obvious-in-retrospect American and British blunders.
 ''The Iraqi state never recovered from its collapse in 2003. Ministries became rackets for those who controlled them,'' he writes. (Note to Cockburn: The Foreign Ministry, run by the estimable Hoshyar Zebari, whom you cite in the book, was burned to ashes in 2003 but now operates quite efficiently.) The last chapter is titled ''The Disintegration of Iraq.'' (Note to Cockburn: If this tip is solid, please contact the Baghdad bureau of The New York Times with two suggested sources.)
 But ''Muqtada'' will immediately become one of a small handful of books that are required reading for anyone who wants to unravel the meaning of events in Iraq five years into the war. To take one example: For Prime Minister Maliki, one positive outcome of his inconclusive assault on the Mahdi Army in Basra is that the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a crucial part of his coalition that is led by another noted Shiite family, the Hakims, has warmed to him considerably after years of regarding him warily.
 That isolated fact means little until you know that during years of exile in Tehran, Damascus and elsewhere, the Hakims continually accused Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr of being a collaborator with the Hussein regime. The rivalry between the Hakims and the Sadrs has never died, and in Iraq it won't soon be forgotten. The prime minister may have depicted the operation in Basra as purely a matter of clearing armed bandits from the streets. But the fact remains that whoever those gunmen were, they withdrew only when Moktada ordered them to.

No conservative writer was tougher on Richard Nixon than George F. Will, the longtime columnist for The Washington Post and Newsweek -- particularly on the subject of ''the 784-day Watergate debacle,'' as he once termed it. ''The Nixon White House ran amok as no other has done, and its abuses were uniquely lurid and sinister,'' Will wrote on Aug. 8, 1974, the day Nixon announced he would resign from the presidency. 
 Will, who returns to the subject this week in his cover review of Rick Perlstein's ''Nixonland,'' thinks the Nixon presidency now looks ''even worse than it seemed at the time,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Regarding domestic policy, which Nixon dismissed as 'building outhouses in Peoria,' his disdain for the subject did not, alas, produce benign neglect.'' In foreign policy, Nixon's '''realism' was unrealistic -- too pessimistic about America's stamina for protracted containment, too optimistic about the Soviet Union's adaptability to modern economic exigencies. His policy toward China lives on: we are wagering that prosperity will subvert tyranny.''
 How, then, does Nixon fit into the larger story of modern conservatism? ''He doesn't. His tenure was an empty parenthesis.''

HOW huge is Grand Theft Auto IV, the recently released installment of the guns-ablazing video game franchise?
 Huge. But imprecisely huge.
 Wall Street analysts expected it to sell about five million copies in its first two weeks. Instead, it sold 3.6 million copies in just one day, April 29. Sales hit six million globally in its first week for a total haul of $500 million, it was announced Wednesday. 
 G.T.A. IV may move more than 15 million copies over its sales lifetime -- which will last a lot longer than most of its thuggish characters do. Game players inhabit a gangster who is equipped to dispatch scores of rival criminals and others, including police officers and innocent bystanders, on the rough streets of Liberty City, the bullet-riddled stand-in for New York.
 By several imperfect measures, G.T.A. IV, which sells for $60 in the United States, is shaping up to be one of the biggest products in entertainment history.
 There is no definitive comparison of all-time best-selling music, film, games and books. Each industry tends to calculate revenues by its own methods. Most of those figures are unavailable to the public, closely guarded in a fiercely competitive business.
 For a little context, however, it is possible to place Grand Theft Auto IV's expected sales -- and sales of the whole series (eight titles) -- among the iconic names of the film and music industries. Britney Spears, meet Niko Bellic, G.T.A. IV's criminal star. He is on track to sell more than nine million copies of his game, domestically -- approaching what you sold of ''Oops . . . I Did It Again,'' the 24th-biggest album since detailed sales data appeared in 1991.
 About 70 million copies of earlier G.T.A. editions have sold worldwide since the 1997 debut, perhaps three quarters of those domestically -- roughly 53 million units. That is close to Whitney Houston's career unit sales (rank: 20), and ahead of U2, Celine Dion and Shania Twain, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
 Previous versions of G.T.A. provoked harsh criticism for their bloodstained plotlines. The latest, which allows players to hire prostitutes and then run them over or shoot them right after they've performed their work, has been met with a more muted response, thus far, as it flies off store shelves.

 When McDonald's builds a commercial for its ''dollar menu'' around cubicle banter about the value of U.S. currency -- ''it's dropping like a lead balloon'' -- something weird is going on. Since when are exchange rates a suitably popular touchstone to reference in fast-food ads? Actually, the sagging potency -- and prestige -- of the greenback probably escaped from the business pages last year, thanks to figures as disparate as Ron Paul (whose Republican presidential-debate lectures about the declining dollar seemed to help his quixotic candidacy) and Jay-Z (who famously flashed a thick wad of euros in a video). Currency prestige has a long history in the context of nation-states, but the idea that individuals might find some forms of money more desirable than others is less familiar. Perhaps rising awareness of the falling dollar is changing that. 
 There is a way to, in effect, spend your dollars on other forms of money, and apparently the number of people doing so is increasing. EverBank, based in Jacksonville, has sold foreign-denominated certificates of deposit for years, but those instruments have never been more popular than they are today. This year, according to Chuck Butler, president of EverBank World Markets, customers of that bank unit hold about $1 billion in foreign-currency C.D.'s and money-market accounts -- up from about $300 million five years ago. Although the current figure represents about a sixth of EverBank's total assets under management, the first thing you'll see at the bank's Web site is the question ''Are you well positioned for today's economy? See how foreign currencies may be your answer.'' 
 Your choices include single-currency C.D.'s -- euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, even Brazilian reais or Indian rupees -- or multicurrency C.D.'s bundling predetermined baskets of denominations. For instance, the Viking Index C.D. is made up of Norwegian, Danish and Swedish currency. Other financial institutions offer ways to, in essence, bet against the dollar by way of a targeted mutual fund, for example, but EverBank's products are unusual. McDonald's and Jay-Z aside, it would be an overstatement to say this a Main Street move: the minimum investment on a single-currency C.D. is $10,000; for the baskets it's $20,000. EverBank World Markets customers tend to be ''high-net-worth individuals who do a lot of research,'' Butler says. 
 Still, the value of the dollar is perhaps more a part of the public consciousness than it has ever been, says Craig Karmin, author of the recent book ''Biography of the Dollar.'' Partly this may be a function of the Internet and the wide array of financial-news sources. Partly it may be a function of the dollar's role in more quotidian consumer concerns, like rising prices for oil and imported goods. (Anyone who has been to Europe lately, or who has encountered tourists from abroad giddily shopping in Manhattan, is certainly aware of what a weak dollar means.) And partly it may be something bigger. 
 Butler first got interested in the idea of foreign-currency C.D.'s back in the 1980s. Since 1992 he has written a regular dispatch (now distributed via e-mail) about currency trends and has spoken at investor conferences about the importance of currency diversification. In the past, some reactions were borderline hostile, accusing Butler of not only being anti-dollar but also unpatriotic. ''They think I'm saying bad things about the U.S.,'' he says. ''All I'm trying to do is get people to diversify their portfolios.'' (It should go without saying that this column is no place to look for investment advice, but just for the record, a foreign-currency C.D. will lose money if that currency falls sharply against the dollar.)
 But one reason EverBank is spending more time signing up new customers than warding off charges of anti-Americanism these days probably has less to do with an outbreak of financial enlightenment than an outbreak of pessimism. In raw symbolic terms, the dollar has long been a proxy for American power, economic and otherwise, so the popular interest in its troubles simply mirrors fear of rising economic rivals like China. As Karmin notes, the dollar has had its ups and downs, but its ultimate dominance as a global currency has been in place, and taken for granted, for generations. ''People have started to think, Maybe it's not inevitable,'' Karmin says. And maybe that means more of us are coming to Butler's view that cheering for the dollar isn't the same thing as patriotism. As Americans, we don't want to see McDonald's introduce a Yuan Menu, but as investors, we're a little more willing to go where the money is. Even if it's denominated in euros.

HEADLINE: As Bush Term Wanes, Mideast Peace Appears as Elusive as Ever

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The 2008 race for the White House is casting a long shadow over President Bush. So long, in fact, that it may extend all the way to the Middle East.
 When Israeli and Palestinian leaders committed themselves to peace talks after meeting in Annapolis, Md., last November, Mr. Bush had hopes of ending his presidency on a foreign policy high note, with a deal for the contours of a Palestinian state. But with Mr. Bush headed to the region this week for the second time in five months, peace seems as elusive as ever -- and some are looking to his successor.
 ''In some ways, this is the roadshow cast of 'Waiting for Godot,' '' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said the trip would ''basically set a marker while everybody waits for the next president,'' while other analysts predicted the most Mr. Bush could accomplish would be to hand over a working peace process to his successor. The five-day trip, which will begin Tuesday, will revolve around the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding, but will also take Mr. Bush to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. For the White House, the timing is hardly ideal. 
 Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, is embroiled in a criminal investigation that threatens his job. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, left Washington disappointed after a recent meeting with Mr. Bush. Although the peace talks continue, the two sides are far apart on the core issues that divide them, and the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, has said progress is ''more halting'' than Mr. Bush would like.
 The talks are so tenuous that even Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's ever-optimistic national security adviser, conceded there was little reason for the three leaders to get together. Mr. Bush will meet Mr. Olmert in Jerusalem and see Mr. Abbas separately in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt.
 ''This did not seem the time for a big high-level three-way event with the president and the prime minister and President Abbas,'' Mr. Hadley said. ''It just doesn't feel right as the best way to advance the negotiations.''
 Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, offered an especially bleak assessment.
 ''It's hard to remember a less auspicious time to pursue Arab-Israeli peacemaking than right now,'' Mr. Alterman said. ''The politics on the ground are absolutely miserable. U.S. power and influence are at low ebb in the region. The Bush administration is beset by challenges -- the combination of a faltering economy, persistent difficulties in Iraq and a growing threat from Iran -- all at a time that the president's popularity is at a historical low, and his administration is settling more and more into lame duck status.''
 Still, that will not keep the president from trying. 
 Mr. Hadley, the national security adviser, characterized the visit as ''both symbolism and substance,'' and said Mr. Bush would use his time in the region to try to prod the parties along. In Israel, in addition to meeting Mr. Olmert, Mr. Bush will deliver a speech to the Israeli Parliament and tour Masada, the ancient fortress overlooking the Dead Sea. 
 There is little question that President Bush will get a warm reception. Few presidents have been as closely allied with Israel as Mr. Bush, and experts say many Israelis worry that the next president will not be nearly so sympathetic. The trip will be Mr. Bush's second to Israel as president -- he was there in January, on the heels of the Annapolis talks -- and probably his last.
 But Arabs across the region are looking past Mr. Bush with a hopeful eye -- particularly if his successor is a Democrat, said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Arab-Israeli peace negotiator who worked for the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration. Mr. Miller said countries like Syria, which Mr. Bush has branded a state sponsor of terrorism, were hopeful that a new administration would be more willing to engage.
 ''If the Democrats come in after eight years, there will be a lot of new ideas, a lot of new enthusiasm to look at the Middle East in a different way, with more engagement, more diplomacy, '' Mr. Miller said, though he added that ''there may be less of a change from Bush policies'' than many Arabs think.
 Like most second-term presidents in their final year in office, Mr. Bush is spending considerable time on the road; the Middle East trip is one of eight foreign trips on his agenda for 2008. With a Congress controlled by Democrats and his agenda on Capitol Hill reduced to issuing veto threats, it may be no wonder that he wants to get away. Historians say overseas travel can give presidents both a political and a psychological boost.
 ''They hope they can get some kind of significant advantage, emotionally, personally,'' said Robert Dallek, the presidential biographer. ''They want a sense of being in charge, of being in control, of having some impact on something.''
 Bruce Buchanan, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin, said even the slightest bit of good news could be a plus for the president.
 ''He's not going to turn around his presidency or anything like that,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''But what he might do is bump his numbers a little bit and get people to acknowledge that this guy is trying to serve the public interest.''
 One issue the American public has a keen interest in is the price of oil -- a topic that created some embarrassment for Mr. Bush in January. At that time, with gas prices already on the rise, Mr. Bush appealed to the Saudi oil minister to give Americans some relief by increasing production -- and was publicly rebuffed. He then made a private appeal to King Abdullah, with little result.
 Mr. Hadley said he was confident Mr. Bush would try again.

HEADLINE: When Should the Fed Crash the Party?

BYLINE: By PETER L. BERNSTEIN. 
Peter L. Bernstein, a financial consultant and economic historian, is the editor of the Economics & Portfolio Strategy newsletter.

 BODY:
IN the darkest days of the Depression, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, one of the richest men in the United States, opposed any government action to stem the tide of plunging business activity and soaring unemployment. Instead, he urged a policy of supreme indifference. 
 ''Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate,'' he said. 
 ''It will purge the rottenness out of the system,'' he added, and values ''will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.'' 
 John Maynard Keynes, for one, thought that prescriptions like Mellon's were preposterous. The economist called those who held such views ''austere and puritanical souls'' who believed that it would ''be a victory for the mammon of unrighteousness'' if general prosperity were not ''subsequently balanced by universal bankruptcy.'' Keynes perceived too much good in prosperity to treat it as the enemy, and he revolutionized economic theory to prove his point. 
 Keynes won the argument, and government intervention to overcome rising unemployment and falling profits has been standard operating procedure forever after. Nevertheless, the debate over intervention is not ancient history. It replays in today's headlines. 
 As the world economy wrestles with the credit crisis and a shattered housing sector, there are those who grumble that too much prosperity caused the excesses that became the root cause of all our troubles. Now, they fear, aggressive countercyclical policies will lead to inflation and threaten a run on the dollar. In some ways, this view derives from Mellon's dark advice. 
 Just recently, William Fleckenstein, a successful investment manager in Seattle, said: ''Part of me keeps hoping we'll just let financial gravity take over and have this brutal crack-up. We'd have a decent foundation instead of the balsa wood structure we had coming out of the last bubble.''
 This school holds Alan Greenspan responsible for current problems. Critics of Mr. Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, contend that he pressed the panic button as the year-over-year inflation rate plunged from 3.6 percent year over year in May 2001 to only 1 percent just 13 months later. Such a precipitous decline had not occurred since the 1930s. In response, the Fed sliced its key interest rate to 1 percent from 4 percent over the next 24 months and held it there until June 2004 -- accompanied by a rapidly expanding money supply. 
 Now, Mr. Greenspan's critics contend, his determined creation of excess liquidity has left his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, with a mess. 
 In this view, Mr. Bernanke is making matters only worse by carrying out extreme interventions. They see him taking the risk of higher inflation to break the credit crunch and to prevent the economy from falling into what he fears could be a steep decline with deflationary consequences. 
 As James Grant, a well-known expert in fixed-income markets, warns, ''Maybe the policymakers' response to the crisis accounts for the parallel bull markets in gold and bonds.'' 
 Did Mr. Greenspan's Fed make the right decisions? Did it set a bad example for Mr. Bernanke to follow? It is important to remember that deflation is devilishly hard to deal with. When people expect prices to decline, they tend to hold back from spending, which only makes prices fall further. The policy choices open to the Fed are limited. It can try to stem the tide by cutting interest rates, but once the interest rate falls to zero, there is no place else for it to go. Then the authorities have no choice but to open up the monetary spigot, a route that can haunt them later by creating inflationary pressures or asset bubbles. 
 A profound issue is at stake here. Keynes's perspective creates its own problems. Prosperity does not manage itself. William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed chairman in the 1950s and '60s, famously declared that the Fed's role was ''to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going.'' If we could refrain from squeezing out the last drop of punch on the upside -- a temptation that Mr. Greenspan could not resist during the high-tech boom of the 1990s -- fewer maladjustments would develop, and the downside would be less ominous and easier to control. 
 In the real world, however, managing prosperity is just as complex as managing recessions. How does anyone know precisely when the party gets too good? Mr. Martin's timing with the punch bowl was less neat than he would have liked. Real G.D.P. declined by an average of 2.5 percent during the three recessions that followed his removal of the punch bowl. During Mr. Greenspan's tenure, which lasted just about as long as Mr. Martin's, G.D.P. declined by an average of only 0.7 percent over two recessions.
 In any case, those who echo Mellon's view about letting downturns run their course are inconsistent in their arguments. This school favors government intervention on the upside, but wants no part of government action when trouble develops. Like Mr. Martin, it believes that government should deal with prosperity by cutting it short, before the party really gets good. But when the economy slips into recession, let 'er rip!
 IN the end, this dispute boils down to consequences, not hard-and-fast rules. The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald L. Kohn, laid down a wise general principle in a speech in February, when he asserted that, ''In circumstances like these, the decisions of policymakers must take account of not only the most likely course of the economy, but also the possibility of very unfavorable developments.'' 
 The onset of the credit crisis last summer could have led to a replay of many features of the Depression. Was it worth the risk of taking no action, and the resulting social and political consequences, in order to clean house and start fresh?
 I have no doubt that today's authorities are taking risks and are going to make mistakes in managing the complex fallout from the speculative fevers of recent years. Nevertheless, I would still reject Mellon's advice and those who echo it, because the consequences would be unthinkable.

HEADLINE: A Hurdle for TV: Wall Street Reality

 BODY:
The mortgage crisis hasn't merely caused millions of home foreclosures, cost big Wall Street firms tens of billions of dollars and forced layoffs. It has also made it harder to find willing participants for ''Wall Street Warriors,'' a cable television show that documents the lives of traders, brokers, bankers and other financial professionals.
 ''The economy has definitely affected the response,'' said the show's casting director, Laine Rosenberg. ''Our show tries to follow people for seven months, and people who might have done it are uncertain about the future due to the economic situation.'' 
 To be sure, finding subjects has never been easy, especially in the publicity-averse hedge fund world. And big firms have been unwilling to host camera crews on their trading floors, said Sean Skelton, the co-creator and producer of the show, which is shown on MOJO-HD, a high-definition cable channel.
 To find the four to six main characters who will anchor the third season, Mr. Skelton and Ms. Rosenberg have responded with tactics worthy of Gordon Gekko, such as approaching people in Wall Street watering holes who they think fit the bill.
 For aspiring Wall Street Warriors, Ms. Rosenberg is hosting an open casting call Tuesday afternoon at the offices of House Productions on West 15th Street in Manhattan. 
 The program will begin filming this month and appear next spring. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ 
 TAX RETURNS, ON DISPLAY Giorgio Armaniis not personally bothered that it is public knowledge that he paid 19 million euros ($29 million) in taxes on an income of 44 million euros ($68 million) for 2005. 
 The information came to light recently, when the Italian government, as part of a transparency effort intended to combat tax evasion, posted on the Web the returns of all 40 million Italians who did pay taxes in 2005. The site with the tell-all data was shut down after just a few hours amid protests, but not before yielding some fascinating financials, including the fact that Mr. Armani was among those who paid the most taxes. 
 Interviewed last week in New York, Mr. Armani said he did have professional reasons for objecting to publishing tax return information
 ''Within a large company or a small company, this can create a lot of difficulties,'' he said. ''We have two people that are doing the same job; one does it very well and the other one doesn't do it well. The first one I reward with a bonus of some sort, and the other one doesn't necessarily have to know about that. Now everybody knows. So this can create a lot of problems within companies with the internal relationships.'' 
 Mr. Armani was in New York to attend the annual gala of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which he helped to underwrite. He was also honored by supporters of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, whose students he addressed. JANE L. LEVERE 
 BEYOND SLOGANS To promote incentives from Chrysler, one of Lee A. Iacocca's famous sayings as chairman was ''Buy a car, get a check.'' But how about, ''Buy a car, get a call from the chairman?''
 Chrysler, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is trying to strengthen ties to customers by having 300 executives spend time in its call center. Among those participating will be the current chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, and the vice chairmen Thomas W. LaSorda and James E. Press.
 The executives will make customer-satisfaction calls to people who recently bought a Chrysler vehicle as well as listen in as representatives take some incoming calls from customers, said a spokesman, Stuart Schorr. The executives will also compete to generate the most sales referrals in the next three months. NICK BUNKLEY 
 SMOKING, SORT OF The public pleasure of the cigar has received a serious blow in the form of government smoking bans. Now a company in Minneapolis says it has found a way to restore this accessory of business types. 
 The company, Ruyan America, has introduced a cigar that produces water vapor instead of smoke. Equipped with an ultrasonic atomizer, nicotine-infused cartridges and a small battery, the cigar ''provides its user with the experience of smoking, without producing dangerous secondhand smoke and without endangering the health of associates or bystanders,'' according to a company statement. (No similar assertions are made about the health of the actual smoker, or rather ''user,'' of the cigar.)
 One cigar, which costs $40, contains about 1,800 mouthfuls of vapor, said Ruyan America's president, William P. Bartkowski. (The company also offers a cigarette version.) He acknowledged that ''if you're a real cigar aficionado, you're not going to be blown away by this,'' but he said that many smokers had responded favorably to his company's high-tech substitute.

HEADLINE: Recycling a Relic in Detroit

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
After the Tigers played on opening day, a pickup truck full of guys drove across Woodward Avenue from Comerica Park on the near East Side to old Tiger Stadium on the near West Side, a mile or so away.
 They entered the abandoned stadium through a large locked door by using an attachment to the front of their vehicle as a battering ram. They crashed the gate and took an unguided tour until approached by a security guard.
 ''My guard said, 'What are you guys doing?' '' said Fred Rottach, who supervises the place for the city. ''They jumped back in the truck and drove away.'' 
 This is extreme behavior even for touchy-feely fans whose affection for the ballpark is well known. Before the Tigers left in 1999, a booster club sponsored two group hugs in which devotees linked arms and gave the stadium a squeeze.
 Since then, various plans for redevelopment have come and gone. The stadium sits empty. Late last year, the city auctioned mementos like grandstand seats, a dugout urinal, Al Kaline's locker and the fence in front of the right-center-field light tower, hit by a Reggie Jackson home run in the 1971 All-Star Game. Last month, the city tentatively awarded a partial demolition contract for the stadium, which opened in 1912 as Navin Field. 
 An opposition group, the Old Tiger Stadium Conservancy, has until June 1 to raise $369,000 to try to save part of Tiger Stadium, even temporarily. The group includes Ernie Harwell, the retired Tigers radio broadcaster.
 If that goal is reached, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said he would seek greater financing in the 2009 federal budget to preserve the oldest part of the structure around the infield and redevelop the playing field for amateur teams.
 ''The field is sort of sacred ground,'' Levin said in a telephone interview.
 Levin, who grew up in Detroit, said he attended the 1945 World Series in the ballpark, then known as Briggs Stadium, after Hank Greenberg returned from World War II to help clinch the pennant. The grounds around Michigan and Trumbull need a commercial development plan, Levin said, to coincide with a historical renovation, even if only the stadium's corner footprint is saved.
 Jeff Wattrick, a spokesman for the conservancy, said three ''civic-minded philanthropic groups'' had discussed contributing money to stave off a full demolition that may begin in weeks. But he said he could not reveal their names because he did not want to spread false optimism.
 ''So many different plans have come and gone,'' he said. ''We sensed a real fatigue.''
 Wattrick said the Tigers had not expressed much interest in the effort. A team spokesman, Rob Matwick, said he wished the group well but added little else. ''We do not have an active role,'' he said.
 Complicating everyone's calculations is the deal the Detroit Economic Development Corporation made with the two demolition companies that have promised to tear down Tiger Stadium for the scrap steel, copper, aluminum, brass and nickel they can salvage.
 It would take less than a year to demolish, said Waymon Guillebeaux, a vice president of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. But it would be even faster and cheaper, he said, to tear the place down without preserving even a corner.
 So the demolition companies have promised to pay the city $300,000 if they do not have to preserve the corner piece, Guillebeaux said. But they want an answer by June 1, he said. The companies -- MCM Management Corporation of Bloomfield Hills and the Farrow Group of Detroit -- did not respond to a request for comment.
 Guillebeaux said that his group was cooperating with the preservationists, but that the economic downturn discouraged such plans. Detroit has been hit harder than many cities. ''To try to raise money to just hold on to a portion of an old stadium might not be easy,'' he said, adding that developers would be more interested if the site were cleared.
 The stadium's outfield is thick and green but much shaggier than a major league field. Dandelions speckle it with yellow. A short, skinny tree protrudes from the concrete in the lower deck where the box seats used to be. What was once the pitcher's mound is now round and flat.
 The lower deck and parts of the upper deck have almost no seats. Rottach, the city's overseer of the property and a native East Sider, walked across the field and recalled the 1968 Tigers winning a World Series game there and all the championship football games between the city's public and Catholic leagues.
 He also turned a measured eye to the present and said that remaining structural pieces are valuable. They are from the first half of the 20th century. ''The steel is the highest of the high grades,'' he said. ''Steel was cheap then.''
 Adding that all metal prices had ''gone through the roof,'' Rottach said the demolition would be a green project with about 85 percent of the materials recycled.
 Under sun and blue sky, he walked beneath the upper deck in right field, which hangs over the warning track and once turned apparent flyouts into home runs.
 One spectator impressed by this architectural feature in the 1960s was Jeff Wilpon, the chief operating officer of the Mets. He used to visit Detroit to see his grandfather, who would take him to baseball games in the summer and to Lions games on Thanksgiving.
 So Wilpon insisted that the new Mets stadium have a similar overhang in right field. ''You're in fair territory,'' Wilpon said of those seats. ''We copied that a little bit.''
 Whatever the stadium's fate, the neighbors are eager for something to happen because the area is not dormant. The land lies near a casino hotel, a recent arrival.
 Nearby residential neighborhoods include a new subdivision with streets named after Motown artists like Marvin Gaye and Martha Reeves and a revived 19th-century neighborhood called Corktown, once populated by Irish immigrants.
 Timothy J. McKay, executive director of the Greater Corktown Development Corporation, said he supported the preservation attempt but added that the conservancy would have to entice investors.
 ''We want to see some changes,'' he said. 
 Knowledge of history is a critical part of healing an inner city, McKay said.
 He added: ''This is an old city. But history here is discounted by a lot of people.''

HEADLINE: Eye Candy, but Definitely Not the iCar In New York, Parking Is Ever So Easy

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
SHOULD Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg be feeling glum over the death of congestion pricing, his plan to divert drivers onto public transit by imposing an $8 surcharge to motor into the heart of Manhattan, he ought to be cheered by the arrival of the Smart car from Europe. 
 The Smart Fortwo could do for Midtown gridlock what Mr. Bloomberg's successful bans on smoking and trans fats did for New Yorkers' health: after a few miles in this anemic two-seat tomato can, drivers will sprint to the subway and abandon the surface streets for good. 
 Like BMW's introduction of the Mini Cooper before it, the Mercedes-built Smart arrives as an appealing alternative for Americans weary of overstuffed cars and overblown fuel prices. Just under nine feet long, the Smart easily kneecaps the 12-foot Mini as a contestant for the smallest car sold in America. 
 But unlike the mostly fabulous Mini, the Smart Fortwo, with room for just two urban warriors and a few loincloths of cargo, turns out to be a Trojan pony, primitive in its performance and no more fuel-efficient than some far more practical cars. 
 Sizing up the Smart against a subcompact you'd expect it to get at least 50 miles to the gallon. The Smart design certainly gets the basics right: it weighs just 1,800 pounds and its rear-mounted engine, a 1-liter 3-cylinder power plant of 70 horsepower, is the smallest in the market. 
 While the Smart has the best fuel-economy rating of any nonhybrid sold in America, you'd expect far better numbers from its bite-size body. Its E.P.A. rating is just 33 miles per gallon in town and 41 on the highway. I averaged an unspectacular 33 m.p.g. over a week of driving. 
 How can this be? While the Smart has enough power to keep pace with traffic, its engine works so hard that it can't conserve fuel. By my stopwatch, the car takes more than 14 seconds to reach 60 miles an hour, and it tops out at 90. The engine's clattering idle was loud enough to make me suspect a diesel under the hood. No dice: The diesel-powered Smart that tops 70 m.p.g. on the European test cycle won't be coming here. 
 If the engine is mediocre, the five-speed automated manual transmission is an engineering embarrassment. You could practically squeeze a half-inning of baseball into the maddening delay between the release of one gear and the engagement of the next. The Smart loses momentum in the pause, lurching passengers forward, and then Barcalounges backward when it oozes into a higher gear.
 The Smart has been described as fun to drive by some reviewers, but other than showing taillights to the neighborhood riding mowers, I don't see it. The Smart steers decently but feels clumsy when pushed hard. Tire grip is meager, the body wallows, and big city bumps come crashing through the suspension. 
 Things are no better on the highway. Wind noise was so intrusive at 70 m.p.h. that I kept thinking the windows were cracked open; the engine buzz added to the din. Ultimately, it feels more a contraption than a car, and it's a chore to drive. 
 In its favor, this tall-roof tot is extremely roomy for the driver and a passenger, and it scores well in federal crash testing. I drove a mid-price Passion model, which starts at $14,235; a basic Pure version starts at $12,235, and the convertible tops the range at $17,235. 
 As Smart tries to jump on the Mini's bandwagon, some myths need to be addressed. First is that the Smart has been a smash success in Europe. In fact, Smart has been a small but weighty millstone around Mercedes's neck, never reaching sales expectations and posting more than $3 billion in losses over a decade. 
 The second myth flows from the first: that the Smart is arriving to show America how small cars should be done. But the Smart isn't the sophisticated runabout that people might expect. 
 Sure, the Smart is cute, if you enjoy cars from the Weebles school of design. And it's ridiculously easy to park. My only pleasure came from slotting the Smart into spots that would have discouraged a St. Bernard. 
 But the Smart's diminished size brings diminishing returns. From supermarkets to metered spaces, American parking slots are sized for the biggest cars and S.U.V.'s. Because you can't straddle the lines at the mall or double up at meters, the Smart offers no advantage there. 
 The Smart's only edge is its ability to park motorcycle-style by backing or nosing perpendicular to the curb. Oops, strike that: New York's parking department said that move is off-limits unless signs specifically allow angle parking for all cars. 
 Compared with suburb-dwellers, the urban single or family is also more likely to rely on one do-it-all car. That means the versatility to carry friends, escape for a weekend and deal with cargo. 
 That's where the Smart gets really dumb. For roughly the Smart Passion's well-equipped price of $15,510, one could have several pint-sized models -- the terrific Honda Fit or Nissan Versa come to mind -- that are sportier, hold twice as many people, up to six times the cargo and get nearly the same mileage. (Fold the Versa hatchback's rear seats, and there's 50 cubic feet of storage, compared with just 7.8 cubic feet for the Smart).
 Here's what you won't be hauling in the Smart's hatch: a cart full of groceries, a guitar case, golf bag or two medium suitcases. And the Smart's silly pickup-style tailgate forces you to lean against the open gate and reach to grab your stuff. 
 Smart says that 30,000 people have put down refundable $99 deposits. I have no doubt that initial sales will be strong. 
 But I'm also convinced that this trendy twerpy ride had better enjoy its welcome. After three years at most, the Smart will begin gathering tiny pieces of dust in showrooms, as Americans discover smarter places for their small-car dollars. 
 INSIDE TRACK A minnow not worth hooking.

HEADLINE: Governor Paterson's Forgotten Agenda

 BODY:
Before he suddenly became New York's governor, David Paterson was a committed reformer. In his years as a state senator (and leader of the Democratic minority), he called for limiting special-interest money, public financing of elections, and sweeping out as much muck as possible from the State Legislature. 
 Now that Mr. Paterson finally has the power he has lost his zeal. He has not charted any real plan to push a resistant Legislature toward reform. He has said his focus is on steadying the state in hard economic times.
 A steady hand is important. But voters also want reform, Albany desperately needs it, and it is very, very cheap. The only thing that could cost money -- public financing for campaigns -- would save over the long run. All those lobbyists would have more trouble skewing state money to special interests. 
 The No. 1 reform should be an end to the system that allows legislators to draw their own districts so that they are re-elected pretty much for life. Mr. Paterson needs to begin pushing now for a constitutional amendment creating a nonpartisan commission on redistricting like those in Iowa and Maine. 
 Most of Mr. Paterson's friends in the Legislature will not want to give up this self-serving operation. Senator Malcolm Smith, who leads the Democratic minority, has backed away from this reform, especially if Democrats win full control of the Legislature this year. Mr. Paterson has the power to shame, if he has the will. He needs to start publicly pressing the redistricting reform and threatening vetoes -- of money for the current redistricting system and of any future proposal that is not done fairly. 
 New York has one of the worst systems in the country when it comes to letting special interests buy candidates with campaign contributions. That commission and genuine campaign finance reform offer the best chance for cleaning up the system. Instead, Mr. Paterson is supporting a very modest reform package that would limit some contributions and require better reporting of campaign funds. It lacks any real enforcement and even increases the amount of contributions allowed in some cases. Only Albany could act like that's real reform.
 As a 20-year veteran, Mr. Paterson knows Albany's every secret, every scam. Now that he is in charge, he should start cleaning up the scandals that so appalled him before he became governor.

HEADLINE: Party Like It's 2008

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ANOTHER weekly do-or-die primary battle, another round of wildly predicted ''game changers'' that collapsed in the locker room.
 Hillary Clinton's attempt to impersonate a Nascar-lovin', gun-totin', economist-bashin' populist went bust: Asked which candidate most ''shares your values,'' voters in both North Carolina and Indiana exit polls opted instead for the elite and condescending arugula-eater. Bill Clinton's small-town barnstorming tour, hailed as a revival of old-time Bubba bonhomie, proved to be yet another sabotage of his wife, whipping up false expectations for her disastrous showing in North Carolina. Barack Obama's final, undercaffeinated debate performance, not to mention the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's attempted character assassination, failed to slow his inexorable path to the Democratic nomination. 
 ''It's still early,'' Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday. Though it's way too late for her, she's half-right. We're only at the end of the beginning of this extraordinary election year. While we wait out her self-immolating exit, it's a good time to pause the 24/7 roller coaster for a second and get our bearings. The reason that politicians and the press have gotten so much so wrong is that we keep forgetting what year it is. Only if we reboot to 2008 will the long march to November start making sense.
 This is not 1968, when the country was so divided over race and war that cities and campuses exploded in violence. If you have any doubts, just look (to take a recent example) at the restrained response by New Yorkers, protestors included, to the acquittal of three police officers in the 50-bullet shooting death of an unarmed black man, Sean Bell. 
 This is not 1988, when a Democratic liberal from Massachusetts of modest political skills could be easily clobbered by racist ads and an incumbent vice president running for the Gipper's third term. This is not the 1998 midterms, when the Teflon Clintons triumphed over impeachment. This is not 2004, when another Democrat from Massachusetts did for windsurfing what the previous model did for tanks. 
 Almost every wrong prediction about this election cycle has come from those trying to force the round peg of this year's campaign into the square holes of past political wars. That's why race keeps being portrayed as dooming Mr. Obama -- surely Jeremiah Wright = Willie Horton! -- no matter what the voters say to the contrary. It's why the Beltway took on faith the Clinton machine's strategic, organization and fund-raising invincibility. It's why some prognosticators still imagine that John McCain can spin the Iraq fiasco to his political advantage as Richard Nixon miraculously did Vietnam. 
 The year 2008 is far more complex -- and exhilarating -- than the old templates would have us believe. Of course we're in pain. More voters think the country is on the wrong track (81 percent) than at any time in the history of New York Times/CBS News polling on that question. George W. Bush is the most unpopular president that any living American has known. 
 And yet, paradoxically, there is a heartening undertow: we know the page will turn. For all the anger and angst over the war and the economy, for all the campaign's acrimony, the anticipation of ending the Bush era is palpable, countering the defeatist mood. The repressed sliver of joy beneath the national gloom can be seen in the record registration numbers of new voters and the over-the-top turnout in Democratic primaries.
 Mr. Obama hardly created this moment, with its potent brew of Bush loathing and sweeping generational change. He simply had the vision to tap into it. Running in 2008 rather than waiting four more years was the single smartest political decision he's made (and, yes, he's made dumb ones too). The second smartest was to understand and emphasize that subterranean, nearly universal anticipation of change rather than settle for the narrower band of partisan, dyspeptic Bush-bashing. We don't know yet if he's the man who can make the moment -- and won't know unless he gets to the White House -- but there's no question that the moment has helped make the man. 
 For five years boomers have been asking, ''Why are the kids not in the streets screaming about the war the way we were?'' The simple answer: no draft. But as Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais show in ''Millennial Makeover,'' their book about the post-1982 American generation, that energy has been plowed into quieter social activism and grand-scale social networking, often linked on the same Web page. The millennials' bottom-up digital superstructure was there to be mined, for an amalgam of political organizing, fund-raising and fun, and Mr. Obama's camp knew how to work it. The part of the press that can't tell the difference between Facebook and, say, AOL, was too busy salivating over the Clintons' vintage 1990s roster of fat-cat donors to hear the major earthquake rumbling underground.
 The demographic reshaping of the electoral map, though more widely noted, still isn't fully understood. From Rust Belt Ohio through Tuesday's primaries, cable bloviators have been fixated on the older, white, working-class vote. Their unspoken (and truly condescending) assumption, lately embraced by Mrs. Clinton, is that these voters are Reagan Democrats, cryogenically frozen since 1980, who come in two flavors: rubes who will be duped by a politician backing a gas-tax pander or racists who are out of Mr. Obama's reach. 
 Guess what: there are racists in America and, yes, the occasional rubes (even among Obama voters). Some of them may reside in Indiana, which hasn't voted for a national Democratic ticket since 1964. But there are many more white working-class voters, both Clinton and Obama supporters, who prefer Democratic policies after seven years of G.O.P. failure. And there is little evidence to suggest that there are enough racists of any class in America, let alone in swing states, to determine the results come fall.
 As the Times columnist Charles Blow charted last weekend, Mr. Obama's favorable and unfavorable ratings from white Democrats are both up 5 points since last summer in the Times/CBS poll -- a wash despite all the hyperventilating about Mr. Wright and Bittergate. (By contrast, Mrs. Clinton's favorable rating among black voters fell 36 points while her unfavorable rating rose 17.) Gallup last week found that after the Wright circus Mr. Obama's white support in a matchup against Mr. McCain is still no worse than John Kerry's against President Bush in 2004.
 But this isn't 2004, and the fixation on that one demographic in the Clinton-Obama contest has obscured the big picture. The rise in black voters and young voters of all races in Democratic primaries is re-weighting the electorate. Look, for instance, at Ohio, the crucial swing state that Mr. Kerry lost by 119,000 votes four years ago. This year black voters accounted for 18 percent of the state's Democratic primary voters, up from 14 percent in 2004, an increase of some 230,000 voters out of an overall turnout leap of roughly a million. Voters under 30 (up by some 245,000 voters) accounted for 16 percent, up from 9 in 2004. Those younger Ohio voters even showed up in larger numbers than the perennially reliable over-65 crowd. 
 Good as this demographic shift is for a Democratic ticket led by Mr. Obama, it's even better news that so many pundits and Republicans bitterly cling to the delusion that the Karl Rove playbook of Swift-boating and race-baiting can work as it did four and eight years ago. You can't surf to a right-wing blog or Fox News without someone beating up on Mr. Wright or the other predictable conservative pinata, Michelle Obama.
 This may help rally the anti-Obama vote. But that contingent will be more than offset in November by mobilized young voters, blacks and women, among them many Clinton-supporting Democrats (and independents and Republicans) unlikely to entertain a G.O.P. candidate with a perfect record of voting against abortion rights. Even a safe Republican Congressional seat in Louisiana fell to a Democrat last weekend, despite a campaign by his opponent that invoked Mr. Obama as a bogeyman.
 A few conservatives do realize the game has changed. George Will wrote last week that Mr. Obama was Reaganesque in the stylistic sense that ''his manner lulls his adversaries into underestimating his sheer toughness -- the tempered steel beneath the sleek suits.'' John and Cindy McCain get it too, which is why both last week made a point (he on ''The Daily Show,'' she on ''Today'') of condemning negative campaigning. But even if Mr. McCain keeps his word and stops trying to portray Mr. Obama as the man from Hamas, he can't disown the Limbaugh axis of right-wing race-mongering. That's what's left of his party's base.
 Now that the Obama-Clinton race is over, the new Beltway narrative has it that Mr. McCain, a likable ''maverick'' (who supported Mr. Bush in 95 percent of his votes last year, according to Congressional Quarterly), might override the war, the economy, Bush-loathing and the bankrupt Republican brand to be competitive with Mr. Obama. Anything can happen in politics, including real potential game changers, from Mr. McCain's still-unreleased health records to new excavations of Mr. Obama's history in Chicago. But as long as the likely Democratic nominee keeps partying like it's 2008 while everyone else refights the battles of yesteryear, he will continue to be underestimated every step of the way.

HEADLINE: In Dixie, Signs of a Rising Biracial Politics

BYLINE: By JACK BASS. 
Jack Bass, author of seven books about the modern South, is writing ''Justice Abandoned,'' about the Supreme Court's dismantling of the Constitution's Civil War amendments.

 BODY:
Across the South, Barack Obama's smashing primary victory in North Carolina last week reflects a new reality -- a half-century of rising Republican red tide has crested, with signs of receding.
 A week ago yesterday, Democrats won a special Congressional election in a Louisiana district held by Republicans since 1974. That outcome might well be replicated Tuesday in Mississippi, where a biracial Democratic coalition is optimistic in the second round of another special Congressional election.
 Roger Wicker, a Republican picked to fill the Senate seat vacated by Trent Lott's retirement in December, had easily held the Congressional seat since 1994. Yet former Gov. William Winter, a Democrat, says he has found ''a lot of optimism among Democrats'' for their candidate, Travis Childers, who received 49.4 percent of the vote -- 3 percentage points ahead of his Republican opponent -- three weeks ago, in a first round of voting in which the Republican secretary of state left the names of defeated primary candidates on the ballot. 
 In response to Mr. Obama's energizing of black Southern voters, enlightened self-interest may well convince many of the region's undecided superdelegates to endorse him. Over the last two years, there have been little-noticed Democratic gains in Congressional and state legislative elections across the South, as the solid black Democratic base has been joined by whites disenchanted with the Bush administration. New concern about the economy may be adding momentum.
 The Republican tide surged across the region in the 1990s, bringing large gains in state legislatures and a vault from 39 members of the House of Representatives before the 1992 elections to a 71-53 majority in 2000. But in 2006 and 2007, Democrats in the 11 states of the Confederacy gained six Congressional seats -- a Senate seat in Virginia and five House seats -- and added 30 state legislators.
 Florida's battered Democrats gained two House seats in 2006 and five in the Statehouse. Arkansas elected a Democratic governor to join the party's two United States senators and the majorities of both legislative houses. Democrats control both legislative houses in Mississippi as well.
 The story is most dramatic in Virginia, which in 1976 was the only state in the South that failed to back Jimmy Carter for president. Republicans still hold a majority in the House of Delegates and an 8-3 dominance in seats in United States House. But with their second Democratic governor in a row, the party in control of the State Senate, and the likelihood of Mark Warner being elected their second Democratic senator, Virginians may have reached a Democratic tipping point. 
 The trends suggest a region in transformation, with dynamic economic growth, an expanded black middle class, the arrival of millions of white migrants, the return of scores of thousands of African-American expatriates, and an emerging native white generation with little or no memory of racial segregation. The result has been greater tolerance, an expanded pool of talent, and growing openness to new ideas.
 In the South Carolina presidential primary in January, one factor in Mr. Obama's decisive victory was his ability to draw 25 percent of the white vote against two strong white opponents, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards. But the turnout may have been the strongest sign of change. 
 Almost 100,000 more South Carolinians voted in the Democratic primary than in the Republican contest. The surge smashed the previous Democratic presidential primary record by more than 80 percent -- this in a state where Republicans hold both Senate seats, the offices of governor and attorney general, and both houses of the legislature. The more astute white Democrats saw an energized black electorate as a core element for a future biracial comeback. 
 A bit of Southern political history can help in understanding the present. In 1948 the Dixiecrat campaign of South Carolina's theretofore liberal governor, Strom Thurmond, aroused the region's most racially conservative voters, striking a powerful psychological blow to the Democratic ''solid South'' that had emerged from the Compromise of 1877. (That agreement resolved a disputed election by giving the Republican, Rutherford B. Hayes, the electoral votes from three Southern states, providing a one-vote margin to win the presidency; in return, conservative Southern Democrats obtained the withdrawal of federal troops from Southern states, and Reconstruction ended.) --
 In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican presidential candidate ever to campaign in the South. He won four upper South states in 1952 and added Louisiana in 1956. In 1961, Barry Goldwater launched the Republican ''Southern strategy'' at a gathering of Republican leaders in Atlanta. ''We're not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964,'' he declared, ''so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.'' He voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and Mr. Thurmond, by then a senator, switched parties, bringing his Dixiecrat followers with him. 
 Now things are changing again. In Tennessee's 2006 Senate race, the moderate Democrat Harold Ford Jr., a five-term African-American congressman, faced Chattanooga's mayor, Bob Corker, a moderate Republican. With the race in a dead heat, the Republican National Committee aired an ad ending with an attractive young blonde woman saying with a come-hither look, ''Harold, call me.''
 The ''Southern strategy'' still worked, but barely. Mr. Ford lost, 51 percent to 48 percent, but he did get 40 percent of the white vote. 
 Another sign was George Allen's loss of his Senate seat in Virginia, after he used the term ''macaca'' to insult a heckler. Both experiences reinforced the Democratic allegiances of African-Americans, and Mr. Obama's mass canvassing to register and turn out new voters has now energized an expanding base. 
 Although the effects of past discrimination still include widespread poverty among African-Americans, it's mostly hidden from view. The outlawing of discrimination in employment, under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, has resulted in a unified, biracial work force in which white and black Southerners can more easily acknowledge a common regional identity and biracial culture, as found in music, literature, religion, food and a sense of place. 
 There's been no startlingly new conversation about race yet, but Senator Obama has generated ferment. His landslide victory in North Carolina indicates his Jeremiah Wright troubles have significantly diminished. 
 After the 1990 census, the first Bush administration reached an agreement with civil rights groups under which the Justice Department required legislatures to increase the number of voting districts in which minority groups were concentrated. As a result, Southern blacks more than tripled their numbers in Congress; many now have seniority and status as committee chairmen or other posts. But with the removal of blacks from predominantly white districts that had tended to vote Democratic, Republicans too made huge gains, and the ranks of moderate white Democrats were decimated. Similar patterns emerged in state governments, like South Carolina's.
 Now, however, there are established and seasoned African-American Congressional Democrats like James Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip, and the civil rights hero John Lewis of Georgia, deputy whip. So the potential exists to launch a renewed equivalentof the Voter Education Project of the late 1960s. Such an effort would include energizing often-complacent black legislators and lesser officials elected in safe districts to mobilize their voter base for statewide and Congressional Democratic candidates. 
 The demonstrated capacity of black elected officials to gain and hold white support could lead a future Department of Justice to decide that blacks need not be quite so concentrated in districts any more. And that would open expanded electoral opportunities for Democrats across the South.
 Like Americans across the country, many Southerners, black and white, are troubled by the war in Iraq, rising deficits and a plummeting economy symbolized by the soaring price of gasoline. Race itself is receding as a divisive issue. Like the late afternoon sky across the region, there's a purple hue across one horizon.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the potential rise of biracial politics in the South referred incorrectly to a young man whom George Allen, a Republican senator seeking re-election in Virginia, called a ''macaca,'' widely considered to be a racial slur, during a campaign appearance in 2006. The young man, who was of Indian descent, was conducting opposition research for the Democrats; he was not heckling Mr. Allen.

HEADLINE: Already, Obama And McCain Map Fall Strategies

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
Senators John McCain and Barack Obama are already drawing up strategies for taking each other on in the general election, focusing on the same groups -- including independent voters and Latinos -- and about a dozen states where they think the contest is likely to be decided this fall, campaign aides said. 
 In a sign of what could be an extremely unusual fall campaign, the two sides said Saturday that they would be open to holding joint forums or unmoderated debates across the country in front of voters through the summer. Mr. Obama, campaigning in Oregon, said that the proposal, floated by Mr. McCain's advisers, was ''a great idea.''
 Even before Mr. Obama fully wraps up the Democratic presidential nomination, he and Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, are starting to assemble teams in the key battlegrounds, develop negative advertising and engage each other in earnest on the issues and a combustible mix of other topics, including age and patriotism. 
 Mr. McCain, of Arizona, will spend the next week delivering a series of speeches on global warming, evidence of his intention to battle Mr. Obama for independent voters, a group the two men have laid claim to. Those voters tend to recoil from hard-edged partisan politics, and presumably would be receptive to the kind of bipartisan forum that Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama seemed open to on Saturday.
 Clearly concerned that questions about such things as his association with his former pastor had damaged his standing with independents, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, is likely to embark on a summertime tour intended to highlight the life story that was once central to his appeal. Preliminary plans include a stop in Hawaii, his birthplace, and a major address there at Punchbowl Cemetery, where his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II, is buried.
 Mr. Obama's campaign is firing up voter-registration efforts and sending troops to Ohio and Pennsylvania, states that he lost in the primaries but that his aides said he must win to capture the White House. Mr. McCain's advisers said they had tracked Mr. Obama's struggles with blue-collar voters there and would open campaign headquarters in both states in early June.
 Beyond that, aides to the two men said Latino voters would be central to victory in a swath of Western states now viewed as prime battlefields, including Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. 
 These decisions by Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama to look ahead to the fall reflect their conclusion that it is only a matter of time before Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York steps away from the fight for the Democratic nomination.
 Mr. McCain is looking first to states where President Bush narrowly lost in 2004 and where Mr. Obama lost primaries, starting with New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama is looking to states where he won caucuses and primaries -- including some, like Virginia, that have been solidly Republican in recent presidential elections -- as well as others where he has organizations in place.
 And the two sides have produced television advertisements that will be rolled out as soon as the Democratic contest is officially resolved. These advertisements are directed less at promoting themselves than at undercutting their opponents. 
 The Republican National Committee is planning a $19.5 million advertising campaign to portray Mr. Obama, 46, as out of touch with the country and too inexperienced to be commander in chief, seeking to put him on the defensive before he can use his financial advantage against Mr. McCain, 71, party officials said.
 ''In 1984, Ronald Reagan said, 'I'm not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience,' '' said Frank Donatelli, the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''Well, we are going to exploit Obama's youth and inexperience.''
 On the Democratic side, Mr. Obama's aides this week put finishing touches on advertisements intended to tether Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush and chip away at his image as a maverick, an identity that the aides said they found remained strong with voters. 
 ''By November, every voter will know that McCain is offering a third Bush term,'' said Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe. 
 Advisers to Mr. Obama said their research suggested that Mr. McCain, notwithstanding his high profile in American politics for more than a decade, was not well known to many voters. In particular, Mr. Obama's aides said they would highlight Mr. McCain's opposition to abortion rights to try to stem the flow of disaffected women who backed Mrs. Clinton in the primaries and whom Mr. McCain's aides said they would aggressively court.
 The strategies reflect a lesson from the 2004 presidential campaign, when top aides to Mr. Bush, some of whom are working for Mr. McCain today, began a well-financed television campaign to define and undercut Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, the moment he became his party's nominee.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said they were mindful that he had not yet won the nomination and that six contests remained. Still, they said it was crucial to begin engaging Mr. McCain as soon possible.
 Independent voters have been critical in presidential elections as the country has become polarized along party lines. What makes this election different is the extent to which Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have turned to independent voters for support throughout their careers.
 Historically, independent voters have responded to specific issues and concerns, in particular an emphasis on government reform and an aversion to overly bitter partisan wrangling. Accordingly, Mr. McCain's advisers said they would present him as a senator who frequently stepped across the aisle, while portraying Mr. Obama as a down-the-line Democratic voter who is ideologically out of touch with much of the country. 
 ''We believe America is still a slightly right-of-center country, and that is what McCain is,'' said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. ''If you look at Obama's base and his record, he is a pretty conventional liberal.''
 Mr. Obama's advisers, meanwhile, intend to present Mr. McCain as a product of Washington who moved closer to the Bush administration to win the Republican nomination.
 The two men also have sought to build their candidacies around images of reform, unconstrained by traditional political molds. The rivals are openly discussing staging forums across the country to speak directly to voters, an idea that is by any measure unconventional for a general election campaign.
 Asked about the idea on Saturday, Mr. Obama told reporters in Oregon, ''If I have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with John McCain, that's something that I'm going to welcome.''
 Hispanic voters could find themselves drawing more attention from presidential candidates than ever before. Their votes could prove critical in determining whether Democrats capture states like Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico and whether Republicans have any chance of being competitive in California. 
 Mr. McCain's identification with legislation that would have permitted some illegal immigrants to attain citizenship, a position he moved away from in the primaries but never renounced, gives him an opportunity to compete for those voters, who except for Cubans in Florida appear to have largely settled into the Democratic camp in recent years. 
 Mr. Obama also supported measures that would have allowed immigrants to attain citizenship but struggled to win over Hispanic voters in his primary fight, signaling a potential problem for him in the fall campaign. Mr. Obama's aides said the endorsement by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, one of the nation's most prominent Hispanic leaders, could prove more critical in the general election than in the primary.
 Both sides say the states clearly in play now include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
 Republicans said they hoped to put New Jersey and possibly California into play; Democrats said African-Americans could make Mr. Obama competitive in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Mr. Obama's advisers said they had a strong chance of taking Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia away from the Republican column.
 Mr. Obama has a clear financial advantage. By March 31, Mr. McCain had raised about $80 million and reported about $11 million in cash on hand. Mr. Obama had raised three times as much -- about $240 million -- and had more than four times as much in the bank. 
 But the Republican National Committee, which is permitted to spend money on Mr. McCain's behalf, has raised $31 million, compared with just $6 million by the Democratic National Committee. And Republican officials said they were not concerned about being outspent between now and the conventions.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said that as a result of the five-month series of primaries and caucuses, he had a nearly national campaign apparatus in place and had identified and registered thousands of new voters. That said, they acknowledged that they were at a disadvantage in two important states -- Florida and Michigan -- because those states had early primaries in defiance of the Democratic National Committee, and the candidates agreed not to campaign there.
 ''Organizationally, we have now built very powerful organizations in every state but Michigan and Florida,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''That is one huge silver lining to how long this nomination fight has gone on.''
 Republicans will seek to portray Mr. Obama as out of touch with many voters on issues like abortion and gay rights. Some of Mr. McCain's advisers said they also thought that Mr. Obama had displayed a number of vulnerabilities as a candidate that they would seek to exploit: they argued that he was prone to becoming irritated when tired or pressed on tough questions, that he had trouble connecting with voters in smaller settings and that he had run a campaign light on substance.
 In the eyes of the Obama campaign, Mr. McCain's chief weaknesses include continuing to embrace the Iraq war, his support for extending the administration's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans (he once opposed the idea) and his suggestion that the economy had made ''great progress'' in the last eight years.
 Mr. Obama has said he has no intention of making age -- Mr. McCain is 25 years older -- an overt issue in the general election campaign. Yet in recent weeks, the Obama campaign has made a point of showing their candidate in settings, on the basketball court, as well as surrounded by his young family, that could be seen as telegraphing the message without explicitly raising the issue.

HEADLINE: The Upside of Being Knocked Around

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- So, now that it might finally be over (or maybe close to it, possibly, perhaps), does Senator Barack Obama come out a bloody mess, or a battle-tested warrior?
 In recent weeks, a wiseguy consensus seems to have settled on the former: the idea that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has so weakened Mr. Obama in the race for the Democratic nomination -- so diminished him, distracted him, exhausted him -- that he could be a grievously damaged nominee.
 The wiseguys invoke the Republican race of 1976 and Democratic contest of 1980 as examples of what happens when candidates -- Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, respectively -- get battered in primaries, emerging damaged in the summer and losers in the fall. They mention surveys showing almost 50 percent of Clinton supporters in Indiana telling exit pollsters that they would sooner vote for Senator John McCain or stay home than vote for Mr. Obama. They suggest that by staying in the race, Mrs. Clinton is playing a spoiler's role. 
 But there is a competing view that says that Mrs. Clinton, rather than being a spoiler, has in fact been an unwitting mentor to Mr. Obama, a teaching adversary who made him better. Could competing against Mrs. Clinton have improved Mr. Obama as a candidate in the same way that competing against Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in the 1980s made Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan champions in the 1990s?
 Herein, we cover our pundit posteriors with the requisite ''to be sure'' paragraph in which we acknowledge that the wiseguys are called wise guys for a reason, and it's not entirely sarcastic. And yes, Mr. Obama has all kinds of healing work to do, the Democrats might really be fractured beyond recognition, the wiseguys might be right and Obama might be toast. 
 But amid the supposed carnage, it's easy to overlook that Mr. Obama owes a lot to Mrs. Clinton, that without her challenge, he would be a much different candidate today, and not necessarily a stronger one. Reasons abound:
 1. SHE MADE HIM A GIANT KILLER
 No matter what happens in the fall, if Mr. Obama goes on to win the nomination, he will be remembered as the candidate who beat the Clintons.
 ''He is stronger for having beaten the champion,'' says Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and former aide to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. ''Period, case closed.'' Clinton-slaying brings with it a level of stature and prestige that, say, John Edwards-slaying or Joe Biden-slaying never could. Some aides to Michael Dukakis were thrilled in December 1987 when Gary Hart re-entered the Democratic primary race after dropping out that May, thinking it would give Mr. Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, a giant to vanquish (as opposed to ''the Seven Dwarfs,'' which the Democratic field of that year had been dubbed). Mr. Hart, however, was a nonfactor by the time the voting started, and wound up dropping out again in March.
 2. SHE MADE HIM ANGRY
 Mr. Obama's relentless hope-hope-hope campaign put him in danger of being seen as soft, a 2008 version of the ''wimp factor'' that haunted George H. W. Bush 20 years ago (before Mr. Bush, then vice president, embarked on one of the most aggressive, some say dirty, presidential campaigns in recent memory). The term ''Obambi'' entered the lexicon late last year, but has barely been heard of late.
 Indeed, a candidate gains a certain political street credibility by being in a fight. Aides to the current President Bush when he was governor of Texas said he was greatly enhanced by the challenge posed by Mr. McCain in 2000.
 ''One of Bush's liabilities coming in was that he was seen as a silver spooner who had lived a charmed political life,'' said Dan Bartlett, a top aide to Mr. Bush in Texas and in the White House. Overcoming Mr. McCain, Mr. Bartlett said, was a show of toughness. ''He took a punch and got up off the mat,'' Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bush. ''You could argue the same about Obama now.''
 3. SHE LED HIM TO THE WORKING CLASS
 If Mr. Obama goes on to win the nomination, one of the signature challenges of his general election campaign will be his ability to win over the traditional Democratic blue-collar voters that have flocked to Mrs. Clinton in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. In a sense, Mrs. Clinton's success with this constituency exposed his vulnerability with it -- a vulnerability he might not have known existed to such an extent had Mrs. Clinton dropped out early and Mr. Obama breezed to the nomination. 
 In recent weeks, Mr. Obama started doing more retail events, talked more about his family's economic challenges growing up (to address a creeping rap of elitism, however ill-fitting that label is). He saw what played well (a tough-love opposition to the gas tax holiday) and what needed work (his bowling). He worked to escape the pigeonhole that he was a big arena rock star. He has recently done fewer big rallies and more one-of-you performances (pick-up hoops games in Indiana). He seemed to heed Mrs. Clinton's recurring criticism that Mr. Obama was all about ''creating an atmosphere'' and ''giving great speeches.'' There have been fewer shots of a larger-than-life Mr. Obama at a podium, more of him face-to-face with workers (or waffles). More listening photo ops, in other words, and fewer talking ones. 
 4. THE WRIGHT FIGHT
 While this doesn't involve Mrs. Clinton directly, the long primary battle allowed the emergence, and re-emergence, of Mr. Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., to take place now, rather than later. It's generally assumed that Mr. Wright would have been an issue at some point, so better for Mr. Obama now than October.
 ''It's entirely likely that we'll hear from Reverend Wright again,'' said Dan Payne, a Democratic media consultant. ''But from now on, the Obama people will be able to play it as old news.''
 As a corollary to the ''made him angry'' benefit, Mr. Obama's handling of the Wright controversy signaled an evolution that could serve him well. ''The Reverend Wright thing struck me as Barack learning to be president,'' said Richard Ben Cramer, author of ''What It Takes,'' the exhaustive examination of six candidates for president in 1988. ''When your friend causes you trouble, a president gets rid of those friends. It may come to pass that they become friends again. But for the time being, this is more important.''
 5. SHE HELPED DEFINE HIM
 Consider Mr. Dukakis and John Kerry, both serious and sober sons of Massachusetts who enjoyed relatively easy primary races before getting beaten in their respective general elections in 1988 and 2004 by their respective George Bushes. Both could have benefited greatly from tougher early tests. ''Tough primaries can give you antibodies,'' Mr. Rogers said. 
 Bill Carrick, who ran the 1988 Democratic presidential campaign of Representative Richard Gephardt, recalled that Mr. Dukakis had been pilloried for claiming that the election would be more about competence than ideology. ''It was a weak message,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''And he could have honed it into something much more meaningful if he had been challenged more in the primaries.''
 Likewise, Mr. Kerry emerged relatively unscathed from his nomination fight, but also largely undefined. ''That gave Bush an opening to fill in the blanks,'' said Stephanie Cutter, a top communications aide to Mr. Kerry's campaign. Mr. Bush did just this that spring, Ms. Cutter recalls, by running ads ridiculing Mr. Kerry for his line about supporting a funding provision for Iraq before opposing it. The Kerry campaign had no money to respond, and by the time it did, the damage was done.
 By contrast, Mr. Obama is now a better prepared and better defined candidate, and no doubt a stronger one, than he would have been without his rival. He went through 21 debates against a tough opponent, Mrs. Clinton, and improved steadily (with an exception in Philadelphia last month). He has made mistakes, but nothing fatal, and nothing he can't learn from.
 6. AND HAS THE RACE BEEN SO BAD?
 It has become a kind of operating assumption that the Democratic race has been a bloodbath, with mud slung in all directions and grudges that will never be resolved. Throughout the campaign, Mrs. Clinton has pooh-poohed this idea. ''There really is no cause for nervousness,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a fund-raising event in Washington last week. She has seen and been in far worse, she said.
 So have others. ''I find the idea that this has been such a negative campaign to be way over the top,'' Mr. Carrick said. There have been some heated moments, mistakes and gaffes, he said. ''But we haven't seen the thermonuclear warfare in paid advertising. We haven't seen a tremendous ideological divide like we did in 1968 and 1972.'' 
 Mr. Carrick and others point out that ideological splits can be much more toxic to a nominee than stylistic or even demographic ones. For instance, the Democrats were divided over Vietnam, a highly emotional issue that laid bare irreconcilable fault lines. Some years later, a cultural and ideological gap was exposed by the bitter campaign between Edward M. Kennedy and Mr. Carter in 1980. Others point to the primary challenges posed by Ronald Reagan against Mr. Ford in 1976 and Pat Buchanan against the first President Bush in 1992. But as has been said so many times, Obama v. Clinton has been waged in uncharted territory, a battle of firsts. 
 Mrs. Clinton has also been criticized for using arguments against Mr. Obama that Republicans might use in the fall. She has suggested, in so many words, that Mr. Obama is all talk, that he is not experienced, that he might not be ready to be commander in chief.
 ''Yeh,'' Mr. Rogers said, ''like we couldn't have thought of that.''

HEADLINE: Recession? What Recession? May 4-10

 BODY:
THE NEWS A Monet landscape and a sculpture by Rodin brought record prices at a Christie's sale of Impressionist and Modern art.
 BEHIND THE NEWS So much for fears that the economic slowdown might hurt sales. The weak dollar made prices seem cheap to Europeans, who represented 52 percent of the buyers. Russian buying was also significant. Monet's ''Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil'' (1873) fetched $41.4 million; $35 million had been expected. Rodin's ''Eve, the Large Version,'' sold for a record $18.9 million; the expected price was $9 million to $12 million. ''It was a bit like playing the lottery -- you just don't known if it's your night,'' one dealer said. 
 THE NEWS Revenues from Disney theme parks and resorts rose 11 percent in the first three months of the year over the same period last year, the Walt Disney company reported. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mickey Mouse proved impervious to rising fuel costs and the housing crisis. Disney said the weak dollar kept American vacationers closer to home and attracted foreign tourists. Hotel bookings were also trending higher than last year's, the company said. Disney's parks had faltered in past recessions. But with most of its hotel rooms priced more moderately than they were in previous slowdowns, Disney said it was better prepared this time. 
 THE NEWS The superhero movie ''Iron Man'' sold an estimated $104.3 million in tickets on its first weekend.
 BEHIND THE NEWS It was the second-biggest debut for a nonsequel ever, behind ''Spiderman.'' With movie attendance down about 6 percent this year, the opening raised hopes for a strong summer -- perhaps approaching last summer's record $4.1 billion season. Three more superhero movies are set for this summer, featuring the Incredible Hulk, Batman and Hellboy. ''This is a good thing for all of Hollywood when you're talking about a film with a second-tier superhero opening at $100 million,'' said Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. 
 THE NEWSNBC Universal said that it would charge advertisers $3 million for a 30-second commercial on its 2009 Super Bowl broadcast.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The price is up about 10 percent from an average $2.7 million Fox Broadcasting charged for 30-second spots on this year's Super Bowl, watched by a record 97.5 million viewers. The cost of a 30-second ad would break down to $100,000 per second. But NBC, which is also televising the Summer Olympics, said it was confident advertisers would pay the price, The Wall Street Journal reported, because of the ratings success of Super Bowl XLII, in which the New York Giants beat the New England Patriots. 
 THE NEWSJohn McCain raised $7 million in one night at a fund-raiser in New York hosted by the city's former mayor (and one-time McCain rival) Rudolph Giuliani.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The Republican had raised $76.6 million, according to his March 31 report (compared with Barack Obama's $234 million and Hillary Rodham Clinton's $189 million). Not bad, considering nearly all of their money (McCain, 93 percent; Obama, nearly 100 percent; and Clinton, 91 percent, the Center for Responsive Politics says) has come from individuals who are limited to giving $2,300 in the primary and $2,300 in the general election. That's a lot of people opening up their wallets.

HEADLINE: New Rules and Economy Strain Adoption Agencies

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
Faced with a tightening of federal regulations governing foreign adoptions, and suffering from a downturn in business, international adoption agencies in the United States are finding 
 themselves in financial straits and closing their doors in unprecedented numbers, experts say.
 At least 15 percent of agencies that specialize in international adoptions have recently shut down, are expected to do so this year or will probably merge with other agencies to survive, according to the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy and education group in Virginia.
In some cases, the closings have come without warning, leaving people without the thousands of dollars in fees they paid to an agency or the child they had thought would finally be theirs. 
 They have also led to lawsuits and criminal investigations, as some struggling agencies have apparently turned to more desperate business practices to stay afloat. 
 ''I don't think anyone thought we'd see the number of closings that we have,'' the adoption council's vice president of training and agency services, Chuck Johnson, said. ''We've heard of agencies still collecting fees from families and then announcing they're going out of business the next week.''
 For couples like Susan and Jim Paulson of Lafayette, Colo., what began as an aching desire to have another child turned quickly into a nightmare.
 In 2006, with their son Quinn, 2, dying from a degenerative neurological disorder, the Paulsons decided to adopt a third child. Their first-born, a boy, now 6, would belonely without his brother, they reasoned. And so would they.
 After contacting Lisa Novak, the director, along with her husband, of the Claar Foundation, a Boulder adoption agency, the Paulsons paid roughly $11,000 in processing fees and waited for the arrival of a baby girl from Nepal.
 But after the adoption collapsed amid political turmoil in Nepal last May, the Paulsons said they asked for some of their money back but never received a response from Ms. Novak. She was arrested on March 26 on charges of defrauding families of tens of thousands of dollars by promising adoptions but never completing them.
 ''It was devastating,'' Ms. Paulson said. ''We really trusted them.''
 Ms. Novak's lawyer, Lance Goff, said that there was no merit to the charges, and that the Paulsons knew the risks of adopting in Nepal and could have continued working with Claar to adopt a child in another country. Under their contract, he said, the Paulsons were not entitled to their money back.
 ''No adoption agency can guarantee a couple a child,'' Mr. Goff said, adding that what agencies did was help couples ''put together the paperwork so they can adopt, and there's no evidence that the Claar Foundation breached that obligation to its clients.''
 Mr. Goff added that prospective parents ''need to have the fortitude and the flexibility to roll with the punches if they are committed to getting a child.''
 The story of the Paulsons, and that of other people the Claar agency is accused of swindling, exemplifies a trend in a field that until recently operated largely free of federal regulation.
 International adoptions in the United States fell to 19,613 children in the last fiscal year, from 22,884 in 2004, with one factor being red tape in countries like Russia and China making it more difficult for people to adopt there.
 On April 25, the Vietnamese government announced it would stop processing new adoption applications from Americans after July 1, following a report by the United States Embassy in Hanoi that accused the adoption system there of widespread corruption. The Vietnamese government has denied the charges. And in Guatemala, the government has placed a temporary one-month hold on pending adoptions as each case is reviewed because the system there has been plagued with corruption.
 The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which went into effect in the United States on April 1, is also having an impact.
 The convention requires that to become accredited, international adoption agencies must comply with uniform standards that include training for prospective parents, establishing staff 
 qualifications and transparent bookkeeping. But the standards apply only to agencies that bring children to the United States from countries that agreed to abide by the convention, more than 70 in all.
 ''From what I've seen, it looks like some of those agencies have looked at the Hague standards and simply can't meet them,'' Kemy Monahan, who coordinates adoption compliance with the Hague Convention for the State Department, said of many of the agencies that have gone out of business recently.
 Ms. Monahan and Mr. Johnson said they thought that the Hague regulations, intended to safeguard adoptions better, would eventually weed out agencies that operated on the fringes of
 the law.
 That seems to be happening already in some places.
 In Michigan, a district court judge recently barred the operators of Waiting Angels Adoption Services from participating in adoptions for nearly three years. The state attorney eneral's office has also asked the judge to order the operators to refund $327,000 to prospective parents who paid the agency to facilitate adoptions of children from Guatemala that never took place, said a spokesman for the office, Matt Frendewey.
 In Santa Barbara, Calif., the director of the Adoption International Program, Orson Mozes, was charged on April 1 with 62 felony counts of theft by false pretenses. Mr. Mozes, who has since disappeared, is accused of taking more than $1 million from families who paid to adopt children from Eastern Europe, adoptions that rarely happened, according to an arrest affidavit.
 Reece and Amanda Heinrich of Holt, Mich., said they were out more than $14,000 after an adoption arranged through Waiting Angels fell apart. The Heinrichs, who are unable to have children of their own, fell in love with a baby boy from Guatemala after the agency showed them pictures and a video of him.
 They named the baby Jamyson, but after waiting more than a year, the Heinrichs said, Waiting Angels told them there were complications with the birth mother and that Jamyson was no longer available for adoption. They were refused a refund, they said.
 The couple have since adopted twins through a domestic agency, but the experience has left scars.
 ''I'd honestly rather get stabbed in the stomach than have to go through that again,'' Mr. Heinrich said. ''We were relying on somebody to help us create a family, and then to have our 
 hearts ripped out. I considered Jamyson my son.''
 In Colorado, on the heels of the police investigation into the Claar Foundation, the state Department of Human Services found, in a report released May 1, that 10 of 22 local international adoption agencies whose financial records they examined were losing money. As a result, Colorado will tighten its licensing standards to require that agencies maintain 
 two months' worth of operating costs in reserves and prohibit them from charging an entire adoption fee up front, said Liz McDonough, a department spokeswoman.
 The Paulsons and others have filed lawsuits against Claar and its directors. This year, the Paulsons won a $5,000 judgment in small claims court from Ms. Novak, but Ms. Paulson said she had not received any money.
 Mr. Goff, Ms. Novak's lawyer, said Claar had no revenue because it was no longer operating. Ms. Novak is scheduled to appear in Boulder County Court on May 19.
 The Paulsons said their experience had left them too traumatized and without enough money to try adopting again. The quilt they bought for a new daughter has been stashed away in a closet, a list of potential names discarded.
 Worst of all, Quinn Paulson died on Feb. 5.
 His older brother ''kept asking when his new sister was coming home, that she would be able to play with him all the time,'' Ms. Paulson said. ''It feels really unfair.''

HEADLINE: 2 Men Are Killed in Separate Cases in Queens and Brooklyn

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON and ANN FARMER

 BODY:
One man was slashed to death in Queens and another was fatally shot in Brooklyn in two unrelated cases on Saturday, the police said.
 One man, identified as Henry Frasier, 40, was cut with a razor and killed late Saturday night in a fight with a neighbor outside his cousin's home in Queens, the police said. 
 The fight took place shortly before 10 p.m. outside of 110-15 207th Street in Queens Village, the police said. Mr. Frasier, who was a veteran of the first Persian Gulf war, was pronounced dead at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Two other people involved in the fight were treated for minor injuries at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
 Benjamin Dunn, 30, a neighbor of Mr. Frasier's cousin, was arrested and charged with manslaughter and assault, the police said, although the police account said it was Mr. Frasier who started the fight.
 The second killing took place in Brooklyn, where a man identified as Saquan Toler, 21, was found shot three times at the corner of Schenectady Avenue and Sterling Place in Crown Heights shortly after 10 p.m., the police said. He was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center. There were no arrests in that case, the police said on Sunday. 
 In Queens, Mr. Frasier's mother, Louise Frasier, 64, said that her son, who had recently worked as a security systems installer but was most recently unemployed, was prone to depression and had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
 ''He has been going through things,'' she said, ''Depression, medication.'' She said the symptoms first appeared after Mr. Frasier returned from duty on a Navy aircraft carrier in the gulf war in Iraq. ''They teach them to kill,'' she said. ''They don't realize how it affects them. After he came back, he wasn't the same.'' 
 On Saturday, Mr. Frasier was at the home of his cousin, Phelix Boatwright, 58, watching basketball when he stepped outside, and the argument began, Mr. Boatwright said. 
 Mr. Frasier's family believed he had known Mr. Dunn from the neighborhood, but it was unclear what the argument was about. Mr. Frasier struck Mr. Dunn on the side of the head with a bottle, and punched and kicked him, the police said. The bottle shattered, cutting one of the wounded victims, a woman, the police said. 
 Mr. Dunn fled and Mr. Frasier was chasing him, the police said, when Mr. Dunn turned and slashed Mr. Frasier with a razor. 
 The second wounded victim, a man, was cut trying to break up the fight. 
 ''He'd fight a lot,'' Mr. Boatwright said of Mr. Frasier, but he added: ''He's all right. He didn't deserve that.'' 
 It fell to Mrs. Frasier to identify her son's body, she said. 
 ''Of all days,'' she said. ''Mother's Day.''

HEADLINE: The Politicians and a Gas Tax Holiday

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''The Tax Trickery Spreads'' (editorial, May 8), against suspending gas taxes this summer, is correct in noting that this very bad idea is spreading to the states in a ''chain reaction.'' 
 If the gas taxes were suspended, there would predictably be efforts by antitax forces, populists and politicians seeking re-election to make the change permanent, with the spurious claim that reinstating the tax would be a ''tax increase.'' 
 Since fuel supplies are not likely to increase much for some years, and since world fuel use will surely increase as China and India industrialize, high gasoline prices will be with us in the foreseeable future. 
 We need to find ways to decrease our use of gasoline and other fuels, rather than to increase the demand for a major commodity with fairly inelastic supply, which would only enrich oil exporters and further harm our economy. 
 Gerald M. Levitis
 Mahopac, N.Y., May 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You are correct to point out that a temporary cessation of the gas tax is political pandering. You also say that ''Americans must find ways to curb their use of fossil fuels'' and that higher fuel prices would ensure less use. True, but this sounds like a recipe for slowing the economy, and perhaps spurring a recession. 
 The higher prices we face are due to a lack of supply, caused by our steadfast refusal as a country to use our own resources. The only way to lower prices, and remove the risk of economic recession, is to mitigate our dependency on foreign sources of energy.
 There is now no reliable or cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels. So we must accept reality and drill on our soil and build our own refineries. If our elected officials lack the will to make this happen, we need to replace them.
 Paul Marasciullo
 Laurel Hollow, N.Y., May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Clinton gas tax plan is the right one. By your own calculations an 18-cent reduction in the gas tax could save 10 cents at the pump, or $6.25 each month per driver. It would be more than covered by the increased tax on oil companies.
 Even in the worst case, if supply and demand drove prices right back up to where they would have been, there would be no loss to the United States Treasury. The best thing about the Clinton plan is that it opens the door to taxing the oil companies the way other American companies are taxed.
 In the long term we should eliminate the tax subsidies given to oil companies, not go after windfall profits. When they pay the same taxes as everyone else, there will be no need to tax the windfall. Keeping the current tax structure is the real trickery. Paul Ferber
 New York, May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 A great first step toward curbing our use of fossil fuels would be for employers to embrace telecommuting in a meaningful way. Particularly for people who spend an hour or more on the road each way commuting to work, a day or more a week working from home would reduce household gas costs significantly, while increasing their time for family or exercise -- two things that tend to be sacrificed on the altar of work. 
 Telecommuting would also cut down on pollution, traffic and high levels of unhealthy stress for workers who sit in gridlock morning and night. Lots of companies claim to support telecommuting, but the idea has yet to catch on in the mainstream, at least here in Washington. Julie Lloyd
 Washington, May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''States Get In on Calls for a Gas Tax Holiday'' (front page, May 6):
 There are literally dozens of creative and visionary proposals to reduce gasoline dependency. The consensus from virtually all economists that a gas tax abatement will do nothing to blunt our extreme dependence on oil should be a wake-up call to the public to demand better answers from the candidates.
 Real solutions are needed urgently, so it would be nice if the governors and presidential candidates used their bully pulpits to advocate tax breaks that actually accomplish this. Such as selling electric vehicles with no sales tax, or hybrids sold at half the normal sales tax. Perhaps free vehicle registration for electric vehicles.
 Other steps could be a nationally coordinated program of car pooling, ride shares, more mass transit and incentives for future communities to be planned around transit efficiency. So far Barack Obama is the only one who did not pander on this issue, so maybe he can take it to the next level.
 Brian Sullivan
 Valley Stream, N.Y., May 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Supporting a gas tax moratorium, Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida said, ''I'm supposed to respond to the people and try to make them happy.''
 The voters will be happy, and the bill will be passed on to their grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New Economics Of Hacking

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
New Economics
 Of Hacking
 To make money, you have to move up the economic food chain into higher-value, more profitable work and markets. That economic fact of life applies to nations, companies and people. 
 A study released last week shows how this natural law is being applied in the subculture of criminal computer hackers. Pilfered credit card numbers and bank account PINs have become commodities on shadowy Web sites where stolen digital information is bought and sold.
 Company e-mail messages, business documents and personal health information are the new targets of choice for hackers, according to Finjan, a San Jose, Calif., manufacturer of Web security software and appliances.
 ''Money is the motivation for criminal hackers, and it is this kind of information that has become most valuable,'' said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, the company's chief technology officer. 
 A couple of years ago, credit card numbers and bank account PINs sold for $100 or more each on those sites, Mr. Ben-Itzhak said. Now, the price is down to $10 or $20, compared with $150 to $200 for some of the newer documents.
 Patients' records, he said, apparently were plucked from personal computers in doctors' offices at what he would identify only as an ''organization'' on the East Coast. STEVE LOHR Google-Yahoo:

HEADLINE: PBS Revives a Show That Shines a Light on Reading

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DAVIS

 BODY:
Steady work has been scarce for actors in gorilla suits since ''The Electric Company'' went dark in 1977. 
 But all that changes this week as shooting begins in Washington Heights and the Lower East Side on an ambitious reboot of the PBS literacy series that turned on a generation of schoolchildren to the rudiments of reading. The first graduates of ''Sesame Street'' found in ''The Electric Company'' a companion piece that relied on pun-filled sketches, Spider-Man cameos, and lots of primate shtick, all backed by a Motown beat.
 Refitted for the age of hip-hop and informed by decades of further educational research on reading, the 2009 version of ''The Electric Company'' is a weekly, more danceable version of its former daily self. The series, which is expected to make its debut in January, faces challenges the original never did (trying to stand out amid so much children's programming and to shake the stigma of educational television) as well as familiar ones (trying to make reading a positive experience for youngsters). 
 ''It's the old one mixed with 'High School Musical' and a Dr Pepper commercial,'' said Linda Simensky, senior director of programming for PBS Kids, a block of children's shows that will include ''The Electricity Company.'' There's a touch of ''Fame'' to it, given its cast of culturally diverse city kids who sing and dance, as well as nods to the original series. (A cameo has been offered to Rita Moreno, a regular on the original ''Electric Company,'' remembered for her show-opening exultation, ''Hey, you guyyyyys!'') 
 Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit media corporation formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop, will once again produce. As before, when the show began in 1971, it is still directed at viewers 6 to 9 years old. 
 Ms. Simensky, 44, said the rebirth would be happy news for the Garanimals generation. '' 'The Electric Company' was my favorite show in third grade, along with Bugs Bunny,'' she said.
 In keeping with the original show's ties to theater (many in the cast, like Morgan Freeman, had stage backgrounds), the new head writer is a Tony-Award-nominated playwright and lyricist, Willie Reale, with experience in children's theater (''A Year With Frog and Toad''). 
 In the first episode Mr. Reale establishes the show's conceit: Somewhere in the big city lies a natural-foods diner that is headquarters to a not-so-secret society known as the Electric Company. The four semi-superheroes who meet there -- Keith, Jessica, Lisa and Hector -- have pledged not only to use their powers for good but also to eat sensible portions of healthy meals. The gang ranges in age from 13 to 20 and can scramble, recall, project and animate words in astounding ways.
 Plotting nefariously is a clutch of comical misfits and poseurs known as the Pranksters. ''They're villains without being villainous,'' said Scott Cameron, the show's research director, ''just neighborhood kids who cause chaos.'' 
 The show will join an expanding lineup of reading-readiness shows on PBS Kids. It will differ from the original in that each episode will emphasize vocabulary from five ''conceptual domains'' (animals, the body, weather, ecosystems and the solar system) and tell a story in multiple acts, interspersed with splashes of animated and live-action lessons in phonics. As the last of the Pranksters was being cast in late April, taping had begun in a small studio near Lincoln Center in Manhattan on short segments. They will carry the show's educational load, a curriculum forged over two years of research and testing. As has been done with previous Sesame Workshop series, ''The Electric Company'' will undergo extensive testing during production and after its first season's 26 episodes have been broadcast.
 Mr. Cameron and his associates searched for a format that would smoothly incorporate educational goals, the most challenging of which is to reverse negative attitudes about reading among children in second and third grades. Test audiences of low-income students in Baltimore, San Antonio and Carbondale, Ill., provided early indications that the series might be effective. 
 In the old, dull days of children's TV ''The Electric Company'' shone brightly. But it remains to be seen whether a vigorous campaign to build awareness for the revival will cut through the clutter of diversions now available to children.
 ''Media has evolved and learning styles have evolved,'' said Malore I. Brown, the project director, who as a child in Freeport, the Bahamas, picked up ''The Electric Company'' via a signal that drifted in from Miami. ''We want to make this a 360-degree experience.'' That includes an online component along with a magazine being developed by Marvel Comics. Sneak-peek video will begin appearing on PBS in September.
 The Sesame Workshop hopes to raise $25 million for the project, $17.7 million of which has been provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting through the federal Department of Education. Twenty low-income, low-literacy pockets across the country will also be the focus of an extensive outreach program in the months leading to the show's premiere. 
 ''There will be billboards, bus ads, notices in their dollar stores, television and radio ads, all about the power of reading,'' Randell M. Bynum, who is coordinating the outreach, said. ''When the show comes on in January, these communities will have already been primed to the importance of reading and bombarded with resources.''
 Ms. Bynum, along with the production team and cast members, has been testing strategies at P.S. 188 on Houston Street in the Lower East Side. A group of that school's students in first through fourth grades recently screened a 30-minute demonstration of the series, which included a music-video tribute to the transformational power of the silent E, the sneaky letter that can turn cap into cape and at into ate. 
 Music for the series will come from three people involved in the Broadway rap-salsa-pop musical ''In the Heights'': the director Thomas Kail, the co-arranger and orchestrator Bill Sherman and the actor Christopher Jackson. 
 In a category by himself is the beat-box artist Shockwave (Chris Sullivan). Besides slinging hash at the Electric Diner, he speaks in one-word bursts only -- no sentences -- and appears in guises like the much missed gorilla and a butcher who cleaves words. But it is his D.J. routine that may be mimicked on playgrounds next year. He appears to be scratching syllables from dueling turntables to form words. It all emanates from his ''bruh-bruh-AIN, bruh-bruh-AIN, brain.''
 The producers said that they hoped the show would help head off a vexing problem: the wall that struggling students hit in fourth grade, the turning point at which school is no longer about learning to read, but reading to learn. As it was for the first incarnation of ''The Electric Company,'' the target audience this time is the economically disadvantaged child. 
 ''Lower-income kids are already behind the eight ball by the time they reach kindergarten,'' said Karen Fowler, the show's executive producer. ''By second grade language is flying by them, and they have no reference for it. That's devastating.'' 
 It's a familiar refrain to Joan Ganz Cooney, the 78-year-old chairwoman of the executive committee of Sesame Workshop's board who, along with Lloyd Morrisett, led development of the first incarnation of ''The Electric Company.'' After she previewed the new version, she said in an interview, she told the producers, ''Make it funnier.'' 
 Ms. Fowler happily obliged. ''We saw that we needed to be sillier at the 8-year-old level,'' she said. ''Bring on the pratfalls.''

HEADLINE: A Kosher Soup Kitchen Offers a Dignified Place to Eat, and Steak for One Day

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
The poor and hungry people at the Masbia soup kitchen in Borough Park hardly fit a bums-and-bag ladies stereotype.
 The storefront, on 14th Street in central Brooklyn, in one of New York's largest Hasidic communities, serves only hot kosher meals. Its operators say it is the only soup kitchen of its kind in the city, and at first glance it seems to have a dress code that is also unique. The men -- and it is mostly men -- wear dark suits, white button-down shirts and black hats.
 ''From a distance, they may look no different than a rich man, but if you look closer, you can see the difference,'' said Mordechai Mandelbaum, a co-founder of the soup kitchen who was also dressed neatly in the traditional Hasidic garb on Thursday night. 
 Indeed, closer scrutiny of some of the patrons revealed subtle signs of hardship: a slightly smudged shirt, a somewhat rumpled suit, a bruised felt hat. The few women were generally seated away from the men and dressed in traditional skirts and wigs, some with small children.
 Thursday was more crowded than usual because the kitchen was serving steaks -- juicy, 16-ounce kosher shell steaks. Seconds were even available.
 A soup kitchen that serves steak might sound rather luxurious, but steak night comes only once a year at Masbia, in honor of Grand Rabbi Yeshaya Steiner of Kerestir, Hungary, who died in 1925 and who was known for feeding the hungry and other acts of charity. 
 His poster-size likeness was taped to the wall behind the steaming pans of steaks and side dishes of carrots, potato kugel and gefilte fish. There were also pickles and sauerkraut, and fruit cups for dessert. Each table had bottles of cold seltzer and a memorial candle, in honor of Rabbi Steiner. 
 ''Word got out that today was a special day,'' said Alexander Rapaport, who co-founded Masbia in 2005 and who made sure steak night was listed on a Yiddish news hot line. That might have accounted for the long line when the kitchen opened at 4 p.m.
 Mr. Mandelbaum shrugged. ''Listen, people are hungry,'' he said. 
 ''At my synagogue, they were saying, 'A 16-ounce steak? Who's going to finish it?' '' said Menashe Silbert, another official of the soup kitchen, which has a dozen tables and was designed to resemble a restaurant. Tall fake plants and screens between tables give diners some privacy.
 Masbia, the Hebrew word for ''satiate,'' serves 160 meals five nights a week. ''We wanted to make it look like a restaurant,'' Mr. Rapaport said, ''because people in our community don't want to be seen going to a soup kitchen -- it's highly embarrassing.
 ''But we've had people come in and eat and ask where they pay. We have to tell them, 'No, you don't pay.' People here are kosher so they won't go to any other soup kitchen. It's come here or starve.'' 
 Being down and out in Borough Park may seem to conflict with the area's image of well-to-do families. But, as elsewhere, jobs have been lost and rents have climbed, and then there are the rising costs of sending children to yeshivas and the extra expense of putting kosher food on the table. Mr. Rapaport said it was not unusual to see parents and older people alike hoarding free snacks at synagogue, and families on food stamps and government assistance.
 Two men at Table 6 would give only their first names. ''I don't want people in my synagogue to know I come here,'' said one of the men, Meyer, 55, who lives in Flatbush. 
 Meyer said he had been unemployed for six months and recently went back to work as an optician. He enjoys the camaraderie at the soup kitchen.
 ''They treat you like a mensch, not a second-class citizen,'' he said.
 His dining companion, Eli, 57, said that he had recently been divorced and was short of money.
 ''I'd rather be home with my wife and two kids, but I don't have them anymore,'' he said. ''It's just me and my four walls.'' He added that he would have preferred his steak rare, rather than well done, but added, ''I guess beggars can't be choosers.''
 Mr. Rapaport said, ''We try to treat everyone equal: There's a saying that even in the synagogue, the fishmonger sits with the stockbroker.''
 Borough Park is an insular neighborhood where many of the signs are in Yiddish. There are adults who have grown up here who never learned English. Mr. Rapaport said he finally learned it ''from listening to NPR.''
 Some of the kitchen's $500,000 annual budget comes from city and state aid, but most comes from local donations, Mr. Rapaport said. Mostly, money is solicited from couples who are getting married, drawing on an old-world tradition of donating to the needy just before marriage. 
 ''We remind them that contributing helps them avoid bad luck,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said, lifting an eyebrow mischievously. ''Jewish guilt is very powerful.'' Mr. Rapaport said the kitchen served Jewish and gentile, rich and poor. Just then, two men in casual clothes walked in, looking a bit uneasy and wearing creased oversize yarmulkes.
 ''These guys think you have to be Orthodox to come here,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. ''We call those things funeral yarmulkes. You can tell they just put them on.''
 The two women at Table 3 said that they had fallen on hard times, and that it cost much more money to keep kosher.
 ''This place is a godsend,'' said one, a 50-year-old woman who had lost her job as a legal secretary. ''And the steak is very good. My father was a kosher butcher, and meat, I know.''

 Given the deadly dangers associated with crossing the border through the desert since the mid-1990s, unauthorized temporary immigrants have been afraid to return to their home countries.
 And with today's restrictionists turning our ''nation's de facto immigration policy'' into making ''life untenable for illegal immigrants,'' we are faced with a new problem: a decrease in immigrant's remittances to their loved ones that will lead to more economic displacement in our hemisphere.
 The solution, it seems to me, is a simple human rights sensibility easily sustained by economic rationality: legalize and legitimize the millions of workers who have helped, historically, to keep an economic system, indeed American society and the Western Hemisphere, more competitive globally.

HEADLINE: Ecuador Opposes Outpost In American War on Drugs

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: MANTA, Ecuador 

 BODY:
The scene at the Manta Ray Cafe, a mess hall here at the most prominent American military outpost in South America, suggests all is normal.
 A television tuned to Fox Sports beams in a golf tournament. Ecuadorean contractors serve sloppy Joes near refrigerators bulging with Dr Pepper and Gatorade. Air Force personnel in jumpsuits preparing to board an Awacs surveillance plane leaf through dog-eared paperbacks.
 But by next year, if President Rafael Correa gets his way, this base will be gone, and, with it, one of the most festering sources of controversy in Washington's long war on drugs. 
 ''It's not panic mode yet,'' said Steven Tate, 42, a Clearwater, Fla., contractor who moved here two years ago after retiring from the Air Force to help run the base fire station. ''I'm hoping a miracle will happen that will allow us to stay.''
 To the Bush administration, the American air station here is a critical component in the war on drugs in the Andes. The 180 service members based here conduct about 100 flights a month over the Pacific looking for drug boats from Colombia, the source of about 90 percent of the cocaine used in the United States. 
 Last year, those flights led to about 200 cocaine seizures, the Air Force said.
 But to Ecuadoreans, Manta is a flash point in a regional debate over the limits of American power in Latin America.
 In 1999, American officials negotiated a 10-year agreement with President Jamil Mahuad to set up the elaborate airborne radar detection project at Manta, a port of 250,000. The deal did not require the United States to pay rent to Ecuador. Nor did it allow Americans stationed here to be judged in Ecuadorean courts for crimes committed in Ecuador. Nor was it submitted to the Ecuadorean Congress for approval.
 Mr. Mahuad was toppled in a military coup a few weeks later. 
 To Mr. Correa, 45, who opposes renewing the agreement allowing the American base at Manta, the base compromises Ecuador's sovereignty. Many Ecuadoreans fear it could end up dragging their nation further into Colombia's long civil war, a fear that was heightened in March, when Colombian forces raided a rebel camp in Ecuadorean territory. Particularly after the Bush administration explicitly sided with Colombia in the diplomatic crisis that erupted after the raid, critics of the United States here see little reason to keep the base. 
 But to Mr. Correa, the debate is personal as well as political. When he was a child in Guayaquil, his father was imprisoned in the United States for several years on smuggling charges.
 He has no intent of ensnaring Ecuadoreans further in the American war on drugs. He has proposed pardoning couriers with long prison sentences for smuggling small amounts of cocaine. He is also one of the most vocal proponents of creating a Latin American defense council that excludes the United States.
 In a shake-up of the armed forces in April, Mr. Correa picked Javier Ponce, a poet who advocates less military cooperation with United States, as defense minister. ''Should Ecuador have a base in Miami? Or New Jersey?'' Mr. Ponce, 59, said. ''The decision of the government is not to renew this accord.''
 For now, operations here continue as they have for years. When asked what his mission consists of, Lt. Col. Robert Leonard, the ranking American officer in Ecuador, points to the blue waters of the Pacific.
 The Awacs sitting on the tarmac at Manta are useless over Colombian soil; the jungle canopy effectively renders them blind for spotting small aircraft, Colonel Leonard explained. 
 But over the ocean, sometimes the Awacs' radar happens upon speedboats, some of which transport Colombian cocaine to points north. If this seems like using a $300 million plane to track down far more primitive and cheaper vessels, the personnel here are the first to acknowledge that it is.
 ''It is a big game of cat and mouse,'' the colonel said. ''We look for dots on a radar screen. Those dots are smuggling drugs.''
 None of the planes here are armed; their mission is detection.
 The military says it spends $15 million a year for its operations here, although that figure excludes major expenses like fuel. 
 Finding another location would have been easier a decade ago, when American standing in the region was higher and allies were easier to find. For now, American officials are resigned to transferring Manta's operations when the agreement expires in November 2009, most likely to bases in Curacao and El Salvador. 
 Together, officials here said, those three bases, known in military jargon as F.O.L.'s, or forward operating locations, helped seize $1.1 billion worth of drugs in 2007, with the focus of the seizures on smuggling out of Colombia. The officials had no estimate of how much cocaine eluded them.
 ''We have had a lot of success in the fight against drugs with the F.O.L.,'' Linda Jewell, the American ambassador to Ecuador, said recently. ''We will talk to the government to find ways in which we can continue working together.''
 But some antinarcotics experts in Ecuador and the United States question whether it is worth the cost of maintaining the base, both economically and politically.
 And many Colombian traffickers have shifted tactics in ways that render Manta less effective. Smugglers, for instance, have begun to rely less on speedboats and more on semi-submersibles, the low-tech subs built for $1 million each in Colombia's jungle that easily elude high-tech Awacs.
 Russell Crandall, a former White House adviser and an expert on Andean antinarcotics efforts, said interdiction efforts, as well as Colombia's resilient drug trade, would survive without Manta. ''Manta is just icing on the cake,'' he said. ''We had the drug war going full speed before Manta, and we'll have it full speed after Manta.''
 Meanwhile, the four-member crews take off each day here for 12-hour sorties. ''We have hours of sheer boredom followed by moments of sheer terror,'' said Lt. Charles Moore, the leader of one Awacs crew. ''It is like finding needles in a haystack.''

HEADLINE: State Programs Add Safety Net For the Poorest

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. 

 BODY:
For years, state welfare offices like the one alongside Interstate 30 have drawn the unemployed. But these days, the red-brick building here is also attracting poor, working parents with an unexpected offer: $204 a month in cash.
 Shelly Thomas, a stockroom clerk and single mother, is using her windfall from the State of Arkansas to tune up the old Chevrolet she drives to work. Talia Greenwood, a day care worker with four children, spends the money on gas, diapers and baby formula.
 The women are pioneers in an emerging social experiment as states across the country try to go beyond simply moving people off welfare. Over the last two years, officials in Arkansas and at least a dozen other states have announced plans to extend the safety net -- through monthly cash payments -- to thousands of low-income workers struggling to gain a foothold in the work world.
 Most states focus on people who have left welfare for low-wage jobs. Officials believe that the programs, which typically combine several months of cash assistance with career counseling, health insurance and subsidized child care, will help low-wage workers weather family illnesses and cash shortages and deter them from cycling back onto the welfare rolls. 
 Arkansas provides poor working parents with $204 a month, plus bonuses for staying employed, for up to two years. Oregon offers $150 a month for up to a year. Virginia gives $50 a month for up to a year. And the California Legislature is considering a plan, proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, to provide $40 a month to 41,000 working families that receive food stamps.
 ''The goal had been getting parents off of welfare,'' said Jack Tweedie of the National Conference of State Legislatures, who counsels states on poverty issues and has advised Arkansas officials. ''The emphasis now is much more on work and helping parents stay in work.''
 The new strategy reflects, in part, a growing concern about the challenges facing the poor nearly 12 years after Congress overhauled welfare laws. While states have drastically reduced their welfare caseloads, research suggests that they have been far less successful in helping people find and keep jobs that lift families out of poverty.
 The trend has also been driven by new federal rules that require states to engage 50 percent of welfare recipients in work-related activities. By offering payments to people already working, states are also trying to ensure that they meet federal mandates and avoid steep fines.
 By October, at least 11 states will offer cash assistance for working families. Two others plan to start next year, and an additional three states, including California, are weighing plans. Most rely on federal welfare money to finance the programs. 
 Advocates for low-income families point out, however, that benefits are so low in some states that officials seem to be more focused on meeting federal work requirements than on helping the working poor. Federal officials say the programs may siphon money from the welfare recipients they were intended to serve. 
 ''One of the key issues is: how rich is the benefit?'' said Liz Schott, who has studied the programs as a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. ''Is it nominal, or is it an amount that will really help?''
 The programs differ considerably. While Utah offers $474 a month for two months and $237 for a third month for a family of three, Michigan provides $10 a month for six months. Massachusetts gives $7 a month to more than 13,000 food stamp recipients.
 Alison Goodwin, a spokeswoman for the human services department in Massachusetts, acknowledged that the benefit was ''modest.'' But she said it would increase the work participation rate. 
 Sidonie Squier, who heads the federal agency that oversees public assistance, criticized what she described as accounting tricks to meet federal mandates.
 ''Time and taxpayer resources are best spent helping people on welfare find jobs, not manipulating the system,'' said Ms. Squier, director of the family assistance office in the Administration for Children and Families.
 Because the programs are new, it remains unclear whether they will help poor parents keep jobs and advance beyond low-wage work. 
 But the relief has been welcomed by many families as food and gas prices soar and good jobs are harder to find because of the struggling economy.
 Ms. Thomas, one of the Arkansas mothers, bubbles with enthusiasm as she envisions graduating from college next year and leaving her $10-an-hour stockroom job at a clothing store for a career in computer programming. 
 She says the payments from the Arkansas Work Pays Program help enormously -- with gas, groceries and car repairs -- as she juggles college courses and work.
 ''I need that extra help, even though I'm working,'' said Ms. Thomas, 24, who has two sons and receives free child care from the program. 
 Ms. Greenwood, shy and soft-spoken behind her wire-rimmed glasses, agrees. She had been on and off welfare for years until Work Pays came along. 
 State caseworkers gave her a $2,500 down payment to buy a car so she could take her children to school and still get to her two day care center jobs on time. 
 Now, Ms. Greenwood dreams about running a day care center and owning her own home. Sometimes, she can even imagine the little brick house with the big green yard where her children could run and run.
 ''I had a dream that everything came together, the way that I always wanted it in my heart,'' said Ms. Greenwood, 33, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment with her four children and a grandchild. ''Now, I have that chance.''
 But if the experiences of the two women highlight the promise of such programs, they also underscore the challenges. 
 About a third of the 2,334 people who have participated since the program began in 2006 have dropped out because they lost jobs, failed to work enough hours or opted out of the program, state statistics show. (Participants must complete at least 30 hours of work-related activities each week, and 24 of those hours must involve paid work.) So far, only 7 percent of participants have left because their jobs pushed them above the program's income limit. Nearly half worked in jobs that paid less than $500 a month.
 Officials say clients struggle to find and keep good jobs because of limited education and work experience. The current economic climate makes it harder.
 Ms. Thomas was told recently that her store hours would drop from 30 to 20 a week because of declining sales. She is scrambling to find a second job. Ms. Greenwood was fired from her first job, as a $9-an-hour warehouse clerk, when she missed a day to care for her sick children. She found another job at a day care center, but it paid less. 
 Arkansas officials say such struggles are only part of the story. Eighty-two percent of the 1,225 parents enrolled in Work Pays in March were holding jobs and in good standing, they say. And officials are fine-tuning the program to make it stronger. 
 State officials increased the income limits from $1,430 per month for a family of three to $2,146 per month to allow more people to participate. They are encouraging clients to work two jobs, if necessary, to get the required hours. And they are urging workers to pursue promotions and better negotiate conflicts to improve job retention. 
 They hope the program -- which was allocated $5.9 million for the current fiscal year and is overseen by the director of the Department of Workforce Services, Artee Williams -- will ultimately save money, in part, by reducing the number of people who return to welfare. Currently, about 20,000 residents are receiving public assistance. From 1998 to 2004, about 40 percent of the people who left the welfare rolls returned within 18 months.
 Elroy Willoughby, the division chief of the state's temporary assistance program, says Arkansas wants to smooth that transition. 
 ''They take their first steps, two or three steps, and they wobble and may fall,'' Mr. Willoughby said. ''We're there to kind of help prop them up.'' 
 Ms. Greenwood, who is due to receive a raise soon, prays that she is on her way. She does not have to look far for inspiration.
 Her boss, Kathryn Conley, the assistant director of the All Star Kids day care center, is a graduate of the Work Pays program. 
 ''I'm not just somebody walking down the street anymore,'' Ms. Conley said proudly. ''People call me 'Miss Kathryn' here.''

New Economics
 Of Hacking
 To make money, you have to move up the economic food chain into higher-value, more profitable work and markets. That economic fact of life applies to nations, companies and people. 
 A study released last week shows how this natural law is being applied in the subculture of criminal computer hackers. Pilfered credit card numbers and bank account PINs have become commodities on shadowy Web sites where stolen digital information is bought and sold.
 Company e-mail messages, business documents and personal health information are the new targets of choice for hackers, according to Finjan, a San Jose, Calif., manufacturer of Web security software and appliances.
 ''Money is the motivation for criminal hackers, and it is this kind of information that has become most valuable,'' said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, the company's chief technology officer. 
 A couple of years ago, credit card numbers and bank account PINs sold for $100 or more each on those sites, Mr. Ben-Itzhak said. Now, the price is down to $10 or $20, compared with $150 to $200 for some of the newer documents.
 Patients' records, he said, apparently were plucked from personal computers in doctors' offices at what he would identify only as an ''organization'' on the East Coast. STEVE LOHR

HEADLINE: Marketers Welcome Television's Shift to a 52-Week Season

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE broadcast networks and Madison Avenue may want to adopt ''Honky Cat'' as the official theme for the 2008-9 television season.
 Why? A lyric that Elton John sings -- ''And oh, the change is gonna do me good'' -- encapsulates the attitude of many broadcasters and advertisers as they prepare for a different kind of upfront week, which begins on Monday. 
 The term upfront refers to the springtime previews offered by the networks of the prime-time programs they intend to broadcast in the fall. It also describes how the advertisers and their agencies decide to buy billions of dollars of commercial time ahead of the fall season.
 Change is in the air because of the mess the 100-day writers' strike made of the 2007-8 TV season, which ends this month. The strike scrambled the networks' schedules, chased away millions of viewers and impeded the ability of advertisers to reach the audiences they wanted. 
 ''The networks, and advertisers, realized that an upfront reflective of a business model born when there were three networks is unsustainable,'' said John Rash, senior vice president and director for media negotiations at Campbell Mithun, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. His reference was to the era when ABC, CBS and NBC were the sole choices for viewers.
 After the strike was settled in February, the broadcasters resolved to rethink how the coming upfront week would proceed. As a result, the strike ''had a major silver lining,'' said Rino Scanzoni, chief investment officer at the GroupM division of the WPP Group, which is composed of giant agencies like MediaCom and MindShare. The upfront week had turned into ''a dog and pony show,'' Mr. Scanzoni said, ''missing the mark from what it was intended to be: speaking to advertisers and media agencies about what the networks' strategies will be for the next season.''
 ''Plans were under way at the networks to make changes,'' he added, ''but the writers' strike was the catalyst that forced the issue.''
 Some changes will be cosmetic, among them shortening the presentations at sites in Midtown Manhattan like Carnegie Hall and canceling most of the lavish parties that typically followed.
 For instance, CBS, part of the CBS Corporation, is replacing a fete at Tavern on the Green featuring series stars with a casual cocktail hour for reporters at a bar, Rosie O'Grady's.
 Some changes are more substantive. For example, the networks are ordering far fewer pilots, test episodes of new series that are expensive to produce. They also intend to broaden the presentations beyond what will be on TV, to include programming in new media like the Internet and mobile devices.
 And the networks will expand their horizon from the usual nine-month season -- running September through May, with most new series brought out en masse in the fall -- to a year-round perspective, known in industry parlance as a 52-week season.
 The senior executives at media agencies who help marketers determine which shows to buy commercials in -- and which to avoid -- welcome the changes. They say they would like the revamped upfront week to become normal, rather than entering the record books with an asterisk: temporary changes because of a strike-battered season.
 ''I'm hoping it's not just a one-year thing,'' said Chris Geraci, managing director for national broadcast at OMD, part of the Omnicom Group, because ''the whole process was due for some change.''
 Mr. Geraci embraced the idea of cutting back on pilots. ''Instead of showing us clips of shows that may or may not look like that three months from now,'' he said, the networks ''should make better use of the time'' they have during the presentations.
 One method of doing that would be, as the networks intend, to include in their presentations alternatives to TV like broadband video and video on demand.
 ''We're into a world where it's not about TV, it's about video,'' said Charlie Rutman, chief executive for the North American operations of MPG, part of Havas, ''which reflects consumer behavior.''
 That means the networks ''are not in the TV business, they're in the video content business,'' he added, ''and they have to find ways to monetize it.''
 Gail Ettinger, executive vice president and director for national broadcast at KSL Media, said: ''The networks are selling in a 360-degree fashion because that's the way people live these days. They have to be better content providers because advertisers are looking for something better.''
 An end to ''what we called the 'traditional upfront' '' would make sense, Ms. Ettinger said, because ''there's nothing about the media landscape that's traditional anymore.''
 The agency executives are also enthusiastic about the shift to the 52-week season, which was pioneered by Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, when it scheduled new series for summertime like ''So You Think You Can Dance.''
 Executives at NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric, upped the ante last month with plans for a 65-week season for NBC, which would run from May 2008 through August 2009.
 ''The idea of dropping in new shows throughout the year is a smart move,'' said Kris Magel, senior vice president and director for national broadcast at Initiative, part of Interpublic, because ''advertisers need original programming from June through August, not low-rated repeats.'' 
 The idea is also appealing, he added, because ''lumping all the new shows into a big-noise launch in September,'' as the broadcasters have done for decades, is becoming increasingly problematic. Estimates of the failure rate for series that are introduced each fall run as high as 90 percent.
 ''The upfront will be quite different than in the past if you don't have a defined programming schedule'' that begins in September and ends in May, said Gene DeWitt, chairman of DeWitt Media.
 He predicted that two networks would fare best in the brave new upfront world: Fox, because of successful series like ''American Idol,'' and ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, because of a focus on ''multiplatform offerings like the Internet, video on demand, DVDs and international.''
 After the upfront week presentations conclude on Thursday, the negotiations between the networks and agencies begin in earnest. They can last from a week, if demand is strong, to four months, if demand is weak. (There are separate negotiations for cable networks and syndicated shows, as well as for broadcast programs outside prime time like newscasts.)
 In recent years, the amount of commercial time sold by the broadcasters in each upfront market has ranged from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion; last year, the total was about $9.2 billion.
 ''This is one of those 'Walk carefully so you don't step into a hole' years'' for the networks, said Aaron Cohen, executive vice president at Horizon Media.
 Among the reasons Mr. Cohen cited were the soft national economy as well as the ''diminution of the audience'' caused by the writers' strike, when reruns of popular series had to be scheduled in place of original episodes.
 Mr. Scanzoni of GroupM said ''we are in store for a potential contraction in demand'' for prime-time broadcast commercials by the fourth quarter, especially if consumers ''are spending on gas and food'' -- and little else.
 Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, predicted last week that the broadcast upfront market for 2008-9 would decline by 2 percent to 14 percent.
 By contrast, Mr. DeWitt of DeWitt Media forecast ''a stampede to put as much money into the upfront as possible'' because rates for commercials bought recently were far higher than what the networks charged during the upfront market last spring.

HEADLINE: Oil and Accountability

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Democratic Recession'' (column, May 7):
 Thomas L. Friedman is right to note the troubling connection between rising oil prices and increasing levels of authoritarianism. This problem will only grow worse as oil prices continue to rise and the United States looks increasingly to unstable developing countries to satisfy its demand for oil. 
 One way to address this issue is to provide citizens in oil-producing countries information on exactly how much oil companies pay to their governments. Armed with this data, communities can hold their governments accountable for investing in education, health care and economic development. 
 Fortunately, some members of Congress have recognized the power of this information. On May 12, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, will introduce legislation to require oil and mining companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. This law would apply to all foreign and domestic extractive companies registered in the United States. 
 By supporting this legislation, Congress can help ensure that oil wealth need not be synonymous with autocratic rule.

HEADLINE: Can Corzine Still Pass As a Liberal? He Thinks So

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
You never know which Gov. Jon S. Corzine is going to show up at the State House these days.
 There is the pro-labor Mr. Corzine, who seemed genuinely moved as he signed legislation earlier this month, citing the ''moral necessity'' of giving workers throughout the state the right to take paid leave to care for a newborn or an elderly parent. Then there is the tough-on-labor Mr. Corzine, whose proposed budget would pare 3,000 state jobs and outsource the cleanup of hazardous sites to private contractors.
 There is Mr. Corzine the environmentalist, traveling to Yale for a recent global warming conference to tout New Jersey as being at the cutting edge of greenhouse gas restrictions. But then there is Mr. Corzine the bane of environmentalists, who is toying with the idea of closing state parks, weakening housing and land-use rules and pondering the feasibility of a nuclear power plant.
 During his five years in the United States Senate, Mr. Corzine -- a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs -- compiled one of the most liberal voting records of any Democrat. But now, during the current budget season, many in Trenton say that his bleeding heart has occasionally clashed with his corporate brain. 
 ''At heart he's a liberal, but he's also a C.E.O.,'' said State Senator Barbara Buono, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is the chairwoman of the budget committee. ''He certainly has a big heart, but it gets complicated when you add into that what some have described as political naivete and a streak of single-mindedness.'' 
 Ask any legislator, lobbyist or political veteran to describe Mr. Corzine's instincts and actions in recent months, and these words inevitably surface: Inconsistent. Enigmatic. Unpredictable.
 To Mr. Corzine's staunchest allies, the apparent contradictions in positions reflect a genuine attempt to advance liberal policies by a governor holding a horrible economic hand. This is not necessarily Mr. Corzine's ideal approach to governing, but it may be the most pragmatic way to fix an inherited fiscal mess.
 ''He's struggling with what he wants and what his head tells him,'' said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, which supported Mr. Corzine on the paid-leave initiative but is now fighting many of his proposed budget cuts. ''But do I believe him to be a true progressive? Absolutely.''
 Critics say that Mr. Corzine struggles so much that many in Trenton no longer know what to expect from him.
 ''He's a little bit more hypocritical than a limousine liberal,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter. ''I think he's an S.U.V. liberal. And I think there's a frustration, even anger, among my members, because we expected a lot of positive changes. If he doesn't change his ways, he may go down in history as one of New Jersey's worst governors, environmentally.''
 In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Corzine dismissed the notion that his heart and his head were in conflict, or that his actions were enigmatic. Instead, he recited a list of left-leaning initiatives on everything from permitting needle-exchange programs aimed at helping prevent the spread of AIDS to repealing the death penalty. But ''we have to pay for what we are doing,'' he said, more than once.
 ''I'm clearly a progressive at heart, but we have to do that in an environment that doesn't allow us to undermine economic strength,'' he said. ''It's a trade-off between progressive attitude about how we ought to approach almost every issue and the reality of the financial implications.''
 In public, Mr. Corzine seems most passionate when detailing or defending his toll-road plan, or talking about anything related to Wall Street or finances. And certainly there are plenty of examples of Mr. Corzine pining for more private sector involvement in New Jersey government.
 The biggest one, of course, is his controversial -- and, by all appearances, doomed -- financial restructuring plan involving the toll roads. While much of the initial discussion focused on the possibility of leasing the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway, Mr. Corzine ultimately opted for a plan that would keep the toll roads in public hands, but would also encourage the private sector to buy billions of dollars worth of bonds.
 He has also endorsed the idea of privatizing the New Jersey Network, the public television and radio network -- something that pro-union legislators, like State Senator Shirley K. Turner, a Democrat from Mercer County, strongly oppose.
 ''I'm supportive of the concept that's on the table,'' Mr. Corzine said, before an event in Princeton on Wednesday night. ''In general, I think it's the right direction.''
 The state's vocal environmental lobby has been among Mr. Corzine's most ardent critics. After being given an 88 percent rating by the League of Conservation Voters as a senator, he has been criticized for watering down rules on greenhouse gas emissions and those related to low-income housing and a long-term energy plan. 
 But he has been most vilified for proposed budget cuts to environmental programs that could jeopardize several state parks, a plan that prompted protests up and down the state.
 Mr. Corzine has since suggested that a compromise is likely, as long as other cuts are found in the budget. But he has expressed enthusiasm for generating more money inside the parks by using the private sector.
 ''Certainly we're not going to lease out parks or privatize parks, which I heard some critics propose,'' he said on Wednesday night. ''There may be ways to generate revenues around the concept of concessions of certain elements in parks.''
 Mr. Corzine has also endured an up-and-down relationship with organized labor, which had been among his strongest supporters. This spring, union leaders praised him for capping a 12-year struggle for paid leave, but they also lambasted him for an early-retirement program proposal that they say will only add to future pension liabilities, and also for the outsourcing of environmental projects to clean up contaminated areas.
 Some have even compared him to former Gov. Christie Whitman, the Republican who warred constantly with labor and environmentalists. One such critic is Carla Katz, the president of Communications Workers of America Local 1034, one of the state's largest public-employee unions, who has had her own personal ups and downs with Mr. Corzine. They had a romantic relationship, and gifts he gave her upon their breakup became a side issue last year in union negotiations.
 ''The bottom line is that giving contractors, focused on their own bottom line, the authority to sample toxic sites, determine a cleanup method, and then certify to D.E.P. that the site is clean, guts the whole meaning of government oversight and real environmental protection,'' said Ms. Katz. ''It's Whitmanesque.''

 IRAQI FORCES TESTING TRUCE
 Are Struck by Three Bombs
 A column of Iraqi armor set out to test a new truce in the Sadr City area of Baghdad between the militias and the Iraqi government by venturing north on a major thoroughfare that borders the Shiite enclave. The Iraqi forces had barely started to move before they were struck by three roadside bombs. It was a vivid demonstration that a durable cease-fire in the densely populated neighborhood, where intense fighting has been going on for more than a month, has yet to be achieved. PAGE A11 
 FIGHTING IN LEBANESE MOUNTAINS
 Fierce clashes broke out in the mountains east of Beirut between supporters of the Western-backed government and followers of Hezbollah, the militant group backed by Iran. The fighting followed overnight clashes in the northern city of Tripoli that left at least two people dead. Beirut, where there had been heavy fighting since Wednesday, was calm. Near Beirut, a relative mourned a Druse youth who he said was killed by pro-government fighters. PAGE A11 
 ON THE REBEL ATTACK IN SUDAN
 The day after the Sudanese government quickly dispensed with an attack by Darfurian rebels on the heavily fortified capital, Khartoum, the question many people are asking is, ''What were the rebels thinking?'' But beyond the fact that the rebels attacked at all, Jeffrey Gettleman writes in a news analysis article, the most surprising aspect of the attack was how far they got. PAGE A6 
 END NEAR FOR U.S. BASE IN ECUADOR
 To the Bush administration, the American air station in Manta, Ecuador, is a critical component in the war on drugs in the Andes. But to Ecuadoreans, Manta is a flash point in a regional debate over the limits of American power in Latin America. If President Rafael Correa, whose father was once imprisoned in the United States on smuggling charges, gets his way, the base will be gone, and, with it, one of the most festering sources of controversy in Washington's long war on drugs. PAGE A7 
 CHaVEZ MARRIAGE IS POLITICAL FODDER
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is faced with problems like rising inflation, a diplomatic crisis with neighboring Colombia and defections of officials from his Socialist Party to the political opposition. But few issues have dogged Mr. Chavez recently as much as his legal battle with the former first lady, Marisabel Rodriguez. The strife is more than a personal legal matter: Ms. Rodriguez has become a political figure as well, making a custody dispute over their daughter fodder for the country's polarized politics. PAGE A6 
 SEVEN DIE IN KASHMIR ATTACK
 A long lull in violence in the Indian-administered province of Kashmir broke as a gun battle between militants and Indian soldiers left seven dead, according to Indian authorities. The clashes began when militants stormed the home of a local politician near the city of Jammu, on the border with Pakistan, killing him and his wife before a gunfight broke out with security forces. It is unclear why the politician would have been a target. PAGE A11

 A GOVERNOR DAMAGED
 By Links to a Fund-Raiser
 Antoin Rezko, who is the focus of a corruption trial in Illinois, came to national attention after he was linked to Senator Barack Obama. But Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, who also had his eyes set on the White House, has been feeling the fallout from his connection to Mr. Rezko, as his name and administration have come up repeatedly, described as participants in kickback schemes in which Mr. Rezko is accused. PAGE A15
 NO BREAKFAST IN BED FOR CLINTON
 On Mother's Day, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton did not take the day off, campaigning through rainy West Virginia as her prospects to become the Democratic presidential nominee become more of a long shot. With her daughter, Chelsea, in tow, Mrs. Clinton was hoping to win over mothers who see in her a chance to break through the ultimate glass ceiling. PAGE A16 
 A HIGH-TECH ANSWER TO HOOKY
 Dallas has the seventh-worst graduation rates of the country's large school districts. In trying to keep track of its truant students, Bryan Adams High School, on the city's east side, has begun fitting some of the chronically absent with G.P.S. monitors attached to belts. ''We're always yearning for something tangible to use as tools to teach self-efficacy,'' a staff member said. ''Everyone's so overwhelmed. We'll try anything.'' PAGE A17 
 A GANG IN LA JOLLA?
 Five young men from the affluent beachside community of La Jolla, San Diego, are charged with first-degree murder for beating to death a 24-year-old professional surfer, Emery Kauanui Jr., whose memorial service is pictured above. Because the men belonged to a beach clique called the Bird Rock Bandits, prosecutors are also seeking to apply tough state laws that apply to criminal street gangs. ''They weren't gangsters,'' says one local surfer. ''They were gangsta chic.'' PAGE A13

 RETHINKING PRIMETIME 
 In the Age of TiVo
 Where have all the viewers gone? Six million fewer people tuned in to television during sweeps week in May, and with the exception of Fox, all of the major broadcast networks have watched their ratings dip. But many of those lost viewers are still out there -- if watching on their own terms thanks to TiVo, cable on demand and streaming online video -- leaving networks struggling to figure out what to do next. PAGE C1 
 CRAIG LOOKS BEYOND THE WEB
 Craigslist, the no-frills Web site that is also a clearinghouse for just about everything and people in search of it, is the seventh-most popular site in the United States. And yes, there is a real Craig -- Craig Newmark, the site's founder. Lately he is looking at life beyond his list, which includes endorsing Barack Obama's presidential campaign and financing investigative journalism. And then there's the little issue of the site's legal fight with eBay. PAGE C1 
 EVEN SEX IS NOT RECESSION-PROOF
 Playboy lost money in its first quarter, which it blamed on the sluggish economy. But the company is also grappling with the fact that what it sells is no longer a scarcity. ''Their model worked very well when what they sold was hard to come by,'' said one consultant. ''But now they're living in a world where there are zero distribution costs because of the Web and a tremendous variety of sexual material that is limited only by your ability to search for it.'' PAGE C4 
 THE NETWORKS' 52-WEEK SEASON
 Now that there are no longer three networks and millions of eyeballs have migrated elsewhere, the upfronts -- the annual events where networks hyped their fall offerings for advertisers -- were in need of an update. They are ordering fewer pilots, and doing away with the lavish parties with series stars. Instead, they will shift to a year-round perspective instead of the traditional September to May season, and put new focus on the Internet and mobile devices. PAGE C6 
 Obituaries
 DIANA BARNATO WALKER, 90
 She was the granddaughter of Barney Barnato, a co-founder of the De Beers mining company in Johannesburg, South Africa, but left the debutante's life to become an aviator. She was one of the ''Atagirls,'' a group of women who were pilots that delivered war aircraft to squadrons across Britain during World War II. PAGE A19
 JOSEPH R. EGAN, 53
 An M.I.T.-trained engineer, he became a lawyer who led Nevada's legal campaign to block a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain. He wrote an obituary weeks ago that was posted on his law firm's Web site after his death, which said that he had arranged for his ashes to be spread at Yucca Mountain, in southern Nevada, with the words, ''radwaste buried hereonly over my dead body.''

 THE THRILL IS GONE,
 Handlers of Love Logo Say
 In business, as in romance, familiarity often breeds indifference. Consider the Playboy logo, a symbol of a certain kind of male sophistication in the 1950s, yet today, owing to promiscuous licensing, it seems associated mainly with taxicab air fresheners. Now ponder a far more difficult case: the ''I NY'' logo. The state tourism board has announced a revamped marketing campaign centered on the slogan. Inherent in the campaign is a drive to reclaim the symbol itself, which has become devalued, as marketers term it, through overuse. PAGE A21 
 A MOST REFINED BARFLY
 Show up at the Cafe Des Artistes anytime after 6:30 most evenings, and you might notice a woman nursing a glass of red wine at the bar, her carriage erect, her suit jacket immaculate, her gaze resting nowhere in particular. She is Claire Oesch, 93, most likely the city's oldest barfly. ''I came and I got stuck,'' she said, still speaking with a strong Swiss-German accent after 60 years in the United States. PAGE A21

 MINI GOLF ENTHUSIASTS
 Take Whimsy Very Seriously
 Most people may consider miniature golf as a leisurely pursuit with windmills and scary clown faces, but there is a small group of people -- particularly the members of the United States Pro Mini Golf Tour -- who take it very, very seriously. The tour has a 50-page rule book (with an antidoping clause) and a dress code (collared shirts, no sandals). ''We get that all the time -- people who don't know that there are professional mini golfers,'' one tour member said. ''I don't get upset. What am I going to do, take umbrage?'' PAGE D5 
 A GRIDIRON CAREER TAKES ITS TOLL
 Reggie Williams was a football star at Dartmouth before he spent 14 years in the N.F.L., and all that football took a toll on his knees. Now Williams, whose name was floated as a candidate for the job of league commissioner a few years ago, is having one of his surgically repaired knees replaced, and coming to the grips with the possibility that he may lose a leg. But he says he has no regrets about playing football. Sports of The Times, George Vecsey. PAGE D2 
 NEW CABLE HOME FOR U.S. OPEN
 Beginning next year, ESPN and the Tennis Channel will be the new cable home of the U.S. Open, snatching the Grand Slam event from the USA Network. For the five-year-old Tennis Channel in particular, the event is a major coup. ''Two years ago, we had no majors,'' said Ken Solomon, the chairman of the Tennis Channel. ''We're a little punch-drunk, and I feel like the guy who's asked how you feel winning the Super Bowl.'' PAGE D2

 JAMES FREY WRITES A NOVEL
 With Facts Thrown In
 When the world last saw James Frey, the author was being eviscerated by Oprah Winfrey after it was revealed that his best-selling memoir, ''A Million Little Pieces,'' was largely made up. Mr. Frey is back, with ''Bright Shiny Morning,'' a book that is openly fictitious this time, and full of run-on sentences, unconventional punctuation and an occasional urban fact thrown in for good measure. Janet Maslin says it's also pretty good. PAGE B1 
 ERYKAH BADU AT RADIO CITY
 Between songs at Radio City Music Hall Erykah Badu leaned over a computer and some electronic equipment to set off burbling, swooping noises straight out of sci-fi B movies, as if she were tuning in the concert from another dimension. Maybe she was. Jon Pareles writes that Ms. Badu's Vortex Tour was a visit to her eccentric pop cosmos, which encompasses silliness and hard-nosed realism, idealism and bawdiness, choreography and whim, R & B and hip-hop, funk and jazz.

 BRINGING 'ELECTRIC' BACK ONLINE
 Hey, You Guyyys! ''The Electric Company,'' the popular PBS children's show that went off the air in 1977, is getting a reboot, with a new series set to make its debut in 2009. The television landscape has changed considerably since then, with a glut of educational programming aimed at young viewers. But the network says it's taken notice. ''It's the old one mixed with 'High School Musical' and a Dr Pepper commercial,'' said a PBS executive. PAGE B1

 The Orchestra of St. Luke's has its eye on a permanent home in Hell's Kitchen that would also double as a rehearsal space for other freelance groups.

''We want it to be this wonderful hub, almost a community center for the musicians,'' the orchestra's president said. PAGE B1

 Traditionally, denunciations of speculators come from the left of the political spectrum. In the case of oil prices, however, the most vociferous proponents of the view that it's all the speculators' fault have been conservatives -- people whom you wouldn't normally expect to see warning about the nefarious activities of investment banks and hedge funds.

HEADLINE: Craig (of the List) Looks Beyond the Web

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
Imagine what it might have been like to be Dr. Kleenex. You invent a modern miracle, the cheap paper handkerchief, and suddenly you become the person blamed for America's disposable culture, praised for a more convenient life, or both. 
 There never was a Dr. Kleenex, though -- the product was created by a team of researchers at Kimberly-Clark laboratories in the 1920s. But there is a real Craig in Craigslist, and lately he is looking at life beyond his little list that happens to be the seventh-most-popular Web site in the United States.
 It is also a site that is deeply tied up with the fate of newspapers -- indeed, many in the newspaper industry blame the site's founder, Craig Newmark, for the downturn in their classified-advertising business.
 An ardently no-frills, ad-free, user-sensitive site, Craigslist has, by the estimate of its chief executive, Jim Buckmaster, generated more than 600 million free classified listings. (Though nearly all listings remain free, Craigslist has added modest fees for job listings and real estate brokers in certain big cities, and from those fees the company generates $80 million to $100 million in annual revenue. It has a staff of 25, including Mr. Newmark.) 
 In the United States and beyond, Craigslist is digging even deeper into the classified-ad markets. Once, an announcement that Craigslist was expanding meant adding cities like Miami, Minneapolis and Philadelphia. These days, it means smaller places like Janesville, Wis., (population: about 60,000) and Farmington, N.M., (roughly 38,000) as well as Cebu in the Philippines and, by Mr. Newmark's request, a site for Ramallah on the West Bank.
 In the face of this expansion, Mr. Newmark is becoming more of a public figure, capitalizing on his success to promote causes that include supporting the Barack Obama campaign and financing investigative journalism -- not, he insists, to compensate for any damage Craigslist has done to the newspaper business, which he calls ''an urban myth.'' 
 Sitting in a coffee shop in San Francisco a month ago, explaining his plans in neat mathematical style, Mr. Newmark presented an unassuming public presence. He was perched on an ordinary seat, a six-year-old Prius parked nearby, a Kangol beret on his balding head.
 He used to spend two-thirds of his time working on customer service issues (including notifying an Internet service provider about a scammer on the site), he said, and the remaining third on ''founder issues,'' a catchall term he uses for his public-spirited work. That division, he said, would now be half and half. 
 But before he can extricate himself from customer issues, Mr. Newmark will have to resolve some of the growing business and legal complexities that surround Craigslist, a laid-back operation that is bumping into tough-minded competitors.
 A Delaware lawsuit accuses him and Mr. Buckmaster of boardroom chicanery, an assertion they emphatically deny. Their accuser is the online giant eBay, which became a minority shareholder in 2004, with a stake of roughly 28 percent. 
 And while officials at Craigslist, including Mr. Newmark, maintain that for many years he has not had a significant leadership role there, the eBay lawsuit describes Mr. Newmark, in addition to being a large shareholder, as chairman (the board has two members; it had been three).
 The suit was set in motion by eBay's decision to introduce a rival online-classified site, Kijiji, in the United States last year. Kijiji is already the market leader in Canada, Germany, Italy and Taiwan.
 EBay's complaint contends that after the Kijiji move, Mr. Newmark and Mr. Buckmaster plotted in secret to dilute eBay's influence in the company, including an effort to deprive it of its board seat. The lawsuit asks the court to reverse those provisions. 
 Craigslist is expected to respond to the complaint this month, but on its blog it offered an assessment: ''Sadly, we have an uncomfortably conflicted shareholder in our midst, one that is obsessed with dominating online classifieds for the purpose of maximizing its own profits.'' 
 The phrase ''maximizing its own profits'' broadly outlines the fight between the two companies. 
 Despite its success, Craigslist prides itself on its grass-roots instincts and user-based content -- including harnessing its users to identify and block bad actors on the site. Even broad strategic decisions, such as which areas to expand into, are described as reflecting user requests made at online forums at the site.
 As the complaint indicated, last year Mr. Buckmaster wrote to Meg Whitman, then the chief executive of eBay, saying, ''We are no longer comfortable having eBay as a shareholder, and wish to explore options for our repurchase, or for otherwise finding a new home for these shares.''
 In an e-mail message of its own, eBay stressed that the two companies would remain joined. ''We would obviously prefer to see this resolved without litigation,'' eBay wrote. ''With that said, we will only accept a resolution that preserves our rights and the full value of our investment in Craigslist. We will continue to act openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder.''
 The competition between the companies is also heating up outside court. EBay has recently sent e-mail messages to its users promoting Kijiji, and Craigslist in the last few weeks has added 120 cities, half of them overseas, where Kijiji has been dominant.
 The Web sites' expansion comes as newspapers are experiencing a steep downturn in classified advertising, magnified by the badly depressed housing market and weaker overall economy. Print classified advertising declined 16 percent last year, to $14.2 billion, according to the Newspaper Association of America, below the 1996 level, even without adjusting for inflation.
 In this straitened market, Craigslist becomes shorthand for the threat that online advertising outlets are seen as posing to newspapers. 
 Mr. Buckmaster responds, saying that Craigslist has no sales force and has not sought to win over newspaper advertisers, in contrast to companies like the job-listing site Monster. ''That to me is a direct attack on newspapers,'' he said. ''We put a service out there.''
 ''There are bigger things that have been more problematic for newspapers,'' he added, including circulation losses and basic mismanagement. ''Newspapers have an enormous amount of debt. That is not something that can be laid at our doorstep.''
 Clayton Frink is the publisher of The Capital Times in Madison, Wis., where Craigslist arrived in 2005. The newspaper late last month stopped printing daily, adopting a Web strategy and printing weekly. 
 ''They have ads we would have had once upon a time,'' he said, but added that his staff did not consider it ''No. 1 or No. 2 or 3 of Web sites that hurt our business.'' The bigger enemy, he said, is the changing marketplace, noting that large employers used to buy a page and a half for job listings and ''now they put in a small ad saying to see their Web site.''
 ''What Craigslist does well is build a community and a feel of a community,'' he said. ''Building communities is going to be critical for any online product, whether a newspaper or not.''
 Also, Craigslist no longer sneaks up on local newspapers. Sammy Lopez, publisher of The Daily Times in Farmington, said: ''We've been kind of watching them. You can get on Craigslist and see if people have been requesting a site. I asked someone to look at that four or five months ago, and saw that they had.'' 
 He said the knowledge that Craigslist would be arriving someday led the paperto improve its online presentation of classified ads, creating more categories and clear entry points. He noted that a vibrant classified-ad section was both a revenue source and a reason that people buy the paper and visit the Web site. 
 Mr. Newmark is a believer in the power of technology to improve life -- whether in the blogging he does for Mr. Obama, a visit he recently made to Israel where he argued in favor of microloans and technological innovation to build up the Palestinian economy, or the use of online tools to make government more transparent. 
 He promotes these projects on his personal blog. As of the last couple of weeks, he has been writing posts on Twitter.com, too. 
 The list of good-government and good-journalism Web sites Mr. Newmark is involved with -- sometimes financially, but more often as adviser and advocate in the Silicon Valley world -- speak for themselves: factcheck.org, sunlightfoundation.com, PRWatch.org, NewsTrust.net, publicintegrity.org.
 An article in The Observer of London two years ago described him as ''readying his armory of cash to invest in citizen journalism projects.'' Mr. Newmark says he never donated more than $20,000 to any organization. 
 But he has not followed the common path to Silicon Valley philanthropy -- create a successful Web site, sell the Web site either to a larger company or through an initial public offering, acquire a pile of cash, then give away part of that. 
 While unwilling to discuss his wealth, he said he could be a lot richer if he wanted to. ''We know these guys in Google and the eBay guys,'' he said, ''and they are not any happier than anyone else. A lot of money is a burden.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Asks Albany to Oppose Union-Backed Retirement Bills

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York is appealing to Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders to hold firm against two bills that the city believes would cost as much as $300 million a year. 
 The mayor made his case last week in separate letters to the governor, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
 One bill would allow members of District Council 37, an umbrella group of New York City municipal unions, to retroactively buy into an early retirement plan that was offered in 1995, giving city workers a second chance to retire at 55. 
 ''Approving this legislation would be particularly irresponsible during the current economic downturn,'' Mr. Bloomberg, below left, wrote in his letter to the governor, adding that it ''grossly undermines the agreement between the city and D.C. 37'' negotiated more than a dozen years ago. 
 Another bill would allow nurses and midwives at city hospitals to retire at 50. The bills are the latest illustration of the power of the unions in Albany and the bipartisan willingness to drive up costs, even in times of financial distress.
 Mr. Bloomberg argued in his letter to the governor that the first bill would cost $200 million annually ''because of the anticipated increase in enrollment, and because of the accelerated payout of health care and pension benefits as employees would now be able to retire at age 55 rather than at age 62.'' The second bill would cost $60 million to $100 million, city officials said. Calls to the office of State Senator Martin J. Golden, the Brooklyn Republican who sponsored both bills, were not returned. 
 Assemblyman Peter J. Abbate Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat, sponsored the bills in the Assembly. He disputed the city's cost estimates and said that an outside actuary hired by the Legislature had told sponsors that the bills would cost nothing. 
 ''I don't believe the $200 million, or whatever he's saying, is a real figure,'' Mr. Abbate said. A spokeswoman for District Council 37 declined to comment. 
 Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for the governor, said he would review the bills if they passed both houses. 
 Mr. Bloomberg probably should not expect much help from Mr. Silver. During the union's annual lobbying day last week in Albany, he expressed support for the second-chance early retirement bill.
 ''We believe that there is a need to reopen'' the plan, he said, adding, ''we have legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Abbate, to address what we recognize is D.C. 37's No. 1 priority.'' 
 Constituents Back a Tough Stand
 For many Democratic members of the Assembly, last year's passage of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was the culmination of years of battle and persuasion within their party's ranks, and most of them eventually supported the legislation. 
 For the few Assembly Republicans who ultimately supported the bill, the vote was potentially far more risky: a public break with their own party on an issue that at the time was still considered in some quarters to be radioactive, potentially even career-killing.
 But the experience of Assemblywoman Teresa R. Sayward suggests that those fears may be unwarranted. 
 Ms. Sayward, left, a three-term Republican from the North Country, an observant Roman Catholic in a heavily Catholic district, surprised many of her colleagues last year when she rose to speak in support of the bill, reflecting on her own experiences coming to terms with the fact that her son, Glenn, was gay.
 More surprising -- to Ms. Sayward, anyway--was the response from her constituents after news of the vote percolated through her district. More than three-fifths of those who contacted Ms. Sayward's office about the issue said they either agreed with her position or respected her willingness to make a stand on principle.
 ''We did get some of those very heated phone calls and letters as we expected to get,'' she said. ''But we didn't get as many as you'd think. We got an excellent reception.'' Some letters, she said, came from parents who had kept quiet about their own gay children for years. ''They decided they were no longer going to be secretive,'' Ms. Sayward said. ''That touched my heart the most.''
 Before her high-profile vote last year in favor of same-sex marriage, Ms. Sayward was best known for her stands on local taxes and property rights. But in the months since, she has been feted by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, as were two other Republicans who voted for the bill, Dede Scozzafava of St. Lawrence County and Joel M. Miller of Poughkeepsie. (A fourth who voted for the bill, Assemblyman Mike Spano of Westchester, switched parties last summer and is now a Democrat.) 
 Ms. Sayward even noticed a new trickle of campaign checks from New York City, though she hastened to add that almost all her funds are raised in her district, ''and that's good.''
 Ultimately, no corresponding bill came to a vote in the Republican-controlled State Senate. But gay-rights groups say they believe that the lack of a public outcry over last year's Assembly vote will help them next year in the Senate. Democrats hope to take control of the chamber in this fall's election. 
 ''I think most of the Assembly members that voted for this had a good experience with it, and that will help build support in the Senate,'' said Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil rights group, who has been meeting with Albany lawmakers on the issue each week. ''People are not afraid of gay marriage. It's just not a wedge issue any more in New York State.'' NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

HEADLINE: Cablevision Offer Baffles Wall Street (Again)

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Not for the first time, and probably not for the last, Wall Street is wondering just what the Dolans are thinking.
 Like many actions taken by the Dolans, the family that controls Cablevision Systems, based on Long Island, and a host of New York properties like Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers, their recent bid to buy Newsday from the Tribune Company for $650 million has resulted in a collective head scratch.
 That offer, once considered a long shot, was thrust to the front of the line over the weekend when the News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, pulled its bid, saying it would not raise its offer to compete with Cablevision. 
 That left Cablevision with the prevailing bid. An announcement of a deal could come as early as Monday morning, barring a last-minute complication, said a person involved with the talks who would not be named because they were confidential. 
 The Newsday bid had the backing of both Dolans -- James L. Dolan, the chief executive, and his father, Charles F., the company founder -- even if the two still have an uneasy relationship. Three years ago, father and son fought publicly over the fate of an expensive satellite project called Voom, a favored venture of the elder Mr. Dolan's; when it lost millions, his son shut it down.
 About two weeks ago, both Dolans flew to Chicago to meet with Sam Zell, the chief executive of Tribune, and on Sunday, Cablevision's bankers and lawyers were in Chicago finishing the final deal points.
 Both Dolans have attended meetings about Newsday, but the tension between the two has been obvious, said one person present who was granted anonymity because of the confidential nature of the discussions. The family has been a lightning rod for public criticism -- not least of all because of the soap opera that has been the Knicks -- and the father is known to laugh off the words of critics, while the younger Mr. Dolan is more thin-skinned.
 The Newsday bid has come amid a flurry of deal activity from Cablevision after an unsuccessful bid by the Dolan family last fall to take the company private in a $10.6 billion deal. Most analysts question the rationale for buying Newsday and had hoped Cablevision's quest failed. 
 But when it comes to the Dolans, the only thing that is predictable about them is that they are unpredictable. 
 ''We've seen this movie before,'' said Craig E. Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Jimmy made the comment the other day that their shareholders pay him to grow the company. Maybe he believes that, I don't know. Shareholders pay him to increase shareholder value. Even if you squint hard enough to justify these deals, it isn't what shareholders signed up for.''
 Last week, the company spent $496 million in stock and cash to acquire the Sundance Channel, a deal that was tepidly accepted by most investors and analysts. 
 The price, Mr. Moffett said, ''was less bad than we expected.'' Previously, the company flirted with taking a large stake in AEG Live, the concert promoter owned by the billionaire Philip F. Anschutz. That deal fell through, to the relief of many investors, who just wish the company would use its cash to buy back shares.
 ''It's always a fun parlor game to figure out the Dolan family's motivations,'' said David C. Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak & Company.
 Cablevision's Newsday bid had a touch of audacity to it, coming as it did after offers from two dyed-in-the-ink newspapermen: Mr. Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns The New York Post, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News. Both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Zuckerman bid $580 million, or $70 million less than Cablevision.
 ''If you look at The Post and Zuckerman's bid, there are real synergies there,'' Jill A. Greenthal, a senior adviser at the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, said last week at a forum on the media in New York City. ''If you look at Cablevision's bid, he really wants to own a Long Island newspaper, which I'm not sure I understand.''
 The Dolans, as is their custom, refused to comment for this article. In the company's quarterly earnings conference call last week, James Dolan shrugged off questions about Newsday. ''We haven't spoken about it before,'' he said, ''and we really aren't going to speculate about rumors.''
 This contrasted with the bravado of Mr. Murdoch in his own earnings call on Wednesday: ''No, I don't think Cablevision will prevail; just be patient for a couple days.''
 An executive of another business who has worked closely with the Dolans said their interest in Newsday could not be entirely economic ''because there's not a business rationale to spend what they're willing to spend.'' This person spoke anonymously to avoid alienating the Dolans for future business.
 But even if the prospective deal has an element of vanity to it, Cablevision could make the following argument. It has roughly three million cable subscribers in Long Island, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, while Newsday has about 300,000 subscribers. Cablevision's customer relationships could help it sell more subscriptions, while overlapping ad sales forces at the two companies could result in cost savings. And Cablevision owns a 24-hour local news channel in Long Island, which could use the news gathering capacity of Newsday -- and in theory cut costs. 
 ''To be fair, those synergies probably do exist,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''But it ends there, and it's far from sufficient that it would support owning Newsday at that price.''
 The Cablevision empire is a strange dichotomy: one side is a cable company that is regarded as one of the best run in the country, while the other side includes Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers -- and all the publicity and drama that go with owning pro sports franchises in New York City.
 Mr. Moffett, talking about the cable portion of Cablevision's recent quarterly earnings -- which make up about 75 percent of the company's revenue -- said, ''It was another in the line of an amazing string of quarters.''
 As a sign of the strength of the cable side, Mr. Moffett noted that Cablevision recently passed Verizon Communications as the largest provider of fixed-line phone service on Long Island. 
 ''In four years, they went from not having phone service to being bigger than the phone company,'' he said.
 A cynical theory for the Dolans' recent deal-making is making the rounds of Wall Street. Under this line of thinking, the family is so angered that shareholders killed the buyout that the Dolans now consider the company their own private fief.
 ''That's ridiculous,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''No one's going to say, 'I'm going to light up some of my billions just to spite shareholders.' ''

HEADLINE: Saying No to Everything

 BODY:
Even before the House passed a new plan last week to prevent foreclosures, President Bush threatened to veto the bill, calling it ''overly burdensome.'' The bill is not burdensome enough. 
 To help an estimated 500,000 borrowers switch to federally insured loans, it relies on the voluntary participation of lenders, an approach that has doomed other foreclosure-prevention efforts. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Bush derided a modest plan to provide $4 billion to states and localities to buy foreclosed properties, saying that buying up empty homes helps only ''the lenders or the speculators.'' Actually, it protects entire neighborhoods and local economies from the effects of foreclosures by preventing a greater buildup of unsold homes and a further drop in prices. 
 Most egregious, Mr. Bush has resisted efforts to allow bankrupt homeowners to have their mortgages modified under court protection, parroting the mortgage industry's overwrought objections to what is arguably the best way to avoid preventable foreclosures. Letting homeowners have the loans modified in court would keep them in their homes, helping to stabilize the housing market while inflicting the considerable pain of bankruptcy on both lender and borrower. 
 When Mr. Bush hasn't been busy saying no to worthy efforts, he has been endorsing Orwellian-named programs that have failed to address the problem effectively. Hope Now, the mortgage industry alliance that pledged a big effort five months ago to modify subprime loans, has barely made a dent. Project Lifeline, announced last February, has yet to release any results. The Times reported last month that another program much touted by Mr. Bush, FHA Secure, has helped fewer than 2,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure.
 Meanwhile, defaults, the first link in the foreclosure chain, are running at an annual pace of 2.2 million so far this year.
 But the Bush administration's free-market biases have apparently convinced officials that bold action would impede a necessary economic correction. That is misguided. The housing bust is at the root of the economy's problems, and foreclosures are its most serious manifestation. House prices have collapsed to a point where they are creating a negative spiral: price drops provoke foreclosures, which in turn provoke even lower prices, and so on. The danger now is not too much government intervention but too little.
 The House is to be commended for defying Mr. Bush's veto threat, especially the 39 Republicans who joined all the House Democrats. When the Senate considers a similar measure, Republicans there are likely to face pressure, too. At least the Senate bill will probably not be considered until after Memorial Day. While home for the holiday, senators are sure to hear from constituents about the need for mortgage relief. That might inspire lawmakers to do what Mr. Bush is unwilling to do.

HEADLINE: Playboy Has a Losing Quarter, and Its Chief Talks of Media Transformation

BYLINE: By JOANNE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Not even sex, it seems, is recession-proof. 
 Last week, Playboy Enterprises reported that it had lost money in the first quarter of 2008, making it another casualty of the economic downturn and the squeeze between old media and new media. The company had a profit in the corresponding period last year.
 Playboy said its weak spot was the domestic media division, which publishes the company's flagship magazine. The division got a scissors kick from the difficult advertising climate and from the easy availability of bare flesh on the Internet. 
 In a news release, Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy, attributed the problems to ''the dual challenges of structural transformation in our traditional media business and a difficult U.S. economy,'' while also citing ''unprecedented changes in the way consumers access and use media content.''
 In a telephone interview, she was more upbeat.
 ''I think what's true is that we're recession-resistant,'' Ms. Hefner said. ''Less than 20 percent of our revenue comes from advertising, so we're much less vulnerable than other media companies.''
 Playboy, she said, has deals to open casinos and introduce a men's perfume, as well as plans to upgrade its online operation and improve its content. New initiatives include the Playboy Audience Network, which will put videos on YouTube. 
 Nevertheless, last week's earnings report was not a pretty picture. The company showed declines in all its domestic units, and it lost $3.1 million in the quarter on revenue of $78.5 million. In the 2007 period, Playboy earned $1.4 million on revenue of $85.4 million.
 Certain divisions fared better than others. Domestic television revenue was down 16 percent and online revenue 3 percent, while the publishing group, which includes the flagship magazine, dropped 14 percent. 
 Yet those who are less than delighted with Playboy's first-quarter performance would do well to change their focus, suggested Ms. Hefner, 55, the daughter of Playboy's founder, Hugh M. Hefner. They should stop looking at the company as a whole and start considering its individual parts, she said. 
 She pointed to the consumer products division, which sells women's apparel, workout clothes, jewelry, linens and barware. ''We're projecting high single-digit growth'' in that unit, she said. ''I think most fashion brands would be very happy with that in this environment.'' 
 The division has suffered a bit from the weakness in retailing, she said. But because its sales are spread across the world, with 40 percent in Asia, 40 percent in Europe and 20 percent in the United States, ''we can sort of balance our regional weaknesses,'' she said. 
 She pointed to the strength of the media division internationally, as well as the success of a licensing agreement that in 2006 led to the Playboy Club at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. 
 ''We're on track to open an even bigger entertainment venue with gaming in Macao next year,'' Ms. Hefner said. ''I think, by any standard, our licensing business is doing extremely well.'' 
 Licensing is a nice part of the Playboy story, said Ed Moran, director of production innovation at the consulting firm Deloitte. ''The brand has equity and value, and there are people who will pay you to put it on their product. How many other magazines are out there that can do that?''
 Still, Playboy is emblematic of the problems facing risque publications in a world where there is no shortage of such material. ''When you look at the magazine and digital side, it's fraught with challenges,'' Mr. Moran said. ''Their model worked very well when what they sold was hard to come by, but now they're living in a world where there are zero distribution costs because of the Web and a tremendous variety of sexual material that is limited only by your ability to search for it.''
 Further eroding Playboy's strength is the ubiquity of video cameras and the software to upload and share images. ''It's hard to command the same pricing when supply has gone up so dramatically,'' Mr. Moran said.
 Ms. Hefner said that such analysis missed the point. 
 ''There isn't anything different about the fact that people can access explicit sexual content on the Internet,'' she said, ''because they could access it in other forms before.''
 She noted that Penthouse and Hustler were introduced in the 1970s; that explicit videos became available in the late 1980s, fueling the sales of VCRs; and the advent of satellite television in the early '90s gave people still another option for spicy movies ''in the privacy of your home.'' 
 Although Playboy Enterprises owns some cable channels that show X-rated material, like Hot Network, Hot Zone and Vivid TV, those are not presented as Playboy brands (though they do turn a profit). 
 Playboy ''is not just in a class by itself, but is not considered by consumers to be an adult brand,'' Ms. Hefner asserted. 
 ''People don't come to us for explicit content,'' she said. ''In fact, they'd be very disappointed if that's what they were looking for and they bought Playboy magazine or went to Playboy.com.'' 
 The 7 million monthly visitors to the Playboy Web site and the 10 million who read the magazine ''look to Playboy for glamour,'' said Ms. Hefner -- ''for celebrities, for the unique look of the playmate, for the breadth of content.''

HEADLINE: A Tenuous Prosperity Lost

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: DALTON, Ga. 

 BODY:
In his first years in the United States, Carlos B. Jacinto endured the itinerant life of a Guatemalan migrant worker, from picking fruit in Florida to moving logs at a sawmill in Washington. Eventually, he settled here in northern Georgia and erected a middle-class American life.
 The carpet factories that sustained this town were desperate for workers to supply a nationwide boom in home construction. The wages Mr. Jacinto earned over the last decade were enough to buy a minivan and a brick house with a yard and a swing set for his four young girls. It was a long way from his childhood home in Guatemala, a wooden shack without electricity or plumbing.
 But last month, amid the shrinking fortunes of the American economy, Mr. Jacinto, 37, was laid off. Everything he has achieved is suddenly at risk.
 ''Am I going to be able to keep up the payments on my house?'' he asked. ''I never believed this could happen. Now, we don't know the future.'' 
 The economic downturn unfolding across the United States is imposing a particularly punishing toll on Hispanics, a group that was among the primary beneficiaries of the expansion in recent years. What had been a story of broad and steady advances has given way to growing joblessness, diminishing paychecks and lost homes. 
 The boom in American housing generated millions of new jobs for those willing to engage in physically demanding tasks, from factory work churning out floorboards, carpeting and upholstery, to landscaping, roofing and janitorial services. Latinos occupied widening swaths of these trades and filled large numbers of relatively high-paying construction jobs.
 As a great influx of Latino immigrants spread beyond the initial entryways of the Southwest into smaller cities and towns across the South and the Midwest, many found employment doing much of the unpleasant work shunned by those with better prospects. 
 But now significant portions of this work are disappearing. What were once the fastest-growing areas of the nation, including states with expanding Hispanic populations like Florida, California, Georgia and Nevada, are often bearing the brunt of the pain. 
 From April of last year to April of this year, the Labor Department reported, the unemployment rate among Hispanics spiked 1.4 percentage points, to 6.9 percent. By comparison, the overall jobless rate rose half a percentage point, to 5 percent.
 For the nearly 19 million Latino immigrants in the United States, the downturn in the job market has cut significantly into earnings, dropping the share of those sending money home to families in Latin America from nearly three-fourths two years ago to about half, according to a survey released last month by the Inter-American Development Bank.
 Economic troubles now threaten to reverse a long period of gains in homeownership among Latinos as well. From 1994 to 2006, the rate of Hispanic homeownership climbed to 50 percent from 41 percent, according to census data, a pace more than double the increase among non-Hispanics. 
 Growth was fueled by heavy reliance on subprime mortgages -- loans extended to people with troubled credit histories, which have since proved the most likely to go bad. By 2006, 47 percent of the loans issued for home purchases by Hispanics were subprime, nearly double the rate for non-Hispanic whites, according to a paper by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. Only African-Americans leaned harder on subprime loans.
 Last year, the homeownership rate among Latinos fell, a trend that is likely to continue: one in 12 of the mortgages made to Latino households in 2005 and 2006 is likely to fail, estimates Catherine Singley, a policy fellow at the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group in Washington.
 Georgia is one of many states where Hispanics are now feeling strains. From 2000 to 2007, the state's Hispanic population grew more than 70 percent, according to census data. 
 In the Atlanta area, construction exerted a strong pull, mirroring the national trend. Nationally, Latinos rose from one-fifth of the construction work force in 2000 to almost one-third by 2006, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Economic Policy Institute. 
 Among foreign-born Hispanics, construction was responsible for 46 percent of the growth in employment from 2004 to 2006, according to Rakesh Kochhar, an economist at the Pew Hispanic Center. 
 Now, that dynamic is working in reverse. ''Hispanics are concentrated in an industry that is leading the downturn,'' Mr. Kochhar said.
 For the last eight years, Jose Serrano, an illegal immigrant, has crammed into rented houses in Atlanta with five and six other men while working construction jobs that paid about $10 an hour, sending most of his earnings home to Mexico City to support his wife and three children.
 But since November, Mr. Serrano has failed to find steady work. Every morning, he joins dozens of others in a parking lot, where contractors hire for odd jobs. Most days, he waits in vain, he said.
 Now, there is no money to send home. He has sold his car, navigating Atlanta's freeway-laced sprawl by bicycle. He has been borrowing from friends to pay his rent of $150 a month. 
 Others in his situation have returned to Mexico, he said, discouraged by the deteriorating job market and a recent surge in crackdowns against illegal immigrants. If things do not improve soon, so will he, though he is pained by the thought of having to lean on the very family he is supposed to be supporting.
 ''Your dreams have disappeared,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''Your family is counting on you for basic necessities. You feel defeated.''
 Dalton, a town of 35,000 people 90 miles northwest of Atlanta, is where three-fourths of the carpeting in the United States is produced. It benefited from the housing boom, serving as an archetype of Hispanic upward mobility.
 Before the 1980s, the carpet industry attracted mostly white blue-collar workers from as far as Tennessee and Alabama, offering wages that paid enough to support families. But competition intensified and as similar jobs sprang up elsewhere, Dalton's carpet mills struggled to find enough workers.
 Among Latinos, word spread that a small town in Georgia, with fresh air and thick stands of trees, had abundant jobs at wages reaching $14 an hour. Houses were affordable. 
 ''This was the dream they were seeing on television,'' said America Gruner, founder of the Coalition of Latino Leaders, a local social service organization.
 Today, Latinos make up about 40 percent of the city's population, up from 10 percent a decade ago. Some 70 percent of the students in the city school system are Hispanic.
 ''They came in here and saved jobs,'' said Dalton's mayor, David E. Pennington. ''This is a one-industry town. If they hadn't come here, the carpet industry was going to leave.''
 For several years, Rafael Ortiz picked strawberries in California for 12 and 14 hours a day, being paid about $250 a week. On a visit home to his village in the Mexican state of Guanajuato a decade ago, relatives told him he could make twice as much in northern Georgia, working indoors.
 Mr. Ortiz and his wife boarded a Greyhound bus with their six children -- the youngest then 8 years old. They arrived with no savings, staying with cousins. 
 Mr. Ortiz quickly found a job in a factory making bathroom mats and toilet seat covers. Nearly all of the workers were from Mexico or Guatemala, he said. He was paid $8.50 an hour, with as much overtime as he was willing to take. He brought home $450 to $500 a week.
 Over subsequent years, Mr. Ortiz, 62, never lacked for work. In 2000, he paid $4,500 for a trailer, plunked it on a three-quarter-acre lot and called it home. He recently became an American citizen.
 ''I have 10 grandchildren, and there's plenty of room there to run around,'' Mr. Ortiz said. ''That's my satisfaction.''
 But last fall, Mr. Ortiz's father grew ill. He returned to Mexico to be with him before he died. Since coming back to Dalton in February, he has not found work. He no longer takes his grandchildren out to eat, he said. He relies on his grown children to pay the bills.
 From the fall of 2005 to the end of 2007, carpet industry jobs in Whitfield County declined to 15,416 from 17,140, according to the Georgia Department of Labor. 
 At the Southern Janitorial Services Corporation, where 95 percent of the employees are Latino, working hours are being cut and paychecks are down from $450 a week to as little as $300 a week, according to Gabriela Gardea, the company's receptionist.
 The impact of smaller paychecks is now rippling out to businesses built to serve the Latino influx. At El Sombrero, a Mexican restaurant in an old brick storefront downtown, sales have dropped by half since the beginning of the year, said the owner, Adolfo Morones. He has been forced to lay off a waiter and two kitchen employees, he said.
 At La Michoacana, a grocery store festooned with colorful pinatas, the owner, Efrain Espinoza, said he was losing money. ''We don't know how long we can continue like this,'' he said.
 A taxi service that ferries Latino workers from home to job has idled three of its six cars, Maria T. Perez, the owner, said.
 Born in Mexico, Ms. Perez arrived here from Los Angeles a decade ago to put her five children -- then mostly teenagers -- beyond the reach of gangs, she said. She started the taxi service in 2001, making use of no-money-down financing to buy her first car, a used Buick Regal. 
 As Dalton filled with Latinos, her business expanded, earning her a $40,000 profit in 2004 and again the following year, she said. 
 She and her husband, Ricardo Torres, bought a four-bedroom house with a swimming pool, a huge living room, a washer-dryer and a kitchen with granite countertops. They paid $240,000, with no money down, she said.
 The promotional mortgage payment of $1,700 a month was manageable, she said. But the taxi business dipped the following year. And by early 2007, their mortgage payment had jumped to $2,500, she said. 
 Last summer, with the taxi service losing money, Ms. Perez stopped making house payments. In January, she and her husband gave up their home to foreclosure, she said, joining a growing crowd. From January to March of this year, Dalton registered 111 foreclosure filings, nearly four times the number of the previous year, according to data from RealtyTrac.
 Ms. Perez and her husband are now camping in the taxi company office. They do their laundry at a Laundromat, and cook with a hot plate, opening the door to release the smoke. 
 ''I don't know what's going to happen in the future,'' she said. ''The only thing that's left is to wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Shepard's Debtors of 1978, Sounding like Today's Poor

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
''Banks are loaning money right, left and center,'' the woman says with easy confidence, assuring her son that selling the house will be a cakewalk. ''Small family loans. People are building. Everyone wants a piece of land. It's the only sure investment. It can never depreciate like a car or washing machine.''
 Heh-heh. The words resonate with grim humor today in the 30th-anniversary revival of Sam Shepard's ''Curse of the Starving Class'' at the American Conservatory Theater here. Mr. Shepard's acrid comedy about a family in psychological and financial disarray never was and never will be a socioeconomic tract. But as homeowners from California to Florida scramble to stay afloat in response to the country's subprime mortgage crisis, the desperate maneuvers of the play's feuding spouses as they try to outwit creditors and lawyers and unload the family property assume a bleak, freaky new relevance. 
 Mr. Shepard has had a long association with this city's theatrical scene, mostly through the Magic Theater, which presented the premieres of some of his major plays in the 1970s and 1980s. He has revised the 1978 ''Curse,'' first produced by the Public Theater, for this new staging by Peter DuBois. (Mr. DuBois, who has frequently worked at the Public in recent seasons, will take over as the artistic director of the Huntington Theater in Boston in the fall.) The changes are minimal and mostly cosmetic. The now corny-sounding epithet ''meatball'' has been upgraded to something a little more pungent and vulgar, for instance, and the second of the original three acts has been deftly split in half, so the play is performed in just two. 
 Mr. DuBois has, however, approached the work in a radically unradical way, bringing a softening sheen of naturalism to its rumpled texture. It's a counterintuitive choice, given the ferociously anti-naturalistic bent of much of Mr. Shepard's work, including this sprawling but often scabrously funny play about poverties of the spirit and the stomach. ''Curse of the Starving Class'' marked a step in the direction of classic dramatic structure for Mr. Shepard, whose earlier plays had mostly been far more jagged and experimental. It certainly has affinities with American comedies and tragedies of a more traditional sort, oppressive living-room tales of alcoholic fathers and neglectful mothers, alienated sons and awkward daughters. But Mr. Shepard's harassed characters also spend time talking to the refrigerator, losing themselves in imagistic soliloquies or using artichokes as artillery.
 The resulting production is respectable but timid, almost straitlaced. The set by Loy Arcenas, with its artfully arranged piles of farm implements and hay bales surrounding a meticulously detailed kitchen, roots the play in an everyday reality that is not always a comfortable fit. One unfortunate result is that the empty refrigerator, the literal symbol of the family's psychic need, loses its prominence in the play's aesthetic architecture. The sweep of neon-blue sky in the background is incongruous too, more apt for a staging of ''Oklahoma!'' than for a dark, turbulent tale in which a baby lamb is ceremoniously slaughtered. (Offstage, of course; there'd be rioting if anyone laid a threatening finger on the milk-white sweetheart interpreting the role with a scene-stealing sense of improvisational humor here.) 
 Pamela Reed appeared in the original production as the combative adolescent daughter, Emma. Here she plays Emma's mother, Ella, who wants to sell the house, ditch her drunken husband and light out for foreign parts. Ms. Reed is brusquely funny as she distractedly fries up bacon and bread while ignoring her daughter's increasing hysteria at the disappearance of the chicken she was going to use for a class demonstration. (Mom cooked it but isn't letting on.) 
 As Ella's chronically soused husband, Weston (coincidentally -- or not? -- the surname of the family in Tracy Letts's ''August: Osage County''), Jack Willis throws his burly frame around the stage effectively, and draws a sharp, comic contrast between the rancorously nasty man in his cups and the chipper figure who offers to make everybody a hearty breakfast to right all past wrongs when he's finally sobered up. 
 But Ms. Reed and Mr. Willis don't manage to imbue their roles with the vivid theatricality that would carry us through the wayward or loose passages. And Jud Williford, as the couple's troubled son, Wesley, is so bland and Wally Cleaver-ish that it's hard to believe that he is infected with the hungry ache that is the family curse. 
 Only Nicole Lowrance, as the mouthy Emma, tears into her role with the kind of savory intensity that animates the most effective performances in Mr. Shepard's highly charged plays. Emma's rattled rant at her mother's perfidious chicken-stealing kicks the play into high gear in the first act, and Ms. Lowrance then tops it in a hilarious monologue in which the mud-splattered Emma relates her dream of fleeing to the hills of Mexico, like ''that guy who wrote 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' ''
 In any case, the revised ''Curse'' is not as cohesive and forceful as Mr. Shepard's other two tragicomic family stories from roughly the same era, ''True West'' (1980) and the Pulitzer Prize-winner ''Buried Child'' (which opened at the Magic just three months after ''Curse'' took a bow in New York). But there's no denying that this production's timing feels felicitously apt for a moment that finds many Americans worrying about stocking the fridge and ready to downsize their dreams. (Well, perhaps felicitous is not quite the word.)
 Listen to Weston's recollection of just how he got the family into such a financial pickle: ''See, I always figured on the future. I banked on it. I was banking on it getting better,'' he says, adding later, ''I figured that's why everyone wants you to buy things. Buy refrigerators. Buy cars, house, lots, invest. They wouldn't be so generous if they didn't figure you had it comin' in. At some point it had to be comin' in.'' (Scarcely a word of the monologue is new, by the way.)
 Keep listening, as Weston's analysis of the fantasy world of the American economy gets even more scarily prescient. ''The whole thing's geared to invisible money,'' he continues. ''You never hear the sound of change anymore. It's all plastic shuffling back and forth. It's all in everybody's heads. So I figured, if that's the case, why not take advantage of it? Why not go in debt for a few grand, if all it is is numbers? If it's all an idea and nothing's really there, why not take advantage?''
 Had Weston pulled himself out of the whiskey bottle and pursued that logic to his financial benefit, who knows? He might have gone on to head an investment bank or make a killing in hedge funds.

TWO BY MITCHELL LEISEN
 The very model of the crack studio director, Mitchell Leisen spent much of his career at Paramount, where he tackled projects as radically different as the archly theatrical ''Death Takes a Holiday'' (1934) and the frothy revue film ''The Big Broadcast of 1938'' with the same composure and elegance. 
 It's even possible to prefer ''The Big Broadcast'' -- essentially a series of comedy bits and musical numbers performed by the radio superstars of the day -- for Leisen's sensitive staging of ''Thanks for the Memory,'' the song that would become Bob Hope's signature. In Leisen's hands the song becomes a dramatic dialogue with Shirley Ross, staged in the lounge of an ocean liner. As she and Hope share their unexpectedly fond recollections of a marriage that failed, Leisen plays down the humor of the lyrics while emphasizing the emotional underpinnings of the scene, which ends with the characters' shared but discreetly unvoiced discovery that they are still in love with each other. 
 The same tension -- between a scintillating, witty surface and the more serious emotions that course beneath it -- is developed at feature length in two of Leisen's best films, both recently reissued by Universal: the 1937 ''Easy Living,'' with Jean Arthur and Ray Milland in a romantic comedy written by Preston Sturges, and the 1939 ''Midnight,'' a Parisian farce with Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche and John Barrymore, from a screenplay by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. 
 Set in New York City, ''Easy Living'' anticipates the form of one of Sturges's later, self-directed fables about the arbitrariness of success and failure in America. Arthur's working-class heroine, Mary Smith, is riding in an open-air bus when a miraculous gift, a sable coat, drops from the heavens, having been hurled from a penthouse balcony by a millionaire (Edward Arnold) angered by his wife's latest extravagance. 
 The highly cultured Sturges would almost certainly have intended the allusion to Zeus' pouring his shower of gold upon the princess Danae. As if touched by magic, Mary finds herself being propelled up the social scale, as dressmakers rush to show her their wares, and the owner of a failing luxury hotel (Luis Alberni) offers her the use of a suite, all in the belief that she is the banker's new mistress. 
 But Mary's true love is the banker's son (Milland), a reformed playboy who is trying to prove his independence by taking a job in an automat. Her upward trajectory parallels his democratic descent, and when the two lines intersect, the result is perfect structural balance and romantic comedy bliss. 
 ''Midnight'' gives greater range to Leisen the visual stylist. A former production designer (notably for Cecil B. DeMille), Leisen revels in the details of his back-lot Paris, creating two very different looks for (again) an aristocratic beau monde and a proletarian street life. As in ''Easy Living,'' appearances are everything: the unemployed showgirl Eve Peabody (Colbert) arrives in Paris after a disastrous sojourn in Monte Carlo with nothing but the shimmering evening gown on her back; after persuading a sympathetic cabbie, Tibor Czerny (Ameche), to chauffeur her around the city in an unsuccessful search for a nightclub job, she crashes a society party and, Cinderella-like, finds herself the belle of the ball. 
 John Barrymore, in steep decline but still capable of some brilliant line readings, is Georges Flammarion, the millionaire fairy godfather who saves her from exposure, financing her impersonation of a Hungarian countess in hopes of breaking up the flirtation between his wife (Mary Astor) and a professional ladies' man (Francis Lederer). All goes well until the love-struck Czerny appears, himself done up as a Hungarian count with the help of his cabdriving friends. 
 Among the first of Wilder's American screenplays, ''Midnight'' already reflects, to an unpleasant degree, this future director's obsession with the theme of prostitution: for much of the film Eve seems ready to sell herself to the highest bidder. But there is a softness and warmth in Leisen's direction that takes the edge off Wilder's cynicism, and Colbert and Ameche make a sparkling couple. (As in Ernst Lubitsch's later ''Heaven Can Wait,'' Ameche proves what a soulful performer he could be when given the material.)
 Leisen somehow contrives to give even the most obvious studio sets, like Flammarion's Versailles estate, a spatial coherence and conviction; if these are not real places (and who would want them to be?), they are fantasies constructed with the precise eye of an architect. (Universal Studios Home Entertainment, $14.99 each, not rated.)
 THE BIG TRAIL
 Had it been even marginally successful, Raoul Walsh's 1930 epic western, ''The Big Trail,'' might have changed the course of film history. Made in a pioneering 70-millimeter widescreen process (as well as in conventional 35 millimeter for theaters that couldn't afford the new equipment), this story of a wagon train's dangerous journey from Missouri to ''the land beyond Oregon'' makes use of techniques that would not gain currency in Hollywood until more than two decades had passed.
 Walsh makes maximum use of the width of the big screen, composing his shots so that the eye is led, as in classical painting, to pick out a series of details across the surface of the image. But he also uses the extremely high resolution of the 70-millimeter stock to create perspectives that draw the viewer from foreground details to action in the distant background, at times seemingly miles away. Nothing less is at stake here than the whole system of analytical editing within a scene, as developed by the directors of the 1910s; what Walsh is doing does not really find an equivalent until Jacques Tati's 70-millimeter masterpiece of 1967, ''Playtime.''
 Unfortunately, few theaters of the time were equipped to present the process -- which the studio head William Fox humbly named Fox Grandeur -- and the young leading man Walsh had picked out of the prop department, a certain Marion Morrison whom Walsh renamed John Wayne, did not yet have the authority to command a film of this scope. 
 A financial disaster, the widescreen ''Big Trail'' vanished for 60 years, until the Museum of Modern Art restored it in the 1980s in a widescreen 35-millimeter print. It is this version that Fox Home Entertainment has now brought out in a fine two-disc set (which includes the standard-aspect-ratio version as well as several illuminating documentaries on the film's making). Greedy as I am, I lust to see the true 70-millimeter version presented in Blu-ray, but even in this shadow-of-a-shadow edition, ''The Big Trail'' is still astounding.

HEADLINE: Hundreds Are Arrested In U.S. Sweep Of Meat Plant

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
In the biggest workplace immigration raid this year, federal agents swept into a kosher meat plant on Monday in Postville, Iowa, and arrested more than 300 workers.
 The authorities said the workers were suspected of being in the United States illegally or of having participated in identity theft and the fraudulent use of Social Security numbers. 
 A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not say how many people had been rounded up beyond the initial 300 or whether the management and owners of the plant, AgriProcessors, would face criminal charges. 
 The plant has 800 to 900 people and is the country's largest producer of meat that is glatt kosher, widely regarded as the highest standard of cleanliness.
 The plant shut temporarily. 
 The agents set up a perimeter around the 60-acre plant, in northeastern Iowa, and entered on the morning shift, carrying out two search warrants, federal authorities said. An affidavit filed in court before the raid by the Homeland Security Department cited ''the issuance of 697 criminal complaints and arrest warrants against persons believed to be current employees'' and to have acted criminally.
 The affidavit said a former plant supervisor had told investigators that a methamphetamine laboratory had operated at the plant and that some employees had carried weapons to the plant. The former supervisor, the affidavit said, estimated that 80 percent of the employees were in the United States illegally.
 A spokesman for Representative Bruce Braley, Democrat of Iowa, said the number of arrests was expected to increase, perhaps even double, as the investigation continued.
 Federal officials leased an expansive fairground area in nearby Waterloo to process and house the arrested workers. Among people at the fairgrounds and in Postville, ''there is a lot of fear,'' said Prof. Mark A. Grey, who focuses on immigration at the University of Northern Iowa. 
 ''It's absolutely devastating to the local economy,'' Professor Grey said.
 In a news release, Matt M. Dummermuth, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, called the sweep ''the largest operation of its type ever in Iowa.'' 
 Federal authorities have been conducting workplace raids across the country in recent years, with the pace accelerating since the failure of immigration legislation last year in Congress. 
 The raid had been planned for months and was conducted in coordination with local law enforcement, according to the news release, released jointly by Claude Arnold, special agent in charge for the ICE regional office in Bloomington, Minn. 
 Calls to AgriProcessors, a global giant in the kosher meat market and the major employer in Postville, a town of 2,200 people, were not answered. A lawyer for the plant did not return a call. 
 According to a company Web site, Aaron Rubashkin, whose family controls the plant, bought a defunct meat factory in Postville in 1987 and turned it into the present plant. 
 According to Menachem Lubinsky, the editor of Kosher Today and a marketing consultant, AgriProcessors provides 60 percent of the kosher retail meat and 40 percent of the kosher poultry nationally, and most retail chains depend on it for supply. Mr. Lubinsky said the company was also the sole American packing plant whose products are accepted in Israel.
 The raid was not the first moment in the national spotlight for the plant. In 2004, it was asked to change its slaughtering methods after an animal rights group secretly documented workers cutting the throats of living steers and letting them bleed to death. 
 The company has also been a target of environmental pollution complaints.

HEADLINE: Ways of Ancient Mexico Reviving Barren Lands

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: SAN ISIDRO TILANTONGO, Mexico 

 BODY:
Jesus Leon Santos is a Mixtec Indian farmer who will soon plant corn on a small plot next to his house in time for the summer rains. He plows with oxen and harvests by hand. 
 Under conventional economic logic, Mr. Leon is uncompetitive. His yields are just a fraction of what mechanized agriculture churns out from the vast expanses of the Great Plains. 
 But to him, that is beside the point. 
 The Mixteca highlands here in the state of Oaxaca are burdened with some of the most barren earth in Mexico, the work of more than five centuries of erosion that began even before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers, their goats and their cattle. The scuffed hillsides look as though some ancient giant had hacked at them, opening gashes in the white and yellow rock. 
 Over the past two decades, Mr. Leon and other farmers have worked to reforest and reclaim this parched land, hoping to find a way for people to stay and work their farms instead of leaving for jobs in cities and in the United States. 
 ''We migrate because we don't think there are options,'' Mr. Leon said. ''The important thing is to give options for a better life.''
 Viewed against the backdrop of rising food prices in a global marketplace, Mr. Leon's fight to keep farmers from abandoning their land is much more than a refusal to give up a millennial way of life. 
 As Mexico imports more corn from the United States, the country's reliance on outside supplies is drawing protests among nationalists, farmers' groups and leftist critics of Mexico's free trade economy. Earlier this year, as the last tariffs to corn imports were lifted under the North American Free Trade Agreement, farmers' groups marched against the accord in Mexico, asking for more aid. 
 Mr. Leon and the farmers' group he helped found, the Center for Integral Campesino Development of the Mixteca, or Cedicam, have reached into the past to revive pre-Hispanic practices. To arrest erosion, Cedicam has planted trees, mostly native ocote pines, a million in the past five years, raised in the group's own nurseries. 
 Working communally, the villagers built stone walls to terrace the hillside, and they dug long ditches along the slopes to halt the wash of rainwater that dragged the soil from the mountains. Trapped in canals, the water seeps down to recharge the water table and restore dried-up springs. 
 As the land has begun to produce again, Mr. Leon has reintroduced the traditional milpa, a plot where corn, climbing beans and squash grow together. The pre-Hispanic farming practice fixes nutrients in the soil and creates natural barriers to pests and disease. 
 Along the way, the farmers have modernized the ancient techniques. Mr. Leon has encouraged farmers to use natural compost as fertilizer, introduced crop rotation, and improved on traditional seed selection. 
 Mr. Leon plows with oxen by choice. A tractor would pack down the soil too firmly. 
 In the eight villages in the region where Cedicam has worked, yields have risen about three or fourfold, to about 16 to 24 bushels per hectare, Mr. Leon said. Unlike the monocultures of mechanized farming, these practices help preserve genetic diversity. 
 Mr. Leon's work is a local response to the dislocation created by open markets in the countryside. ''The people here are saying that we have to find a way to produce our food and meet our basic needs and that we can do it in a way that is sustainable,'' said Phil Dahl-Bredine, a Maryknoll lay workers and onetime farmer who has worked with Cedicam for seven years and written a book about the region.
 The key to determining the project's success, and that of similar projects in these highlands, will be if it can produce enough to sustain families during the bad years, said James D. Reynolds, an expert on desertification at Duke University who visited Cedicam last month. The land of the Mixteca region is so degraded that ''the overall potential is not that high,'' he said.
 Over the past two decades, the Mexican government has steadily dismantled most support for poor farmers, arguing that they are inefficient. About two-thirds of all Mexican corn farmers, some two million people, are small-scale producers, farming less than 12 acres, but they harvest less than a quarter of the country's production. 
 Rising demand for animal feed has spurred soaring imports of subsidized corn from the United States. Mexico now buys about 40 percent of its corn from the United States.
 Increased subsistence farming is not the answer to the global food crisis. But people skeptical about the idea that free trade is the best way to reduce hunger point to small-scale projects like Cedicam's as alternatives to industrialized farming, which is based on costly energy use, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
 ''The Green Revolution displaced our local resources,'' said Mr. Leon, referring to modern agricultural practices with hybrid crops and chemical fertilizers. ''Our dependence on the outside, that led to our ruin.''
 Mixtec farmers typically grow enough corn to feed their families and sell the excess in local markets. But the price they get has been distorted by subsidized American imports and the dominance of just a handful of large buyers. It does not cover the increase in the cost of fertilizer, which has more than doubled in the past year. 
 ''We have to think about a different form of production,'' said Mr. Leon, who won the prestigious Goldman Prize for grassroots environmentalists last month. ''Conventional methods are not possible in a globalized market.'' 
 Mr. Leon, 42, combines a hard-headed analysis of crop yields with a reverence for the land. ''It is my passion to live in this place,'' he said, as he waved at a stand of pines he had planted. ''When I was little, it was practically impossible to hear the birds singing'' because there were no trees, he said. ''Now you can hear their song all day.''
 But the Indians here are still so poor that many continue to leave. Indeed, Mr. Leon is the only one of nine siblings who farms. 
 Aware of that, Cedicam has started greenhouses so farmers can grow vegetables to sell. Most people still keep goats and sheep, which forage on the rocky hillsides. A goat will bring $45 at the most, money that goes to food and clothes, said Juventino Rosas, a farmer who lives just down the road from Mr. Leon.
 ''I want him to teach us where to find a job,'' said Mr. Rosas' wife, Lucia Pedro Montesinos, who was herding two dozen goats, her 9-month-old son strapped to her in a shawl. 
 And what kind of job? Mr. Rosas' answer suggested that he still sees farming as a way of life, but not yet a living: ''A water-purification plant, or maybe a clothing factory.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The San Isidro Tilantongo Journal article on Tuesday, about the successful use of old pre-Hispanic farming techniques in the barren Mixteca highlands of Mexico's Oaxaca State, misstated, in some copies, the three-to-four-fold rise in crop yields in eight villages where the techniques have been applied. The yields have grown to between one and one and a half metric tons per hectare, or 16 to 24 bushels per acre -- not 100 to 150 bushels per acre.
The San Isidro Tilantongo Journal article on May 13, about the successful use of old pre-Hispanic farming techniques in the barren Mixteca highlands of Mexico's Oaxaca State, misstated the middle initial of a Duke University desertification expert who was quoted as saying the land's agricultural potential was not high. He is James F. Reynolds, not James D. Reynolds.

HEADLINE: Back Pain Eludes Perfect Solutions

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERGER

 BODY:
BACK pain is one of the most common physical complaints, so it's no surprise that treatments for it have multiplied over the years. That ought to be good; instead, many patients find that sudden back pain opens the door to a world of medical confusion.
 The effectiveness of virtually every pharmaceutical or surgical remedy, however, has been questioned. And for all the money sufferers spend on doctor visits, hospital stays, procedures and drugs, backs are not improving. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that spending on back treatments jumped 65 percent to nearly $86 billion from 1997 to 2005, after adjusting for inflation. But during the same period, the proportion of people with reduced function because of spine problems increased, even after controlling for an aging population. 
 ''Low back pain represents so many different diseases that there really hasn't been a breakthrough treatment,'' said Dr. Russell K. Portenoy, chairman of the department of pain medicine and palliative care at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. ''It's good for the public to know how little we know.''
 The mystery begins with the first doctor's visit. The exact cause of back pain is never found in 85 percent of patients, said Dr. Dennis C. Turk, professor of anesthesiology and pain research at the University of Washington and a past president of the American Pain Society. Even magnetic resonance imaging seldom sheds light; in many studies the scans have picked up spinal abnormalities in many people who have never reported back pain. 
 So what's a sufferer to do? 
 Narcotic pain relievers like OxyContin, used regularly by more than eight million Americans, can help, but doctors remain deeply divided over when to prescribe them. The painkillers can also be highly addictive and lead to mood changes.
 ''I think we are an overmedicated society, and I would not recommend narcotics for everyday back pain except for in most rare of circumstances,'' said Dr. James N. Weinstein, editor of the medical journal Spine and chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.
 Alternatives to narcotics have proved problematic, too. Two anti-inflammatory drugs, Vioxx and Bextra, were taken off the market after being linked to heart attacks. And ibuprofen and aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or organ damage at high doses.
 Spinal injections of steroids and anesthetics increased by nearly a third during the 1990s, but several scientific reviews found scant evidence that these provided more than short-term relief. Some doctors have begun prescribing drugs like Lyrica, an anticonvulsant, and Cymbalta, an antidepressant, to treat chronic back pain. But the data on antidepressants is also mixed. A study last fall in The Annals of Internal Medicine found that antidepressants help back sufferers, but this year a review by the respected Cochrane Collaboration, a nonprofit organization for health information, concluded there was no evidence that antidepressants offered relief.
 While the quest for a safe and effective pain pill continues, Americans undergo more than 300,000 spinal fusion surgeries a year, at an average cost of $59,000 each, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Almost as many undergo laminectomies or diskectomies to remove damaged vertebrae and disks.
 For some, back surgery can be life-changing, eliminating pain and disability. But for others, it can have serious consequences. One study found that 11.6 percent of patients in the 78 spinal surgeries that were analyzed developed infections and other complications. 
 Newer procedures, like implants of medication pumps and stimulators, have received mixed reviews, too. The jury is still out on kyphoplasty, an outpatient procedure for patients with vertebrae fracture from osteoporosis. The doctor inserts a needle into the spine and inflates a balloon, then injects a cement, gluing the bones together. The procedure works only for some patients.
 With such uncertainties, it is little wonder that many doctors have fallen back on more traditional approaches to easing the pain, like exercise or counseling. This year, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education began requiring that medical residents who want to become pain specialists study not only anesthesiology but also psychology, neurology and rehabilitative medicine.
 The reality is that most people with back pain heal on their own, slowly, without major intervention. ''The best treatment for straightforward back pain without a specific diagnosis is reactivating yourself to what you normally do as fast as possible,'' Dr. Weinstein, the Spine editor, said.

HEADLINE: 'A patient grants you the gift of trusting you with their lives, and there is no room for mistakes.'

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
Q. WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?
 A. Mexicali. My father had a small gas station. The family's stability vanished when there was a devaluation of the Mexican peso in the 1980s. My father lost the gas station, and we had no money for food. For a while, I sold hot dogs on the corner to help. 
 As the economic crisis deepened, there seemed no possibility for any future in Mexico. I had big dreams and I wanted more education. So in 1987, when I was 19, I went up to the border between Mexicali and the United States and hopped the fence. 
 Some years later, I was sitting at a lunch table with colleagues at Harvard Medical School. Someone asked how I'd come to Harvard. ''I hopped the fence,'' I said. Everyone laughed. They thought I was joking. 
 Q. AFTER YOU CROSSED THE BORDER, WHAT KIND OF WORK DID YOU FIND?
 A. I was a farm laborer in the San Joaquin Valley, seven days a week, sunup to sundown. I lived in this little trailer I paid $300 a month for. It didn't take long to see that farm work was a dead end. 
 After a year of it, I moved to Stockton, where I found a job loading sulfur and fish lard onto railroad freight cars. My eyes burned from the sulfur, and my clothes smelled from fish lard, but it paid me enough so that I was able to go to night classes at San Joaquin Delta Community College. There, I met this wonderful human being, Norm Nichols, the speech and debate coach. He took me into his family and mentored me. Norm helped me apply for and get accepted to the University of California, Berkeley.
 Once at Berkeley, I took a lot of math and science classes to up my G.P.A. Science and math are their own language. You didn't need to write in perfect English to do well in them. I pulled straight A's in science. In my senior year, someone told me to go see this guy, Hugo Mora, who helped Hispanics with science talent. I brought him my transcript and he said: ''Wow! With grades like these, you should be at Harvard Medical School.'' That's how I got to Harvard. All along, I had much luck with mentors.
 Q. DID YOU FIND HARVARD TOUGH?
 A. Not really. Compared to working in the fields, it was easy. The question was what kind of doctor should I become? For a while, I thought I'd be a pediatric oncologist, because I wanted to help children. But then I thought, I'm good with my hands. Maybe I should do surgery.
 One day, I was walking through Brigham and Women's Hospital and I saw Dr. Peter Black, the chairman of neurosurgery. I introduced myself, and he invited me that day to come to watch him do an operation. As it happened, he was doing an ''awake'' surgery, where the patient's brain is exposed and the patient is awake so that the surgeon can ask questions. As I watched that, I fell in love with brain surgery.
 Q. WHAT ABOUT IT SPOKE TO YOU?
 A. Imagine, the most beautiful organ of our body, the one that we know least about, the one that makes us who we are, and it was in Dr. Black's hand. It was in front of me. It was pulsating! I realized I could work with my hands and touch this incredible organ, which is what I do now. I cannot conceive of a much more intimate relationship than that. A patient grants you the gift of trusting you with their lives, and there is no room for mistakes.
 Dr. Peter Black, he was a very humble person. And he took me under his wing. So here again, I was very fortunate with mentorship. 
 Q. I'M TOLD THAT YOU DO SOMETHING THAT NOT ALL SURGEONS DO: YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH PATIENTS BEFORE AN OPERATION. WHY?
 A. I meet them several times, and their families. They don't know if they are going to wake up after the operation. Not all the time am I successful. I do about 230 to 240 brain tumor operations a year. The majority make it. Some have complications. And some -- 2 to 3 percent -- it takes awhile for the patients to wake up. I need to meet everyone so that they know the risks. But getting to know these patients, it's the most painful part.
 I was at a funeral yesterday. This was a 21-year-old man with a young wife, pregnant. Three surgeries, and the tumor kept growing and growing. And he told me, ''There's no possible way I'll give up.'' He fought so hard. He trusted me with his life. Not once, several times. I owed him my presence.
 Q. HOW DO YOU HANDLE SUCH LOSSES?
 A. One of the ways I work it out is through research, the laboratory. I'm trying to learn about the causes of these recurring tumors. The patients, they can donate tissue, which we will examine.
 My hypothesis is -- and there are quite a few scientists who believe this -- there are within these brain tumors a small subset of cells that can keep growing, even when you think you've taken them all out. We call them brain stem cells. They can keep making themselves, and they can make ''daughter cells'' that can become anything else in the brain. They have the ability to go to sleep for a little bit and then wake up and do it again. So we're trying to identify this small subset of cells we may be leaving behind when we make these beautiful surgeries. 
 Q. HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FOUND THEM?
 A. Yes, but only in the laboratory. When we've found them, they may be a product of the experimental conditions of the laboratory. We haven't found them yet in live patients. The next challenge is to see if they truly exist in the human brain while the patient is alive.
 Q. WHEN YOU HEAR ANTI-IMMIGRANT EXPRESSIONS ON TALK RADIO AND CABLE TELEVISION, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
 A. It bothers me. Because I know what it was that drove me to jump the fence. It was poverty and frustration with a system that would have never allowed me to be who I am today. 
 As long as there is poverty in the rest of the world and we export our culture through movies and television, people who are hungry are going to come here. There's no way to stop it.
 At the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa has four positions.

HEADLINE: Clear Channel Sale Appears to Be Close

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
After a year of bickering and courtroom battles, Clear Channel Communications finally may be sold.
 The two private equity firms seeking to buy Clear Channel, the nation's largest radio broadcaster, were close to settling with the banks financing the deal on Monday, the company said. A revised deal would finally close one of the last remaining leveraged buyouts from the private equity boom, which collapsed last year as the credit market tightened.Under the terms being discussed Monday night, the buyout would be reduced in price to $36 a share, from $39.20, people briefed on the negotiations said. The newly private Clear Channel might also pay higher interest rates to the banks, cutting into the profit that Bain Capital and THL Partners would earn. A settlement along those terms would leave both the buyout firms and the six banks able to claim victory of sorts.
 The latest push for a settlement began Wednesday as Highfields Capital Management, one of Clear Channel's largest shareholders, and Morgan Stanley, one of the six banks involved, urged a settlement to avoid the uncertainties of an impending jury trial, said the people involved, who asked to remain anonymous because the talks are continuing. 
 Talks extended through the weekend, as the parties hoped to reach a settlement before the start of the New York trial, scheduled for Monday. 
 On Monday, speculation that a settlement was near grew after a New York State court judge issued a one-day delay of the start of a trial between the buyout firms and the six banks that had agreed to finance the deal. Pretrial procedures in the Texas lawsuit that were scheduled for Monday were also delayed.
 Shares in Clear Channel surged on the news, closing up 9.6 percent at $32.87 on Monday.
 Representatives for the buyout firms and the banks declined to comment.
 Other private equity deals have foundered since the seize-up of the credit markets last summer, which drastically raised the price of the debt that underpins leveraged buyouts. Home Depot was forced to cut the price of its professional supply unit, and scores of other deals, including those for the student lender Sallie Mae and the rental equipment servicer United Rentals, collapsed.
 From the beginning, Clear Channel's efforts to sell itself have been troubled. Bain and THL raised their offer for the company three times before the broadcaster accepted last May, as wary shareholders led by Highfields Capital Management finally agreed to the deal.
 As the credit markets began to tighten soon afterward, however, the private equity firms faced reluctance from the six banks committed to providing financing. Bain and THL argued that the six banks -- Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia -- were refusing to honor their commitments to provide as much as $22 billion in financing. The two buyout firms have sought to force the banks to provide lending on the original terms.
 The banks in turn accused the two private equity firms of refusing to negotiate in good faith. Given the current credit markets, they have argued, they stand to lose billions of dollars were they to lend on the original terms
 By late March, the dispute had moved into courtrooms in two states. Bain and THL sued the banks in New York State court, arguing that they had breached their lending contract. Last week, Judge Helen Freedman dismissed some of the buyout firms' claims, but allowed the trial to proceed.
 Separately, Clear Channel sued the banks in Texas, claiming interference in its contract with the buyout firms.

HEADLINE: How I Was Struck by Lightning (and Lived to Crack Wise About It)

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
I got struck by lightning the other day, but it didn't hurt a bit.
 Maker Faire is a celebration of the community of people who like to pull stuff apart and put stuff together, but it's also a draw for those who like to teach. So it was not surprising to find a team from the University of California, Santa Cruz in the Dark Room pavilion, a set-up where you could find a harp whose ''strings'' were laser beams, bicycle wheels fitted with programmable light-emitting diodes that drew shapes as the wheels spun, and people wrapped in glowing fiber-optic lines. The folks from Santa Cruz (university mascot: the banana slug) had brought their giant Tesla coil. 
 The Tesla coil, named for its inventor, Nikolai Tesla, is a high-energy electrical device that can generate long, lightninglike arcs. Terry L. Schalk, an adjunct professor of physics at the university, takes the coil to schools to give the students a jolt of science -- and, he hopes, to spark their interest in learning physics. 
 Sorry. It's hard to resist puns on this topic.
 Professor Schalk described his basic show. He discusses physics and why people study it. Then a colleague comes out with heavy gloves, a grounding strap and an epee and fences with the arcs, drawing the artificial lightning with the tip of the sword. Then another colleague comes out in a metal suit and pretends to box with the lightning. The effect is spectacular, and the audience learns about the importance of grounding electricity as a way to avoid injury and the function of what a Faraday cage, a metal shield that protects anything inside from electrical charges. (This phenomenon explains why people in a car that has been hit by lightning are not hurt; the current is routed through the exterior structure of the car and into the ground.)
 After the professor described it, I asked, ''Could I get in the suit?''
 He looked surprised, and then his eyes gleamed and he smiled a wicked smile. He put his arm around my shoulder and asked, ''Are you sure?'' 
 ''I always ride the rides,'' I said.
 It turns out that the traveling Teslugs, on school outings, often put the principal in the suit and have him take a few arcs. He said he would be happy to let me in on the act. 
 You should know that I already understood that the show would be safe. For one thing, Professor Schalk didn't look like the kind of guy who went around frying principals. What's more, I understood the physics of Faraday cages. 
 Besides, I own a Tesla coil. When I was 12, an uncle who was an engineer showed me a copy of the Edmund Scientific catalog. I called the company and ordered a Tesla coil to be sent to my house. The woman answering the phone asked for my address, and said she would send it C.O.D., and I thanked her and hung up. A few days later, when the box came in the mail with a bill for more than $50 attached to it, my father was not happy. (That $50, after nearly 40 years of inflation, would be the equivalent of a $300 purchase today.) But he did let me keep it --and, more importantly, let me live. 
 I spent many happy evenings making fluorescent bulbs glow from a distance and running its one-inch arc to a key held firmly in my fingers.
 Besides, I really wanted to get into that suit.
 At 4, we came back to the Dark Room and listened as Professor Schalk gave his spiel. Before switching on the beast, he gave a few warnings to people with electronics on them -- which, at Maker Faire, is just about everyone. Turn off the cellphone, in case the charge wipes clean the phone memory. If you have a pacemaker, he said, ''I'd just as soon you watch it on TV'' than up close and personal. 
 After the epee stunt and the boxing, he invited me up.
 I got on the stage, where two of Professor Schalk's colleagues fitted me in the metal suit. It was designed for a larger person; the neck joint came up to my nose. There was a slight body smell to it. Not just sweat. Maybe fear. 
 They then jammed the helmet down over my head and led me to a platform with a metal strip on the floor. ''Don't move around, or you're likely to fall,'' one of them warned me.
 On cue, I raised my left arm to the flattened sphere at the top of the coil. They ramped up the current. The air was filled with a sound like highly amplified, and angry, bees, ZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAPPPP ZZZZZZZZZZ. The burnt-almond smell of ozone filled the suit. I waved my arm up and down to make the arc dance. I couldn't see what was happening, but I could hear the fierce buzzing of the machine and the oohs and aahs of the crowd. But I knew that the current was flaring from the toes of the boots into the metal strap at the bottom of the platform. I've seen photos since. It's quite a sight.
 The crowd applauded like mad. Professor Schalk stuck a microphone in my face and asked, ''Do you have anything to say?''
 ''Klaatu Barada Nikto,'' I said.
 Dr. Schalk and the crowd seemed confused; I had outgeeked them. The line is from ''The Day The Earth Stood Still.'' Check the clip on YouTube; I looked a little like the robot, Gort. 
 Maybe you had to be there. 
 Bzzt.

HEADLINE: For HSBC, Asia Offsets Loan Problems in the U. S.

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings, Europe's biggest bank, said on Monday that a recession in the United States was ''increasingly likely'' because the housing market would continue to deteriorate into next year.
 The bank put aside $3.2 billion for bad loans in the United States in the first quarter, in line with its expectations, and said that the consumer finance business in America ''remains challenging'' because the ''trend of rising delinquency ratios will continue.'' 
 HSBC reported higher profit in the first quarter from the same period a year ago as its Asian business more than offset declining earnings in the United States. 
 Turmoil in the American subprime mortgage market has erased more than $320 billion in profit at financial services companies and forced banks to raise capital from new and existing shareholders. Some banks with a large emerging market business, including HSBC, weathered the crisis slightly better as they profited from economic growth in countries like China and Russia.
 HSBC, which opened seven new outlets in China in the first quarter, generates 64 percent of its pretax profit from outside the United States and Europe.
 Michael F. Geoghegan, HSBC's chief executive, told analysts in a conference call on Monday that even though the bank expected ''some contagion between Asia and the U.S., we haven't seen it yet.'' But he repeatedly said he was ''worried'' about the risk of inflation and how it would affect the bank's business.
 HSBC, which was one of the first banks to suffer from the subprime market collapse through its American subsidiary last year, said it would continue to revamp its American business. The bank already discontinued trade in mortgage-backed securities in the United States, shut mortgage businesses and discontinued some consumer finance products.
 HSBC took charges of $1.6 billion for bad consumer loans in the United States in the first quarter a year ago and $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 Stephen K. Green, the chairman of the bank, said on Monday that a recovery in the United States would hinge on an improvement of the credit markets and would be difficult to predict.
 ''The outlook for the rest of the year remains unusually difficult to foresee in the current environment,'' Mr. Green said in a statement. HSBC, which only reports earnings twice a year, did not release any detailed figures for the first quarter. 
 While most of HSBC's mortgage customers in America continued to meet their payment commitments, 5 percent of the loans were two months or more overdue at the end of March, up from 4.2 percent at the end of December, the bank said.
 ''U.S. impairments were below our expectations,'' James Hutson, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London wrote in a note to investors. ''Global markets have put up a resilient performance and U.K. impairment charges are improving.''
 The bank said pretax profits in all major emerging markets in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America increased in the first quarter along with the retail business in Britain. HSBC had $2.6 billion of additional write-downs in its global banking and markets division but they were offset by accounting gains. 
 ''Many parts of the world continue to enjoy strong economic growth,'' Mr. Green said. ''In particular, emerging market economies remain relatively robust, with infrastructure spending growing and demand for energy, minerals and steel rising accordingly. The demand for capital goods to support domestic expansion in these markets is increasing export opportunities for the developed world.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the quarterly earnings report of HSBC Holdings, Europe's biggest bank, referred incorrectly to the impact the turmoil in the American subprime mortgage market has had on financial services companies. They have lost more than $320 billion in asset value through write-downs; they have not lost that much in profit.

HEADLINE: Choice of Heliport Operator Stirs Criticism and a Lawsuit

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
City officials have chosen to turn over the heliport near Wall Street, in the midst of one of the busiest aviation zones in the country, to FirstFlight, an upstate company that has not operated a similar facility in the metropolitan area or in any other big city.
 The decision has not yet received final approval but has provoked sniping in the insular world of helicopter operators. Local heliport and airport operators are complaining about being passed over, and one of them has sued the city's Economic Development Corporation in federal court over its selection process. 
 Linden Airport Management Corporation, which runs a municipal airport in New Jersey that is home base for several helicopters that fly around the city, filed suit against the development corporation last month, contending that it was secretive and unfair in awarding the contract to operate the Downtown Manhattan Heliport for 10 years.
 The case, Linden's complaint states, ''raises serious issues relating to the integrity and legality of how contracts are awarded in the City of New York by state actors influenced by political considerations to the detriment of professed bidding procedures.''
 A spokeswoman for the development corporation, Janel Patterson, said that the group had followed its standard procedures but declined to explain the basis for selecting FirstFlight, which is based in Elmira, N.Y.
 When first asked by a reporter about the outcome of the selection process, Ms. Patterson said that officials were ''still evaluating.'' She later acknowledged that they had already chosen a winner, but said that information about the bids would not be available until after the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee and the comptroller's office had approved a contract for the operation of the heliport.
 The contract became available when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided last year to stop operating the heliport, which occupies a pier in the East River adjacent to the financial district. The Port Authority, which operates the three biggest airports in the metropolitan area, said the heliport no longer fit with its ''core mission.'' It will continue to operate the heliport until a successor takes over.
 After several companies bid for the concession, officials of the development corporation narrowed the field to two finalists, according to people involved in the bidding. One of those companies was Atlantic Aviation, which operates the heliport at the east end of 34th Street. The other was FirstFlight, which charters private planes and operates hangars and fueling facilities at a few small airports.
 After a second round of bids, the officials chose FirstFlight, a decision that aroused suspicion because one of the company's directors is Alvin S. Trenk, and his son Jeffrey was once a director. Mr. Trenk and his family control another company, Air Pegasus, which operates the city's third heliport, at the west end of 30th Street. FirstFlight's chairman is William Wachtel, a Manhattan lawyer who owns one of the Hudson River commuter ferry services that operates under the banner of New York Waterway.
 Mr. Trenk has been mired in controversy for years over the way Air Pegasus has operated the West Side heliport, which sits within the boundaries of the Hudson River Park and handles dozens of corporate and sightseeing flights daily. The Friends of Hudson River Park, a group that raises money to support the park, is suing to shut down the heliport on the grounds that it is a nuisance to park visitors and that its location violates the state law that created the park.
 This month, lawyers for the Friends group asked a judge to postpone the case while they attempt to conclude a settlement with Air Pegasus, said Albert K. Butzel, until recently the president of the group. He said he hoped that a settlement would lead to a ban on sightseeing flights at the West Side heliport within a couple of years.
 Some sightseeing tour operators said they would prefer not to have a company affiliated with Mr. Trenk operating two of the city's three heliports. John Kjekstad, president of Helicopter Flight Services, which flies tours from the downtown heliport and previously used the West Side heliport on weekends, is among the critics.
 Ron Ricciardi, vice chairman of FirstFlight, said that Alvin Trenk was a director and that he and his son owned small stakes in the company, but that Jeffrey Trenk was otherwise uninvolved. Mr. Ricciardi said that while FirstFlight was ''not a heliport operator, per se,'' it does fuel and service helicopters at an airport in Garden City, Kan., and another near Scranton, Pa.
 Asked how his company managed to beat out companies with more experience running heliports in the region, Mr. Ricciardi declined to comment, saying, ''It's just not appropriate for me to fill in blanks for you right now.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Slide, and Wall Street Cheers

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied on Monday as oil prices fell, easing some investors' concerns about accelerating inflation. The Dow Jones industrials gained more than 130 points.
 Light crude briefly reached a new trading high of $126.40, after gaining nearly $10 last week, but ended the day down $1.73 to settle at $124.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Investors also got some encouraging news about the credit crisis from HSBC Holdings, the global banking company based in London, which said its first-quarter profit was up from a year ago although it took a $3.2 billion write-down on subprime mortgage assets in the United States. The company echoed other assessments, however, that the United States was likely to fall into recession this year.
 JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said at a conference Monday that he estimated the credit market crisis was 75 percent over, but that the recession was just beginning.
 Monday's gains showed investors were still willing to lay some bets. Last week, the major indexes all fell as worries about the impact of inflation weighed on investors.
 Craig Peckham, a market strategist at Jefferies & Company, said some of the buying was a natural move higher after last week's decline, in which the Dow lost 2.4 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.81 percent.
 ''This market, after having had a pretty rough last week, is prone to drawing in some more value seekers,'' he said.
 The Dow rose 130.43, or 1.02 percent, to 12,876.31.
 Broader stock indicators also rose. The S.& P. advanced 15.30, or 1.10 percent, to 1,403.58, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 42.97, or 1.76 percent, to 2,488.49.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.18, or 1.83 percent, to 733.23.
 The flow of first-quarter earnings reports is beginning to dwindle, so Wall Street will most likely require some big news on the economy -- like a sharp reversal in commodities prices -- to dislodge the markets from their current position, said Ted Oberhaus, director of equity trading at Lord, Abbett & Company.
 Hewlett Packard fell $2.30, or 4.7 percent, to $46.83 after the technology company confirmed it was in talks with Electronic Data Systems about a possible acquisition. Shares of E.D.S. rose $5.27, or 28 percent, to $24.13.
 MBIA, the struggling bond insurer, posted a $2.41 billion first-quarter loss as it took heavy charges to write down the value of liabilities amid continued deterioration in the credit markets. The stock rose 42 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $9.85, after comments from the company on the strength of its balance sheet.
 Research in Motion rose $9.20, or 6.9 percent, to $141.97, after it introduced its first major new BlackBerry model in more than a year.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 9/32, to 100 20/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.80 percent, from 3.77 percent. 
 After an early strong start, the dollar ended mixed against most other major currencies, while gold prices fell.

 MISSILE FIRED ON U.S. HELICOPTER
 Flying Over Sadr City
 A surface-to air missile was fired on Saturday at an American Apache helicopter flying over the Sadr City section of Baghdad, American military officials said. The attack, which had not been disclosed previously, represents the first time that a helicopter had come under missile attack in Sadr City since fighting erupted in the Shiite enclave in March. The missile missed the aircraft, but the episode was sufficiently worrisome that the American military changed the route of an aerial tour of Baghdad it had arranged for a group of reporters.

 SUDAN BRIEFLY ARRESTS ISLAMIST
 Hassan al-Turabi, a flamboyant Islamist leader who was once friends with Osama bin Laden, was arrested on suspicion of fomenting a rebellion. Sudanese officials released Mr. Turabi from jail by the end of the day, but they said he might have helped a rebel force from Darfur that staged a bold attack on Khartoum, the capital, on Saturday. Mr. Turabi's Islamic political party is widely known to have links with the Darfurian rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement. PAGE A11 
 DALAI LAMA SAYS TALKS TO RESUME
 The Dalai Lama said that formal talks between his envoys and their Chinese counterparts were expected to resume next month, even as Chinese officials kept up their public denunciations of the Tibetan spiritual leader. For the last two months, the Dalai Lama has witnessed from his perch in India a historic outburst of protest in his homeland, but he has been accused by officials in Beijing for trying to split the nation and was even derided as a ''wolf in monk's clothing.''

 MEXICO ARRESTS 6 IN OFFICER'S DEATH
 Six people with links to a drug kingpin have been arrested and charged in the killing of the acting federal police chief, investigators announced. Investigators said the group that carried out the assassination was led by a federal police officer, who was arrested with several incriminating documents. Among them were lists of cars used by top commanders in the federal police and records of drug shipments. PAGE A8 
 LEBANESE ARMY PLANS TO USE FORCE
 The Lebanese Army announced it would start using force to stop fighting between supporters of the governing coalition and the Hezbollah-led opposition, a step the army had not taken during almost a week of sectarian violence. The announcement was made as violence eased across Lebanon, despite some renewed street battles in the north. Tensions were still high in the Chouf mountains overlooking Beirut, pictured above.

 PAYING OUT CASH 
 To Turn Out the Vote
 Unable to keep pace with Senator Barack Obama's grass-roots political organizing efforts, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's election campaign turned to ''street money'' in Ohio and Texas -- an old-style and controversial political tool in which people are given cash to round up votes for candidates on Election Day. The Obama campaign gave street money in those states as well, but the Clinton camp three times as much. Because street money is most effective on the precinct level, it is hard to tell how much a factor it was in the outcomes. PAGE A18 
 A SMALL TOWN WITH NEW OPTIONS
 The tiny town of Ewing, Ky. (pop. 300) is trying to figure out what to do with a $12,000 windfall thanks to the vagaries of law and fate. What the town really needs is a sewer system, but that will run about $6 million. But what about spending the $12,000 on a new park to replace the social spaces that have been gone since the barbershop and beer hall closed? Or how about sidewalks for the streets near the elementary school? PAGE A13

Mr. Raikes will be paid more than that, though the foundation would not say how much. PAGE A16

 Another hearing at the United States Court of Federal Claims is being held to determine whether the preservative thimerosal, which is added to vaccines, played a role in thousands of children becoming autistic. The court is weighing whether the government should pay millions to the parents of autistic children. Although no major studies have found a link between the vaccine and autism, the parents have persisted in their legal fight. PAGE A14

 NISSAN TO MAKE ELECTRIC CARS
 Nissan is trying to take the lead in the race to develop environmentally friendly vehicles, and it is expected to announce it will sell an all-electric, zero-emission vehicle in the United States and Japan by 2010. Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief executive, said that the company sped up its plans to develop a battery-powered vehicle because of higher gas prices and environmental concerns. PAGE C1

 NEW YORK'S BLUESTONE BOOM
 A demand for bluestone for old-fashioned sidewalks and new rustic patios -- a $100 million industry -- has spurred the opening of scores of new mines in upstate New York over the last six years.

 The golf-ball-size tumor in 3-year-old Grace Webster's brain is called a hypothalamic hamartoma, which afflicts only a few thousand people in the world. Though it is benign, it can lead to dozens of seizures, some of which bizarrely mimick laughter or rage. Only five years ago, a child like Grace would not have any recourse, and many children were institutionalized. But a new procedure is giving children like Grace a chance at a normal life. PAGE F1

Because of the animal's quirkiness, the announcement by scientists that they had mapped the platypus genome was greeted with much fanfare, but Natalie Angier says that what was more shocking was how ordinary its genome is. Now researchers hope to use the new information as a springboard to understand mammalian evolution. PAGE F1

 In her book ''Girls Like Us,'' Sheila Weller weaves the biographies of Carole King, Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon into a post-feminist history. Ms. Weller reveals all three women as heavily indebted to traditional pop and its quasi-religious faith in romantic love. But they also belonged to a generation of women for whom the belief in love as the answer coincided with the women's liberation movement, and an unvoiced question suggested by the book is whether romantic love and promiscuity are compatible.

HEADLINE: Nissan Plans Electric Car In U.S. by '10

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company plans to sell an electric car in the United States and Japan by 2010, raising the stakes in the race to develop environmentally friendly vehicles.
 The commitment -- expected to be announced Tuesday by Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn -- will be the first by a major automaker to bring a zero-emission vehicle to the American market. Nissan also expects to sell a lineup of electric vehicles globally by 2012.
 In an interview Monday, Mr. Ghosn said Nissan decided to accelerate development of battery-powered vehicles because of high gasoline prices and environmental concerns, not just because of the need to meet stricter fuel-economy standards.
 ''What we are seeing is that the shifts coming from the markets are more powerful than what regulators are doing,'' he said. 
 Mr. Ghosn said Nissan envisioned a broad range of electric vehicles, starting with small cars, and added: ''It's not only about a small city car or a small minivan. It can also be about a small commercial vehicle and a small crossover.''
 Mr. Ghosn was not always enthusiastic about alternative-fuel technology. In a 2005 speech to the National Automobile Dealers Association, he called gas-electric hybrids ''niche products'' useful only to meet strict fuel-economy and emission standards in states like California.
 ''It wasn't long ago that Carlos Ghosn was a big naysayer about the role of electric vehicles,'' said John O'Dell, senior editor at the auto Web site GreenCarAdvisor.com. ''Obviously, something has opened his eyes.''
 Other automakers like Mitsubishi Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries are testing versions of electric cars, and General Motors and Toyota are working on battery-powered vehicles that have small gasoline engines for recharging. G.M. plans to start producing the Chevrolet Volt in 2010, while Toyota expects to offer a similar so-called ''plug in'' hybrid around the same time.
 But Nissan, which a decade ago was on the brink of bankruptcy, is the first manufacturer to say it will sell mass-market all-electric vehicles worldwide. The zero emissions refers to those from the car's tailpipe and not those from the production of electricity used to power the car.
 Still, Mr. O'Dell said: ''Nissan is upping the ante tremendously. They are the first to put it on the line and say we're going to have an all-electric vehicle for a certain market by a certain date.''
 Mr. Ghosn declined to disclose details of the electric products and said initial quantities would be small. ''We're talking about hundreds of vehicles first,'' he said.
 But he said that the company was determined to achieve ''zero-emission-vehicle leadership.''
 With customers in emerging markets like China and India clamoring for cars, the industry has a responsibility to invest in the cleanest vehicles possible, he said, adding, ''The question is how we participate in the growth of emerging markets, while doing it in a way that is not in contradiction with the fact that a lot of people are sensitive to the emission levels and the preservation of the planet.''
 Early this year, Nissan and its French alliance partner, Renault, signed a deal with the California-based Project Better Place to produce electric cars for sale in Israel and Denmark.
 Renault will provide the cars and Nissan will supply lithium-ion battery packs. Mr. Ghosn, who also serves as chief executive of Renault, said the Israeli government would encourage sales of electric cars by sharply cutting taxes to levels below those on gasoline-powered vehicles.
 ''We would never have done this if the Israeli government was not encouraging it,'' he said. ''Whoever puts the most incentive on the table is going to get the technology first.''
 The goal to sell electric vehicles is part of a new five-year business plan, called Nissan GT 2012, also to be announced Tuesday. It contains goals that are among the most ambitious set by Mr. Ghosn since he took the reins at Nissan in 1999.
 In previous plans, Mr. Ghosn set strict targets for cost cuts, profit and return on investments to turn around the company's lagging fortunes.
 But now Nissan is healthier. It is expected to report a profit in the most recent fiscal year of $4.1 billion.
 The next five years, Mr. Ghosn said, would focus on growth and trust. ''Trust is about sustainability,'' he said. ''It's about return; it's about loyalty. In our industry, the companies that are performing best are the ones that have established a high level of trust with the different stakeholders.''
 The goals also call for Nissan to match the best industry standards in vehicle quality and to increase its revenue by an average of 5 percent each year.
 The company plans to introduce 60 models worldwide by 2012. Several new products are planned for the United States market, including a new Maxima sedan, the Cube small car and a new version of the Z-family sports cars.
 Renault and Nissan have also joined with an Indian carmaker, Bajaj Auto, to produce a $2,500 car by 2011.
 The new business plan and electric-car pledge represent a comeback effort of sorts for Mr. Ghosn, whose status as an industry superstar was tarnished in an aborted effort to extend the Nissan-Renault alliance to General Motors in 2006.
 The alliance talks were spurred by the investor Kirk Kerkorian, who was then a major G.M. shareholder. Though Mr. Ghosn was willing to conclude a deal, G.M. management rebuffed him.
 Nissan recently struck joint ventures with Chrysler, which is now private, to build vehicles in each other's plants, but Mr. Ghosn played down the chances of bringing the American automaker as a full partner into the Nissan-Renault alliance.
 ''We're not in a hurry,'' he said, ''but if we feel there is a good opportunity for us to add a North American partner, we need to take it seriously. For now, we have to be very cautious.''
 But Nissan is being more aggressive about its electric-car efforts. Mr. Ghosn declined to say how much electric vehicles would cost, but stressed that they would be affordable and comparable with other vehicles in the marketplace.
 ''We are not interested in some 'Stars Wars' prototype,'' he said, ''but in really bringing a mass- market product that everybody can buy. It's really a new chapter in the life of this industry.''
 He said that as many as 10 million of the 69 million vehicles produced each year worldwide could ultimately be electric-powered, with a concentration in urban areas. ''We think that cars sold in cities are the obvious first starting point,'' he said.
 Electric cars are typically recharged by plugging the vehicle into an electrical outlet at home or elsewhere overnight. But previous attempts at electric vehicles were hampered by the length of time needed to recharge the battery, and the limited distances the cars could travel on a single charge.
 How customers will respond to a mass-market electric car is still unknown, Mr. O'Dell said. Concerns about driving range and reliability, he said, would generate a ''healthy skepticism.''

HEADLINE: Not a Time for Rivalry

 BODY:
After an auspicious start, the leaders of Pakistan's new coalition government have let political rivalries thwart their efforts to rebuild their battered country. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif withdrew his party's ministers from the cabinet on Monday in a dispute with his rival, Asif Ali Zardari, over when and how to reinstate dozens of dismissed judges. 
 The judiciary has been at the heart of Pakistan's roiling political dynamic for a year. At the height of his dictatorial powers, President Pervez Musharraf purged 57 judges, including the chief judge of the country's Supreme Court. He feared the court would overturn his re-election by the departing Parliament. 
 The country's two main opposition parties -- led by Mr. Zardari, the widower of the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and Mr. Sharif -- won control of Parliament in February, promising to quickly reinstate the judges. But they have not been able to agree since on how to do that.
 Mr. Sharif, who was driven from office by Mr. Musharraf, wants the judges restored immediately, by executive fiat, with a clear expectation that they will legally oust the former general. Mr. Zardari, who seems more willing to envision a deal with Mr. Musharraf (as did his late wife), wants the judges restored by an act of Parliament, coupled with judicial reform measures -- a process that could take months to play out. 
 Strong personal rivalries, in abeyance until now, have made this all the more complicated. Mr. Zardari's party is the senior member of the coalition and has much to lose if Mr. Sharif gets credit for finally toppling Mr. Musharraf. There are also suspicions in Pakistan that the Bush administration is pushing to protect the ex- general, at least for a while longer. 
 Pakistan needs its judges reinstated quickly. But it also needs the coalition government to hold together. Political leaders who have Pakistan's interests at heart should be able to find a compromise that restores the judges, promotes much-needed judicial reform and resolves the issue of Mr. Musharraf's future. One possible solution would be to hold another election -- one the deeply unpopular president is certain to lose. 
 The United States must make clear, finally, that its goal is not to keep Mr. Musharraf in office but to help the civilian government survive and prosper. The new government has many more problems to deal with, including rising food prices, a deepening economic crisis and a resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
 There are some hopeful signs. Mr. Sharif said his party would continue to back the government. And Pakistan's Army seems to be living up to its commitment to stay out of politics.
 Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif now need to remember that the only one likely to gain from the collapse of the coalition government is the man it sought to marginalize: President Musharraf.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Faces S.E.C. Inquiry Over Auction-Rate Securities

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. 

 BODY:
Wachovia said on Monday that its securities unit and affiliates had received inquiries and subpoenas from federal and state regulators over auction-rate securities. 
 In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wachovia said the S.E.C. and other regulators were seeking information concerning the underwriting, sale and subsequent auctions of municipal auction-rate securities and auction-rate preferred securities.
 Interest rates on such securities are reset at regular auctions. Troubles have arisen as demand for some high-rate securities dried up as rates fell.
 ''Further review and inquiry is anticipated by the regulatory authorities, and Wachovia will cooperate fully,'' the company said in the filing.
 According to the filing, the bank and Wachovia Securities have also been named in a lawsuit filed in March in New York. The lawsuit seeks class-action status for customers who purchased and continue to hold such securities, and it contends there were misrepresentations concerning the quality, risk and characteristics of the securities. The bank said it intended ''to vigorously defend the civil litigation.''
 Wachovia's chief executive, G. Kennedy Thompson, tried to reassure investors at a conference in New York, saying recent negative news about his bank gave the perception ''that Wachovia is a company in crisis,'' but added ''that is not the situation at all.''
 He said the bank was taking steps to fix regulatory and other issues, including hiring a third-party firm to analyze its financial controls and risk management practices. The review could take three to four months, he said. 
 Mr. Thompson is under fire for Wachovia's earnings problems and stock slide.

HEADLINE: A Bloomberg L.P. Hiring Implies Added News Focus

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The news business may be in the doldrums, but the competition over business news could be heating up.
 Bloomberg L.P., the financial data and news giant founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said Monday that it had hired Norman Pearlstine, the former top editor of Time Inc. and The Wall Street Journal, to the new position of chief content officer.
 The move suggests that Bloomberg, whose fortunes have been buoyed by the selling of its hugely profitable data terminals to brokerage firms and investment banks, plans to expand the journalism side of its business.
 Bloomberg's sprawling operation, which includes 2,300 editorial employees, a television outfit and a radio station, has largely been used as a tool for the Bloomberg terminals. But the growth in terminal sales has slowed with the economy and as Wall Street suffers from the fallout of the mortgage crisis. 
 Adding Mr. Pearlstine to its masthead will polish Bloomberg News' journalistic credentials at a time when the company is gearing up for new competition on almost all fronts. Last May, the Thomson Corporation bought Reuters for $17 billion to form the world's largest financial data company. And last fall, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation completed its $5 billion takeover of Dow Jones & Company, owner of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and Dow Jones Newswires. 
 Also last fall, News Corporation introduced Fox Business News, a cable channel in direct competition with Bloomberg TV and CNBC, which is owned by NBC Universal.
 In an interview, Mr. Pearlstine stressed that his immediate concern would be developing existing Bloomberg properties rather than looking to acquire new ones. 
 ''I would say the specifics of the job are very much a work in progress,'' he said. ''The initial focus is going to be on some of the multimedia products.''
 Mr. Pearlstine just had his own stint as a deal maker for the private equity firm Carlyle Group, working for the past 20 months as adviser on media and telecommunications acquisitions. But the company did not complete any deals in those areas during his time there. 
 Recently, Newsweek and The New York Post reported that Mayor Bloomberg might be considering an acquisition of The New York Times Company, but the mayor denied the rumor and Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the company's chairman, said it was not for sale. 
 Monday morning, Mr. Pearlstine; Matthew A. Winkler, Bloomberg's editor in chief; and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the president of Bloomberg, assembled in an auditorium at the company's New York City headquarters to address employees. The takeaway from the gathering, according to an employee who was present but was granted anonymity to speak about a closed-door company meeting, was that the news organization would have a brighter spotlight on it.
 ''People are really excited about this,'' this person said. ''It means a bigger presence for us.''
 On the surface, a union of Mr. Pearlstine and Bloomberg L.P. may seem a mismatch in personality and culture. Bloomberg is known as being systematic and bureaucratic with a relentless focus on efficiency; Mr. Pearlstine, a highly visible member of the New York media scene, comes from the clubby world of Time Inc. and The Wall Street Journal, where personal relationships count for more. 
 While Time Inc. still retains vestiges of a heritage of collegiality and informality, at Bloomberg, Mr. Pearlstine will find another level of egalitarianism: there are no offices, only open desks. He will have a desk in the newsroom as well as on the executive floor. 
 Until Monday, Bloomberg required its editors and reporters to conduct a daily ''autopsy'' in which they would scour newspapers and analyze why a particular paper chose, say, to run a Reuters dispatch over a Bloomberg article. 
 A video message set to the Beatles song ''Revolution'' that Mr. Winkler sent to the staff Monday shows the editor tearing a copy of The New York Times' business section to symbolize the elimination of the daily autopsy. 
 The vast majority of Bloomberg's revenue comes from selling data terminals, which includes its news service. Its revenue in 2007 was $5.4 billion, of which an estimated $4.7 billion came from selling financial data, according to Inside Market Data, a trade publication. 
 ''They're not fundamentally a journalistic organization,'' said Paul Steiger, a former managing editor of The Journal and former colleague of Mr. Pearlstine. ''It's about the machine. The journalism promotes the machine.''
 But that journalism is becoming a fast-growing machine itself. It has 2,300 editorial employees around the world, compared with 1,500 in 2005 and 1,200 in 2001. 
 Mr. Steiger predicted Mr. Pearlstine would be able to ''harness'' some of the journalistic talent at Bloomberg. Mr. Winkler, he said, ''has an enormous amount of talent that he's stockpiled. Norm can direct that, he can energize that.'' 
 Mr. Pearlstine and Mr. Winkler have known each other for more than 25 years; in the early 1980s, Mr. Pearlstine hired Mr. Winkler to work for him at The Journal's European edition.
 Mr. Winkler said growth in terminal sales was slowing this year, mainly because of layoffs at investment banks and other financial institutions. The company had 273,000 subscribers last year, up from 243,000 in 2006. Each subscriber pays a fee of about $1,500 a month. Mr. Winkler also said advertising at Bloomberg Markets, the company's magazine, and at Bloomberg TV was up on the year. 
 ''The credo around here is, if you stop growing, you die,'' Mr. Winkler said.
 Bloomberg's media properties have cautiously stepped out from under the terminal's shadow recently. For the first time, Bloomberg Markets was honored this year as a finalist for a National Magazine Award, for a series on the subprime mortgage crisis. 
 Bloomberg TV, which has quietly toiled in the shadow of CNBC for about 14 years, recently revamped its look to appeal to a wider audience. While its viewership is assumed to be low, it does not participate in Nielsen ratings. Bloomberg executives view television as an essential platform. 
 ''You cannot be in the news business today without being in television,'' Mr. Winkler said.
 The issue of how the company might continue to grow was raised at the gathering Monday when one of the employees in the audience asked whether a potential deal was in the works. 
 Mr. Doctoroff, denying that any deal was in the works, told the gathering, ''We do have greater aspirations, and in what form those aspirations will be fulfilled, we're going to all have to sit and figure that out,'' according to another employee who also agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was meant to be confidential. 
 Yet Mr. Winkler and Mr. Pearlstine seemed to distance themselves from the long-held company mantra that they are ''builders not buyers'' -- meaning the company would seek growth organically rather than through acquisitions. Mr. Pearlstine noted Mr. Doctoroff's resume -- he worked at Lehman Brothers and Oak Hill Capital, a private equity firm -- and suggested that his expertise in deal making might be put to use.
 As Mayor Bloomberg's term in office approaches its end in 2009, there is no shortage of speculation as to what his future holds. He retains a 68 percent stake in Bloomberg -- a portion that Fortune valued last year at close to $13 billion. Merrill Lynch is the other major shareholder, with a 20 percent stake. 
 The mayor is made aware of most major decisions at the company, but a spokesman for the mayor declined Monday to comment. Mr. Pearlstine said his ''substantive conversations'' were with Mr. Winkler and Mr. Doctoroff, and that he did not feel comfortable identifying who else he spoke with.

HEADLINE: Here Come The Millennials

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
An important aspect of the presidential race so far has been the generational divide, with Barack Obama doing very well with younger voters and Hillary Clinton drawing strong support from those who are older. A similar split can be expected in a general election race between Senator Obama and John McCain.
 However the election ultimately turns out, the Obama campaign has tapped into a constituency that holds powerful implications for the future of American politics. The youngest of these voters, those ranging in age from roughly the late teens to the early 30s, are part of the so-called millennial generation. 
 This is a generation that is in danger of being left out of the American dream -- the first American generation to do less well economically than their parents. And that economic uncertainty appears to have played a big role in shaping their views of government and politics.
 A number of studies, including new ones by the Center for American Progress in Washington and by Demos, a progressive think tank in New York, have shown that Americans in this age group are faced with a variety of challenges that are tougher than those faced by young adults over the past few decades. Among the challenges are worsening job prospects, lower rates of health insurance coverage and higher levels of debt.
 We know that the generation immediately preceding the Millennials is struggling. Men who are now in their 30s, the prime age for raising a family, earn less money than members of their fathers' generation did at the same age. In 1974, the median income for men in their 30s (using today's inflation-adjusted dollars) was about $40,000. The figure for men in their 30s now is $35,000.
 It's not hard to understand why surveys show that overwhelming percentages of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. The American dream is on life support. Polls show that dwindling numbers of Americans (in some cases as few as a third of all respondents) believe their children will end up better off than they are.
 The upshot of all this is ominous for conservatives. The number of young people in the millennial generation (loosely defined as those born in the 1980s and 90s) is somewhere between 80 million and 95 million. That represents a ton of potential votes -- in this election and years to come. And the American Progress study shows that those young people do not feel that they have been treated kindly by conservative policies or principles.
 According to the study: ''Millennials mostly reject the conservative viewpoint that government is the problem, and that free markets always produce the best results for society. Indeed, Millennials' views are more progressive than those of other age groups today, and are more progressive than previous generations when they were younger.''
 The Demos study pointed to the very difficult employment environment confronting young adults. Fewer jobs offer the benefits of paid vacations, health coverage or pensions. And moving up the employment ladder is much harder.
 As the study noted, ''The well-paying middle-management jobs that characterized the work force up to the late-1970s have been eviscerated.''
 The longer-term outlook is depressing.
 Except for the expected continuing demand for registered nurses, the occupations projected to add the most jobs over the next several years do not offer much in the way of pay, benefits or career advancement. Demos listed the top five occupations in terms of anticipated job growth: registered nurses, retail sales, customer service reps, food preparers and office clerks.
 Often saddled with debt, and with their job prospects gloomy, young Americans feel their government ought to be doing more to enhance their prospects. They want increased investments in education, health care and initiatives aimed at expanding the economy and fostering the growth of good jobs.
 The American Progress study found that Millennials are more likely to support universal health coverage than any other age group over the past 30 years. By huge percentages, they want improvements in health coverage and support for education, even if it means increases in taxes.
 The landscape is changing before our eyes. Younger voters struggling with the enormous costs of a college education, or trying to raise families in a bleak employment environment, or using their credit cards to cover everyday expenses like food or energy costs are not much interested in hearing that the government to which they pay taxes can do little or nothing to help them.
 Whether young Americans can shift the balance of the presidential election is an open question. But there is very little doubt that over the next several years they are capable of loosening the tremendous grip that conservatives have had on the levers of American power.

HEADLINE: GREENHOUSE GAS MUST BE CAPPED, MCCAIN ASSERTS

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and JOHN M. BRODER; Elisabeth Bumiller reported from Portland, Ore., and John M. Broder from Washington. Kitty Bennett contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain sought to distance himself from President Bush on Monday as he called for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States to combat climate change.
 Mr. McCain, in a speech at a wind power company, also pledged to work with the European Union to diplomatically engage China and India, two of the world's biggest polluters, if they refuse to participate in an international agreement to slow global warming.
 In the prepared text of his speech, e-mailed to reporters on Sunday night and Monday morning, Mr. McCain went so far as to call for punitive tariffs against China and India if they evaded international standards on emissions, but he omitted the threat in his delivered remarks. Aides said he had decided to soften his language because he thought he could be misinterpreted as being opposed to free trade, a central tenet of his campaign and Republican orthodoxy.
 But he took a shot at Mr. Bush. 
 ''I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears,'' Mr. McCain said pointedly. ''I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges.'' 
 In speeches on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain frequently highlights the threat of climate change, but he has a mixed record on the environment in the Senate. In recent years he has pushed legislation to curb emissions that contribute to climate change, but he has missed votes on toughening fuel economy standards and has opposed tax breaks meant to encourage alternative energy.
 In his address on Monday, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, renewed his support for a ''cap-and-trade'' system in which power plants and other polluters could meet limits on heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from more efficient producers.
 Mr. McCain's break with the Bush administration means that the three main presidential candidates have embraced swifter action to fight global warming. 
 The two Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination, Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, criticized the McCain plan as too timid, because their plans would reduce emissions more quickly. Leaders of several environmental groups were also sharply critical and noted Mr. McCain's Senate votes against incentives for energy conservation and alternative energy sources like wind and solar power.
 Other environmental advocates offered qualified praise for Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who was among the first in Congress to introduce legislation to address the carbon emissions that scientists blame for the warming of the planet.
 Mr. McCain said Monday that the problem demanded urgent national and international action.
 ''Instead of idly debating the precise extent of global warming, or the precise timeline of global warming, we need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters, and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring,'' he said at a Vestas wind turbine manufacturing plant in Oregon, where the environment is a central issue for voters. ''We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great.''
 The senator's remarks were a clear criticism of Mr. Bush, who in his first term questioned the scientific basis for global warming and who has remained opposed to mandatory caps on emissions, which he says would be bad for the American economy. The administration also rejected the international Kyoto protocol, which limits emissions of heat-trapping gases. 
 Mr. McCain's speech, a compilation and sharpening of many of his existing proposals, was most notable as a political document that sought to appeal to the independents he is wooing for November. It put him slightly to the right of center in the environmental debate.
 Mr. McCain simultaneously released a television commercial in Oregon about his position on climate change and startled audience members at his speech by praising and sharing the stage with Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, Democrat of Oregon, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president.
 Mr. McCain is the only Republican presidential candidate this year to call for mandatory limits on heat-trapping gases, but his target for reducing emissions is lower than that of Senators Clinton and Obama, and even lower than that in a bill proposed by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia.
 In his speech, Mr. McCain advocated cutting emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050; Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama propose cutting them by 80 percent in the same time frame, while the Lieberman-Warner bills calls for a 70 percent reduction. Scientists say reductions of that magnitude are needed to slow and then reverse production of the gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, which are heating the atmosphere and causing long-term climate changes.
 Mr. McCain said the United States must seek new, cleaner sources of energy to replace the burning of coal and oil, which produce the bulk of the gases that are blamed for the warming of the planet. ''As we move toward all of these goals, and over time put the age of fossil fuels behind us,'' he said, ''we must consider every alternative source of power, and that includes nuclear power.''
 Mr. McCain has long advocated nuclear power as a way to cut emissions, and frequently promotes it in his campaign appearances as an alternative energy source. His view is shared by many utility executives and many Republicans in Congress, but it puts him at odds with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, who have expressed skepticism about the cost and safety of nuclear power plants.
 There are no incentives for building new nuclear plants in the Lieberman-Warner legislation now before the Senate that his Democratic rivals have endorsed, and Mr. McCain suggested Friday that he would not support the measure unless it contained some nuclear power subsidies. 
 Mr. McCain's proposal in his prepared remarks to impose tariffs on industrializing countries like China and India is also made in the Lieberman-Warner bill and reflects concerns by both industry and labor in the United States and elsewhere in the industrialized world. It would mandate punitive duties on products from any country that did not participate in a global carbon-reduction system, to balance the lower cost of producing goods using dirty-energy sources. 
 In another contrast with Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain also sought to persuade voters that he had a personal concern and firsthand experience with climate change, which has emerged as a major issue in the 2008 presidential race.
 ''A few years ago I traveled to the area of Svalbard, Norway -- it's a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I was shown the southernmost point where a glacier had reached 20 years earlier. From there, we went northward for miles, up the fjord to see where that same glacier ends today, because all the rest, all the rest, has melted.''
 Reaction to Mr. McCain proposals from environmental advocates was lukewarm. Several environmental groups said that his plan did not go far enough but that they were grateful to hear a Republican recognizing what they consider an urgent problem and offering a detailed plan to solve it. But Mr. McCain came under considerable criticism for repeatedly opposing federal programs to encourage energy conservation and alternative fuel sources.
 Daniel J. Weiss, who heads the global warming program at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic policy shop in Washington, said Mr. McCain had often voted with Democrats on environmental bills but at other times had taken contrary positions. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Senator John McCain's proposals to combat global warming referred incorrectly to the Washington-based Center for American Progress, whose top official noted that Mr. McCain sometimes voted with Democrats on environmental bills. Although the Center for American Progress often supports policies espoused by the Democratic Party, it is not ''a Democratic policy shop'' or officially affiliated with the party.

HEADLINE: Clinton Running Hard In Campaign's Last Laps

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from South Charleston, W.Va., and Katharine Q. Seelye from Logan, W.Va.

 BODY:
Forget the calls for her to quit the presidential race: Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is determined to rack up two big primary victories in the next eight days -- in West Virginia and Kentucky -- as she seeks to prove her continued political viability and claim bargaining chips that might help her exit the race on her terms, her advisers say.
 It is a risky proposition. Mrs. Clinton is behind Senator Barack Obama in both the national popular vote and the delegate count, and she could appear to be a spoiler if she damages his candidacy in those two closely fought states, her advisers acknowledge. 
 But she and her chief political counselor, her husband, see the two coming primaries as crucial to strengthening her standing and, if it comes to it, to allowing her to leave the race on a high note, the advisers say.
 Sizable victories -- the Clinton camp believes it could win West Virginia by 25 points or more -- might put pressure on Mr. Obama to agree to her demands to seat the disputed delegates from Michigan and Florida, some of her advisers say, which would let her claim a victory on a battle she has fought for months. Accumulating victories this late in the primary season -- as Mr. Obama looks so strong -- might also bolster a bid for the vice presidency, should she decide to seek it. (Whether Mr. Obama would ask her, however, is very much in doubt.)
 The two candidates campaigned across West Virginia on Monday, with Mrs. Clinton's motorcade driving more than two hours through the winding hills of Appalachia, where she courted a relatively small number of voters in hopes of driving up her expected margin of victory. She is counting on a big victory to impress undecided superdelegates, the party leaders who will most likely decide the nomination.
 Mrs. Clinton also wants to show strength in Kentucky and West Virginia -- states Democrats have struggled to carry in presidential elections -- not to mention, advisers say, pointing up what the Clinton campaign sees as the weakness of the Obama coalition. But advisers acknowledged that even if she won those states by wide margins, it was probably too late to change the dynamic of the nominating contest in her favor.
 ''Obama is so far ahead at this point, it is hard to see anything we do, even big wins, being a game-changer at this point,'' said one senior adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to assess Mrs. Clinton's political fortunes.
 Mrs. Clinton plans to spend the day after the West Virginia primary meeting with advisers and top fund-raisers to discuss the future of the campaign. Aides said they believed she was likely to remain in the race until the Kentucky primary next Tuesday.
 Obama advisers see that day, when Oregon also votes, as the unofficial end of the primary season; they plan to declare victory then by stating that they have locked up a majority of the pledged delegates.
 Mr. Obama is now caught between the end of his long primary battle with Mrs. Clinton and the start of the fight with the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain. Mr. Obama's remarks at stops in West Virginia and Kentucky on Monday seemed largely geared to the fall campaign, with several critiques of Mr. McCain on issues including the economy and Iraq. In Louisville, Ky., on Monday night he praised Mrs. Clinton as a ''capable, smart, hard-working, intelligent human being.'' 
 His coming schedule also reflects how his campaign has started to look past Mrs. Clinton. On Wednesday, he is headed to Macomb County, Mich., an area that has long been synonymous with so-called Reagan Democrats. Michigan is a state aides to Mr. McCain see as highly competitive, given the number of blue-collar workers there and Mr. Obama's difficulties in winning support from those voters in the primaries.
 In addition, Michigan -- along with Florida -- held its primary in defiance of Democratic Party rules, so Mr. Obama did not campaign or build up an organization there. 
 At a brief news conference at a pool hall in South Charleston, W.Va., Mr. Obama echoed his campaign's openness to a Democratic National Committee plan that would end the dispute over how delegates from Michigan would be seated at the Democratic convention this summer.
 Under the proposal, 69 Michigan delegates would be seated for Mrs. Clinton, who won the primary there, and 59 would be seated for Mr. Obama, who withdrew his name from the ballot because of the state's violation of party rules.
 ''I think it is a legitimate approach to trying to solve the problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''There haven't been final negotiations on it, but what we have said is that we will strongly consider it and I think it is a legitimate approach to trying to resolve an issue.''
 Next week, Mr. Obama plans to spend three full days in Florida.
 Mr. Obama's aides were quick to say that his schedule does not reflect a view that the primary contest with Mrs. Clinton is over, noting that he is also going to Oregon this weekend. But they left no doubt that they were concerned with the head start Mr. McCain is getting in the general election campaign and did not want to leave him unattended.
 ''Our schedule reflects the fact that we are still fighting for votes and delegates in the remaining contests, but also that we are going to places that are going to be competitive in the fall,'' said an Obama spokesman, Bill Burton.
 In Charleston on Monday, Mr. Obama pursued a dual strategy on the stump: He criticized Mr. McCain, whose campaign was happy to engage in a daylong exchange of e-mail messages with the Obama team, and sought to dampen expectations by predicting a loss to Mrs. Clinton in the state's primary on Tuesday. 
 ''I think there is no doubt that Senator Clinton is favored to win,'' he said at the news conference in South Charleston, where a local television reporter asked him about voters who may think he is ''un-American.'' 
 ''Hopefully they'll watch your program tonight,'' he said. ''They'll know that I'm a practicing Christian. They'll know that my grandfather fought in World War II and I was raised to love America.''

HEADLINE: Bluestone Boom Opens Quarries To New Allies, and to Change

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: HANCOCK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Five-foot-10, 270 pounds, with truck axle arms and a rawhide neck, Earl F. Hennessey is a third-generation Catskill quarryman who always did things the way his daddy and granddaddy taught him. 
 Now the state wants him to change.
 Hennesseys have been pulling bluestone out of a ridge near Gee Brook since 1934. Mostly they used hand tools -- sledges and wedges and rock hooks and butterfly plugs -- to get at the smooth, flat slabs of stone that are shipped off to New York City and other places for old-fashioned sidewalks and new rustic patios. When they were done with one section, they would push the scrap rock over the ridge, and let their old trucks rust wherever they died. 
 After more than 70 years of gnawing at this rock ledge, the Hennesseys have roughed up their mountaintop some. As big a man as he is, Mr. Hennessey is dwarfed by the rusted metal, old wood and mounds of bluestone scrap of his past. 
 But since he took out a state mining permit for the first time two years ago, this 53-year-old quarryman, in jeans, T-shirt and blue bandanna headband, has been piling up scrap rock where he can easily put it back when the bluestone runs out. He's also been cleaning up. ''The state told me I really should get rid of the old metal, and that's what I've been doing,'' he said. Last month he sliced up a 1936 International Harvester dump truck and hauled it to a scrap yard. 
 That, in essence, is the kind of reaction the State Department of Environmental Conservation has hoped for since it started experimenting with mining permits in 2002. The new permitting process combined with an increased demand for bluestone has led to a boom in one of the state's oldest and most traditional industries. 
 Scores of new mines have been opened in the last six years, and many old ones have been reactivated. Bluestone, which had shrunk to little more than memories -- is now a $100-million-a-year industry, located mostly in economically depressed Delaware and Broome Counties in the Catskills. 
 At the same time, the state hoped that by issuing permits it could assert some control over the bluestone industry, rein in renegade miners from out of state, and change the habits of the fiercely independent quarrymen. 
 State officials consider the effort so successful from both economic and environmental perspectives that they have taken the unusual step of openly lobbying to extend the two-year measure, which expires at the end of July. Legislation to make it permanent has passed the State Senate and is expected to come up for a vote in the Assembly this month. 
 ''Rather than go in wholesale with guns blazing and multiple enforcement against the industry, we decided to first undertake an education program with them saying, 'This is what you've got to do,' and then give them time to come into compliance,'' said Bradley J. Field, director of the division of mineral resources at the Department of Environmental Conservation.
 That softer approach has convinced some quarrymen that the state does not mean to harass them. Even those who have never gotten a permit before find themselves siding with the department and asking for the law to made permanent. Environmental groups are more tentative. ''The state says it's a win-win situation because the law will improve the economy of the region, and at the same time give regulators the ability to keep an eye on what's happening,'' said Ramsay Adams, executive director of the Catskill Mountainkeeper, an environmental group. ''If that's the case, then it's something worth looking at. But I'm just not sure that the law they are trying to pass permanently is strong enough.'' 
 The link between the Catskill Mountain bluestone quarries and New York City is as durable as the stone slabs themselves. Some of New York's first sidewalks laid in the early 19th century were made of Catskill bluestone, and in parts of the city they are still in place, though Mr. Hennessey said he had never seen one because he has never been to New York. The rock, a kind of sandstone found only in New York and eastern Pennsylvania, usually is light blue, but it can be gray, green or red. 
 By 1870, cutting the slabs out of mountain ledges became such big business that William M. Tweed, the political boss, finagled a partnership out of the New York and Pennsylvania Bluestone Company. He profited greatly by then arranging for the company to supply bluestone for city sidewalks.
 By the end of the 19th century, an estimated 10,000 men worked bluestone in New York. The Catskills were riddled with quarries. 
 As concrete sidewalks replaced bluestone, the industry declined. Then, in 1996, Pennsylvania tightened its restrictions on bluestone mining. Pennsylvania quarrymen flooded into New York, apparently misreading New York's bluestone mining law. 
 The law requires quarrymen to have a permit if they extract more than 1,000 tons of minerals in a year. The Pennsylvania quarrymen assumed that meant 1,000 tons of bluestone, and they simply never bothered to get their permits. But officials said that ''overburden'' -- the dirt and rock that have to be moved to get at the bluestone -- was meant to be included in the 1,000 tons. 
 Harry S. Triebe Sr., owner of Sonny & Sons Stone Co. in Downsville, N.Y. and a past president of the New York Bluestone Association, said that quarrymen usually have to remove ten times as much overburden as bluestone when they mine a deposit. He said they could exceed the 1,000 ton threshold in as little as a day. 
 ''Until we actually work a quarry, we don't know what's there,'' Mr. Triebe said. That meant going through the process of getting a full scale mining permit, and putting up a $5,000 to $10,000 reclamation bond, without knowing if there was enough good quality bluestone to even recoup the cost of the permit. An average quarryman can make about $25,000 to $35,000 a year, Mr. Triebe said. 
 Most bluestone quarries are nothing like the big sand and gravel excavation pits commonly seen in New York. Bluestone quarries typically cover less than five acres and are worked by one to five men. Most are invisible, hidden in hollows or at the far end of back country roads. 
 In 2002, New York amended its mining law to give quarrymen more flexibility in exploring for bluestone. Instead of forcing them to get a full mining permit before they could start working, the state issued less costly exploration authorizations. These permitted Mr. Hennessey and other quarrymen to work on less than one acre for a year to see if there was enough bluestone in a new ledge, or in an abandoned one, to turn a profit. 
 But there's more. The permitting process allows state officials to get onto the quarries, where they can work with the men, as they did with Mr. Hennessey, to clean up and better protect the environment. 
 ''Earl's quarry is a perfect example of what the state wanted to accomplish,'' said Thomas P. Decker, a geologist who works with the quarrymen. ''Before, the state didn't have knowledge of places like this. Now they know where they are, and they can make sure that after the quarrymen are done, they put these places back the way they were.'' 
 The authorizations can be renewed for a second year. After that, they must either be converted to a full five-year mining permit, or surrendered, and the one-acre site restored. There are now 85 fully permitted bluestone mines in New York. Many more continue to operate without permits.
 Blood ties to land and stone are strong in this region. Mr. Hennessey's father first brought him to the quarry when he was 3, and rock dust has been in his blood since then. Even during the 20 years he served in the Navy, he dreamed of coming back to the mountain. 
 ''It's kind of like farming; it's a way of life,'' Mr. Hennessey said. His days start at sunrise, summer and winter, and when he is on the ridge, alone or with his brother-in-law Gerald Wormuth, there is no phone, no electricity, no water. The work is back-breaking hard, and the material pleasures are few. 
 But at 2,500 feet above sea level, Mr. Hennessey can see across several valleys without spying a house or a road. Deer and hawks come close, and it's awesome, he says. 
 ''It's a hard way to make a living,'' he said, ''but it's a good way to live.'' 
 The quarrymen have won the support of Senator John J. Bonacic, an upstate Republican who sponsored the bill to make the exploration authorization laws permanent. He did the same three years ago when the law expired for the first time, but the effort stalled in the Assembly. 
 Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney, a Long Island Democrat who is chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, said the state's endorsement of the measure this time should make the difference. ''Without that, we wouldn't be making it permanent,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hennessey said he did not look forward to changing the way he had done things since he was a boy, but he realized that change may be necessary, and he was willing to give it a try. 
 ''I'm not saying it's bad, the stuff they want us to do,'' he said. ''You've just got to do things different than you did them years ago.''

HEADLINE: A Liberal Wit Builds Bridges To the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative Barney Frank, the rumpled, cantankerous chairman of the Financial Services Committee, plopped down on a leather bench off the House floor last week. After two months of trying to win Republican support for his bill to help homeowners at risk of foreclosure, he had come up short. 
 The White House had just threatened a veto.
 But Mr. Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat and the most prominent gay member of Congress, who always seems on the verge of an outburst, was more philosophical than combustible as he explained the administration's opposition.
 Between an economic stimulus package and the Federal Reserve's rescue of Wall Street, he said, ''they have been pushed into accepting a lot of government help for the market.'' 
 ''People aren't good at doing things they dislike,'' he added.
 Then, in a flash of trademark wit, he said that asking the White House to support more government intervention was ''like asking me to judge the Miss America contest -- if your heart's not in it, you don't do a very good job.''
 With relations between the White House and the Democratic Congress growing more acidic as the presidential election approaches, Mr. Frank, 68 and in his 14th term, has emerged as a key deal-maker, an unlikely bridge between his party's left-wing base and the free-market conservatives in the administration, particularly Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 In the process, Mr. Frank has won praise, even from some Republican colleagues in the House who generally disagree with his politics but say he has treated them with a fair hand and an eye toward compromise.
 Mr. Frank has ascended to his powerful committee chairmanship at a critical time, with the economy in turmoil and housing, the issue he is most passionate about, on center stage. And it is with great glee, usually to emphasize a centrist position on an issue, that he quotes Republican warnings in a 2006 campaign advertisement that he would pursue a ''radical homosexual agenda'' were Democrats to win control of Congress.
 It is a role he clearly relishes but also one that is testing his impatience, which even allies say can lead to impulsiveness, and his ability to control his sharp tongue, which can be amusing but also downright mean. 
 Longtime friends and colleagues say Mr. Frank is more self-assured than he was in 1989 when he admitted hiring a male prostitute as a personal aide; the man had run an escort service from Mr. Frank's apartment without his knowledge.
 And yet, they say, while his hair is thinner and his paunch a bit flabbier, he has not mellowed much from a decade ago, when he emerged as one of President Clinton's fiercest defenders during impeachment proceedings. 
 Mr. Frank is as close a contemporary as Speaker Nancy Pelosi has in Congress, born just five days after her. He has been a point man for the Democratic leadership not just on housing, but on the economic stimulus package approved in February and on a bill outlawing workplace discrimination against gay men and lesbians approved last fall. 
 Many say they also respect his zest for cutting a deal and, indeed, Mr. Frank still hopes to reach one on the housing legislation. To appeal to the White House, he has made numerous revisions, including dropping a plan to have the government serve as a clearinghouse for auctioning bundles of refinanced mortgages. 
 Within the administration, where some high-level officials privately refer to him as ''scary smart,'' no one is underestimating him. After the House approved his bill on Thursday, though without enough votes to override a veto, Mr. Frank quickly went on the offensive, seeking to undercut the administration's argument that homeowners in trouble should have known better. 
 ''No dumb people got America into this problem,'' he snapped. ''You had to be really smart to understand collateralized debt obligation derivatives.''
 Mr. Frank, who holds degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School, understands collateralized debt obligations. 
 What vexes the administration, at times, is that he also holds strong liberal feelings about what he views as the government's top obligations -- to aid the poor and protect victims of discrimination, to police the markets and, in the case of as many as two million Americans at risk of losing their homes, to offer a helping hand if one is needed.
 Some Republicans say it is a mistake to typecast Mr. Frank. 
 ''I think that Barney is misunderstood in some quarters as just being a hard-bound ideological liberal,'' said Michael G. Oxley, the former congressman from Ohio who preceded Mr. Frank as chairman of the Financial Services Committee, ''when in fact his legislative career has been really full of accomplishment and understanding of how markets work and how systems work.'' 
 Mr. Oxley, a Republican, said that in the current Congress, Mr. Frank had ''really stepped up and filled a void.''
 ''Just the fact that he was willing to step in and forge a relationship with Hank Paulson, to try to get things done, I think that's always been Barney's strength,'' he said.
 Mr. Paulson has said that when he arrived in Washington, he was surprised to discover Mr. Frank's keen understanding of Wall Street, given his lack of work experience in the private sector. In an interview, Mr. Paulson said he had enjoyed Mr. Frank's penchant for brokering deals. 
 ''Because he is looking to get things done and make a difference, he focuses on areas of agreement and tries to build on those,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''He doesn't waste anybody's time, your time or his.'' 
 And, he added, ''It's always more fun to work with someone who has got a sense of humor.'' 
 A veteran of parliamentary battles, Mr. Frank is a master of procedural weaponry. When a tactic by Republicans backfired and stripped out provisions that they had wanted, Mr. Frank initially refused to let them fix it. 
 ''If you want to look at this as one big circus, today is the day that the gentleman from Alabama gets to clean up after the elephants,'' he said, referring to Representative Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican on his committee. ''And I mean elephants.'' 
 During debate on the bill, a measure to provide debt relief to impoverished countries, he won praise from Republicans. 
 ''Barney has been very fair,'' said Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California and one of the most conservative members of the House. ''I think that I have been treated more fairly, and a number of my Republican colleagues have been treated more fairly, since the Democrats have become the majority than I was treated by my own leadership.''
 Mr. Frank politely interjected, ''I know the gentleman joins me in looking forward to continued years of such treatment.'' 
 Such friendly banter was a far cry from the day in 1995 when Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, referred to him as ''Barney Fag'' in a radio interview. 
 Mr. Frank, who was born and raised in New Jersey, where his father owned a truck stop, often speaks eloquently about the discrimination experienced by gay men and lesbians. 
 ''I used to be someone subject to this prejudice, and, through luck, circumstance, I got to be a big shot,'' he said during debate on the employment nondiscrimination bill in November. '' I am now above that prejudice. But I feel an obligation to 15-year-olds dreading to go to school because of the torments, to people afraid that they will lose their job in a gas station if someone finds out who they love.''
 Other times, though, Mr. Frank's impatience and sharp tongue take over.
 When Representative Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, criticized a component of the housing bill that would give money to local governments to buy and repair foreclosed properties, saying it would not protect homeowners from foreclosure, Mr. Frank fired back that preventing foreclosures was the goal of a different bill. 
 ''The notion that this bill doesn't keep people out of foreclosure is true,'' he said. ''It doesn't combat global warming. It doesn't get troops out of Iraq. It won't help me lose weight. There are a lot of things this bill won't do that I very much want to do. None of them are a reason to vote against a bill that doesn't do what it doesn't say it's going to do but does what it does. What it does is go to the aid of cities that have been victimized.'' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY STEPHEN CROWLEY/THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHART: A WAY WITH WORDS: Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a master of the one-liner -- a self-described ''left-handed, gay Jew'' who is not accustomed to being in the majority on anything and yet is one of the most powerful members of Congress. Here are some examples, customarily delivered rapid-fire in his trademark accent, a New Jersey- Boston blend. MARCH 11 ''Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is blatant hypocrisy a violation of the rules of the House?'' Responding to Republican complaints that Democrats had extended the voting period for 15 minutes to win approval of a bill creating an independent House ethics office. In 2003, the Republicans once extended the voting period for three hours to get their desired outcome. NOV. 7, 2007 ''I am grateful for the obscurity of the opposition's argument.'' In a debate over the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a bill to prohibit discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation. JULY 18, 2006 ''So, apparently, same-sex marriage is the V8 juice of America.'' During a debate over a ''marriage protection'' amendment, Mr. Frank said he did not understand Republican arguments that gay marriages would undermine traditional marriages, as if happily married men in Indiana, Nebraska, Kansas and Mississippi, learning that same-sex marriage was legal in Massachusetts, would smack themselves in the head and declare, ''Wow, I could have married a guy.'' SEPT. 11, 1986 ''I am afraid that this bill is becoming the legislative equivalent to crack. It's going to give people a short-term high, but it is going to be dangerous in the long run to the system and expensive to boot.'' During debate on a bill authorizing $4 billion for the war on drugs, and allowing the military to protect the nation's borders from drug traffickers. MARCH 6, 1984 ''Well, if this is a Christian nation, how come some poor Jew has to get up at 5:30 in the morning to preside over the House of Representatives?'' Mr. Frank, in an interview describing his reaction when Representative Marjorie S. Holt, Republican of Maryland, declared America to be a Christian nation during an all-night debate over school prayer. Mr. Frank, who is Jewish, was presiding as the speaker pro tem.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves $350 Million in Projects Intended for Economic Development

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
While state analysts are forecasting lean times, lawmakers are bankrolling what some see as a bumper crop of pork. 
 Late Tuesday, the Senate approved $350 million worth of capital projects. At the direction of Senate Republicans, the state will be spending $5 million to pay for buses at private or parochial schools, $1 million to finance an archival depository at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan and $500,000 for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. 
 ''These economic development projects will continue our successful partnership among the private sector, higher education and state government to help create new jobs and retain the highly skilled work force necessary to sustain future economic growth,'' the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said in a statement. 
 The projects are part of $1.2 billion set aside in the budget to be spread around by legislative leaders and Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, in the name of economic development. But the secretive process of how Albany lawmakers in the majority parties pick and choose projects in their districts has long been criticized, particularly when it involves large amounts of borrowed money in a state already awash in debt. 
 ''The problem with these types of allocations is it's hard to know if they have any benefit,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director for the Citizens Budget Commission. ''How does anyone know whether these organizations have merit? Some may, some may not. There just isn't a lot of scrutiny of this part of the budget.''
 ''The budget is already in need of cutting, and they continue to spend on the capital side without much restraint,'' she added. ''They get the benefit of cutting ribbons now and paying for it later.''
 Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Manhattan Institute's Empire Center for New York State Policy, which advocates lower spending, said, ''They're spending scarce capital funding on political wants when there are billions of real infrastructure needs and commitments that won't be covered by the current highway, bridge and mass transit plans.''
 The budget also sets aside $350 million for capital grants allocated by the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. Most of those projects were selected and disclosed at the time the budget passed in April, however. The projects are intended ''to help develop a strong, job-creating climate,'' according to an Assembly news release at the time.
 Private corporations, including many based upstate, accounted for tens of millions of dollars in capital grants from the Assembly. Magna Powertrain, an auto parts manufacturer, received a $13 million grant for its Syracuse-area plant. Both chambers are directing millions of dollars to renovate a Hyatt hotel in Buffalo and a historic hotel in Syracuse.
 Five state university campuses received grants totaling $38 million from the Assembly, including money for the high-tech ''incubator programs'' and $7 million to build an ''Equine Physiology and Rehabilitation Center'' at the State University at Morrisville. The Assembly's largest grant so far this year, $25 million, went to the University of Rochester to build a new center for clinical and translational sciences. 
 Tens of millions of dollars went to museums, libraries and civic institutions in New York City, including $2 million for the Brooklyn Academy of Music; $5 million for El Museo del Barrio, a museum in East Harlem dedicated to Latino culture; and $15 million for the Queens Museum of Art.
 In the Senate, millions of dollars were directed to private businesses like Akrimax Pharmaceuticals and Empire AgriFuel LLC in the hopes of preserving jobs upstate. Companies often reciprocate the largess by making political contributions to the sponsoring lawmakers. 
 Regarding museums that received grants, John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said, ''They are a tourist attraction and a destination for people.''
 ''In many of these communities, particularly upstate, these museums are a big draw,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Colombia Extradites 14 Paramilitary Leaders to the United States

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, and Jenny Carolina Gonzalez from Bogota, Colombia.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Colombia extradited 14 jailed paramilitary leaders to the United States on Tuesday, in an effort by President Alvaro Uribe to take a hard line against the warlords and defuse a scandal that has tied them to senior lawmakers in the Colombian Congress and members of his own family. 
 The extraditions of so many paramilitary leaders at once was unprecedented in Colombia's long history of trying to dismantle the hydra-headed syndicates that export cocaine to the United States. They come at a delicate moment for Colombia's government, which is trying to win approval of a trade agreement with the United States. 
 Senior Democrats in Congress have opposed the trade deal, saying that Mr. Uribe has not made enough progress in curbing human rights abuses and prosecuting those responsible.
 The extraditions seemed to indicate a new push by Mr. Uribe's government to prevent the rearming of the paramilitary armies after years in which violence in Colombia's internal war has waned.
 The extraditions were carried out by surprise in the early hours of Tuesday with dozens of elite police officers gathering the men from three high-security prisons in Colombia. Interior Minister Carlos Holguin said the men were put aboard a plane in Bogota bound for the United States, where they will face drug-trafficking charges. 
 ''Most of the top bosses are there,'' Mr. Holguin said, speaking on Colombian radio. ''In some cases they were still committing crimes and reorganizing criminal structures.'' 
 The extraditions are likely to add fodder not only to the fierce debate around the trade agreement, but also to the debate in Colombia about the best way to prosecute those accused of committing some of the worst atrocities in Colombia's long war. 
 Human rights groups say the extraditions will put the warlords outside the reach of Colombia's judicial system. While the men may now face lengthy sentences in the United States for drug-trafficking offenses, their crimes related to the war in Colombia may go unpunished, they said. 
 ''These men are not going to be held accountable for the human rights violations they committed,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch. ''Victims in Colombia will not be able to confront their tormentors and receive the reparations they deserve.'' 
 Still, some of the men extradited to the United States could spend more time in prison in the United States on drug trafficking charges than they would in Colombia for their actions during the war. It was also clear that some warlords had effectively controlled their armies from prison, thwarting efforts to prevent a paramilitary resurgence.
 Reports of an increase in extrajudicial slayings this year, in particular a rise in killings of union members, have plagued Mr. Uribe's attempts to win approval of the trade deal in the United States Congress. In the past, paramilitaries were responsible for many of those killings, though it was unclear whether any of the extradited leaders were directly linked to the recent crimes.
 In any case, the move by Mr. Uribe demonstrates a resolve to confront the paramilitaries despite a slow-burning scandal of revelations of ties to the militias that had ensnared the president's political supporters, including top lawmakers and Mr. Uribe's former intelligence chief.
 ''This is an astonishing move for Uribe, who is trying to demonstrate to the U.S. Congress that rumors of his ties to the paramilitaries are false,'' said Bruce Bagley, an expert on the Andean drug war at the University of Miami. ''This should go over well with the Democratic Congress.'' 
 Still, perceptions of justice will depend on the sentences meted out. Mr. Bagley said human right groups would closely follow the sentencing, especially after moves by the Bush administration to reduce prison terms for top drug traffickers in exchange for information about the functioning of their networks.
 American officials were vague as to whether prison sentences would be lenient or long. The Justice Department in Washington said in a statement that it had assured Colombia's government that it would not seek life sentences for any of the defendants.
 The paramilitary leaders extradited to the United States included a top warlord, Salvatore Mancuso, who oversaw atrocities like the massacre of 15 civilians and displacement of more than 600 people in 1997 in the town of El Aro, which has come to symbolize the path undertaken by the militias throughout the 1990s. 
 Mr. Uribe's government, the Bush administration's top ally in Latin America, has already extradited more than 700 Colombians to the United States since 2002. Most of those extraditions were of low-level operators in Colombia's resilient cocaine trade.
 Despite the disbursement of more than $600 million a year in aid from the United States to fight drug trafficking and leftist guerrillas, Colombia remains the world's largest cocaine producer and the source of about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States. Paramilitary leaders came to control many of the thriving drug syndicates. 
 Landowners established the private armies in the 1980s to combat the leftist insurgencies, but the paramilitaries eventually attained broad influence in Colombia's economic and political structures. Disclosures of ties between the paramilitaries and prominent political supporters of Mr. Uribe have recently shaken the country. 
 For instance, Mr. Uribe's cousin and close political collaborator, Mario Uribe, a former senator, was detained in April on charges of collaborating with the paramilitaries. And more than two dozen other members of the Colombian Congress have been arrested on claims of having similar ties. 
 Some of these revelations were obtained from the jailed warlords as part of a peace process that demobilized thousands of combatants in the private armies. That process is now thrown into doubt with these extraditions.
 ''The idea that the United States will require the paramilitaries to collaborate with the victims is a lie that is being sold to the country,'' said Eduardo Bocanegra, the lawyer for Rodrigo Tovar Pupo, one of the extradited warlords. 
 ''The reparations were not only monetary,'' Mr. Bocanegra said. ''They were also symbolic; the paramilitaries were providing information about the bodies found in mass graves.''
 But Mr. Uribe said on Tuesday that an agreement had been reached for the proceeds obtained from fines and confiscations of property from the paramilitary leaders in the United States to go to Colombian victims or their families. ''This is notice,'' Mr. Uribe told reporters in Bogota, ''that the law must be respected.''

HEADLINE: A City Cooler and Dimmer, And, Oh Yes, Proving a Point

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska 

 BODY:
Conservationists swoon at the possibility of it all. Here in Alaska, where melting arctic ice and eroding coastlines have made global warming an urgent threat, this little city has cut its electricity use by more than 30 percent in a matter of weeks, instantly establishing itself as a role model for how to go green, and fast. 
 Comfort has been recalibrated. The public sauna has been closed and the lights have been dimmed at the indoor community pool. At the library, one of the two elevators was shut down after someone figured out it cost 20 cents for each round trip. The thermostat at the convention center was dialed down eight degrees, to 60. The marquee outside is dark. 
 Schoolchildren sacrifice Nintendo time and boast at show-and-tell of kilowatts saved. Hotels consult safety regulations to be sure they have not unscrewed too many light bulbs in the hallways. On a recent weekday, all but one of the dozens of television screens on display at the big Fred Meyer store were black -- off, that is. 
 Yet even as they embrace a fluorescent future, the 31,000 residents of Juneau, the state capital, are not necessarily doing it for the greater good. They face a more local inconvenient truth. Electricity rates rocketed about 400 percent after an avalanche on April 16 destroyed several major transmission towers that delivered more than 80 percent of the city's power from a hydroelectric dam about 40 miles south. 
 ''People are suddenly interested in talking about their water heaters,'' said Maria Gladziszewski, who handles special projects for the city manager's office. ''As they say, it's a teachable moment.''
 Until repairs are completed, possibly by late June, the city's private electric utility will depend almost exclusively on diesel fuel. Hydropower is one of the cheapest and cleanest power sources, while diesel, at around $4 a gallon, is one of the most expensive and dirtiest.
 With the first bills based on the increased rate scheduled to be sent out this week, fear is in the air. So is the laundry. Dryers eat up watts, and local stores ran out of clothespins because so many people started hanging their laundry outside. Never mind that it rains 220 days of the year and rarely gets truly warm here amid the fjords and forests of the Inside Passage. 
 ''It takes about two days to get them dry,'' Linda Augustine, 66, an elementary school teacher, said as she used plastic clothes hangers to dry blue jeans and T-shirts under the awning on the back porch of her mobile home. ''And I don't iron my clothes now. You massage them to get the wrinkles out while they're still on the hanger.''
 The new rate is about 53 cents per kilowatt-hour, up from about 11 cents -- around the national average -- before the avalanche. The average residential bill before the avalanche was about $86 a month.
 The greening of Juneau has made for an unexpected moment in the spotlight for a city some Alaskans would like to see play a lesser role. Clear skies in Juneau reveal sheer, snow-capped mountains lining the Gastineau Channel and bald eagles coasting over the water the way crows might elsewhere. But the city's remote location and abundant dreariness, coupled with the fact that Anchorage -- a nearly 600-mile flight away -- has the state's economic power and 10 times Juneau's population, have long led to calls to move the capital. 
 ''Before this event on April 16, the public discourse in Juneau in terms of its future was all focused on the perennial threat of having the capital relocated,'' said Mayor Bruce Botelho. ''It was the subject of three different pieces of legislation, all of which had hearings this year.''
 Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican from an Anchorage suburb, has shown little interest in spending time in Juneau, one of the state's few Democratic strongholds. While plenty of Juneau residents are irate that the electric utility, Alaska Electric Light and Power, could not prevent the avalanche damage and then passed on its costs to customers, they have also blamed Ms. Palin for rejecting a request for public money to help residents handle big bill increases.
 ''We need all the help we can get right now,'' Ashley Richardson, of the Juneau People's Power Project, said at a small protest on the Capitol steps on Friday. ''This is not our responsibility.''
 The governor has requested help from a federal loan program for small businesses hurt by the rate increase. Officials at the electric utility say they are looking at ways to ease the pain by allowing more residents to spread the higher costs over many months. The local United Way and other groups have received a city grant to help lower-income residents with their bills.
 What the avalanche has underscored, however, is that Juneau is largely on its own, whether in meeting the energy challenge or facing the broader question of its future. The gold rush that helped create the city ended a century ago, and other resource-based industries, like other forms of mining and logging, have faded amid environmental pressures and economic changes. State government and tourism are the anchors now. 
 Many residents say they were at least relieved that the power problems started as the days were growing longer and warmer. Some, seeing a silver lining, wonder if the electricity challenge, and the conservation it has prompted, might spur a new economic creativity for a city recommitted to energy efficiency. (While residents have recently rushed to convert to compact fluorescent light bulbs, Juneau is still working toward mandatory curbside recycling and it has yet to complete an audit of its carbon footprint.)
 Mr. Botelho, who said his in-box had been filling with messages from environmental start-up companies that want to make Juneau their proving ground, called the situation ''the opportunity to be our own knights in shining armor.''
 Evidence of the civic self-discipline is updated daily on the Web site of Alaska Electric Light and Power. The day before the avalanche, the city consumed 1,006 megawatt hours of electricity; on Friday, the number was 625.

HEADLINE: April Retail Sales Dipped, But Some Sectors Held Up

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United States retail sales weakened modestly in April, but outside the hard-pressed auto sector they were more resilient than many economists had forecast, a government report showed on Tuesday. 
 The report echoed recent data showing underlying economic durability, including fewer job losses in April than feared and a surprisingly strong pace of first-quarter productivity.
 The Commerce Department said overall retail sales declined 0.2 percent, but if cars were excluded, sales rose 0.5 percent. Economists expected total sales to slip 0.1 percent, but had forecast a gain of just 0.2 percent excluding autos.
 ''I think it's a report that tells you the economy is very weak, but if we are in a recession it's going to be a real short one,'' said Robert B. MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance in Boston.
 Analysts are hoping that consumer spending will at least cushion an economic slowdown and offset the dampening impact of falling housing prices. Government checks are being sent to about 130 million taxpayers under a stimulus plan.
 The economy is forecast to grow at an anemic 0.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, slowing from the scant 0.6 percent growth rate in the previous two quarters, according to a survey of economists released by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday.
 The retail sales data helped bolster the dollar, while prices for Treasury securities fell as investors bet that the data reduced chances for more cuts in interest rates.
 Other data highlighted the squeeze on consumers, who have been caught between rising food and energy prices and a crumbling housing market.
 The Labor Department said import prices climbed 1.8 percent in April as prices for both petroleum and nonpetroleum products climbed, feeding worries about the potential for inflation.
 Import prices have jumped 15.4 percent over the last year, the biggest 12-month gain since the government began publishing the data more than a quarter-century ago.
 Tuesday also brought a report from the National Association of Realtors saying median values of existing single-family homes in metropolitan areas fell 7.7 percent from a year ago.
 The Federal Reserve has cut official interest rates 3.25 percentage points, to 2 percent, since September to shield the economy from a credit squeeze stemming from the housing crisis, hoping to keep consumers from choking off their spending, which fuels two-thirds of American economic activity.
 In April, sales of building materials gained 1.9 percent, more than reversing March's 1.5 percent fall. Sales at general merchandise stores were up 0.5 percent, well ahead of March's 0.1 percent rise.
 The lofty gasoline prices that have pinched consumers' pocketbooks have also reduced their interest in new cars.
 Auto dealers experienced a 2.8 percent drop in sales during April, adding to the 0.5 percent decline posted in March. Gasoline stations reported a 0.4 percent decline in April sales after a 1.6 percent rise in March.
 The new level of cost consciousness turned up in results for Wal-Mart Stores; net income rose 7 percent in the first quarter, which ended April 30.
 The retailer noted that its customers were seeking bargains on necessities like food and were straining from paycheck to paycheck.

HEADLINE: In Paris, Owning an Eleventh of an Apartment

BYLINE: By LINDA HERVIEUX

 BODY:
PARIS
 When Steve Navaro throws open the thick silk drapes framing the large windows in his Paris pied-a-terre, he enjoys a rare luxury in this tightly packed city: a lush garden.
 The garden isn't his alone. Nor, in fact, is the apartment. Mr. Navaro, a lawyer from Denver, shares his two-bedroom apartment in the Marais neighborhood of Paris with several other owners.
 As the founding investor in the property -- and two other apartments in Paris -- Mr. Navaro, 56, was driven by a desire to find an economical way to visit Paris often despite a steadily sinking dollar. And, as a real estate investor and entrepreneur, he also wanted to make those vacations pay.
 ''I was trying to combine my love of Paris with real estate,'' he said. 
 Although the concept of fractional ownership has been slow to catch on in Europe, real estate experts say that Americans looking to buy abroad are increasingly exploring group properties, in response to economic uncertainty and the all-time-low exchange rates of the dollar. 
 For example, six dozen inquiries came flooding in last month after an American woman posted an advertisement on a Web site for expatriates. She was looking for partners to help her buy a 42-square-meter (452-square-foot) loft in the popular Ile Saint-Louis neighborhood. Two buyers quickly pledged $158,000 each, joining two others who had already signed on, said Adrian Leeds, an American property consultant in Paris who runs the Web site, parlerparis.com.
 ''The dwindling dollar means people saving up their pennies to buy property in Paris have less to spend,'' said Ms. Leeds, who is planning her own move into fractionals. ''This allows them to make an investment in a euro asset, which is crucial.''Mr. Navaro and his wife, Sue, signed the contract last August, agreeing on a price of 730,000 euros (then about $997,727). As they began searching for partners, the dollar had already fallen to $1.37 to the euro and was still dropping.
 Still, they decided a renovation was essential. The previous owners had remodeled with a modern industrial look that Mrs. Navaro described as ''hideous.'' The Navaros replaced the concrete floors with dark Brazilian wood and added recessed lighting to the living room ceiling, highlighting the 18th-century wooden beams. They also placed a decorative plaster arch over the living room doorway, complementing patches of the original stone that still can be seen in walls newly painted in soft hues of yellow. 
 With their buying power diminishing by the week, they searched for quality furniture. The only decent deals seemed to be the antiques they found at flea markets, including bronze sconces and a claw-footed dining table. ''The best time to do this was last year,'' Mr. Navaro said.
 Yet 2001 was actually the year that the Navaros began to contemplate buying their first place in Paris -- this one in the 17th Arrondissement, on the city's western side. Back then, the dollar was worth about 90 cents to the euro. Then it began to slide, as Paris real estate prices continued to climb.
 ''Each year I wanted to buy,'' Mr. Navaro said, ''and each year it got more expensive to justify. And that's when I had the idea to get partners.''
 The couple walked every street in the arrondissement before buying a 57-square-meter (614-square-foot) apartment near the Parc Monceau in 2006. They found nine other buyers to invest in the cozy one-bedroom, and liked the arrangement so much that last summer they set about looking for another property. Within three weeks they were bidding on the Marais apartment. 
 By last fall the euro was on a relentless march toward the $1.50 mark -- a figure Mr. Navaro called a ''mental threshold'' for would-be investors. The couple worried that Americans would no longer be eager to buy shares in the Marais apartment (which they had named Jardin Saint-Paul).
 But they needn't have been concerned. Of the 11 shares for sale, each at 92,000 euros ($146,000), Americans bought five. The other three owners are British, Australian and Venezuelan. Three shares remain unsold. 
 In addition, annual dues of 1,130 euros ($1,792) cover expenses like building fees and utilities. Each owner has use of the apartment during one month a year, on a three-month rotation, eliminating the thorny issue of who gets the place on holidays and summer vacations -- so someone who came in March 2008 can return in June 2009. Owners also may trade unused time with one another.
 The Navaros' stake in the two properties allows them to spend two months a year in Paris -- one month in each apartment -- at cost of less than $55 a night, a bargain in a city where four-star hotels start around $300 a night. ''Before, we could never afford to stay in Paris a month,'' Mr. Navaro said, ''but now we can.'' 
 Most fractional arrangements in Paris are organized to make the deal as easy as possible for foreign buyers. Day-to-day matters, like cleaning and repairs, are handled by local employees; the Navaros have two full-time workers who do all that, as well as stocking the apartments with chocolates, Champagne and fresh flowers. 
 The legal structure used for fractional ownership here is designed to avoid French bureaucracy and inheritance taxes that can total two-thirds of a property's value. In Mr. Navaro's case, he formed an American company, Paris Home Shares LLC, that is the primary shareholder of his French company, a Societe Civile Immobilier. The arrangement means American law governs the operating agreement among owners -- although, if an owner dies, the inheritance laws of that person's home country prevail, Mr. Navaro said.
 Today one of the best reasons to buy in Paris, where market values have risen 9 percent to 16 percent a year in recent years, is to diversify your assets at a time when the dollar shows no signs of bouncing back, several industry experts said. 
 ''It's not always easy for Americans to buy euro-based assets,'' said Andy Sirkin, an American lawyer in Paris whose international practice deals only in group properties. ''Buying a fractional is basically painless, because for all intents and purposes, it's an American transaction. It gives you all the benefits and removes all the problems.''
 But there are risks to fractional ownership, particularly if a would-be buyer's main motivation is to make money, said Tony Tidswell, a real estate consultant in the South of France who lists fractional properties for sale on his Web site, nizas.com.
 One of those issues is renting. Experts are divided on whether owners could face French commercial taxes if they accepted renters for unused time. Although many fractionals allow it, the Navaros do not, just to be safe.
 The purchase of a fractional should be viewed as a ''luxury product, a personal indulgence,'' said Mr. Tidswell. 
 And in the end, many buyers do listen to their hearts, not their wallets. 
 Sandra Quesenberry didn't let the dollar ruin her dream of owning a ''little piece of France.'' She bought the first available share of Jardin Saint-Paul after seeing pictures on the Internet -- and cried when Mr. Navaro handed her the keys.
 ''I don't have a Gucci bag,'' said Ms. Quesenberry, 58, an office manager in Decatur, Ga., who stayed at the apartment for three days in December. ''I don't live extravagantly. If I was going to penny-pinch, I wouldn't have done it.''
 For his part, Mr. Navaro is so sure of the future of Paris real estate that he recently bought a third property, a two-bedroom apartment in the Seventh Arrondissement, near the Eiffel Tower, and braced for another large renovation. ''I've retired twice and I go nuts,'' he said. ''This was a perfect job.''

HEADLINE: Indians Find U.S. at Fault In Food Cost

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Instead of blaming India and other developing nations for the rise in food prices, Americans should rethink their energy policy -- and go on a diet.
 That has been the response, basically, of a growing number of politicians, economists and academics in this country, who are angry at statements by top United States officials that India's rising prosperity is to blame for food inflation. 
 The debate has sometimes devolved into what sounded like petty playground taunts over who are the real gluttons devouring the world's resources. 
 For instance, Pradeep S. Mehta, secretary general of the center for international trade, economics and the environment of CUTS International, an independent research institute based here, said that if Americans slimmed down to the weight of middle-class Indians, ''many hungry people in sub-Saharan Africa would find food on their plates.'' 
 He added, archly, that the money spent in the United States on liposuction to get rid of fat from excess consumption could be funneled to feed famine victims. 
 Mr. Mehta's comments may sound like the macroeconomic equivalent of ''so's your old man,'' but they reflect genuine outrage -- and ballooning criticism -- toward the United States in particular, over recent remarks by President Bush. 
 After a news conference in Missouri on May 2, he was quoted as saying of India's burgeoning middle class, ''When you start getting wealth, you start demanding better nutrition and better food, and so demand is high, and that causes the price to go up.''
 The comments, widely reported in the developing world, followed a statement on the subject by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that had upset many Indians. 
 In response to the president's remarks, a ranking official in the commerce ministry, Jairam Ramesh, told the Press Trust of India, ''George Bush has never been known for his knowledge of economics,'' and the remarks proved again how ''comprehensively wrong'' he is. 
 The Asian Age, a newspaper based here, argued in an editorial last week that Mr. Bush's ''ignorance on most matters is widely known and openly acknowledged by his own countrymen,'' and that he must not be allowed to ''get away'' with an effort to ''divert global attention from the truth by passing the buck on to India.''
 The developing nations, and in particular China and India, are being blamed for global problems, including the rising cost of commodities and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, because they are consuming more goods and fuel than ever before. But Indians from the prime minister's office on down frequently point out that per capita, India uses far lower quantities of commodities and pollutes far less than nations in the West, particularly the United States. 
 Explaining the food price increases, Indian politicians and academics cite consumption in the United States; the West's diversion of arable land into the production of ethanol and other biofuels; agricultural subsidies and trade barriers from Washington and the European Union; and finally the decline in the exchange rate of the dollar.
 There may be some foundation to Indians' accusations of hypocrisy by the West. The United States uses -- or throws away -- 3,770 calories a person each day, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization collected in 2001-3, compared with 2,440 calories per person in India. Americans are also the largest per capita consumers in any major economy of the most energy-intensive common food source, beef, the Agriculture Department says. 
 And the United States and Canada lead the world in oil consumption per person, according to the Energy Information Administration, an Energy Department agency. 
 When it comes to trade, Western farming subsidies undercut agricultural production in fertile areas of Africa, India's commerce minister, Kamal Nath, said in a telephone interview, repeating the point that Americans waste more food than people in many other countries.
 The United States is responsible ''many times more'' than India for the world food crisis, said Ramesh Chand, an economist with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, which advises the government on farm policy.
 The Bush administration has called for a truce. President Bush is a ''great friend and admirer'' of India, the United States ambassador here, David C. Mulford, said last week. He added that ''this is a time for increased cooperation among nations to solve this problem and that hostile political commentary is not productive.'' 
 A White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said, ''We think it is a good thing countries are developing, that more and more people have higher standards of living.'' 
 Some economists argue that blaming India's growth is not only unfair, but makes little sense. 
 Food prices have not been rising continually as developing nations grew, said Ramgopal Agarwala, a former World Bank economist and senior adviser at RIS, a research institute in New Delhi. ''They were static until 2006, then in 2007 and 2008 there was a sudden spark,'' he said. But India has been growing for the last decade. This is ''not last year's phenomena,'' he said. 
 ''I don't know who advised the president'' on his recent comments, Mr. Agarwala added, but his analysis is ''subprime.'' 
 Mr. Mehta of the research institute conceded that his remarks on liposuction were meant to be tongue in cheek, but that ''politically incorrect'' attitudes like President Bush's and Ms. Rice's needed to be challenged. Rather than blaming India, Mr. Mehta said, the West should be adjusting to a changing world. 
 ''If the developing world is going to develop, demand is going to go up and there are going to be new political paradigms,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Uncertain Futures For Bounty At Cannes

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS and A. O. SCOTT

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
When the 61st Cannes Film Festival opens here on Wednesday, all the customary glamour, spectacle and high Gallic seriousness will be in place: the red carpet, the hatchet-faced guards, the shouting paparazzi, the promenading stars and bleary-eyed journalists. If the Americans look a little more anxious than usual, it's not just the enfeebled dollar. Everyone may be expecting the bounty of good and even great films from around the world over the next 12 days, but the excitement is tempered by a sense that those films are facing unusually difficult prospects back in the United States. 
 For one thing, there are suddenly fewer companies shopping for movies. Last week Warner Brothers shut down two of its specialty divisions, Warner Independent Pictures and Picturehouse, a move that followed the downsizing earlier this year of another of its subsidiaries, New Line Cinema. Warner Independent recently released Michael Haneke's ''Funny Games'' and David Gordon Green's ''Snow Angels,'' neither of which found much of an audience. Its biggest successes had been Luc Jacquet's ''March of the Penguins'' (2005) and George Clooney's ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' (2005). Picturehouse's recent releases include Olivier Dahan's ''Vie en Rose,'' which won an Oscar for its star, Marion Cotillard, and Guillermo del Toro's critically revered ''Pan's Labyrinth'' (2006), which had its premiere at Cannes.
 Studio specialty divisions are not the only ones affected. The number of film critics writing for traditional print outlets has thinned dramatically in the last year as media companies face shrinking revenues and uncertain futures. Whereas big-budget commercial releases can almost always buy a solid opening weekend at the box office with wall-to-wall publicity and advertising, smaller films depend greatly on the support of critics to find their audiences. That's especially true these days, with so many films opening theatrically -- more than 600 titles in 2007 -- and competing for a seemingly shrinking audience.
 ''The current situation is a nightmare,'' Gary Palmucci wrote in an e-mail message over the weekend. Mr. Palmucci is a top executive at Kino International, a small New York company whose titles include ''Old Joy'' (2006) and Mr. Haneke's original German-language version of ''Funny Games'' (1997). ''The Cuisinarting of accelerated production, release schedules, critics buckling under the strain of reviewing them all, the commensurate effect on attention spans and priorities of various generations of filmgoers -- it all adds up to a major migraine for the small, specialized distributor.'' 
 Even bigger companies seem to be approaching this year's festival with a measure of caution. Peter Rice, president of Fox Searchlight Pictures (distributor of the box office hits ''Juno'' and ''Little Miss Sunshine''), wrote that economic uncertainty ''increases the pressure to make smart acquisition choices because the marketplace is very unforgiving at present.'' 
 The challenges are particularly great for foreign-language films, though not only because American audiences resist subtitles. Howard Cohen, co-president of Roadside Attractions, a Los Angeles independent distribution company, observed that the entire independent film business is facing difficulties, using last year's crop at Cannes as an example. Writing in an e-mail message, he said: ''The English-language fare that is available for U.S. rights at Cannes with any box office hope, like 'We Own the Night' last year, is a) rare, and b) usually goes to the studios or their dependents. The very arty remainder in the actual festival (i.e., 'Paranoid Park,' 'Clean,' 'Factotum,' 'Japanese Story,' 'Jindabyne' -- the list is long) are of less interest since they don't tend to perform.''
 On a less gloomy note, Mr. Cohen also pointed out that several foreign-language films from last year's festival, including ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,''''The Band's Visit,''''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' and ''Caramel,'' which his company released in February, have all grossed (or are approaching) $1 million at the United States box office. (''The Diving Bell'' has made more than $6 million domestically.) 
 This year some of the foreign-language films likely to attract interest, if not frenzied bidding, include new work from several Cannes mainstays. Among them are Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Belgian brothers who have twice won the Palme d'Or (for ''Rosetta'' in 1999 and ''L'Enfant'' in 2005). Their new film, ''Le Silence de Lorna,'' is about an Albanian woman living in Belgium who gets mixed up with a mobster. Also returning to the main competition is the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose earlier Cannes favorites include ''Distant'' (2003) and ''Climates'' (2006). ''Three Monkeys,'' his new entry, involves the struggle of a family to stay together, a generic description for a film bound to be characteristically elusive and elegant. The Argentine writer and director Lucrecia Martel, one of the few women represented in competition, follows ''The Holy Girl,'' her 2004 tale of spiritual and sexual confusion, with ''The Headless Woman,'' about the aftermath of a car accident. 
 For many, these directors are the real stars of Cannes. In America their names may be met with blank stares, but here they walk up the same red carpet as some of the most prominent Hollywood filmmakers and celebrities. And this may be the ultimate measure of the festival's integrity as well as a reminder of its noble traditions. 
 France is the country, after all, that helped establish Clint Eastwood as a major international artist decades ago. Mr. Eastwood, last here in 2003 with ''Mystic River,'' returns with ''Changeling,'' a period film about a missing child that stars Angelina Jolie. It is Cannes that made Steven Soderbergh into an instant auteur when his 1989 feature debut, ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' won the Palme d'Or. Mr. Soderbergh, who was here last year with ''Ocean's Thirteen,'' a high-priced bagatelle and red-carpet bonanza, is back in competition with ''Che,'' a two-part biography of Che Guevara that runs more than four hours.
 Just as anticipated is the rather shorter ''Synecdoche, New York,'' the directorial debut of Charlie Kaufman, best known for narratively kinked, intellectually venturesome screenplays like ''Being John Malkovich,''''Adaptation'' and ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.''
 ''Synecdoche, New York,'' which stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Michelle Williams in a Kaufmanesque tale about a theater director facing physical and metaphysical crises, does not have an American distributor. We can only wait and see what the anxious Americans will do.

HEADLINE: Earthquake in China Highlights the Vulnerability of Schools in Many Countries

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN; David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai.

 BODY:
The enormous loss of life in collapsed schools around China's quake-stricken Sichuan Province could have been significantly reduced using known methods for designing or retrofitting structures in earthquake zones, several experts on global hazards said Tuesday. 
 But China is just one of many countries with known earthquake vulnerability that has been slow to transform schools -- a keystone of any community -- from potential death traps into havens, these experts and some community campaigners for school safety said. 
 Hundreds of students are thought to have perished in schools during the earthquake, among more than 13,000 deaths in all. 
 Experts on earthquake dangers have warned for years that tens of millions of students in thousands of schools, from Asia to the Americas, face similar risks, yet programs to reinforce existing schools or require that new ones be built to extra-sturdy standards are inconsistent, slow and inadequately financed. 
 While earthquakes can sometimes exact a far wider toll on other public buildings, school collapses are particularly wrenching, development officials and experts say, because students are often what propel a struggling nation from poverty to prosperity. 
 In 2004, the 30-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a study, ''Keeping Schools Safe in Earthquakes,'' concluding that schools ''routinely'' collapsed in earthquakes around the world because of avoidable design or construction errors, or because existing laws and building codes were not enforced. 
 ''Unless action is taken immediately to address this problem, much greater loss of life and property will occur,'' the report says. 
 The risks are growing, experts say, as populations in poor regions continue to rise and the world, rich and poor, shifts ever more toward urban centers, many with well-charted seismic threats. 
 In recent years, there have been deadly school collapses after earthquakes in Italy, Algeria, Morocco and Turkey. Most notably, in Pakistan on Oct. 8, 2005, at least 17,000 children died as more than 7,000 schools collapsed after a powerful jolt shook a mountainous region near the Indian border. 
 Similar risks, and delays in reducing them, exist in countries rich and poor from the Americas across Europe and Asia.
 In 2006, Brian E. Tucker, an earthquake expert who runs a private group, GeoHazards International, presented a study on schools to the Economic Cooperation Organization, a group of 10 countries in Europe and Asia. The analysis found that 180 million people, including 40 million school-age children, faced ''an earthquake risk equal to that of northern Pakistan.'' Dr. Tucker also was a co-author of the 2004 O.E.C.D. report. 
 Delays in addressing such threats sometimes result less from financing and engineering than from societal inertia, given competing problems and the unpredictable nature of earthquakes, said Ben Wisner, a former geography professor at California State University, Long Beach, and a founder of the Coalition for Global School Safety. 
 Often, money and technology are not the issue, he said, so much as access to basic information about risks and simple ways to bolster buildings. 
 ''On the whole, the cost of designing and building a school, say, a three-story junior high school in Mexico City, is only about 5 percent higher,'' Dr. Wisner said. ''You don't necessarily design a building to avoid collapse, but design so that it's a survivable collapse. You want large voids so they can be accessed by rescuers.'' 
 There have been some successful efforts to reinforce schools, in places including Katmandu, Nepal, and parts of Turkey, he said. Progress often is a result of persistent pressure by a particular engineer or safety campaigner. 
 The successes are far outnumbered by places that still face calamity on the scale of that seen in Sichuan, he and others said. 
 And the risks are not limited to poor or emerging countries. In Vancouver, British Columbia, parents' groups have been agitating to accelerate a decades-long program aimed at bringing schools up to modern earthquake standards. 
 While there is no reliable global tally of unsafe schools in quake zones, regional snapshots are chillingly clear. A report being presented at an international conference on school safety, coincidentally beginning on Wednesday in Islamabad, Pakistan, says that more than 80 percent of schools in Pakistan are unprotected from shocks like the one in October 2005.
 The inertia is one result of a range of factors, including deep poverty in some places and political immobility in others. In some countries and cultures, inaction is shaped by a fatalism that somewhat indemnifies governments from responsibility for what are seen as ''celestial'' acts, said Thomas Parsons, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. 
 ''It's so disappointing to see these things happening again and again -- little kids caught in a collapsed school building,'' Dr. Parsons said. ''As always, in the short term we are balancing the probable event against real, right-now problems. But in the long term, probable becomes inevitable.''
 Around Sichuan, the earthquake may well have raised the danger level on nearby faults, Dr. Parsons said, noting a 2007 paper mapping the region's unstable underpinnings.

HEADLINE: Clear Channel Accepts Smaller Takeover Bid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Clear Channel Communications agreed on Tuesday to a revised $17.9 billion takeover by two private equity firms after settling a long and often acrimonious dispute with the six banks that agreed to finance the deal. 
 The deal heads off what would likely have been two rancorous legal battles over the buyout, one of the last holdovers from the recent private equity boom. The settlement arrives after nearly a week of negotiations involving the company, its proposed buyers and their banks.
 As expected, Clear Channel, the nation's largest radio broadcaster, agreed to sell itself to Bain Capital and THL Partners for $36 a share, down from the $39.20 a share agreed to nearly a year ago. Many aspects of the original deal remain, including so-called stub equity that allows investors to roll over some of their holdings into a stake in the newly private company.
 Under the terms of the settlement, Clear Channel will pay a slightly higher interest rate on loans provided by the banks -- Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia -- which will cut into the buyout firms' profits.
 The settlement will require a new shareholder vote. Highfields Capital Management, one of Clear Channel's largest shareholders and one that helped broker the new deal, is expected to vote in favor of the proposal.
 The settlement ends a struggle to take Clear Channel private that lasted nearly two years. After a protracted courtship of the company was clinched last May, Bain and THL began to battle with the banks over their lending commitments against the backdrop of a credit squeeze. Bain and THL argued that the banks had refused to honor the contract. The banks, which could stand to lose billions on their financing commitments, said that the buyout firms refused to negotiate the lending terms in good faith.
 Prompted by fears of looming and costly trials in New York and Texas, several parties, including the Mays family, which controls Clear Channel, Highfields and Morgan Stanley, renewed a push for a settlement last Wednesday. Talks continued throughout the weekend, prompting speculation that a deal was near Monday when Judge Helen Freedman of the New York State Supreme Court delayed the trial for a day. A pretrial hearing in Texas was also pushed back one day.
 By that point, the buyout firms and the banks had agreed on the main contours of a settlement, including the revised price and the higher interest rates.

HEADLINE: Squeezed at Both Ends Refiners Are Caught Between High Crude Prices And Slipping Demand

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
While drivers are facing sticker shock at the pump these days, here is a bigger shock: high prices are putting a strain on oil refiners.
 After last year's stellar profits, American refiners are going through a traumatic period. In a time of record gasoline prices, some of them actually lost money in the first quarter, and for virtually all refiners, profits are down sharply.
 Experts say the refiners are caught in a double bind. The price of their raw material, oil, is rising because of strong global demand. At the same time, consumption of gasoline in the United States is falling as a result of slower economic growth and consumer efforts to conserve. 
 However much the companies would like to raise gasoline prices enough to pass along the full increases in oil, analysts say they have been unable to do it. Oil prices doubled in the past year, while wholesale gasoline prices rose a mere 39 percent.
 ''Refiners are having a terrible time,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation.
 For decades, global oil prices were tightly coupled to the ups and downs of the American economy. But in recent years, world oil prices have been pulled upward by heavy demand for diesel fuel from developing countries like China. American economic growth weakened in the last few months, but that has mattered little in the upward march of oil prices.
 ''What we see at the gasoline pump is increasingly driven by what is happening elsewhere in the global economy,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm.
 Gasoline prices rose on Tuesday to a nationwide average of $3.73 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club. That is yet another record. Diesel prices also set a record, at $4.39 a gallon. Crude oil futures closed at $125.80 a barrel, up $1.57, or 1.3 percent, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In its latest monthly report, the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized countries, reduced its forecast for global oil demand for this year, as consumption drops by a bigger-than-forecast 300,000 barrels a day in the developed world. 
 But that decline will be more than offset by growth from developing countries. Consequently, global consumption is expected to rise this year by 1 million barrels a day, to 86.8 million barrels a day. Nearly all that growth will come from China, the Middle East and Russia.
 In the United States, there is no longer much doubt that consumers are responding to higher fuel costs by driving less. Oil consumption fell by 3.3 percent in March, compared with March of last year. 
 But even as gasoline demand softens, the price keeps rising, driven by higher oil prices. The cost of oil represents about 75 percent of the price of gasoline at the pump, according to the Energy Department; state and federal taxes account for 12 percent, and refining and distribution make up the rest. 
 The rising oil prices have led to a sharp drop in refining profit margins, or the difference between the cost of oil and the cost of gasoline. These margins, at $12.45 a barrel on average, are 60 percent below their year-ago level, and in the lower half of their five-year range, according to a report by UBS.
 In response to falling gasoline demand and rising costs, refiners have cut their production rates. Refining utilization rates, for example, slumped to a low of 81.4 percent in the second week of April, compared with 90.4 percent at the same time last year. Earlier this month, refineries were running at 85 percent of their capacity.
 All this has translated into a tough quarter for some refiners. While large integrated companies, like Exxon Mobil, reported big profits in the first quarter thanks to their oil sales, smaller independent refiners that buy their oil, instead of producing it themselves, have been losing money. 
 Tesoro, Sunoco, and United Refining all posted losses in the first quarter. The hardest hit have been small refineries that tend to process the most expensive types of crude oil into gasoline. Sunoco, for example, lost $123 million in the first quarter, while Tesoro posted a $82 million loss for that period, in contrast to a profit of $116 million last year. 
 ''We're just not able to pass along the increased cost of crude oil on the gasoline side,'' said Lynn Westfall, the chief economist at Tesoro.
 At Valero, the nation's largest independent refiner, first-quarter profit melted by 76 percent. Its refining capacity allows it to process heavier grades of crude oil that typically trade at a discount. Still, its profit dropped to $261 million in the first quarter compared with $1.1 billion last year.
 Some consumer advocates say they are deeply suspicious about the behavior of refiners who are sharply cutting production at a time of record gasoline prices. 
 ''They are not sitting in a boardroom and colluding, but they can see easily enough where their benefit lies, and it doesn't lie in a price war,'' said Judy Dugan, the research director at Consumer Watch. ''In a truly competitive market, you might see some of these providers try to improve their market share by reducing prices. But this is not happening. They are all better off by restricting production to keep prices up.''
 Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, said mergers in the 1990s had cut the number of refiners in the country and contributed to reduced competition in the refining market. 
 ''We let them accumulate market power through the wave of mergers, and we've been paying the price in the last five years,'' he said. ''If there is a small number of players in the market, they learn from each other's behavior.'' 
 The demand for diesel has been one of the main drivers of oil demand in recent years. Diesel and other so-called middle distillates are used as transportation, power generation and industrial fuels. 
 In China, for example, oil imports have surged in recent weeks, a signal that the government is stockpiling oil and diesel in anticipation of the Olympic Games. Beijing, the International Energy Agency report said, is seeking to avoid a repeat of the embarrassing fuel shortages and power disruptions that plagued the country last year.

HEADLINE: Discounters Fared Well In Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
It's bargain time in American retailing.
 Wal-Mart Stores and the TJX Companies said Tuesday that sales and profit surged during the first three months of the year as belt-tightening consumers flocked to their deeply discounted merchandise. 
 Profits rose 7 percent at Wal-Mart, the giant discount chain, and by 20 percent at TJX, the owner of the cut-rate clothing retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls. 
 But the slowdown in consumer spending is proving less kind to full-price retailers, like Macy's, Nordstrom, J. C. Penney and Kohl's, which are expected to report big declines in first-quarter earnings this week, according to forecasts from analysts. 
 On average, those four retailers are expected to report a 50 percent decline in first quarter profit, predicted Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. 
 ''People are cheaping out, and retailers that sell discretionary products at full prices are having a very tough time,'' Mr. Dreher said. 
 Those troubles will be a boon to shoppers: To clear all that unsold merchandise, stores are dangling deep discounts, said John D. Morris, a retail analyst at Wachovia Securities. By his estimate, markdowns are up 5 percent this spring compared with the period a year ago.
 Even luxury stores are cutting prices. This coming Thursday, Saks Fifth Avenue is offering discounts of $25 to $1,000 and Ralph Lauren is having a 20 percent off sale.
 Wal-Mart, the large retailer and a bellwether for the economy, cautioned that it was not immune to the economic slowdown. It predicted little, if any, growth in individual store sales during the current quarter. The chief executive of Wal-Mart, H. Lee Scott Jr., warned that ''there are still uncertainties about the rest of the year.''
 During the first quarter, ended April 30, Wal-Mart's profit increased 6.9 percent, to $3.02 billion, or 76 cents a share, from $2.83 billion, or 68 cents, in the period a year ago, as shoppers swarmed to its low-priced food, prescription drugs and electronics.
 Revenue increased 10.3 percent, to $95.3 billion, from $86.4 billion, the company said.
 After a period of experimentation with sleeker fashion and upscale merchandise, like skinny jeans, Wal-Mart has returned with a vengeance to low prices, the strategy that built it into the world's largest retailer.
 This year, the chain slashed grocery prices by as much as 30 percent and it trumpeted the strategy in advertisements that asked consumers ''What will you do with your savings?''
 Nobody at the chain predicted the downturn that settled in by late last year. But once consumers started pulling back, Wal-Mart was poised to benefit, perhaps more than any big chain.
 ''Our business is even more relevant to our customers today, given the current economic pressures,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Wal-Mart is the undisputed price leader.''
 But in retailing, investors are focused on growth. Wal-Mart estimated its earnings would be 78 cents to 81 cents a share in the second quarter, possibly at the low end of analysts' expectations. As a result, shares of Wal-Mart fell $1.37 Tuesday, to $56.65.
 It was an unusual dip for a stock that has been on a tear. Wal-Mart's stock has risen by roughly $10, or about 22 percent, over the last six months, with investors wagering that the chain would benefit from a slowing economy. Its rivals did not fare as well. Macy's shares have dropped by 15.5 percent, Target's by 6 percent and J. C. Penney's by 5.7 percent.
 Budget-minded clothing buyers are instead seeking out off-price chains like TJX, which said it earned $193.8 million, or 43 cents a share, in the first quarter, ended April 26, up from $162.1 million, or 34 cents a share.
 Sales rose 6 percent, to $4.36 billion, from $4.11 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 3 percent.
 ''We are very pleased with our performance,'' said Carol Meyrowitz, the chief executive of TJX.
 Despite the strong results, the company said its gross margin did not meet its expectations, and that helped send its stock price down $1.49, to $30.65
 TJX, which specializes in designer brands sold at deeply marked-down prices, said clothing sales and customer traffic in its stores exceeded its expectations.
 One reason is that department stores, struggling with slower business, are canceling orders for name-brand clothing, which is rerouted to stores like Marshalls and T. J. Maxx. 
 TJX said consumers gravitated toward its dresses, shoes, and accessories. That is traditionally a business dominated by department stores like J. C. Penney, Macy's and Kohl's. But the appeal of department stores has dimmed, with consumers struggling to pay their bills.
 ''We are hearing that dresses, shoes and accessories are very challenging categories for department stores,'' said Mr. Morris of Wachovia. ''That is where off-price chains like TJX can gain an edge.''

HEADLINE: Nissan Warns Profit Jump Is Fleeting

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Nissan became the latest major Japanese automaker to report booming earnings for the fiscal year that just ended, and it was also the latest to forecast a plunge in profit for the current year, blaming a rising yen and soaring material costs. 
 ''There is no way we can overcome these headwinds,'' Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, told reporters Tuesday at company headquarters in Tokyo. 
 Nissan Motor, Japan's third-biggest automaker, expects profit for the fiscal year through March 2009 to drop 30 percent, to 340 billion yen ($3.3 billion). Last fiscal year, its net profit rose 5 percent, to 482.3 billion yen ($4.6 billion).
 Its bigger rivals Toyota and Honda also announced strong annual earnings and dismal forecasts amid worries about the slumping United States economy and strong yen. Toyota Motor expects its fiscal-year profit will fall 27 percent, while Honda Motor foresees an 18 percent drop.
 For the January-March quarter, Nissan's net profit rose 67 percent, to 137.6 billion yen ($1.3 billion). That includes one-time ''fifth-quarter'' numbers from overseas subsidiaries that were added to the previous year's fourth quarter to put all global units on the same calendar. Without those numbers, quarterly profit jumped 95 percent.
 Nissan sold 3.77 million vehicles worldwide for the fiscal year that ended March 31, up 8.2 percent from the previous year. In North America, Nissan's sales totaled 1.35 million vehicles, up 1.3 percent on the year.
 Although sales were down 2.5 percent in Japan during the fiscal year, at 721,000 vehicles, they climbed 17.9 percent in Europe, to 636,000, and gained 22 percent in other overseas markets, including China, at 1.06 million -- surpassing the one million mark for the first time.

HEADLINE: Cuts in Medicaid May Mean Billion-Dollar Loss to New York for Training Doctors

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
New York's public and private hospitals stand to lose more than $1 billion in state and federal funds for the training of doctors because of changes to the Medicaid program backed by the Bush administration, according to an analysis by the city's Independent Budget Office released on Tuesday.
 The change would end a revenue stream that the medical residencies have relied on for more than 40 years and that have widespread ramifications, because New York hospitals train a large share of the nation's doctors, many of whom work in poor neighborhoods during their residencies. 
 ''The cuts that are being proposed by the Bush administration will cause a massive hemorrhaging of resources in New York, including undercutting the ability of many of our institutions to train tomorrow's doctors,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents both public and private hospitals. ''This is a senseless and very damaging policy.''
 Administration officials, though, say that the cuts are necessary to restore the ''fiscal integrity'' of Medicaid, and that underwriting medical education is beyond the scope of the program, which combines federal and state money to provide health insurance to more than 60 million low-income people, including 30 million children.
 A year-old moratorium on the cuts is set to expire on May 25; President Bush has threatened a veto if the Senate votes this week to extend it, as the House did last month, according to Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the Independent Budget Office.
 Jeff Nelligan, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said on Tuesday that the Medicaid program was ''reeling'' financially, and that ''one of the reasons that it's reeling is that states have operated a kind of shell game with Medicaid funding.'' He said that using Medicaid money for graduate medical education ''is not even authorized in the statute,'' but that ''states have taken it upon themselves to divert funds to that end.''
 ''In a time of limited federal and state resources,'' he added, ''it is important to prioritize Medicaid spending and target it to its primary purpose: directly improving the health outcomes of Medicaid beneficiaries.'' 
 In 2006, 40 percent of all Medicaid funds for medical training nationwide, or $1.36 billion, went to New York State. The Medicaid money also accounted for 40 percent of the $3.4 billion spent on graduate medical education in the state.
 Of the nation's 107,000 medical residencies, 16,500, or 15 percent, are in New York State, and 12,200 of them in New York City according to the Independent Budget Office.
 Mr. Raske of the hospital association estimated that because of demographic changes, the nation needs to produce at least 30 percent more physicians by the year 2020, noting that because medical education takes 7 to 11 years, training programs need to expand now, not shrink.
 The Independent Budget Office analysis found that the proposed cut would cost the city's public hospitals about $390 million in federal and state funds, about 7.5 percent of their overall budget. It would cost the city's private hospitals about $790 million, 4.4 percent of their total revenue, the report said.
 Some of the worst-hit public hospitals in New York City would be Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn, Metropolitan Hospital and Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, and Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, the report says.
 Ultimately, the analysis suggested, the state's consumers would feel the cuts in the form of higher salaries for the smaller number of doctors being trained. The budget office argued that contrary to the Bush administration's contention that it was focusing Medicaid resources on poor people, the cut would hurt health care in poor neighborhoods, where doctors in training are a major source of medical care.
 Although New York receives by far the largest amount of money for teaching hospitals, other states also get substantial amounts, like California, which stands to lose $180 million, and Florida, which would lose $150 million.
 The report warned that ''an abrupt termination'' of the financing ''could cause severe disruptions to the finances of both public and voluntary hospitals, to patient care and to the city's economy.''

HEADLINE: 'A Trendless Market' Ends the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street turned in a mixed performance on Tuesday after a fresh report on retail sales and continued high oil prices reminded investors that the economy is flagging and costs are rising. But things could be worse. 
 The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.2 percent in April, as forecast. The data showed better-than-expected sales if automobiles were excluded, but indicated that Americans were reluctant to make big-ticket purchases, especially as fuel prices soared.
 ''The numbers are coming out weak, but the economy's not falling apart,'' said Alexander Paris, economist and market analyst for Barrington Research, based in Chicago. ''On balance, they were negative, but you'd expect them to be.''
 Oil prices touched an intraday high of $126.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after Iranian news services reported that authorities there were considering a cut in output. Oil later settled at $125.80, up $1.57.
 Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said he believed that investors would not have a clear picture until more economic data was released in June and July.
 ''We're going to go through a period where the markets are going to focus on the macrodata,'' he said, ''and any adverse piece of news about the credit markets. It will be a trendless market until the uncertainties about a contraction in economic activity are resolved.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.13 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,832.18, after rising 130 points on Monday. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.54 point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,403.04. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.63 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,495.12. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies gained 3.62 points, or 0.49 percent, to 736.85.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 1.21 billion shares.
 The Nasdaq received a boost from Yahoo after CNBC reported that Carl C. Icahn was considering a proxy fight to try to push Yahoo back into merger discussions with Microsoft. Shares of Yahoo rose $1.30, or more than 5 percent, to $26.56.
 Investors examined proposed acquisitions, including Hewlett-Packard's offer to buy Electronic Data Systems for $12.6 billion and create the second-largest technology services provider behind I.B.M. E.D.S. added 26 cents, to $24.34; Hewlett-Packard fell $2.56, or 5.5 percent, to $44.27.
 Staples increased a hostile bid to acquire a Dutch rival, Corporate Express, by 10 percent. Corporate Express said it was willing to consider the deal, and Staples shares rose 48 cents, to $22.44.
 The market got another reading on the consumer mood after Wal-Mart Stores reported first-quarter profit above Wall Street expectations but predicted that the current quarter would come in below estimates. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.37, to $56.65.
 On the bond market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 30/32, to 99 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 3.91 percent, from 3.80 percent.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills.

HEADLINE: Tax Windfall Could Soften Budget Cuts in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
The state treasurer said Tuesday that New Jersey collected $533 million more than anticipated in 2007 tax revenue, allowing Gov. Jon S. Corzine to soften his proposed budget cuts to small towns and largely spare the state parks from closing this summer and the Department of Agriculture from being dissolved.
 But the treasurer, David Rousseau, told members of the Senate budget committee that the windfall from 2007 would be short-lived because of the current economic downturn, and that revenue would probably shrink next year. 
 Moreover, hours after Mr. Rousseau testified before legislators, Mr. Corzine told reporters that any increases this year in aid to towns, parks or state agencies would have to be offset by additional cuts to the State Police, health care programs and other areas. He also said that the state would try to squeeze an extra $25 million out of the state's lottery.
 In all, Mr. Corzine said that the state would spend $32.8 billion next year, or $200 million less than his original proposal in February, and $700 million less than the previous year. 
 It would be a rare recent example of New Jersey's slashing spending, but it would also represent the kind of fiscal discipline that Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, said was crucial to the state's long-term economic health.
 ''I think we're at a turning point,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''I think everyone sees the challenges are agonizing. I hear the concerns that the public has, but those concerns need to be put in the framework of what available funds we have.''
 The numbers came as a bit of a surprise -- and relief -- to New Jersey lawmakers, particularly in light of the difficulties that other states are facing. In New York, for instance, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer lowered projections for tax revenue by $384 million in February, just three weeks after presenting his budget, citing the souring national economy.
 But the numbers made public here on Tuesday do not reflect projections -- and the brunt of the downturn -- but rather hard numbers based on what the state collected from individuals and businesses in 2007. And for the most part, 2007 was a very good year, over all, for Wall Street, whose fortunes play an enormous role in New Jersey's annual financial health.
 Still, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Rousseau urged the state to put extra revenue toward paying down long-term debt obligations rather than layering on more programs as previous governors and legislatures have done. Nearly every lawmaker who spoke at Tuesday's hearing or discussed the numbers afterward offered similar assessments.
 ''It suggests that we have dodged the bullet that might have been the worst-case scenario,'' Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. said in an interview. ''However, we have to continue our resolve to fight for spending restraint. I think we have to avoid the temptation of these new numbers as justification for greater spending.''
 To be precise, the Corzine administration wants to use the bulk of the new revenue to help reduce the size of the state's $32 billion debt, which would save $130 million next year on debt service.
 At the same time, the administration wants to cut about $70 million from more than 20 programs, ranging from an anti-smoking program in the Department of Health and Senior Services ($1 million) to various State Police functions ($4.5 million) and an inmate medical program in the Department of Corrections ($5 million).
 Those cuts would enable the administration to provide more funds for more vocal and organized advocates in Trenton: labor, farmers, environmentalists and small towns. There would be an additional $15 million for municipalities with fewer than 10,000 residents, the Department of Agriculture would not be shuttered and the state parks would not close. The state would also provide an extra $500,000 to the Election Law Enforcement Commission.
 ''My belief is that if there are any closures, it will be minimal,'' Mr. Rousseau said about the parks, at a briefing with reporters after his testimony.
 Over all, Mr. Corzine's budget would still reduce funds for property tax rebates, municipalities, hospitals and state colleges. But Mr. Rousseau said that Mr. Corzine would try to ensure that no town would have to absorb an annual increase of more than $100 for each homeowner in property taxes.
 But some legislators vowed to fight for even more money for the small towns.
 ''The proposed restorations do not go far enough,'' said State Senator Paul A. Sarlo, a Democrat from Bergen County who is also mayor of Wood-Ridge. 
 Mr. Sarlo said that although the governor recognized that drastic cuts ''would be devastating to municipal budgets,'' the proposed solution ''does nothing to help make municipalities whole.''

HEADLINE: The New Cold War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The next American president will inherit many foreign policy challenges, but surely one of the biggest will be the cold war. Yes, the next president is going to be a cold-war president -- but this cold war is with Iran.
 That is the real umbrella story in the Middle East today -- the struggle for influence across the region, with America and its Sunni Arab allies (and Israel) versus Iran, Syria and their non-state allies, Hamas and Hezbollah. As the May 11 editorial in the Iranian daily Kayhan put it, ''In the power struggle in the Middle East, there are only two sides: Iran and the U.S.'' 
 For now, Team America is losing on just about every front. How come? The short answer is that Iran is smart and ruthless, America is dumb and weak, and the Sunni Arab world is feckless and divided. Any other questions?
 The outrage of the week is the Iranian-Syrian-Hezbollah attempt to take over Lebanon. Hezbollah thugs pushed into Sunni neighborhoods in West Beirut, focusing particular attention on crushing progressive news outlets like Future TV, so Hezbollah's propaganda machine could dominate the airwaves. The Shiite militia Hezbollah emerged supposedly to protect Lebanon from Israel. Having done that, it has now turned around and sold Lebanon to Syria and Iran. 
 All of this is part of what Ehud Yaari, one of Israel's best Middle East watchers, calls ''Pax Iranica.'' In his April 28 column in The Jerusalem Report, Mr. Yaari pointed out the web of influence that Iran has built around the Middle East -- from the sway it has over Iraq's prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, to its ability to manipulate virtually all the Shiite militias in Iraq, to its building up of Hezbollah into a force -- with 40,000 rockets -- that can control Lebanon and threaten Israel should it think of striking Tehran, to its ability to strengthen Hamas in Gaza and block any U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace.
 ''Simply put,'' noted Mr. Yaari, ''Tehran has created a situation in which anyone who wants to attack its atomic facilities will have to take into account that this will lead to bitter fighting'' on the Lebanese, Palestinian, Iraqi and Persian Gulf fronts. That is a sophisticated strategy of deterrence. 
 The Bush team, by contrast, in eight years has managed to put America in the unique position in the Middle East where it is ''not liked, not feared and not respected,'' writes Aaron David Miller, a former Mideast negotiator under both Republican and Democratic administrations, in his provocative new book on the peace process, titled ''The Much Too Promised Land.'' 
 ''We stumbled for eight years under Bill Clinton over how to make peace in the Middle East, and then we stumbled for eight years under George Bush over how to make war there,'' said Mr. Miller, and the result is ''an America that is trapped in a region which it cannot fix and it cannot abandon.''
 Look at the last few months, he said: President Bush went to the Middle East in January, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice went in February, Vice President Dick Cheney went in March, the secretary of state went again in April, and the president is there again this week. After all that, oil prices are as high as ever and peace prospects as low as ever. As Mr. Miller puts it, America right now ''cannot defeat, co-opt or contain'' any of the key players in the region.
 The big debate between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is over whether or not we should talk to Iran. Obama is in favor; Clinton has been against. Alas, the right question for the next president isn't whether we talk or don't talk. It's whether we have leverage or don't have leverage. 
 When you have leverage, talk. When you don't have leverage, get some -- by creating economic, diplomatic or military incentives and pressures that the other side finds too tempting or frightening to ignore. That is where the Bush team has been so incompetent vis-a-vis Iran. 
 The only weaker party is the Sunni Arab world, which is either so drunk on oil it thinks it can buy its way out of any Iranian challenge or is so divided it can't make a fist to protect its own interests -- or both.
 We're not going to war with Iran, nor should we. But it is sad to see America and its Arab friends so weak they can't prevent one of the last corners of decency, pluralism and openness in the Arab world from being snuffed out by Iran and Syria. The only thing that gives me succor is the knowledge that anyone who has ever tried to dominate Lebanon alone -- Maronites, Palestinians, Syrians, Israelis -- has triggered a backlash and failed.
 ''Lebanon is not a place anyone can control without a consensus, without bringing everybody in,'' said the Lebanese columnist Michael Young. ''Lebanon has been a graveyard for people with grand projects.'' In the Middle East, he added, your enemies always seem to ''find a way of joining together and suddenly making things very difficult for you.''

HEADLINE: Budget Deal In Congress Tops Request From Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate and House Democrats said Tuesday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a budget blueprint that embodies their priorities and sets spending levels somewhat higher than President Bush had requested.
 Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the measure could be approved by both houses next week.
 The blueprint would bring the federal budget into balance in 2012 and keep it in balance in 2013. 
 If approved by both houses, the agreement would be a significant political achievement for Democrats. Lawmakers have found it difficult to reach such agreements in election years. But Democrats said they were likely to defer tough decisions on the details of spending and taxes until after the elections.
 The budget blueprint is for the guidance of Congress. It is not submitted to the president for his approval and does not become law. It sets a framework for action by Congress on programs and appropriations bills.
 The agreement rejects Mr. Bush's effort to squeeze major savings out of health programs. The president estimated that his legislative proposals would have saved $178 billion in Medicare and $17 billion in Medicaid in the next five years.
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, said it was irresponsible for the Democrats to brush aside all the proposals for Medicare savings. It makes sense to require high-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for prescription drug coverage, as the president proposed, Mr. Gregg said.
 Representative John M. Spratt Jr., the South Carolina Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said, ''We have reached an informal agreement with the Senate on all the major issues and should be able to pass the budget before Congress goes home for Memorial Day.''
 Mr. Spratt said the agreement assumed another year of relief from the alternative minimum tax and a continuation of ''middle-class tax cuts'' that would otherwise expire in the next few years. The alternative tax, originally directed at high-income people, is not indexed for inflation and has therefore increased taxes for a growing number of middle-income people.
 In his most recent budget, Mr. Bush requested $991.6 billion for the wide range of military and domestic programs subject to annual appropriations. Mr. Conrad said the agreement would provide ''about $20 billion'' more than the president requested for those accounts.
 The agreement includes $7 billion for highway and bridge projects intended to stimulate the economy, Mr. Conrad said. But it would apparently not provide money for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits, sought by many Democrats.
 The agreement assumes that the government will collect substantial new revenues, but does not identify the sources. 
 Mr. Conrad said the agreement did not specify the fate of tax cuts that primarily benefit high-income taxpayers. Congress could secure additional revenue by allowing some of those tax cuts to expire, restricting the use of offshore tax havens, shutting down abusive tax shelters or finding ways for the Treasury to collect more of the taxes owed under current law, Mr. Conrad said.
 The budget agreement does not instruct Congressional committees to come up with legislation changing revenues or spending. Such legislation is considered under special rules and, in the past, has been a vehicle for major changes in tax law and entitlement programs.
 Several moderate Republican senators, whose votes are needed for passage of the budget blueprint, objected to use of those procedures, which enhance the power of the majority party at the expense of the minority.

HEADLINE: Squeezed at Both Ends Hoping to Ease Gas Prices, Congress Votes to Halt Deposits to Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Groping for a quick response to rising gas prices, Congress voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to order the Bush administration to stop depositing oil in a national reserve even though lawmakers predicted the impact for consumers would be modest at best.
 ''Is it a giant step? No,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, a leading proponent of the idea of trying to influence the price of gas by redirecting supplies from the reserve to the commercial market. ''But is it a step finally, at long last, in the right direction? It is.''
 Despite initial resistance from the White House, the Senate voted 97 to 1 to stop putting 70,000 barrels of oil a day in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the remainder of this year; the House later approved a similar bill by a vote of 385 to 25. Senators of both parties said the House bill could clear the Senate within days and be sent to the president. 
 The rapid action demonstrated lawmakers' anxiety about election-year howls from constituents who are straining the family budget at the gas pump. It also was a rare break between Congressional Republicans and Mr. Bush as his usual allies voted en masse for the measure even though the White House has portrayed filling the reserve as a security issue and a way to guard against supply disruptions.
 The administration reiterated skepticism about the impact of the bill on Tuesday, with one spokesman, Scott M. Stanzel, saying ''there is no evidence that it will affect the price of oil or gasoline in a meaningful way.'' But he said Mr. Bush, who left on a trip to the Middle East, would not veto it. The margins were adequate to easily override him if he did.
 In an interview conducted Tuesday for Yahoo and Politico, a Washington journal concentrating on politics, Mr. Bush said he was open to the idea of withholding oil deposits to try to encourage a price decrease at the pump. At the same time, he said, both the government and consumers must do more to address the rise in gasoline prices.
 ''The truth of the matter is that in order for there to be a substantial change either consumers have to change their habits -- which we're encouraging through alternative tax of automobiles -- or there has to be an increase of supply,'' he said in the interview.
 Estimates of the impact of suspending the deposits varied. Some economists predicted the impact would be negligible, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi, citing others who have studied the issue, said prices could drop 5 to 24 cents a gallon.
 But Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the measure was meaningless. ''If all the members of the House would go out onto the steps and clap our hands three times and say, 'Down prices, down prices,' that would have as much impact as passing this bill,'' he said.
 In any event, lawmakers cautioned that any price decline from suspending the oil deposits would be temporary and that the plan pushed by Democrats was not a long-term solution.
 ''They have just a one-shot bill here, and it's pretty good, but it isn't an energy policy,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
 Before the Senate voted to halt the deposits into the reserve, which is now near 97 percent capacity, lawmakers voted 56 to 42 against a Republican energy proposal that pushed for greater domestic production of oil by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other coastal areas to drilling. The measure fell 18 votes short of the 60 needed, with 6 Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure.
 Republicans said that they had been willing to back some investment in alternative energy and higher automobile mileage standards, but that Democrats refused to consider tapping new domestic sources of oil as part of a broad energy approach.
 ''We have offered a plan that would increase supply,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. ''And it would be from our own resources, so that America would not have to depend on foreign sources for our energy needs.''
 But Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said it was too late for ''us to produce our way out of the problems that we now have.''
 Mr. Reid said he hoped, within the next week, to start consideration of a Democratic energy plan. But even if he can bring it to the floor, the proposal is unlikely to overcome a filibuster by Republicans objecting to new taxes on oil company profits to pay for alternative energy investment. And Mr. Reid said he was not inclined to pursue separately another idea that has bipartisan support -- an effort to rein in speculation in the oil markets.
 A group of Democratic senators also sought to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Bush will be visiting this week, as they called on the Saudis to increase their oil production or face the possibility of Congress blocking a pending arms deal.
 ''We are saying to the Saudis that if you don't help us, why should we be helping you?'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''We are saying that the relationship has to be a two-way street. We are saying that we need real relief and we need it quickly.''

HEADLINE: City Revisits Old Bidders After Railyards Deal Fails

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's last-ditch effort to revive his ambitious plans for the West Side railyards ended on Tuesday after Tishman Speyer Properties failed to come to terms with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on a $1 billion deal.
 In an attempt to salvage the project, the transportation authority quickly reopened talks that same day with four other developers -- Douglas Durst, Extell Development Company, Stephen M. Ross and Steven Roth -- who had also bid for the rights to build a small city of office towers and apartment houses on a platform over the 26-acre railyards. 
 But even if a new deal can be struck, it will almost certainly be for less than the $1 billion promised by Tishman Speyer, real estate executives said, because the uncertainty created by the sluggish economy and tight credit markets has only grown since Tishman Speyer won the bidding in March. Most lenders have become skeptical about real estate and are increasingly refusing to finance speculative projects.
 ''It's an exciting and important project for New York City,'' said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Durst, who in March had offered $39 million less than Tishman Speyer. ''We would be interested in resuming discussions on its development.''
 The authority and Tishman Speyer had broken off talks last week when they were unable to complete a conditional designation letter, the next step in reaching a formal contract to build 13 million square feet of office towers, apartment houses and parks over the railyards, which lie on both sides of 11th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets.
 M.T.A. officials said they ended negotiations after Tishman Speyer tried to change the terms of the March 26 agreement in ways that would have reduced rent payments to the authority in the early years and made it easier for the developer to abandon the project. 
 Last Friday, Jerry I. Speyer and his son, Rob Speyer, who run Tishman Speyer, flew to London from Milan to meet with Mayor Bloomberg, who urged them to go back to the negotiating table. Although the city does not own the railyards, the development of the site is a key element in the mayor's most ambitious municipal initiative: the transformation of the once industrial Far West Side into the city's next glass-and-steel business district.
 Rob Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer, issued a statement thanking Mayor Bloomberg for his efforts to facilitate a deal, while saying that his company and the authority were unable to ''come to a final agreement that was satisfactory to both of us.''
 Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the authority, said in a statement that the transportation authority ''remains committed to timely development of these unique and valuable parcels of land on Manhattan's Far West Side.''
 Mr. Speyer's statement said: ''This morning we informed the M.T.A. that we are withdrawing from the process immediately so it can proceed in another direction. We appreciate the M.T.A.'s commitment to develop Hudson Yards into a great place for New York and wish it the best as it pursues other alternatives.''
 Mayor Bloomberg expressed disappointment at the turn of events, but insisted that the railyard site ''represents one of New York City's best opportunities.''
 The City Council president, Christine C. Quinn, echoed the mayor's view, saying: ''Even in these challenging economic times, the western railyards present a once in a lifetime development opportunity.'' 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky and other critics, however, say the authority should wait for the economy to improve, while working with a plan to coordinate all the activity on the West Side. ''These deals are breaking down because the governance system for authorities doesn't work and because the public subsidies are out of control,'' said Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester. ''We need a time out before this disaster repeats itself everywhere else.''
 The rezoning of a 50-block swath of the West Side for high-rise development in 2005 helped to prompt construction of a number of residential towers. But other elements of the West Side redevelopment plan now lie in a shambles. The state abandoned the long-awaited expansion of the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center this year, and plans for a major transformation of the neighborhood surrounding Pennsylvania Station collapsed in March.
 Even before it won the bidding, Tishman Speyer lost its anchor tenant and financial partner, the investment bank Morgan Stanley, when the bank pulled out of the project. The developer then tried to alter the very things that the authority viewed as critical to the deal: certainty of payment and completion of the project.
 Tishman Speyer sought unsuccessfully to delay closing on the rights over the yard on the east side of 11th Avenue until it got a zoning change for the western yard, a process that could take 18 months. Under the terms of the deal struck in March, Tishman Speyer would have paid $18.8 million at the closing for the eastern yard later this year, and $24.7 million for the western yard sometime in 2009 or 2010.

HEADLINE: Clinton Beats Obama Handily in West Virginia

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton won a lopsided victory on Tuesday over Senator Barack Obama in the West Virginia primary, where racial considerations emerged as an unusually salient factor. Mrs. Clinton drew strong support from white, working-class voters, who have spurned Mr. Obama in recent contests.
 The number of white Democratic voters who said race had influenced their choices on Tuesday was among the highest recorded in voter surveys in the nomination fight. Two in 10 white West Virginia voters said race was an important factor in their votes. More than 8 in 10 who said it factored in their votes backed Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls.
 With Mr. Obama solidly ahead of Mrs. Clinton in the delegate fight, the West Virginia results are unlikely to hurt Mr. Obama's chances of winning the nomination. A strong Clinton victory in another general election battleground state like her victories in Ohio and Pennsylvania could raise fresh questions about Mr. Obama's ability to carry swing states in a contest against Senator John McCain.
 With 92 percent of the precincts reporting, Mrs. Clinton had 67 percent of the vote and Mr. Obama had 26 percent. John Edwards, who pulled out of the race but whose name remained on the ballot, had 7 percent. 
 The surveys showing a strong racial component in the West Virginia voting suggest that Mr. Obama would face pockets of Democratic resistance if he becomes the first black nominee of the party. Although he has argued that he could broaden the Democratic base in the fall, given his popularity with independents and strong showing in traditionally Republican states like Colorado and Virginia, the Clinton camp has pointed to his modest support from white voters and blue-collar workers as weak links for him. 
 Obama supporters accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the race card last week when she said she had more support among ''white Americans'' than he did. However blunt she was, white and financially struggling voters in West Virginia and in Kentucky, which votes next week and which Mr. Obama has all but conceded, have become a major force keeping her in the race. 
 ''There are some who have wanted to cut this race short,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a victory party in Charleston, W.Va., where the crowd at one point chanted, ''It's not over!'' ''I am more than ever determined to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard.''
 In promising to press forward until the June 3 end of the nominating contests, Mrs. Clinton faces daunting math. Coming into Tuesday, Mr. Obama needed 150 delegates to reach the 2,025 required for the nomination.
 Even if Mrs. Clinton won all the delegates in the remaining contests, a practical impossibility, she could not gather the delegates needed to win the nomination. Her fading hopes rest in seating the Florida and Michigan delegations. Those delegations have been barred from the convention because the states held primaries before party rules allowed. Mrs. Clinton also hopes for a larger share of superdelegates than she has been accumulating. 
 The West Virginia results raised troubling signs for Mr. Obama. Although exit polls in other states have indicated that many Clinton supporters, including many whites, would back him in the fall, more than half of West Virginia voters said they would be dissatisfied if Mr. Obama won the nomination, according to the surveys by Edison/Mitofsky.
 As the Clinton campaign noted in a strategy memo on Tuesday, no Democrat has won the White House without winning West Virginia since 1916. Bill Clinton carried it in 1992 and 1996. Al Gore and John Kerry lost the state in 2000 and 2004, respectively.
 Mrs. Clinton seized on the West Virginia results in an area where she needs particular help, fund-raising. Roughly $20 million in debt despite $11 million in personal loans from Mrs. Clinton, her campaign sent a text message to supporters' cellphones less than an hour after the polls closed hailing the victory and urging them to donate at her Web site. A similar pitch arrived by e-mail two minutes later. ''With your help, I'm going to carry the energy of tonight's victory into the next contests in Kentucky and Oregon,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in the e-mail message, referring to the primaries on May 20. ''You have worked your heart out, put yourself on the line for what you believe in and given generously. And I'm not about to turn my back on you.''
 Mr. Obama, who largely skipped campaigning in West Virginia and spent Tuesday in another battleground, Missouri, said at a campaign event there he was confident he could unify the party as the nominee.
 ''There is a lot of talk these days about how the Democratic Party is divided,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But I'm not worried, because I know that we'll be able to come together quickly behind a common purpose. There's too much that unites us as Democrats. There's too much at stake for our country.''
 Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, Terry McAuliffe, said in an interview Tuesday night that despite the heavy debt, ''we will have the money to play in the next three weeks'' until June 3. 
 Mr. McAuliffe said Mrs. Clinton had expressed a willingness to lend more money if she believed that it would help but that she had not reached that conclusion. ''We haven't had that discussion,'' he said.
 For all of Mrs. Clinton's efforts, Mr. Obama continued to outpace her in the battle for superdelegates, the party leaders who have votes on the nomination. He picked up four by midday. 
 In a sign of the diminished optimism in the Clinton camp, a staunch loyalist, James Carville, said Mr. Obama would probably be the Democratic nominee.
 ''I think its likely Obama is the nominee, but not certain,'' said Mr. Carville, the Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Clinton in the 1992 campaign and is close to the couple. ''I would have preferred another result, but I'm going to be for him.''
 ''Everybody is going to be with Obama,'' Mr. Carville added, referring to the Clinton staff and supporters. ''I have an undated check written out for Obama. I'll send it when this is over.''
 According to the West Virginia surveys, 95 percent of the Democratic primary voters were white, 70 percent did not graduate from college, and 54 percent had household incomes less than $50,000.
 More than 6 in 10 West Virginia voters said the economy was the most important issue facing the country, and two-thirds of them backed Mrs. Clinton. Nine in 10 voters said the economic slowdown had affected them, including nearly half who said they were affected a great deal. Mrs. Clinton was supported by about three-quarters of those most affected.
 She also won the support of most voters younger than 30, a group that has typically voted heavily for Mr. Obama. The New Yorker also edged out Mr. Obama among college graduates and higher-income voters, also groups Mr. Obama has relied on.
 Some exit polls showed mistrust about Mr. Obama, a relatively rare finding in Democratic primaries. Half of voters said Mr. Obama shared the controversial views of his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. More than half said Mr. Obama was not honest and trustworthy, and most also said he did not share their values.
 When asked to select from four candidates' qualities that mattered most in voting, nearly half the voters said bringing about change was paramount. Nearly one in four said having the right experience was most important. Less than two in 10 chose the fact that the candidate cared about people like them, and one in 10 decided based on the ability to win in November.

 Extradited to United States
 Fourteen Colombian paramilitary leaders have been extradited to the United States, part of an attempt by President Alvaro Uribe to defuse a scandal that has tied them to senior lawmakers in the Colombian congress and members of his own family. The extraditions come at a particularly fragile moment for Colombia, which is trying to secure a trade agreement with the United States. PAGE A6

 Two American military attaches were expelled from Russia early this month, and though neither the United States nor Russia has gone into much detail about the reasons behind the expulsion, American officials said the two officers involved made an uninvited visit to a Russian military aviation factory. The officials said it was protocol for American diplomats to give the Russian government three days' notice before traveling, but it appeared the attaches had not done so in this case. PAGE A6

The Bush administration says the documents, which were released by North Korea last week, are a key step in finishing a denuclearization agreement, and hopes the completed pact will be reviewed as a rare foreign policy victory.

 ITALIAN'S DETENTION ILLUSTRATES
 Dangers Foreign Travelers Face
 For an Italian man who frequents Virginia to visit his girlfriend and her family, the last thing he expected at the airport was for Customs and Border Protection Agents to send him away to a Virginia jail for 10 days. But that's exactly what happened to Domenico Salerno. Although his case may be extreme, it underscores the real but little-known dangers that face many travelers from Europe and other first-world nations when they arrive in the United States, problems that can startle Americans as much as their foreign visitors.

 The Rev. John C. Hagee, the evangelist whose anti-Catholic remarks created a stir when Senator John McCain received his endorsement for the Republican presidential nomination with great fanfare, has issued a letter expressing regret for ''any comments that Catholics have found hurtful.'' Critics have attacked Mr. McCain for failing to distance himself enough from Mr. Hagee. PAGE A16

 WALL STREET LOOKS AT HEWLETT
 With Raised Eyebrows
 Hewlett-Packard is no stranger to big acquisitions, as evidenced by its $20 billion grab of Compaq six years ago. But Hewlett-Packard's plans to buy Electronic Data Systems was greeted with head-scratching on Wall Street -- and a subsequent dip in its stock price. Analysts wonder how Hewlett-Packard will integrate the service provider, but Hewlett-Packard insists that the purchase -- which would give it the second largest market share in the services business behind I.B.M. -- is much less complicated than the Compaq deal.

 OH, YEAH? WELL YOU'RE FAT.
 Top politicians, economists and academics in India are not happy about suggestions made by President Bush and other American officials who say that India's new prosperity is responsible for rising food costs in the United States. Indian politicians and academics blame the rising costs on the West's agricultural subsidies and trade barriers, as well as the weak dollar. But they also think Americans could stand to push themselves away from the dinner table every once in a while. PAGE C1
 TWO INDICTED IN TAX EVASION CASE
 Bradley Birkenfeld, a former employee of the Swiss banking giant UBS, and an accused co-conspirator were indicted by federal authorities who said they helped an ultra-wealthy American investor to hide $200 million in overseas trusts to avoid paying taxes. The indictment is part of a wider federal investigation of UBS -- one of the largest money managers for the superrich -- and hints that the government is taking a closer look at offshore tax transactions they consider too aggressive.

 Sue Simmons and Chuck Scarborough have been co-anchors on WNBC's 11 p.m. newscast since 1980, and so will have their occasional spats. The big difference is that when one of them uses a certain unprintable word when addressing the other -- which is what happened when Ms. Simmons scolded Mr. Scarborough during the broadcast -- it happens on live television in the nation's largest media market. Her choice of words was met with mixed reactions from the viewing public. PAGE B1

 POLITICIANS ANGRY AT HBO MOVIE
 About 2000 Recount
 HBO's ''Recount'' is a star-studded dramatization of the electoral fight over the votes in Florida during the 2000 election, which had an ending more controversial than the finale of ''The Sopranos.'' Warren Christopher, a former secretary of state and adviser to Al Gore's campaign during the ballot battle, took umbrage to his portrayal as a weak strategist who was unwilling to stand up to James A. Baker III, his Republican counterpart. Mr. Baker, too, was not happy. ''I don't think I was as ruthless as the movie portrays me, and I know he was not as wimpish as it makes him appear,'' Mr. Baker said. PAGE E1 
 WRITING IN THEIR SHOES
 It's a precept all writers have heard: write what you know. Nam Le, a Vietnam-born corporate attorney raised in Australia, did just the opposite, doing copious research and penning fictional stories about adolescents in Colombia or another tale set in the days before an atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. The result is a collection called ''The Boat,'' which is garnering the kind of praise usually reserved for established literary heavyweights. PAGE E1

 The Cannes Film Festival is one place where movie studios look for the arty fare that is often trotted out stateside just in time for Oscar season.

HEADLINE: Financial Markets Calmer, but Still 'Far From Normal,' Bernanke Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Turmoil in financial markets has eased somewhat, but the situation is still ''far from normal,'' the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday.
 The central bank has taken a number of unconventional steps -- especially since March, when the credit crisis intensified -- to help squeezed banks and big investment firms overcome problems and try to get credit flowing more freely again. 
 Those efforts appear to be paying off and ''have contributed to some improvement in financing markets,'' the Fed chief said in remarks delivered via satellite to a financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Sea Island, Ga.
 Mr. Bernanke noted some improvements in the markets for certain mortgage-backed securities, like those backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as some fixed-rate mortgages and corporate debt.
 Moreover, the Fed's extraordinary decision in March to let investment firms go to the Fed for emergency loans ''seems to have bolstered confidence,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 ''These are welcome signs, of course, but at this stage conditions in financial markets are still far from normal,'' he said.
 For instance, there are still strains involving a widely used interest rate called the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, Mr. Bernanke said. And ''funding pressures'' have also been evident in the ''strong participation'' of commercial banks in a Fed auction program that has made billions of dollars available in short-term cash loans, he said.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed policy makers were ready to further increase the size of these loans in the future if warranted by financial developments.
 Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a separate speech Tuesday, offered a similar assessment of financial conditions. ''There are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit,'' she said. The Fed's efforts, she said, ''have mitigated the worst effects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it.''
 In his speech, Mr. Bernanke did not talk about the Fed's next move on interest rates or the broader state of the economy, which many fear is on the edge of a recession or in one already.
 Many economists say they believe the Fed will hold steady on interest rates and focus more on its various efforts to relieve stressed credit markets.
 Ultimately, financial companies will need to raise new capital and improve risk management to address the fundamental sources of financial strains, Mr. Bernanke said. ''This process is likely to take some time,'' he added.
 And once financial conditions become more normal, the extraordinary provisions to provide ready sources of cash to financial institutions will no longer be needed, he said.
 Even as the Fed has stepped in to provide such help, it also is mindful of creating a ''moral hazard,'' where financial institutions might be more inclined to take certain risks if they think the Fed will be there to bail them out.
 ''The problem of moral hazard can perhaps be most effectively addressed by prudential supervision and regulation that ensures that financial institutions manage their liquidity risks effectively in advance of the crisis,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 The Fed is reviewing its policies on this front to see if improvements can be made, he said.

Overview of Lesson Plan:
In this lesson, students take part in a gallery walk about Israel's history in recognition of its 60th anniversary of statehood. They then learn about a documentary on a Jewish-Arab school in northern Israel that symbolizes hope for the future of the region.
Author(s):
Annissa Hambouz, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance:
One hour
Objectives:
Students will:
 1. Take part in an "Israel at 60" gallery walk that represents the history of Israel's statehood, from 1948 to the present.
 2. Share thoughts and responses based on the materials viewed during the gallery walk.
 3. Learn about "Bridge Over Wadi," a documentary about a bilingual and bicultural school for Arab and Jewish students in Israel by reading and discussing the article, "Arab and Israeli Peace, at Least for Children;" write responses to the article, speculating on future prospects for peace as Israel celebrates its 60th anniversary.
 4. Review the article, the questions and share and discuss their written homework responses in small groups.
Resources/Materials:
-student journals
 -pens and pencils
 -paper
 -classroom board
 -copies of "Arab and Israeli Peace, at Least for Children," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080514wednesday.html (one per student)
 -sources on Israel's history, including maps, basic information and facts on the state, articles from The New York Times, and personal stories (see Activities/Procedures below for further instruction)
Activities/Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do Now: [Note to teacher: This lesson plan requires some advance preparation, and it will likely require two class periods to accomplish. It will be most effective if students have familiarity with the history and geography of Israel and/or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.] 
Prior to your students' arrival in class, transform a section of your classroom into an "Israel at 60" gallery. When they arrive, invite students to take a "gallery walk" to read and review a number of sources on the past 60 years of Israel's statehood. Invite students to look closely at the material, displayed gallery-style on the walls and other spaces of the classroom, and how it highlights the words, images and sounds of a particular time and place. Because today's featured article from The New York Times discusses a documentary film on a growing Jewish-Arab school in northern Israel, the gallery will also provide the background information students need to contextualize this story. 
To create this gallery walk, gather a broad range of print and visual materials that address Israel's unique and complex history, from 1948 to the present. Resources to consider may include: photographs, quotations, maps, charts, graphs, essays, editorials, articles, primary source documents, music, film or video clips, or artifacts of any kind. These can be displayed around the classroom in "stations," preferably in chronological order to create an interactive timeline. Provide extra copies of articles and other print sources for students to select from and use for the next activities. 
Depending on your curriculum, you may wish to consider some of the following online primary sources when creating your gallery walk: 
-Excerpt from Theodor Herzl's 1896 publication, "The Jewish State" (http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/herzlex.html)
-The 1917 Balfour Declaration (http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm)
-United Nations 1947 Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution 181 (http://www.mideastweb.org/unpartition.htm)
-The United States Position on the Palestine Problem, March 19, 1948, Statement by Ambassador Warren R. Austin, U. S. Representative in the Security Council (http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/decade/decad166.htm)
-Original Text of the May 14, 1948, Declaration of Independence (http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/ Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel)
-The May 15, 1948, New York Times article, "Zionists Proclaim New State of Israel; Truman Recognizes it and Hopes for Peace" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0514.html#article)
-Estimates of Palestinian Refugees and Their Destinations, 1948-1948 (http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/stats/refs_48.html)
-Israel's Law of Return (Aliyah), 1950 (http://www.israel.org/MFA/MFAArchive/1950_1959/Law%20of%20Return%205710-1950)
-BBC's "On This Day," June 5 and 10, 1967 articles on the Six-Day War (http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/5/newsid_2654000/2654251.stm and http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/10/newsid_3047000/3047177.stm)
-Some United Nations General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions from 1967 to the present (http://globalpolicy.igc.org/security/issues/israel-palestine/docindex.htm)
-Some sources from the 1970s and '80s can be found at My Israel Source (http://www.myisraelsource.com/menu_gui/ default/MenuGuiFolder.2004-02-17.5181881336/School_108681348064/Elementary_108681349339/ Israels_history_108681349353/menu_index)
-The New York Times "Times Topics" page on Israel offers a number of articles from the archives, links, and general information on the country (http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/israel/index.html)
-New York Times Multimedia Features on Israel, like "Changing Lifestyles on the Kibbutz," August 26, 2007, (http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/08/26/world/20070826_KIBBUTZ_index.html) and "Israel's Arabs," May 7, 2008, (http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/05/07/world/20080507ISRAEL_index.html?scp=1&sq=israel&st=cse), can be found online at http://www.nytimes.com/pages/multimedia/index.html. 
2. For the duration of the period, have student "visitors" read, view, listen to and observe gallery exhibits while answering questions on a handout distributed at the beginning of class that asks:
-What documents or images are most interesting to you? Why?
 -What did you learn about Israel's history that you might not have known before?
 -Based on what you've read and seen, what makes Israel unique - politically, culturally and geographically? Why?
 -Based on what you already know or have learned here about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, what changes or developments do you think might unfold over the next decade as Israel moves toward its seventh decade of statehood? 
Once students have viewed the entire gallery and answered all the questions on their handouts, have them return to their seats to share their responses. What have they heard, read or seen in recent weeks regarding Israel's 60th anniversary? How, if at all, did the gallery documents enhance their understanding of this country's growth over the last six decades? Why?
This gallery walk can be specific to your classroom, but can also be a shared activity across the disciplines. A school library or multipurpose room can be transformed into an exhibit, "Israel at 60," for many classes to visit over the course of a day or week. 
3. Wrap-Up/Homework: At the end of the period, each student takes a copy of the article, "Arab and Israeli Peace, at Least for Children" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080514wednesday.html), to read and respond to for homework. Have students choose one of the following writing prompts (copied onto a handout for easier student access):
- How does the story of the Hand in Hand school reflect both the potential for positive change and the pessimistic status quo of Israeli-Palestinian co-existence? Which outlook do you identify with more, and why?
- How do the perspectives of the parents and children interviewed for "Bridge Over Wadi" differ? What other "generation gap" does this remind you of, whether from your own experience or from something you may have read, seen, or heard about?
 - Write a speech commemorating Israel's 60th anniversary in response to filmmaker Barak Heymann's words, "It's about being human and fighting for the right of the next generation not to be afraid of each other."
 Before they leave class, let students know that they will be discussing the article and their written responses in the following class period.
 Day Two:
 4. In a future class period, have students discuss the article, "Arab and Israeli Peace, at Least for Children," in small groups, using the following questions:
 a. According to the article, what is the goal of the Hand in Hand Bridge Over the Wadi School?
 b. Why did Barak and Tomer Heymann decide to make a documentary about this school, according to the article?
 c. How does the film show that "children adapt more easily than adults to difference," according to the article?
 d. Why do you think the reporter shares the story of Assaf and Bashar in this article?
 e. Whose voices do you think might be missing from this article? Why do you think the reporter didn't include them?
 f. What conclusions can you draw about Israeli-Palestinian relations based on this article?
 After groups have finished their discussions, have them share and read each other's written responses. In general, are students more optimistic or pessimistic about the future of this region? Why? Do they think cooperative projects, like the Hand in Hand School, might guide Israel (and the region) toward a brighter future? Why or why not?
Further Questions for Discussion:
-After reading today's article, would you like to see the film "Bridge Over Wadi"? Why or why not?
 -Based on what you know about the issues, why do you believe the conflict in Israel continues? Is peace possible?
 -What do you think might be the personal, emotional toll of the conflicts on the lives of the people who live in the region?
 -What responsibility, if any, should the international community have in supporting the peace process in Israel? Is it possible to support peace in the region without seeming biased toward one side of the conflict? Why or why not?
 -What role should the United States government play, if any, in influencing the peace process in Israel? What position has the United States government taken toward Israel in the past? Has its position changed and if so, how and why?
Evaluation/Assessment:
 Students will be evaluated based on participation in the gallery walk, thoughtful participation in group and class discussions, and completion of reflection pieces for homework.
Vocabulary:
Unnarrated, cultural experiment, atheist, unperturbed
Extension Activities:
1. Investigate further examples of cooperative Israeli-Palestinian efforts for peace and co-existence, like the Seeds of Peace summer camp (http://www.seedsofpeace.org/), the Ta'Ayush organization (http://www.taayush.org/), Women in Black (http://www.womeninblack.org/), the Coalition of Women For Peace (http://coalitionofwomen.org/home), and Bat Shalom (http://www.batshalom.org). Write a profile of one of these organizations. If possible, contact the organization to interview a member on his or her perspective. 
2. Study the evolution of Modern Hebrew language, which came into existence in the late 19th century and helped to create a common culture among new immigrants to Israel in the 20th century. Learn some basic terms and conversational phrases to teach your classmates. 
3. As you have probably learned, the foundation of Israel resulted in the migration and resettlement of one of the world's largest refugee groups. Research and create an infographic to represent the Palestinian diaspora from 1948 to the present. You may wish to begin your research with Global Exchange's Web site, "The Palestinian Diaspora" (http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/mideast/palestine/refugeeFacts.html). 
4. As Israel continues to grapple with the question of Israeli Arabs, the Occupied Territories, and Palestinian diaspora, members of the international community have posed a number of solutions. Learn about the "two-state solution" and the "one-state," or "binational," solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Who are the main proponents of each solution? What are the arguments for a separate Palestinian state or the coexistence of two nations under one state? Create a visual presentation, using maps of the region, for your class.

HEADLINE: With Eye Care as Seed, County Blossoms Into Biomedical Center

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THAT Orange County, Calif., has become a center of small companies developing devices for eye care is no coincidence. 
 Some of the companies were nurtured by a six-year-old private organization of more than two dozen top executives of corporations in the county. The organization, called Orange County Technology Network, or Octane, has so far created 27 companies, most in electronics and software technology, and biomedical devices, especially for eye care.
 ''It's innovation development, a variation on economic development,'' said Gary Augusta, executive director of Octane. 
 Other small eye device companies can trace their origins to William J. Link, who earned an engineering doctorate from Purdue University and came to Orange County in 1977 to work for a hospital supply company. He went on to found two eye device companies, sell them, and with the proceeds join venture capital investors who finance health care companies. He has helped to finance 20 companies, half of them in Orange County.
 ''When companies get bought out, some of the people in them who owned shares find they have money,'' Mr. Link said. ''And if they are entrepreneurial, they get the confidence to start their own companies. So the industry multiplies over and over again.'' 
 In all, there are 310 biomedical firms in Orange County, according to Octane, including several dozen developing implanted lenses, known as intraocular lenses, for use in cataract surgery, laser surgery for vision correction and instruments to alleviate glaucoma and other eye diseases.
 ''This area has the highest concentration of ophthalmic industry in the world,'' said Dr. Roger F. Steinert, professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of California, Irvine, which is closely involved in the Octane community effort. Every Thursday, Luis Vasquez of Octane goes to the Eye Institute at the university and listens as medical researchers tell him of ideas they have for businesses. Then he refers the ideas to the venture capital investors and entrepreneurial businesspeople who serve on Octane's 27-member board. 
 ''There is a remarkable community here,'' said Dr. Steinert, who is helping to raise funds for a $50 million Eye Institute building at the university. The building will be named for Gavin S. Herbert, founder and former chairman of Allergan, the large pharmaceutical products company that first developed antiallergy eye drops 60 years ago in Los Angeles. Allergan moved its headquarters to Irvine in 1971.
 The industry grew over some three decades in an organic process of small companies being taken over by large ones, which spurred entrepreneurs to form and lead new companies. Mr. Link, for example, started in the business 31 years ago when he heard about a need for intraocular lenses to replace lenses clouded with cataracts. ''So I contacted an ophthalmologist friend of mine and we founded American Medical Optics to make such lenses,'' Mr. Link said in a recent interview. 
 Mr. Link sold that company to Allergan in 1986 and then founded Chiron Vision, as an Orange County eye care subsidiary of the Chiron Corporation, the biotechnology firm based in Emeryville in Northern California. 
 Chiron Vision succeeded with lenses and research into advanced eye care, and Mr. Link sold it to Bausch & Lomb of Rochester for $300 million in 1997. Mr. Link then became a venture capitalist at Brentwood Venture Partners and its successor firm, Versant Ventures. 
 Eyeonics of Aliso Viejo, Calif., is a company founded by J. Andy Corley and Dr. J. Stuart Cumming in 1988. Mr. Corley worked with Mr. Link at American Medical Optics and at Chiron Vision. At Eyeonics, he changed the industry by persuading Medicare to let patients pay surgeons extra and directly for specialized lenses. 
 ''Cataract surgery is the most common operation performed, three million a year in the United States,'' Mr. Corley said in an interview. ''But Medicare in recent years started cutting remuneration for the procedure and private insurers did the same.'' So Eyeonics has developed what Mr. Corley called a premium lens that not only replaced the cataract but reduced the need to wear eyeglasses afterward for reading. 
 ''Baby boomers don't want to wear glasses,'' Mr. Corley said. ''They want to preserve the youthful lifestyle, and they're willing to pay for it.'' Eyeonics made $34 million in revenue for its premium lenses last year, he said. Cataract surgery costs up to $2,000 an eye while surgery that installs the premium lenses can cost $5,000 an eye, according to data supplied by Eyeonics and physicians.
 Mr. Corley sold Eyeonics last February to Bausch & Lomb for an undisclosed sum that he said exceeded $80 million. Impressed with the entrepreneurial environment in Orange County, Bausch & Lomb is transferring some research functions to the Eyeonics location, which Mr. Corley will manage.
 Thomas J. Berryman, who founded WaveTec Vision Systems in Aliso Viejo, Calif., in 2005 with $5 million in venture capital from Mr. Link's Versant Ventures, noted in an interview that the demands of eye care change as technology advances. 
 ''Many young people have Lasik surgery these days, and that changes the calculations on their lenses when they come to need cataract surgery,'' Mr. Berryman said. ''This presents problems for surgeons who guarantee a certain level of vision perfection as a result of their operations.'' 
 WaveTec Vision has responded by developing an instrument that attaches to the surgical microscope, allowing the doctor to have a more precise measurement of a patient's corrected vision. The company has run trials of the device on 300 patients, has raised $18 million in venture capital and hopes to achieve commercial operation next year, Mr. Berryman said. 
 Another eye device company is the Glaukos Corporation, headed by Thomas W. Burns, who worked with Mr. Link at Chiron Vision and was recruited by him in 2002 to be president and chief executive. Mr. Link serves as chairman of Glaukos, which is in Laguna Hills, Calif. Inspiration for the company came from a financier in Orange County, Olav Bergheim, whose son suffered from glaucoma and required high-risk surgeries. ''We founded this company,'' Mr. Burns said, ''to develop a safer microinvasive procedure to treat glaucoma.''
 Glaukos, with help from Dr. Richard Little, an ophthalmologist at the University of California, Irvine, developed an infinitesimal titanium stent that can be implanted in the eye to drain fluid and thus reduce the pressure that leads to glaucoma. The company, backed by $55 million in venture capital, has completed its clinical trials and hopes to secure approval for the device by mid-2009, Mr. Burns said. 
 Noting the intense levels of activity among the hundreds of biomedical companies in Orange County, Mr. Augusta summed up one of Octane's tasks this way: ''We have 400 jobs open and must attract the people.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Entrepreneurial Edge column in Business Day on May 15, about the development of biomedical companies in Orange County, Calif., misidentified the developer of a stent used to prevent glaucoma. He is Dr. Rick Hill, an ophthalmologist formerly with the University of California, Irvine -- not Dr. Richard Little, who is still an ophthalmologist there.

HEADLINE: Investors Heartened as Price Index Rises More Slowly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street advanced Wednesday after a better-than-expected report on consumer prices tempered some of the market's concerns about inflation.
 The Labor Department said that consumer prices advanced 0.2 percent in April after rising 0.3 percent in March, despite the largest jump in food prices in 18 years. 
 Marc Pado, United States market strategist for Cantor Fitzgerald, said the tame reading on consumer prices, along with recent figures on productivity, indicated that businesses were swallowing some of their rising costs rather than passing them to consumers.
 The Dow rose 66.20, or 0.52 percent, to 12,898.38. The index, tracking blue-chip companies, was at times up more than 150 points, but a late sell-off in technology stocks pared some gains.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.62, or 0.40 percent, to 1,408.66. The Nasdaq composite index was up 1.58, or 0.06 percent, to 2,496.70.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.78, or 0.11 percent, to 736.07.
 Light crude oil fell $1.58, to settle at $124.22 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Major indexes are approaching their highs of the month, but one sector of stocks -- financials -- is still being left behind.
 Steve Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company, said he remained troubled about the financial industry's underperformance. While the financial sector has been pulled higher by the market's recent overall rise, he said, it is not out front as would be needed to lead a bona fide rally.
 ''They tend to outperform the S.& P. by a 50 percent margin, but we're not seeing that at all,'' he said of financial companies. 
 Concerns that major investment banks and retail banks will have more write-downs in coming quarters has put pressure on their stock prices. Lehman Brothers is down about 8.5 percent from its highs this month, while the S.& P. is down by only 1 percent.
 ''They led us into the crisis, but they're not yet leading us out of it,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''That's what needs to happen.''
 Leadership on Wednesday went to technology stocks; the Nasdaq, which is heavy on technology stocks, at one point was up 1.3 percent. Investors collected profits during the last hour of trading, however, and sent big tech names sharply lower. Apple stock fell $3.70, or 2 percent, to $182.26, after trading as high as $192.24 during the session.
 In corporate news, Macy's reported it lost $59 million in the first quarter because of weaker sales and costs tied to combining businesses. But the results surpassed Wall Street's expectations, and the stock rose 87 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $24.93.
 Deere said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 22 percent as higher crop prices drove global demand for farm equipment. But the company said rising costs of raw materials could eat into profits in the coming months. Deere shares fell $8.94, or 9.9 percent, to $81.25.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was flat at 99 22/32, and its yield remained at 3.91 percent.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 126-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Building Rage

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
 ADMIT it: You do not regard contractors as sensitive creatures. There are times you are not even sure they are quite human. They track all that dirt into your house. They seem unable to clean up after themselves after a day's work. They are unaware that you have a life, a schedule.
 But think about it: Has not a contractor an eye, perhaps one better equipped to judge a grain of wood than your own? Has not a contractor hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? If you prick a contractor does he not bleed, hopefully not on the white marble counter? If you do not pay him, will he not avenge himself, perhaps ripping out the plumbing? In short, has not a contractor feelings? 
 If you doubt it, listen to the story of Rich Gaspar, the president of Gaspar's Construction in Seattle, who suffered such feelings of rage, frustration and pain from what he calls a client from the dark side that he sought therapy. The job, some six years ago, was large, building a mother-in-law apartment in a basement; Mr. Gaspar describes the homeowner as a corporate hatchet man. Meeting him, Mr. Gaspar sensed he would be difficult. A month into the renovation, which was plagued with unforeseen construction problems and would climb from a $250,000 estimate to a cost of $350,000, Mr. Gaspar was certain of it. 
 ''What he said over and over was: 'This confirms my suspicions about you' -- in other words, you are a crook,'' Mr. Gaspar says. ''The houses we are working on are 110 years old, they have asbestos and lead, and when you run into those situations you have to deal with it. He'd come back and say, 'You always intended to charge me more. I knew this was going to be a half-million job.' I went to therapy because he was negative, belligerent and demeaning.''
 What kind of advice did the shrink have?
 ''We'd talk about my feelings, how I could better take care of myself. There were things like write a letter, then tear it up and put it in a drawer. It was a sounding board, a place for me to release the stuff coming down on me. Conflict is hard enough for me.'' 
 Much has been written about contractors from hell. There is a Web site of that very name filled with horror stories and legal resources. Another site, Angie's List, permits homeowners to rate their contractors, who are given the opportunity to reply. Comparatively little attention is paid to the homeowner from hell, to the unreasonable, irrational and selfish demands that make contractors crazy. Although the recession is making it easier to hire contractors in some parts of the country and the power in the relationship might seem to be shifting to the homeowner, it should be remembered that contractors, too, have limits.
 John Finton is the founder of Finton Construction, a Los Angeles firm that has about 30 luxury projects under construction at a time, with C.E.O.'s and entertainment superstars for clients. 
 ''Oh -- a human punching bag,'' commented a woman who was building a vacation house in Mexico when he told her what he did, and Mr. Finton did not disagree. The homes he builds are between 5,000 and 50,000 square feet. The people he builds them for, ''the kings and queens of society,'' want what they want when they want it, he says, and don't stand in line for anything. Mr. Finton, who calls himself a ''pathological accommodator,'' is for the most part fine with that. For many years, he slept with his cellphone next to his bed. He is unruffled by those who show up an hour or two late. 
 But occasionally a client goes too far. 
 There was, for instance, the female pop singer who requested an evening meeting during the time Mr. Finton's mother was terminally ill with cancer, about six years ago. It was Mr. Finton's birthday, and his mother had planned a special dinner. Mr. Finton explained this to the singer's father, who acted as her on-site representative. A short time later, Mr. Finton got a call: The singer, he was told, would see him that evening. Mr. Finton complied.
 On another occasion, Mr. Finton had a cancer scare of his own. A movie executive for whom he was building a large home immediately sent over a limo to take him to the cancer hospital, the City of Hope. The lump on his chest turned out to be benign. Mr. Finton was less certain about his client.
 ''He'd said, 'I need you healthy so I can kick you around,' '' Mr. Finton remembers. ''I think he was somewhat serious.''
 There does not appear to be a builder's equivalent of Angie's List aimed at exposing difficult homeowners. But contractors seem to have their own ways of rating, handling and rejecting those clients. There is even a book on the subject: ''Managing the Emotional Homeowner: The Remodeler's Guide to Happy Customers,'' written by David Lupberger, a Colorado contractor turned consultant, and Bill Still. (The book is available at Mr. Lupberger's Web site, turnkeyprogram.com, for $29.95.) Topics include ''Managing Homeowner Expectations'' and ''The Zen Approach to Handling Homeowner Upsets.'' (Abridged version: just let the waves of rage wash over you and eventually the client will become exhausted.) If it sounds as if there was a good deal of psychiatric input, it's because there was. Two psychologists, a man and a woman, had asked, through a friend, to meet him.
 ''They had both done renovations the previous year and both were still upset, and so for the next hour they vented. Cost overruns, delays in the construction. I'll never forget him shaking a finger at me and saying, 'David, it's been over a year. Do you see how upset I still am?' ''
 Mr. Lupberger learned a few things. ''He said there is something called parental transference that can take place in a large remodeling project; the contractor takes on the parenting role due to the dependency that can happen,'' Mr. Lupberger says. ''If someone had a bad parenting experience growing up and then the contractor upset the homeowner by not meeting an expectation or missing a deadline, all the negative emotion from that person's childhood is transferred to the contractor.''
 One instructive chart in Mr. Lupberger's book is ''The Homeowner's Emotional Roller Coaster,'' which illustrates the intense highs and lows a client can expect during a renovation. Dan Bawden, who runs Legal Eagle Contractors in Houston and is both a lawyer and a contractor, found the book invaluable and has taken that chart a step further. His interpretation, ''Dan's Funk Chart,'' expands the list of players to include architect, family dog and children, all of whom ride a roller coaster of emotional states, from Deep Funk to Bliss. (A version appears below.) The chart is on Mr. Bawden's Web site (legaleaglecontractors.com), which makes it easy to follow along as he explains. 
 ''Look at the family dog,'' Mr. Bawden says. ''When construction starts he hides so far away he goes off the bottom of the chart. He doesn't come back until the party to catch the falling hors d'oeuvres. Look at the children when the rough framing comes in, bouncing around, happy because they have a jungle gym to play on. The homeowner is super-happy at the beginning, then when the bids come in the homeowner and the architect both drop into a deep funk. The architect is down there because he told them it was going to cost half the amount so his creation could be built, and the homeowners are there because they know he was lying.''
 Trying to prepare homeowners for the stress of renovation does not always work, Mr. Bawden says; women in their third trimester of pregnancy, for example, can be ''insanely picky.''
 ''They'll bend over as best they can and look at the underside of the countertop in the kitchen, and they'll see it wasn't painted and they will just explode,'' he says.
 Mr. Bawden, a married man, always gives pregnant women slack. But he does screen clients; if they seem flaky at the first interview, he asks them to take a 10-question personality test. (On his site, this test is labeled ''Just for Fun,'' which shows how sneaky some contractors can be.) 
 ''It puts you in one of five categories,'' Mr. Bawden says. ''If you are in the middle you are an ideal candidate. If you're at one extreme, you are someone so anal and picky that you are going to be unpleasable; if you're at the other, you are so artistic and flaky you couldn't pick a paint color if your life depended on it.'' Either way, he adds, ''you're going to get a real careful second interview.''
 CLIENT screening turns out to be a common practice. Experienced contractors learn to become alert to potentially destructive patterns: homeowners who belittle the work of respected colleagues, say, or brag about beating down tradespeople to get the best price. 
 Herbert Stanwood, a senior project designer for the nationwide firm of Case Design/Remodeling, who works at the headquarters in Bethesda, Md., has a list of difficult client types. They include the Carrot Dangler, who boasts of his influence in the neighborhood and suggests the contractor will get more work if he lowers his price, and the Relationship Killer, who announces at the first meeting that he or she will be difficult. That's a major red flag because the client has taken a belligerent stance before the project has even begun. 
 Mr. Stanwood has also encountered the Contract Rewriter. One such client tried to add a clause that said the contractor would be liable for damage ''to any property on the site or adjacent sites, including trees, shrubs, lawns, lots, pavements or roadway,'' Mr. Stanwood says. ''So I guess if we're driving down the street and we see a shrub that somebody's run into, we're responsible.'' 
 Once a job is under way, the problem that most seems to trouble contractors is client indecision. 
 ''The contractor can't proceed without certain information,'' says Sal Alfano, the editorial director of a half-dozen magazines for contractors at Hanley Wood Business Media and a former contractor himself. ''If I don't know what the floor finishing is going to be -- if it's going to be three-quarter-inch hardwood or a layer of plywood and half-inch tile, which would make it more like an inch and a quarter -- there's a lot of work I can't do. I can't hang the doors, I can't even plan what the stair structure is going to be like. If I'm a half-inch off on the height of the first tread because you decided to go with thicker or thinner flooring, you're going to fall on your face.''
 Contractors also have problems with clients who buy materials themselves in an attempt to save money, then expect their contractor to deal with any problems that result; clients who constantly challenge their expertise; clients who call them on weekends or evenings about problems that can wait until a workday. 
 Sometimes the problems are not even the responsibility of the contractor. Mr. Finton, the luxury builder in Los Angeles, remembers getting one such call as he was sitting down to Easter dinner.
 ''A lot of my clientele, although they may be brilliant in terms of their own business, when it comes to fixing a clogged toilet -- and most people would pick up the Yellow Pages -- they have one number, and they call me,'' Mr. Finton says. ''I had a client who called me because his home had caught on fire. It had nothing to do with anything we had done; his wife had lit some candles and the drapes closed automatically and caught on fire. He said, 'The house is on fire.' I said, Call the fire department.'' 
 ''I did go out there anyway,'' he adds.
 Getting paid can be another issue.
 ''I've had people send me an interpretation of the bill and pay me that,'' said Kip Siebert, who runs Heritage Home Design in Montclair, N.J. ''I send them a bill, they send me back another one that tells me what I really should be charging.''
 There are also those clients who find fault with the work to delay or withhold a final payment, knowing that it may be so expensive for the contractor to sue that he will write off the loss. Lonny Rutherford, who runs Legacy Construction, a three-person firm in New Mexico, had a client who withheld a final payment of $10,000 because a knob from a kitchen cabinet was missing. 
 ''It was a custom order -- sometimes when you order knobs, the screw holes aren't right,'' Mr. Rutherford says. ''We re-ordered and got the knob within three weeks, but it was a killer.'' Later, ''we added a clause that says final payment is due upon substantial completion, when you can occupy the job and use it. You can still cook without a knob.''
 Bob Hanbury and his brother Alan, third-generation contractors who run the House of Hanbury Builders in Newington, Conn., have also made changes to their contract. It now has 21 amendments, including the dog-and-child clause and the toilet clause. Each, Mr. Hanbury says, has a story.
 ''This dog was in a pen. We delivered some stuff and leaned it against the fence, the door opened, the dog wandered off. But that wasn't a good enough explanation for the homeowner. It became a personal attack: 'Don't you care anything about my dog? Are you stupid?' I said, It's an animal; it will come back. She said -- how did she put it? -- 'Don't you think I care about this dog as much as a child? You could have lost my child.' I didn't know what to do. I just stood there. The dog came back in the middle of the argument.''
 The dog clause now says that workers ''shall not be expected to keep gates and the like closed for animals and children.''
 And the toilet clause?
 ''We did an addition. Most people say if you would like to use the bathroom, come on in. The homeowner suddenly says, 'You can't use my bathroom' -- she had this brand-new remodeled bathroom. I said, Let's pull out of this job, but it was my brother's job. We had to go down to the gas station. Now it says -- I'm paraphrasing -- If you don't let us use your bathroom, we're going to charge you for a Porta-Potty and we're going to put it in the front yard.''
 That reminds Mr. Hanbury of another clause.
 ''The same woman wanted us to reimburse her for the electricity and the water we used. We now say water and other utilities shall be furnished by owner at no expense to contractor. That little old lady drove my brother crazy.''
 And Mr. Finton, builder to C.E.O.'s and stars? Six years after that singer demanded he skip the birthday dinner his dying mother planned for him, he has set boundaries. He would no longer agree to such a meeting. And he now sleeps with his phone in another room. He tries to protect his weekend and family time. If someone calls when he's taking his children to school, he will not answer his cell -- though sometimes he texts.
 How to Drive a Contractor Crazy
 1. Avoid making decisions.
 2. Change orders frequently, then become outraged by the additional costs and delays.
 3. Ask a contractor to provide a solution to a difficult design problem, then use a different contractor for the job.
 4. Challenge a contractor's expertise with sentences that include the words ''my brother-in-law thinks,'' ''my neighbor thinks'' or ''I took a shop course when I was in 10th grade and this is what I think.'' If your brother-in-law was that good, why didn't you hire him?
 5. Withhold final payment for months because of minor problems like missing fixtures that are on order.
 6. Withhold final payment because you know it will cost the contractor so much money and time to take you to court that it will not be worth it.
 7. Cling to the belief that contractors have X-ray vision that enables them to see into walls, and thus are aware of faulty wiring and plumbing or rot before the start of a job.
 8. Attempt to poach the contractor's workers by taking them aside and asking them to come back when the job is finished to do another job.
 9. Schedule construction during the third trimester of pregnancy.
 10. Buy appliances or building materials online or from a discount house to save money, then expect the contractor to make everything work when the products are damaged or don't arrive on time.
 11. Call the contractor in the middle of the night and on weekends about problems that can wait until Monday.
 12. Hover about a job while murmuring tragically, ''It doesn't look finished.'' It's a job site. It doesn't look finished because it's not finished. JOYCE WADLER

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Seeks Reports of Foreign Accounts

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
In its hunt for wealthy Americans who have stashed money overseas to evade taxes, the federal government has turned to an obscure law enacted nearly four decades ago. 
 Under the law, originally aimed at rooting out laundering of drug money, citizens or residents of the United States must tell the Internal Revenue Service each year if they have any foreign bank or financial accounts holding a total of $10,000 or more. Income from the assets is taxed at ordinary rates of up 35 percent. 
 The law took effect in 1970, but many taxpayers have either ignored it or were not aware of it, and the Treasury Department has rarely enforced it. The I.R.S. estimates that one million American taxpayers warrant disclosure, but that as few as one in four file the disclosures. 
 Now, as it intensifies its efforts to root out offshore tax evasion, the I.R.S. is moving to enforce the law aggressively and to apply stiff new penalties to taxpayers who don't file the disclosures. ''There is definitely a renewed emphasis on this,'' said Kevin E. Packman, a tax lawyer at Holland & Knight. 
 The I.R.S. declined to discuss the new efforts it has devoted to tracking disclosures. ''The I.R.S. remains committed to developing compliance initiatives and programs to ensure that all taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities,'' the agency said. 
 The disclosure, known formally as a Foreign Bank and Financial Account Report and informally as an Fbar, is separate from a federal income tax return. The disclosure is also required of United States residents with signatory power over or a financial interest in at least 50 percent of a foreign account. And the definition of those who must file includes domestic estates, trusts, partnerships and corporations. 
 The focus could be harsh for some American clients of UBS, Switzerland's largest bank and the world's largest manager of private wealth. UBS is under investigation by the United States into whether it helped clients evade taxes, possibly by not reporting to the I.R.S. interest and dividends earned by American clients. 
 Those reports are not the same as Fbar disclosures, but the investigation of UBS could produce lists of client names and prompt the I.R.S. to look at whether those people filed disclosures. 
 Failure to file a disclosure or lying on a filed disclosure can be evidence of tax fraud, and the penalties are severe. 
 Before 2004, the maximum fine for civil violations was $100,000, small change for those with millions of dollars or more hidden overseas.
 But provisions in the USA Patriot Act aimed at stopping the financing of terrorists raised the maximum civil fine to $100,000 or half of the amount in the account, whichever is greater. 
 Criminal penalties are as high as $500,000 or half the account balance, and up to 10 years in jail.
 One American caught by the disclosure rules is Igor Olenicoff, the billionaire founder of Olen Properties, a real estate development company. Last December he pleaded guilty to failing to file the disclosures from 1998 to 2004, when he put around $200 million in overseas accounts, including at UBS. He paid $52 million to resolve the issue. 
 Mr. Olenicoff was identified in an indictment of a former UBS banker on Tuesday over violations of private banking and tax issues.
 Some government officials consider the disclosures an easy-to-use weapon in the government's campaign to rein in offshore tax evasion. Rather than having to describe complex tax shelters, ''we only have to prove you have the overseas account, not whether or not you made money in it,'' said a senior government official who declined to be identified because he is in the enforcement field. 
 The focus on disclosures could also turn the spotlight on wealthy American customers of Liechtenstein's largest private bank, LGT Bank. LGT accounts for around half of all deposits in Liechtenstein, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development considers the functional equivalent of an offshore tax haven. 
 In February, the I.R.S. announced that it was investigating more than 100 Americans with bank accounts in Liechtenstein. While it did not name the bank, the accounts in question were at LGT, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation. The number of Fbar disclosures being filed is increasing, partly because of the increased flow of data from foreign countries that are cooperating with the I.R.S. Just under 117,000 disclosures were filed in 1991, according to I.R.S. data; the most recent data, for 2007, showed the filings had more than tripled, to more than 322,000.

 ITALIAN TRIAL OF C.I.A OPERATIVES BEGINS WITH TORTURE TESTIMONY
 A long-delayed trial moved forward in Milan against C.I.A. operatives and former top Italian intelligence officials over the disappearance of a radical Muslim cleric in 2003. Testimony in the case also began, as the cleric's wife offered details of her husband's abduction, saying he was repeatedly tortured. The Bush administration has not commented on whether it was responsible for the cleric's disappearance but has said it will not extradite the Americans charged in the case. Page A10 
 ATTACKS DURING BUSH VISIT
 President Bush's trip to Israel to celebrate the country's 60th birthday was marred by violence. Four Palestinians were killed, including two militants, and nine were wounded in a series of Israeli Army strikes and incursions into Gaza, said medics and witnesses there. A rocket that the police said was launched from northern Gaza badly wounded an Israeli woman and her 2-year-old daughter. Page A6 
 SUICIDE ATTACKS BY TEENS IN IRAQ
 Two suicide bombers described as teenagers carried out attacks Wednesday in suburban Baghdad as the prime minister went to the northern city of Mosul to encourage Iraqi soldiers fighting in a new offensive to rid that area of Sunni Islamic extremists. Page A10
 LEBANON RETRACTS POLITICAL MOVES
 Lebanon's governing faction rescinded two political decisions, moving closer to ending a weeklong political crisis with Hezbollah that prompted the worst bloodshed the country has seen since its 15-year civil war. The decisions to challenge Hezbollah's private phone network and the job of the chief of airport security, a Hezbollah ally, were retracted after meetings between Lebanese leaders and an Arab diplomatic delegation led by the foreign minister of Qatar.

 SCHWARZENEGGER HAS PLAN 
 To Close State Budget Gap
 To close California's huge budget gap, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a plan: persuade a Wall Street investment firm to lend the state $15 billion against future proceeds from the state's rather unsuccessful lottery program with the lending firm taking large risks, for a low-yield return. And if that fails, the state's sales tax will go up a penny over the next few years. The lottery idea reflects the severity of California's budget gap. PAGE A23 
 LET THEM EAT LIVER
 Foie gras, run out of Chicago with great fanfare two years ago, is being allowed back. The city's aldermen voted, 37 to 6, to repeal their ban on sales of the controversial delicacy, the fattened livers of duck and goose. Since 2006, when this became the first major city in the United States to enact such a ban, it had been mocked by critics, including Mayor Richard M. Daley. PAGE A19 
 WEST VIRGINIANS VOTE OUT JUDGE
 The chief justice of West Virginia's Supreme Court, Elliott E. Maynard, lost his re-election bid after being dogged by a conflict-of-interest scandal stemming from photographs showing him dining with the chief executive of a coal company that had cases pending before the court. He had been the clear favorite in the race but after the photographs surfaced finished third in a field of four candidates. PAGE A25 
 REPORT CITES NURSING NEGLIGENCE
 Nursing home inspectors routinely overlook or minimize problems that pose a serious threat to patients, Congressional investigators say in a new report. In the report, the investigators, from the Government Accountability Office, say they have found widespread ''understatement of deficiencies,'' including malnutrition, bedsores, overuse of prescription medications and abuse of nursing home residents.

 BURNING OUT BUT NOT FADING AWAY
 Radio telescopes on Earth and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory have taken pictures of stellar debris believed to be the youngest supernova remnant known in the Milky Way. The observations show that it is still expanding outward at a pace of perhaps 30 million miles per hour, or about 5 percent of the speed of light. ''It's doing things we have never seen before,'' said one physics professor. PAGE A23

 CONSUMER PRICES RISE,
 But Inflation Fears Ease
 Consumer prices edged up slightly in April, but far more slowly than many economists had anticipated, the government reported, lending credence to the view that a slowing economy is applying the brakes to inflation. The data offered a measure of vindication to the Federal Reserve, which has been lowering interest rates in a bid to spur the economy even as some economists have argued that a surge of cheap credit will exacerbate rising prices.

 FREDDIE MAC POSTS LOSSES
 Freddie Mac disclosed losses that were smaller than expected only because of accounting tactics that minimized the effects of bad loans. Yet investors cheered the results anyway, and pushed the company's shares up by over 9 percent. Like its rival Fannie Mae, whose share price rose after the company reported enormous losses, Freddie Mac's performance reiterated that investors believe Freddie and Fannie are too important for either to fail.

 EYE CARE BLOSSOMS IN COUNTY
 That Orange County, Calif., has become a center of small companies developing devices for eye care is no coincidence. Some of the companies were nurtured by a six-year-old private organization of more than two dozen top executives of corporations in the county. The organization, called the Orange County Technology Network, or Octane, has so far created 27 companies, most in electronics and software technology and in biomedical devices, especially eye care devices.

 Not many investigations are as intricate as the Drug Enforcement Administration's three-year pursuit of Tareq Mousa al-Ghazi and Monzer al-Kassar, two shadowy international arms dealers who are being prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan.

 There was once a tiny religious minority so persecuted it was forced to build its own educational and political infrastructure to survive in the city of New York. The subculture ultimately seized power from the entrenched majority and changed what it meant to be a New Yorker. Yet a museum has never devoted a major exhibition to the history of this group. That is, until Friday, when ''Catholics in New York, 1808 to 1946'' opens at the Museum of the City of New York. Page A28

 FIRST GAY KISS IN DAYTIME SOAPS
 Turns a World Around
 Soap operas, which have been shedding their audiences for years now, have over the past 7 1/2 months seen a decline in viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. All the soaps but one, that is: the historically stodgy CBS drama ''As the World Turns.'' Since its introduction of a gay-themed story line, the show has gained viewers, specifically younger viewers, some of whom turned to the show after following the romance of college-age characters Luke and Noah, whose initial kiss was the first gay kiss in daytime soaps.

 BRITISH ACTOR SEDUCES AMERICA
 When Ben Daniels arrived on Broadway this spring for his role as the ostentatiously rakish Valmont in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' he was a largely unknown but deeply attractive British import.

Sitting in a backstage lounge before showtime on a recent afternoon, he was alternately dead serious in discussing his craft and almost giggly over his good fortune. PAGE B1

 HOMEOWNERS FROM HELL:
 Tales of Contractor Rage and Woe
 Much has been written about contractors from hell. (There is a Web site of that very name filled with horror stories and legal resources.)

One contractor suffered such feelings of rage, frustration and pain from what he calls a client from the dark side that he sought therapy. PAGE D1

 Ten years ago, Michael Roach and Christie McNally, Buddhist teachers with a growing following in the United States and abroad, took vows to be celibate and never to separate, giving themselves a range of about 15 feet.

 With annual sales of roughly $2 million, the privately held Da Hui surf clothing line is a flyspeck compared to behemoths like Billabong or Quiksilver.

HEADLINE: Price Data Suggests Slowdown Is Cooling Inflation

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Consumer prices edged up slightly in April, but far more slowly than many economists had expected, the government reported Wednesday, lending credence to the view that a slowing economy is applying the brakes to inflation.
 The data offered a measure of vindication to the Federal Reserve, which has been lowering interest rates in a bid to spur the economy amid fears of a recession, even as some economists have argued that this surge of cheap credit will worsen rising prices. 
 The figures released by the Labor Department showed that consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in April, and 3.9 percent compared with the previous year. Prices grew by 0.1 percent when food and energy were excluded -- about half what most economists forecast -- and 2.3 percent compared with the previous year. 
 This so-called core inflation rate is what the Fed tends to focus on as it adjusts interest rates, lowering them to encourage economic activity and raising them to snuff out rising prices.
 Analysts took the surprisingly positive core number -- representing the third consecutive month of smaller-than-expected increases -- as a sign that the Fed need not raise rates in coming months to choke off inflation.
 ''The message that we're getting from core inflation has been rather friendly from the Fed perspective, in terms of giving them greater latitude to respond to mishaps without fueling fears on the inflation side,'' said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ''The data should undercut thoughts that the Fed will tighten again.''
 Wall Street took stock in that reading, sending markets higher. 
 But most American households do not have the luxury of excluding gasoline and food from their budgets. The details of the report offered clear signs that much of the country is grappling with rising prices, just as the job market is shrinking and many companies are cutting working hours, eroding the purchasing power of American paychecks.
 Food prices rose at a 0.9 percent annual rate in April -- the largest jump since 1990 -- and 5.1 percent compared with the same month a year ago. 
 ''This is a fine inflation report if you don't need to eat, drive or depend on your paycheck,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington and author of the recently released book, ''Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?'' (Berrett-Koehler).
 Housing costs, which make up 40 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose by 0.3 percent. Clothing prices rose by 0.5 percent, and medical care by 0.2 percent.
 Transportation costs dipped by 0.7 percent in April, and recreation costs dropped by 0.1 percent.
 A primary factor holding down the inflation rate was a surprising dip in gasoline prices -- at least in the way the government tracks the data. The Labor Department calculated that gasoline prices actually increased 5.6 percent in April, but when seasonal fluctuations for demand were factored in, that increase was penciled in as a 0.2 percent dip. 
 ''I wonder if they can read the minds of very skeptical American motorists who are not fooled by this statistical sleight of hand!'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in a note to clients. He said the report would give the Fed's policy makers ''some apparent (but not necessarily real) breathing room as they monitor the economy for signs of inflation.''
 Several economists said they expected record oil prices, filtering through the economy, to apply upward pressure to the inflation rate in future months.
 But the most important takeaway from the numbers was the overall picture, many analysts asserted: as the economy slows, eliminating jobs and diminishing corporate profits, it is at least providing some built-in relief by cooling the pace of higher prices.
 ''With virtually every major developed and emerging economy now in the process of slowing, odds are inflation pressures will continue to abate in the second half of the year,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, in a note to clients.
 This could help compensate for the diminished purchasing power of many American households as the economy slows.

HEADLINE: Vision of Arts District Meets High-Rise Reality

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
 Across the street from the hulking remains of the Hudson & Manhattan Powerhouse, which once provided electricity for what is now the PATH rail system, is a mountain of bricks and rubble in the middle of a sprawling vacant lot. 
 Once it was the site of the Lorillard Tobacco and Snuff Manufactory, the largest tobacco factory in the country. Later it was a thoroughly magical warren for hundreds of artists, and the inspiration for an arts district envisioned as a way to revive a decrepit, forgotten warehouse district near the Jersey City waterfront. Current plans call for it to become a 52-story residential tower designed to look like a precarious stack of blocks. 
 Whether or not you care to see Jersey City as New York's sixth borough, you could write a pretty interesting urban history centered on the 12 or so blocks now designated as its Powerhouse Arts District. But before you did, you would have to sort through two distinct story lines about how the tale has evolved. 
 One is a story of betrayal, how almost two decades of hard work and advocacy that produced a visionary plan for a low-rise arts district that preserved the area's past was shunted aside in favor of plans for megatowers and cookie-cutter urban development. The second is a story about the malleability of urban life, how neighborhoods always evolve and how no planning document can ever be exempt from the vagaries of market forces and social trends.
 It's probably appropriate that either narrative culminates at the same point: a shootout over an abandoned matzo factory. In this case, it was a bitterly contested decision by the City Council last month to approve a proposal by the giant home builder Toll Brothers to construct three residential towers of 30 stories or more. Two would be on the site of an old Manischewitz factory; one would be across the street.
 It came after a heated meeting at which nearly all the 45 or so people who spoke opposed changes in the plan. Nearby residents have threatened lawsuits to stop the project.
 ''We're insulted by this scheme,'' said Jill Edelman, president of the neighborhood association in the area. ''It's not only not in keeping with the vision of the redevelopment plan, but it goes counter to it and it destroys it.''
 The current chapter of this saga dates back to the early 1980s, when Jersey City's real estate boom seemed a contradiction in terms. Led by a painter named Charles Kessler and inspired by a burgeoning downtown art scene, residents and officials began thinking of redeveloping some of the most hopeless real estate in the city as an arts district with galleries and housing for artists.
 After various iterations and much high-level study, including an enthusiastic report by the Urban Land Institute, the result in 2004 was designation as the Powerhouse Arts District, with a plan designed to maintain the district's historic character, low-rise feel and mix of art and housing.
 In retrospect, that plan probably died with the pile of rubble at the old tobacco factory when the city -- facing lawsuits from the developer who owned the building, which had since been converted into artists' studios -- allowed him to knock down the building and build a high rise instead. ''That was the first domino,'' said Mr. Kessler. ''So now we have Toll Brothers.'' 
 But city officials say that in truth, the plan, however romantic it seemed, was flawed from the start. It didn't provide enough critical mass for a successful district, it couldn't generate enough revenue to support retail projects envisioned for the area, it didn't support renovation of the one truly iconic building -- the powerhouse -- and it didn't provide enough density for the rail service now in place. 
 ''The idea of keeping density extremely low on a PATH stop is a luxury the city can't afford,'' said Robert Antonicello, executive director of the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency. ''It's not consistent with smart growth, and it's not what's best for the whole city. What's disappointing to me is that instead of embracing what's best for the entire city you've got a group that instead has taken a more myopic Nimby approach.''
 AND so it will go. 
 The city talks about a broader district, covering 25 blocks instead of 12, an arts district with entertainment space, not just visual arts. Critics point out that the city isn't hurting for high-rise development, it's drowning in it. What it almost had, they said, was something distinctive, something based in the city's old industrial past -- not a substitute for high-rise development, but a bit of diversity that's an alternative to it.
 In the Kabuki world of development fights, it's hard to be too surprised at how this chapter played out, but Mr. Kessler said he was still disappointed. ''We have plenty of high rises, we have an entire waterfront that's suitable for high rises,'' he said. ''I expect a developer to try to make as much profit as he can. But here we had an incredible resource that speaks to Jersey City's history like nothing else -- railway history, industrial history -- and rather than fight to save it, the city just folded.''

HEADLINE: At Sotheby's, a Bacon Triptych Is Auctioned for a Record $86 Million

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A 1976 triptych by Francis Bacon brought $86.3 million on Wednesday night at Sotheby's, becoming the most expensive work of contemporary art ever sold at auction and a retort to doomsayers who had predicted that the art market would falter seriously this season because of broad economic anxieties.
 ''Recession? What recession?'' Barbara Gladstone, a Chelsea dealer, said jokingly as she was leaving the salesroom. 
 Although the sale had top-quality art and dealers predicted it would be a success, it went well beyond even the auction house's expectations, bringing in $362 million, above the sale's high $356 million estimate. Only 10 of the 83 works failed to sell, and 18 artist records were set for names ranging from Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni to Tom Wesselmann and Takashi Murakami. 
 By far the most exciting moment of the evening was when ''Triptych,'' Mr. Bacon's comment on his own angst -- a vast (each of the three panels measures about 6 1/2 feet by 5 feet) and densely painted allegorical painting came up for sale. Three telephone bidders went for the painting, which was being sold by the Moueix family, producers of Chateau Petrus wines. Hailing the painting as ''a landmark of the 20th-century canon,'' Sotheby's had estimated it would sell for $70 million.
 (Final prices include the commission paid to Sotheby's: 25 percent of the first $20,000, 20 percent of the next $20,000 to $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
 Two monochrome works by the artist Yves Klein fetched giant prices. Offered from the collection of Walther Lauffs, a German industrialist who died in 1981, and his wife, Helga, ''MG9'' (1962), a gold leaf on panel, proved wildly popular. It carried an estimate of $6 million to $8 million, but Philippe Segalot, a Manhattan dealer, bought the painting for $23.5 million. Mr. Segalot, who spoke French on a cellphone as he bid, also bought ''IKB1,'' a 1960 deep blue canvas that had been expected to bring $5 million to $7 million but fetched $17.4 million. (As soon as the hammer fell on both paintings, speculation started spreading through the salesroom that Mr. Segalot was bidding for Francois Pinault, the luxury goods magnate and owner of Christie's, but Mr. Segalot declined to comment on the buyer for whom he was bidding.) 
 Abstract images have been strong sellers in general this week. Gerhard Richter's ''Abstract Picture'' from 1990, a dreamy canvas of yellows, violets, blues and orange, went for $15.1 million, far above its $5 million to $7 million estimate. The buyer was yet another mystery telephone bidder.
 Marianne Boesky, who for years had represented Mr. Murakami before he jumped to the powerhouse Gagosian Gallery two years ago, was selling one of the artist's outrageous sculptures, ''My Lonesome Cowboy,'' another cast of which is on view as part of the artist's retrospective that opened last month at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The sculpture of the naked cowboy brought another record price, selling to a telephone bidder for $15.1 million, nearly four times its $4 million high estimate.
 Mr. Murakami, wearing his signature baggy blue jeans and his hair in a ponytail, was standing in the back of the salesroom on Wednesday night. People in the audience believed he spent $1.1 million for a 2001 sculpture by the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara, ''Light My Fire,'' a sculpture of a child on a tree stump holding a flame. 
 Three works by the art world titan Robert Rauschenberg were on offer Wednesday night, and his death this week at 82 prompted avid speculation on how they would fare. Historically, auction prices tend to dip immediately after an artist dies in anticipation that long-withheld works will flood the market.
 But ''Overdrive,'' a 1963 silkscreen collage incorporating images of a bird, a stop sign, a one-way street sign and other objects, made yet another record price, bringing $14.6 million. Sotheby's had thought it would make $10 million to $15 million. 
 The evening had one particularly pricey bump: ''Orange, Red, Yellow,'' an abstract Rothko in dense tones from 1956, was expected to fetch $35 million. It was being sold by Heinz Eppler, a philanthropist and collector from New York and Palm Beach, Calif. There were no bids for the painting, which failed to sell. A small triangle by the lot number indicated that Sotheby's had a financial interest in the painting. Before the sale, some contemporary-art dealers said they had heard that Sotheby's had purchased it in partnership with Robert Mnuchin, a Manhattan dealer. Perhaps there were too many red Rothkos for sale this week. On Tuesday night at Christie's, a Rothko in reds and yellows went for $50.4 million, a highlight of that sale.
 But Pop Art was still had its day. A Tom Wesselmann, ''Great American Nude No. 48,'' a 1963 roomlike assemblage that includes a radiator and window illumination, brought another record price, selling for $10.6 million, above its $8 million high estimate. (Another Wesselmann, ''Smoker #9, 1973,'' a painting in the shape of a woman's red lips inhaling smoke, set a record for the artist's work at auction on Tuesday night at Christie's, going for $6.7 million. 
 Jose Mugrabi, the Manhattan dealer, bought Warhol's ''Detail of the Last Supper (Christ 112 Times)'' from 1986 for $9.5 million. Measuring 6 feet by 35 feet, it presents a black grid with the face of Christ outlined in yellow. It seemed like a good price considering the low estimate was $10 million. 
 Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate was a big seller last night. One of Richard Prince's early supporters he was parting with ''Millionaire Nurse,'' from 2002. one of the artist's paintings inspired by the covers of erotic pulp fiction from the 1940s. In this painting, his nurse is wearing a white surgical mask. While it had been estimated to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million, five bidders went for the work which ended up selling for $4.2 million or $4.7 million including Sotheby's fees. (On Tuesday night, Christie's auctioned a Prince nurse painting from the same year for a record $7.3 million.) Even more subtle canvases had their appeal. ''Achrome,'' a sensual, layered white canvas by Piero Manzoni, also brought a record price. Franck Giraud, Mr. Segalot's partner, beat out five bidders to buy the painting for $10.1 million, well above its $6.5 million estimate. 
 After the sale, as the crowds were milling around talking about the evening, everyone seemed stunned by the large sums of money that were spent. ''I don't understand why it did so well if the economy was mediocre,'' said Mr. Mugrabi. ''Maybe people feel safer with art.''

HEADLINE: No Rebates for You

 BODY:
Immigrant restrictionism is stiffing hundreds of thousands of American citizens and legal residents out of their tax-rebate checks. 
 Hard-liners were so intent on keeping the cash out of the hands of undocumented workers that they restricted the rebate to people with Social Security numbers. An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, issued by the Internal Revenue Service to people who pay taxes but do not qualify for Social Security numbers, will not do. If a married couple files jointly, and one spouse is not eligible for the rebate, neither gets the money. 
 This hurts all manner of people who are working and paying taxes: American soldiers stationed abroad who happen to have married foreigners; high-tech immigrants in Silicon Valley and other places whose spouses are not authorized to work or have not yet had their paperwork processed. These are people who are perfectly legal, economically vital and politically inconvenient.
 The government should fix the law so spouses get their money. It is a technical repair that even this Congress should manage. But why shouldn't undocumented immigrants with taxpayer numbers get the cash too? The checks are not rewards for good behavior; they are taxes returned as a means to an end. Illegal immigrants constitute about 5 percent of the work force and earn much less than the native-born. They are just the sort of group the stimulus should be aimed at, if the purpose is to get the most economic bang for every rebate dollar.
 Arguments like that do not fly in the polluted atmosphere of immigration politics, which has produced toxic byproducts so extreme that they make the rebate glitch seem like a mere annoyance.
 Industries across the country are suffering and crops are rotting for lack of workers. Congress is debating a national right-to-work system that could mistakenly ensnare countless Americans and seriously overburden the Social Security bureaucracy. Federal agents and local police officers around the nation are rounding up the usual immigrants.
 Such crackdowns have forced thousands of harmless people into a fast-growing, secretive detention system that is shockingly deficient in basic rights and decent health care. In a disturbing article, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the United States government had injected hundreds of undocumented foreigners with mind-altering drugs to render them docile while they were being deported. This practice violates every imaginable standard of decency, not to mention a few international laws and treaties. 
 Smart efforts to minimize the ill effects of illegal immigration die political deaths, meanwhile, like putting the undocumented into New York State's motor-vehicle database, registered and insured instead of anonymous and unaccounted for. That was also the fate of the Dream Act, a modest bill to ease the way to college for the guiltless children of illegal immigrants so they would not be condemned to dead-end jobs. A model identity-card program in New Haven, hailed for lowering crime, is under legal attack from nativist groups.
 Efforts at deliberate, proportionate and responsible immigration reform provoke paralysis, but restrictionist tactics are greeted with exuberance. The itch to do something about illegal immigration is being scratched. Note to country: Scratching never cured anything.

HEADLINE: Out With Vegas, In With Vamp

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
AT 6 p.m. last Tuesday, the elevator doors opened on the eighth floor of Macy's in Herald Square, exhaling shoppers squished to the shape of sausages and inhaling the echoing sound of a woman's British-accented voice. 
 ''This is our Monte Carlo dot tankini,'' said the woman, Anne Vincent, the director of special events and merchandising for Vogue, as a model wearing a demure Jantzen bathing suit stepped onto a platform in the middle of the swim department. You would have thought it was the 1950s, the scene was so sweetly old-fashioned.
 ''We love all these polka-dot looks because they are great for mixing and matching,'' Ms. Vincent narrated. ''We call it the 'meet and greet' look, where the top meets the bottom.'' The spotted halter top called up images of Norma Jeane Baker (pre Marilyn Monroe) or Janet Leigh sunning atop a float in the Rose Bowl parade. It was just saying howdy-do to a high-waist black bikini bottom. How civilized.
 As swimsuit season approaches, women are discovering that many of this summer's suits represent a sharp turnaround from the crass arrangement of string and sequins that in recent years has made the Hamptons shore look like a Vegas sideshow. 
 Probably for the first time since Lindsay Lohan was born, fashion designers, from the high-end likes of Miuccia Prada and Stella McCartney to mainstream classics like Jantzen, have taken a more refined approach to swimwear, emphasizing one-piece looks, halter tops, high-waist boy shorts and ruffles and ruching as camouflaging details.
 Jantzen's most popular look this season is a sassily ruched one-piece, updated in lifeguard red and now called the Vamp, which would seem to encourage accessorizing with a cigarette and a martini more than a Pilatesstick.
 ''The extra coverage feels really right,'' said the designer Shoshanna Gruss. ''What more people are realizing is that these shapes are beautiful, and more women can wear these. More is more.''
 Now one could argue that the covered-up direction in swimwear has something to do with the tanking economy (ahem, tankini), or perhaps it is a precautionary statement against too much sun exposure. 
 More likely, such looks have come around again for the same reason they were popular a half-century ago. As the Macy's window display of historic Jantzen suits would suggest, leaving a little to the imagination imparts a lot of allure. Care for an example? A black lace suit from 1954 was called the Man Trap.

HEADLINE: French Court Convicts 7 for Helping to Send Youths to Join Jihadist Fight in Iraq

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A Paris court sentenced seven men to prison terms of up to seven years on Wednesday for helping to send French youths to fight alongside insurgents in Iraq, ending a four-year investigation into a jihadist recruitment ring. 
 The men -- five French, one Algerian and one Moroccan -- were tried on charges including criminal association with intent to commit terrorism. 
 Jean-Julien Xavier-Rolai, the prosecutor, had accused the group of sending about a dozen young Frenchmen to join Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia who was killed in an American airstrike in 2006, after funneling them through radical religious establishments in Syria and Egypt. 
 At a six-day trial in March, most of the men testified that they had either been to Iraq after the 2003 American-led invasion or had planned to go, but they denied having been part of a network that recruited insurgents. 
 The group's leader, Farid Benyettou, 27, was given a six-year-sentence. Mr. Benyettou, a former janitor and self-taught preacher, was accused of recruiting fighters from Paris mosques and justifying suicide bombings in private sermons given in his family apartment. 
 Boubakeur al-Hakim, 24, who had fought in Iraq and was accused of running a way station in Syria for French youths headed for Iraq, was sentenced to seven years. So was Said Abdellah, 39, a Moroccan citizen. 
 Nacer Eddine Mettai, a 39-year old Algerian national, was ordered jailed for four years for forging passports. Three others -- one who fought in Iraq and two who had been planning to -- were given lighter sentences. 
 The prosecution had asked for sentences of three to eight years. 
 Along with three young French Muslims who died fighting against American forces in Iraq, the seven men were members of what has become known as the ''19th Arrondissement cell,'' named after the working-class, heavily immigrant Paris neighborhood where most of them lived. The cell had been under surveillance for at least a year before the seven men were arrested in early 2005. 
 Judge Jacqueline Rebeyrotte, who announced the convictions and sentences, called Mr. Benyettou the ideologue of a group ''whose objective was to send young people from the 19th Arrondissement of Paris to fight in Iraq.'' 
 The case received widespread media attention in France, home to an estimated five million Muslims, many from former colonies in North Africa. Memories of a series of terrorist attacks by Islamist networks in the mid-1990s are still fresh, and high rates of unemployment and crime in neighborhoods like the 19th Arrondissement and poor suburbs ringing big French cities have intensified concerns that disenchanted Muslim youths may be vulnerable to anti-Western rhetoric and recruitment by militant Islamist cells. 
 When the Paris cell was broken up in early 2005, investigators worried about what they called a new terrorist threat created by the Iraq war. Since then, fears of European jihadist fighters returning from Iraq to carry out attacks in their home countries have receded. 
 In sealed court documents and in open testimony presented during the trial of the seven members of the Paris cell, for example, prosecutors presented no evidence that any of the seven men intended to carry out terrorist attacks against France. 
 The Iraq war continues to fuel hatred, extremism and terrorism, the officials said. But now investigators are more concerned about North Africa and Pakistan as regions with a growing potential to recruit and radicalize young Muslims. 
 The men convicted and sentenced Wednesday have spent three years in pretrial detention, time that will be subtracted from their sentences.

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
With the downfall of Gov. Eliot Spitzer and an approaching state election that has senators of both parties desperate for support, labor unions are flexing their muscles in the capital to a degree not seen in years. 
 The unions' push has set up an early test for Gov. David A. Paterson, a longtime friend of labor who is trying to refashion himself as a cost cutter in the face of the state's coming fiscal crisis. 
 The unions want their pensions sweetened and their health benefits set in stone. They want local school districts to continue to increase their budgets without interference from the state, and they want to force some nonprofit groups to pay higher wages. 
 They have already scored a victory by stripping language out of state law that linked decisions on teachers' tenure to their students' performance on standardized tests.
 The unions are moving aggressively on their legislative agenda in part because Mr. Paterson is viewed as a relatively weak governor, whereas Mr. Spitzer battled some of the most powerful unions in the state. In fact, there is no effective counterweight to the unions' clout, given the limited influence of the state's business lobby and how close the state's top Republican, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, is to labor leaders. 
 ''Labor is in a good place,'' said Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers, one of the most powerful interest groups in the capital. ''The atmosphere in Albany, for a variety of reasons, has been somewhat chaotic and combative, and that's allowed us to use our ability to be consistent to our advantage,'' he added. ''It's an odd place to be, but we're adding stability to a confusing situation.''
 The governor, a Harlem Democrat, said in an interview Tuesday that he would resist any increased spending in the weeks ahead. ''Everyone is probably going to be mad at me,'' he said. 
 ''I understand what labor's intent is; it's to fight for the best contracts for workers,'' Mr. Paterson added, but said, ''Someone has to present fiscal reality to the Legislature, the advocates and a lot of otherwise good causes.''
 ''I am going to look at these bills very critically,'' he said, and added that since the state faces a $21 billion deficit over the next three years, ''I am not going to back down.''
 Many political observers wonder whether the genial governor will have the strength to deliver on his rhetoric, or whether the Legislature will override him if he tries to veto its acts. 
 Mr. Paterson sided with the teachers' union last month in restoring planned budget cuts to primary education and sided with them on tenure as well. He has clashed with them in recent weeks, however, by significantly cutting the state's higher education budget and restricting the State University of New York's ability to spend tuition paid by its students. 
 In part because of the abruptness of his ascendance to the governor's job, Mr. Paterson has not finished assembling his staff and formulating his agenda. The resulting uncertainty worries fiscal conservatives.
 ''There's a real danger that in the current situation there's a bigger void than usual, and the unions are the 800-pound gorilla who will fill it,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy at the Manhattan Institute. 
 ''Their hand is stronger than it's ever been,'' he said, adding, ''The Legislature might be more cowed by the unions than they have ever been.''
 Fighting the unions could be costly. In 2004, when Mr. Paterson was Senate minority leader, he received roughly $230,000 from unions, either for his own campaign or for those of Senate Democrats; that is a substantial amount for the leader of the minority party to attract. 
 Unions have long had an outsize influence in New York. Porous laws allow them to put millions of dollars into campaigns. The powerful hospital workers' union, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, is one of the largest contributors to Senate Republicans, creating a close political alliance that helped them last year when Mr. Spitzer took them on in a bitter budget fight. The union had more than $5 million in campaign expenditures in 2006, according to the state's Board of Elections. 
 There are about six weeks remaining in the legislative session, and labor groups are pushing a long list of proposals, some of which could be costly.
 The teachers' union has already outlined its firm opposition to any proposal to put a ceiling on local property tax increases; such a proposal is expected from a special commission due to issue a report next week. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. wants legislation forcing employers to grant paid family leave -- an idea Mr. Paterson supports -- and to limit nurses' overtime. 
 The Civil Service Employees Association is backing a bill that would prohibit municipalities from cutting their retirees' medical benefits. 
 Stephen J. Acquario, the executive director of the New York Association of Counties, said the measure would lead to ''a collective bargaining quagmire.'' Danny Donohue, the president of the union, said it would ensure ''that localities live up to their responsibility to retirees.''
 There are also perennial efforts to enhance benefits. District Council 37, an umbrella group of municipal unions in New York City, has been backing a bill that would give members a second chance to buy into an early-retirement plan. City officials estimate that the plan would cost them $200 million annually; lawmakers say it would have no cost. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked the governor to reject the measure. ''If he's right about the numbers,'' Mr. Paterson said, ''then we can't afford to do it.''
 Union lobbying has tied up legislation that would reauthorize local industrial development agencies that help finance capital projects by nonprofit groups. More than $2 billion worth of construction projects have been halted by the delay, including new hospitals and schools. Unions want to require recipients of the tax-exempt financing to pay a ''prevailing wage'' for any jobs created with the aid. 
 Business groups argue that in economically struggling areas, the wage requirement would deter businesses from seeking the tax breaks. 
 ''Obviously, labor is very strong in Albany,'' said Brian T. McMahon, executive director of the New York State Economic Development Council. ''But many of their agenda items, we think, have hurt economic development.''

HEADLINE: House Passes Farm Bill By a Veto-Proof Margin

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ignoring a veto threat from President Bush, who says he wants to sharply limit government subsidies to farmers at a time of near-record commodity prices and soaring global demand for grain, the House on Wednesday approved a five-year, $307 billion farm bill with a solid bipartisan majority. 
 The House voted 318 to 106 -- well above the two-thirds needed to hand Mr. Bush the second veto override of his presidency -- with 100 Republicans joining the Democratic majority in favor. 
 The Senate was expected to follow suit with wide bipartisan support on Thursday, sending Mr. Bush a bill that he described this week as bloated and expensive and said ''resorts to a variety of gimmicks.'' 
 The bill includes a $10.3 billion increase in spending on nutrition programs, including food stamps, that supporters called ''historic,'' as well as increases for rural development and land conservation programs. 
 It also extends many existing federal subsidies that the president and other critics say are difficult to justify in such flush times for agriculture producers. 
 Mr. Bush had sought an adjusted gross income limit of $200,000 above which farmers could not qualify for any subsidy payments. The bill passed by the House, however, allows farm income of up to $750,000 and nonfarm income of $500,000 per individual. 
 That $750,000 limit applies to only one subsidy program, so-called direct payments that are disbursed based on land acreage and regardless of current market conditions or even whether the land is still actively farmed. 
 While Mr. Bush has long called for curtailing subsidy programs, the farm bill is viewed as vital legislation both across rural America and in impoverished urban centers. 
 The willingness of a majority of House Republicans to break with the White House reflected both the strong support for the bill and a growing alarm among many lawmakers about their election prospects in November. 
 Mr. Bush himself made a similar political calculation in 2002, ultimately deciding to sign the farm bill that year even though he had strongly opposed it. A senior official at the time said the White House had concluded it would be ''political suicide'' in the midterm elections to veto the bill that year. 
 This year, though, Mr. Bush seems intent on refusing to sign the bill. He has criticized it for months, and on Wednesday he issued a forceful veto threat. He urged Congress to approve a one-year extension of current law, which he said would be better than adopting the new measure. 
 ''Today's farm economy is very strong, and that is something to celebrate,'' he said. ''It is also an appropriate time to better target subsidies and put forth real reform.'' The bill, he said, ''spends too much and fails to reform farm programs for the future.'' 
 On Wednesday evening, Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman, reiterated the president's opposition. ''With its massive expansion of subsidies, special interest earmarks and budget gimmicks, this bill is wrong for American taxpayers,'' he said. ''The president will veto it.'' 
 But in debate on the House floor on Wednesday, some Republicans were just as forceful in pledging to defy Mr. Bush should he use his veto pen. 
 ''I know there is a veto threat from the White House,'' said Representative Robin Hayes, Republican of North Carolina. ''If the president decides to follow through I will be there voting to override him because we need this update for our nation's policies.'' 
 Should it reach that point, it would be only the second veto override of Mr. Bush's presidency. The first was in November when Congress overwhelmingly rejected the president's veto of a $23.2 billion water resources bill that authorized popular projects around the country. 
 In the House chamber on Wednesday, longtime critics of farm subsidies in both parties echoed Mr. Bush's complaints about the current bill. 
 ''Where's the beef?'' asked Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, standing in the House floor next to a poster showing sharp increases in commodity prices -- 126 percent for wheat, 57 percent for soybeans, 45 percent for corn. ''Where's the real reform?'' he said. 
 Some critics have also pointed to earmarks in the bill, including a tax break for racehorse owners added by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and $170 million to benefit the salmon industry inserted by House Democrats from the West Coast. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, in her own speech on the House floor, responded directly to Mr. Kind, whose proposals for drastically overhauling farm subsidies she had supported before the Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006. 
 Although the legislation is universally known as the farm bill, it actually directs far more money to feeding the poor than it does to helping farmers -- about $209 billion for nutrition programs like food stamps, according to the Congressional Budget Office, compared with $35 billion for agricultural commodity programs. 
 In her speech, Ms. Pelosi praised the bill and said the increase on food stamps alone was reason to support it. She said that while more change would be needed, the bill made important improvements to farm policy. 
 ''With this legislation we will help families facing high food prices,'' she said. 
 At a news conference, the Agriculture Committee chairman, Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, said he expected the bill to reach the president by May 20 and a veto override to be approved before Congress leaves for a Memorial Day recess.
 Both Mr. Peterson and the committee's senior Republican, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, said the bill represented a strong bipartisan compromise. 
 ''I am very pleased that both parties cast a majority of votes for this farm bill,'' Mr. Goodlatte said. ''We don't have a two-to-one majority. We have a three-to-one majority.''
 He added: ''I believe that we now have the opportunity to say to America that this is a farm bill that truly does assure that we continue to have the safest, most affordable, most abundant food supply in the world. We have addressed the needs of America's farmers and ranchers.''

HEADLINE: Europe Expanding Inquiry On Availability of Drugs

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
European antitrust investigators are expanding their inquiry into the pharmaceutical market to determine whether companies are blocking generic drug makers from getting less-expensive medicines to market quickly. 
 Lawyers and European Union officials said that Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner, was also trying to determine whether efforts to block competitors by extending drug patents were distracting companies from developing new medicines, which have been slow in coming to market in recent years. 
 Investigators, who have already questioned about 100 companies, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis, are turning to about 80 medical organizations, including associations of doctors, patients and pharmacies, and government agencies that set the prices of prescription drugs. 
 Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for Ms. Kroes, said antitrust officials were ''not yet drawing any preliminary conclusions from the pharmaceutical sector inquiry as regards legislative changes or anything else because it is far too early to do so.''
 If Ms. Kroes determines that drug companies are using unfair practices, she could eventually impose fines -- as has already happened to AstraZeneca -- and recommend changes in the way the industry operates.
 ''There is clearly a block in the system,'' said Greg Perry, the director general of the European Generic Medicines Association. ''Access to the market in Europe still is less speedy than in the United States.''
 Generics, which cost less than brand-name drugs, make up 42 percent of the market by volume in Europe, compared with 63 percent in the United States, said Mr. Perry, whose organization includes the three largest generics companies in Europe: Ratiopharm, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Sandoz.
 The inquiry could also help raise the profile of Ms. Kroes, who is expected to seek a second term as Europe's antitrust chief next year. Although she oversaw part of the case against Microsoft and has taken a tough line with electricity producers, her candidacy would be strengthened if she could point to another money-saving victory in an area of concern to consumers and governments. 
 Some health and consumer groups also argue that more competition would pressure drug companies to develop more new medicines and rely less on extending patent protection.
 ''These companies should be spending money on discovering drugs for diseases that still go uncured,'' said David Ortega, who is in charge of competition issues at the Spanish consumers' organization O.C.U. 
 The European investigation began in January with surprise inspections at several companies making both brand-name and generic medicines. 
 Ms. Kroes then requested expert help from the European Patent Office, which operates separately from the European Commission. The patent office agreed to send an official to work with investigators.
 Members of the drug industry and lawyers said they were surprised by the use of dawn raids -- the first time such tactics were used in this type of antitrust investigation -- and by the focus on patents, which the industry relies on to recoup the costs of research and development.
 Dozens of pharmaceutical companies operating in Europe have had to respond to 42-page questionnaires, which seek information on how they managed patents and conducted marketing campaigns from 2000 to 2007.
 Brian Ager, the director general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, said drug companies were worried. 
 Generics, Mr. Ager said, commonly reach the market in Europe within three months after patents expire. But generics manufacturers in Europe tend to market a narrower selection of best-selling medicines compared with their American counterparts because of price controls in Europe, he said.
 ''Let's hope antitrust officials reach a better understanding of our industry,'' Mr. Ager said. 
 So far, analysts see little immediate threat to drug company profits. One reason, said Luisa Hector, an analyst in London for Lehman Brothers, is that the companies were more aggressive in the United States than in Europe about protecting drugs by marketing newer formulas of older drugs.
 Even so, if investigators discover abuses in Europe, it would not be the first time.
 In 2005 regulators fined AstraZeneca 60 million euros for giving misleading information to several patent offices to extend the life of a blockbuster antacid drug, Losec, and delaying the entry of generic drugs. Last year, regulators began an antitrust case against a German company, Boehringer Ingelheim, for suspected misuse of the patent system to exclude competition in the market for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drugs.
 Antitrust officials are already considering recommending changes to European legislation or to the way current legislation is enforced to chip away at the control pharmaceutical companies exert over some medicines, although they have not said what those changes would be.
 ''Practices that long have been widespread in the industry may need to change when E.U. antitrust officials clarify what kinds of behavior could infringe antitrust rules,'' said Stephen Kinsella, an antitrust partner with the law firm of Sidley Austin in Brussels.
 Mr. Perry of the generics association said any changes should aim to make it easier for generics companies to place cheaper drugs on the market as soon as patents expire and to discourage big pharmaceutical companies from suing makers of generic drugs for suspected patent violations that later turn out to be unfounded.
 Investigators also appear to be turning their inquiry to generics companies, asking whether they have accepted payments from makers of brand-name drugs as part of patent litigation, perhaps in exchange for introducing a medicine later than originally intended.

HEADLINE: Appliance Division May Be Sold By G.E.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
General Electric is planning to sell its appliance division, one of the oldest businesses in the conglomerate's 120-year history, people briefed on the proposal said Wednesday. 
 A sale of the unit, which makes refrigerators, microwaves and washer-dryers, among other items, could fetch at least $5 billion, these people said. G.E. and its investment bank, Goldman Sachs, have been laying the groundwork for an auction over the last few weeks.
 The sale would mark the end of a brand of household products that made General Electric a fixture in American homes over the last century. 
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, its embattled chief executive, has been trying to refashion General Electric in the face of widespread calls to break up one of America's largest companies. That mission has taken on greater urgency with the credit squeeze and the slumping economy, which have affected many of G.E.'s businesses.
 The appliance unit, which helped make G.E. an American icon, may end up in foreign hands. The division, based in Louisville, Ky., has faced increased pressure in recent years from Chinese manufacturers, which have been growing at double-digit rates thanks in part to significantly lower costs. 
 Asian manufacturers are expected to be particularly drawn to the division, seeking to take advantage of G.E.'s widely known brand name as they try to become global businesses. Lenovo, the Chinese electronics company, successfully acquired I.B.M.'s personal computer division in 2004, in part to help establish itself on the world stage.
 Wall Street bankers are rushing to lay claim to potential bidders for the division. Among the expected suitors are Haier of China, which bid on Maytag two years ago; LG Electronics and Samsung, both of South Korea; Bosch of Germany; Electrolux of Sweden, which makes Sears's Kenmore line of appliances; and Controladora Mabe, a G.E. partner based in Mexico. 
 As part of a potential sale, G.E. is likely to hand over a license to use the G.E. brand for a short period of time, the people briefed on the proposal said. After the initial license for using the General Electric brand expires, the buyer of the appliance unit would be allowed to continue to use the Monogram and Profile badges. 
 The arrangement is similar to the way Lenovo held onto the I.B.M. badge for several years before using its own.
 The news was first reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal on its Web site.
 G.E.'s once high-flying stock price has fallen 20.5 percent during Mr. Immelt's seven-year tenure, and many analysts and investors have called for transformational changes at the corporate behemoth. Last year, it sold its plastics business to Sabic, the big Saudi Arabian industrial company, for $11.6 billion.
 Mr. Immelt's critics long have urged him to consider more unit sales, including the appliance unit, NBC Universal and GE Money, the company's consumer finance unit. The company has focused on higher-growth technology businesses of late, moving out of consumer-oriented operations. G.E.'s light bulbs, however, continue to be made by the company's lighting division. 
 That critical chorus grew louder and more insistent last month when G.E.'s first-quarter earnings badly missed analysts' estimates and its own projections. 
 G.E.'s stunning announcement, made more notable by its status as a barometer of the economy, shook Wall Street's confidence: the company's shares fell 13 percent that day, its biggest one-day loss in two decades. Even worse, for a company that prided itself on meeting expectations, G.E. was forced to cut its projected earnings growth for this year to 5 percent from 10 percent.
 The appliance business generated $7 billion in revenue last year, only a small fraction of G.E.'s $173 billion in total annual revenue, but divorcing it from the company would carry great historical import. Begun in 1907 as a maker of cooking and heating appliances, the appliance division has since grown to manufacture a broad range of products. Among its firsts are the room air-conditioner (1930), the combined washer-dryer unit (1954) and the toaster oven (1956).
 As of last year, the appliances unit had about 13,000 of G.E.'s 327,000 employees.

HEADLINE: Edwards Finally Chooses a Favorite: It's Obama

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Reporting was contributed by Julie Bosman and Patrick Healy in New York and Jeff Zeleny and John M. Broder in Washington.

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 

 BODY:
John Edwards gave his long-awaited endorsement to Senator Barack Obama on Wednesday, bolstering Mr. Obama's efforts to rally the Democratic Party around his candidacy and offering potential help in his efforts to win over working class white voters in the general election. 
 ''The Democratic voters in America have made their choice, and so have I,'' Mr. Edwards told a roaring crowd of more than 12,000 people here in the Van Andel Arena, on a day when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was trying to capitalize on her victory on Tuesday in West Virginia and convince superdelegates and contributors that she still has a chance to capture the Democratic nomination.
 ''There is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America -- not two -- and that man is Barack Obama,'' Mr. Edwards said at an event that resembled the closing night of a party convention, with the two men standing arm in arm and waving as the crowd chanted ''Yes we can!''
 Mr. Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina who dropped his bid for the nomination in January, said Mr. Obama represented hope and reconciliation to a nation buffeted by war and economic distress. 
 His endorsement came after victories by Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states with large working class populations indicated potential weaknesses along racial and class divides -- weaknesses that Mrs. Clinton has tried to exploit to convince superdelegates, contributors and voters in the remaining contests that she has a better chance to beat Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, in the fall.
 Mr. Edwards could potentially help Mr. Obama with that group. A Southerner, he had directed his candidacy at the same white and working class voters Mr. Obama is trying to woo.
 ''I'll just point out the obvious,'' Mr. Edwards told one audience when he was campaigning in Iowa last year. ''In the last -- can I do the math, 45, 50 years -- what is it, the last two Democrats who actually got elected president? Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton. Both of them talk like I do.''
 The value of endorsements is often unclear, and Mr. Obama was not greatly helped when Caroline Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other big-name Democrats supported him earlier this year. But for Wednesday, at least, the endorsement, televised live on cable news and on ABC News, put the focus on Mr. Obama and distracted from several television interviews that Mrs. Clinton had done earlier in the day to make her case for her staying in the race.
 Mr. Edwards spent several minutes praising Mrs. Clinton, which was met by loud boos by the largely white crowd who had filled the arena with no knowledge of the endorsement to come.
 He called her a capable senator and a stalwart campaigner who deserved respect for tenacity and service. ''We are a stronger party because Hillary Clinton is a Democrat, we are a stronger country because of her years of public service, and we're going to have a stronger presidential nominee in the fall because of her work.'' 
 His endorsement went on to be as much about Mr. Obama as it was a populist cry for universal health care, ending poverty, better schools and an end to the war in Iraq. But the drama and excitement of the moment was reserved for Mr. Obama, with Mr. Edwards's endorsement meant to send a sharp and clear signal that the long race is nearly over.
 David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, said there were no plans yet for advertisements featuring Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Obama told reporters last night that they had not solidified plans to campaign together. The endorsement, sealed in a telephone call initiated by Mr. Obama on Tuesday evening, came one day after Mr. Obama suffered a 41-point loss to Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia, and where polls of voters gave the strongest indication yet that Mr. Obama's race could be a factor in the fall. 
 Asked about the loss, and what it said about his strength with working class white voters, Mr. Obama pointed to polls showing him running strongly against Mr. McCain nationally. But he acknowledged that Mr. Edwards could be help, ''I have no doubt that John Edwards could be extremely helpful to us campaigning in every demographic.''
 Mrs. Clinton's campaign played down the endorsement with a terse statement from its chairman, Terry McAuliffe: ''We respect John Edwards,'' it read. ''But as the voters of West Virginia showed last night, this thing is far from over.''
 Missing from the event was Elizabeth Edwards, Mr. Edwards's wife, who has been a passionate proponent of universal health care. The Edwardses were said to be split on the endorsement, with Mrs. Edwards said to favor Mrs. Clinton because of her preference for parts of the Clinton health care plan. 
 Mr. Obama, who accepted Mr. Edwards's endorsement with praise for the speech and the man, also praised Mrs. Edwards and her commitment to health care. Asked if she would endorse him, he said, ''I would not speak for Elizabeth.''
 As the campaign proceeds, aides to both men said, Mr. Edwards is sure to be included on a short-list of vice presidential prospects. Mr. Edwards has played down any aspirations for an administration role. In an interview in January, he said he would not accept a vice presidential spot or a Cabinet position. ''No, absolutely not,'' he said, shaking his head emphatically. But privately, he told aides that he would consider the role of vice president, and favored the position of attorney general.
 Joe Trippi, a former senior adviser to Mr. Edwards, said he believed Mr. Edwards would now help Mr. Obama as he tries to court blue-collar voters in states like Kentucky. Mr. Obama has been busy courting those voters. On Wednesday in Michigan he toured a Chrysler factory in Sterling Heights, spoke with autoworkers in Warren, and ended his day here in Grand Rapids. 
 Mrs. Clinton spent Wednesday making her case for the nomination in a round of network and cable interviews. In response to a question from Wolf Blitzer of CNN, Mrs. Clinton also said that it was ''probably right'' that she made a foolish comment when she claimed that more ''white Americans'' were supporting her than Mr. Obama. She was responding to a remark by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, that her original ''white Americans'' comment was ''the dumbest thing'' she could have said.
 Mrs. Clinton also spent two hours Wednesday at her Washington home with about 40 members of her national and New York fund-raising team. She did not urge the group to raise more money or make specific pledges, though her campaign chairman, Mr. McAuliffe, stressed the need for more donations at a separate meeting with the fund-raisers, several donors said. 
 While some of the participants said later that they were skeptical she could win the nomination, they added that neither they nor anyone else in the room would abandon Mrs. Clinton as long as she is in the nomination fight.

HEADLINE: For Movies, A Summer That's Shy On Sequels

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Hollywood's summer movies promise to be a little fresher, more original and funnier than usual. And that could be a problem for an industry that has done well lately by peddling the familiar. 
 ''Iron Man'' and ''Speed Racer'' -- the first two entries in the big-ticket season of May through August -- both point to the challenge facing a business obsessed with comparisons: last summer's crop of films, driven by an unusual confluence of sure-shot sequels, was so big that this year's more inventive pictures, whether they win or lose individually, may come up short as a group. 
 As hot as ''Iron Man'' is, with domestic ticket sales of about $180 million in its first week and a half, it still trails last year's summer season kick-off movie, ''Spider Man 3,'' by about 25 percent in the same time. Meanwhile ''Speed Racer'' may have crashed at the box office last weekend with less than $20 million in ticket sales, but it looks great when compared with ''Georgia Rule,'' the Lindsay Lohan bomb that took in less than $7 million on an equivalent weekend last year. 
 Nonetheless neither ''Speed Racer'' nor the Ashton Kutcher-Cameron Diaz comedy ''What Happens in Vegas'' appears likely to rank with the 17 movies that took in more than $100 million during last year's robust summer. That season's $4.2 billion in total sales was about 43 percent of the industry's full-year box-office take of $9.7 billion and one of the best summers on record, according to the consulting company Media By Numbers. 
 Repeating last year's performance looks like a long shot, given the rest of this summer's lineup. This batch is light on sequels, gloomy in spots (as with ''The Dark Knight'') and heavy on comedies. But even those comedies often have dark undercurrents, as with the combat-theme ''Tropic Thunder,'' an August release directed by Ben Stiller, or the stoner crime caper ''Pineapple Express'' with Seth Rogen.
 The mix may not perfectly match the mood of an audience looking for refuge from election campaigns and high-priced gas, said Peter Sealey, a former Columbia Pictures marketing executive who is now an adjunct professor of marketing at Claremont Graduate University's Drucker School. ''If the schedule weren't set three years in advance, they'd have a different slate,'' Mr. Drucker said.
 Even if these new offerings connect as intended, they face some tough comparisons. 
 Will Smith may be one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, but ''Hancock,'' a Fourth of July weekend release in which he stars as a booze-swilling superhero who hates his job, could match his recent hit ''I Am Legend'' and still fall short of the $319 million in ticket sales for ''Transformers,'' the toy-based action movie that filled the same slot last year.
 Of the four films that took in over $300 million at the summer box office last year, the other three -- ''Spider-Man 3,''''Shrek the Third'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' -- were the third pictures in established series. And seven other sequels, including ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,''''The Bourne Ultimatum'' and ''Live Free or Die Hard,'' were among the films that topped $100 million at the box office.
 This year only four conventional sequels to predecessors that took in $100 million or more show up on the studio summer slates. They are ''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'' on May 16; ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' on May 22; ''The Dark Knight,'' a Batman film, on July 18; and ''The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor'' on Aug. 1.
 To match last summer's top four movies, each of this year's sequels would have to outperform its own predecessors. But even with the help of ticket price inflation ''Indiana Jones'' is the only one that appears a relatively safe gamble to hit the $300 million mark.
 Among this year's originals, ''Wall-E,'' from Pixar and Disney, is a tricky bet: its Chaplinesque silent sequences must hold the same audience that brought its talkier cousin ''Ratatouille'' $206 million last summer.
 To crack the $200 million level -- seven films did it last summer -- ''The Happening,'' from M. Night Shyamalan would need the kind of ticket sales he has not seen since ''Signs'' in 2002. ''Kung Fu Panda,'' from DreamWorks Animation, could do as well as ''Madagascar,'' the company's best-performing movie to date outside the ''Shrek'' series, with $193 million in ticket sales, and barely edge out last summer's ''The Simpsons Movie,'' which took in $183 million.
 As for the summer's dozen or so comedies, none are likely to score as big as the fantasy sequels that dominated last year, if only because they are poised to crowd each other out. That is not good news, as comedies, which are riskier bets in overseas markets, are especially reliant on the United States sales. The most successful movie comedies have made their money over the long haul, as did ''Night at the Museum,'' which took in $250 million at the box office over six months after its release in December of 2006.
 This summer two of the most anticipated comedies -- ''The Love Guru,'' with Mike Myers, and ''Get Smart,'' with Steve Carell -- are scheduled for the same date, June 20. They are bracketed by ''You Don't Mess With the Zohan,'' with Adam Sandler, two weeks earlier, and ''Meet Dave,'' with Eddie Murphy, three weeks after. They will be followed by an August full of comedies, including ''Tropic Thunder,'' ''Pineapple Express'' and ''The House Bunny.''
 Even ''Sex and the City,'' a long-awaited movie based on the HBO series about four friends well shod and footloose in New York, may find it hard to keep up with the comparisons. The film, set for release on May 28, has registered strong online interest, raising hopes that it could become a hit on the order, of, say, ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' which took in $125 million when it was released in June of 2006.
 But that would still fall short of ''Knocked Up,'' which opened on the equivalent weekend to ''Sex and the City'' last summer. The geek-meets-girl comedy never made it to No. 1 and still weighed in with a tough-to-beat $149 million.
 If nothing else, Hollywood executives can take cheer that the comparisons should get easier as the fall-winter awards season draws near. 
 Last year's Oscar films -- a particularly dark lot, with movies like the best picture nominee ''There Will Be Blood,'' about a relentless oil magnate, and the Oscar winner ''No Country for Old Men,'' about a manic killer -- were relatively soft at the box office. With a little luck and a few crowd pleasers, the business could look good, by comparison, at year's end.

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students share opinions about the spirit and philosophy of the do-it-yourself movement and profile participants to assess the impact of their work on the way people think and live. 

 BODY:
Overview: In this lesson, students share opinions about the spirit and philosophy of the do-it-yourself movement and profile participants to assess the impact of their work on the way people think and live.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour.
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Share opinions about why people create do-it-yourself projects.
2. Learn about the Maker Faire by reading and discussing the article "This, From That."
3. Investigate the philosophy and examples of the do-in-yourself movement.
4. Individually select and profile one significant tinkerer of the past or present.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
-classroom board
-computer and project set up to show the Times Interactive piece, "D.I.Y. Dreams," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/13/science/20080513_MAKER_AUDIO.html
-Internet access
-resources for investigating do-it-yourself tinkerers and projects like magazines, newsletters and computers with Internet access
-copies of the article "This, From That," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080515thursday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now: Before class, set up a computer with Internet access and a projector to show the Times Interactive, "D.I.Y. Dreams," found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/13/science/20080513_MAKER_AUDIO.html. After students are settled, have them watch the video interviews.
Write the following prompt on the board to initiate a discussion about what they watched (if the technology is not available for showing the interactive feature, print color images of the objects to distribute to students): "In an age where just about every human activity can be performed in a virtual world, [the participants in the annual Maker Faire] choose to get their hands dirty."
Ask students to share their opinions about what they have seen. Why do they think people might want to make crafts, get their hands dirty and generally get involved in the do-it-yourself movement? What examples can they point to of inventors or tinkerers who developed products that have changed the lives of future generations? What examples can they point to of craftspeople whose work had or continues to have some personal or wide-reaching impact?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "This, From That" http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080515thursday.html, focusing on the following questions:
a. How do participants in the Maker Faire describe their motivations for developing their projects?
b. Why might the do-it-yourself movement be considered a response to the complexity of contemporary devices (phones, televisions and cars) and behavior (online shopping and networking)?
c. Why do some say that D.I.Y. is an important American tradition?
d. Who are some famous tinkerers in American history and what did they invent?
e. How did their work impact the way people currently think and live?
f. What distinction does Tim O'Reilly make between hobbyist hacking and computer hacking?
g. What do you think are the commercial possibilities for these projects?
h. What social significance might they represent?
i. Which of the projects featured in the article would you like to experience first hand? Why?
3. Explain to the class that they will work in groups to investigate the influence of the current do-it-yourself movement on various aspects of contemporary life.
As a class, work with students to brainstorm the following ideas about tinkering, hobbies and the do-it-yourself philosophy. Read them the following quote from the article: "It's about having a deeper connection with the stuff around you, and through that with the people around you." Then ask students the following questions for general discussion:
-How do you or people you know personalize the products you use? Look around the room and see if there are any examples here. Prompt students to consider their clothes, backpacks and notebooks.
-What was your impulse in making those changes?
-Why might it be more interesting than just taking it the way the company made it?
-Do you feel more connected to the object as a result of the change you made? Might others feel connected to you as a result of your personal expression? Explain your answers.
You might also share some examples of the do-it-yourself spirit throughout history (like the punk rock movement, zines, independent printing presses, pirate radio, blogs, cable access television, the arts and crafts movement, early personal computers, handcrafted vehicles, the slow food movement and home renovations) and those that have been profiled in The New York Times (like in the article "Knife Skills: Creating Feasts for the Eyes," found at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/dining/14carve.html?ref=dining and "Steampunk Moves Between 2 Worlds," found at http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/fashion/08PUNK.html?scp=1&sq=steampunk&st=nyt).
Then arrange the class into small groups and assign each a section of the newspaper as follows:
-House and Home
-Automobiles
-Food/Dining
-Arts
-Style
-Sports
-Technology
-Business
Provide sections of the newspaper from the past several weeks for students to use to conduct their investigations. Prompt them to work in their groups to respond to the following guiding questions based on their newspaper investigations, additional resources and their own experiences:
-How would you describe the spirit or philosophy of the do-it-yourself movement?
-In what ways might tinkerers be seen to get their hands dirty or create a handmade version of objects or activities in this field?
-What examples do you see in this newspaper section about do-it-yourself tinkerers in action?
-If there are no examples in the newspaper, where else in the culture might you find examples?
-How does the work of the tinkerers and craftspeople you read about respond to high-tech aspects of contemporary culture?
-Do you think that any of the inventions or crafts you learned about today might change the way future generations live or experience the world? Explain your answer.

Readymade Magazine, http://readymademag.com
Toward the end of class, have each group share one noteworthy do-it-yourself tinkerer or project.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students identity one person in American history, their local community or online who they feel embodies the spirit and philosophy of "D.I.Y." They might, for example, profile a local gardener, a historical inventor like Benjamin Franklin or someone they learned about in their classroom investigations.
Have students prepare newspaper articles featuring their respective subjects. Their choices should include visuals (either for a print or online paper), explanatory text and demonstrate how their selected subject embodies the do-it-yourself spirit.
In the next class, students will present visual demonstrations of their respective subjects' work. Advise them to consider how they might use 3-dimensional models, diagrams, computer animation or posters to aid their presentations. Also, provide them with options. Allow them to present a demonstration of the original object or one that incorporates their own modifications. For those who are particularly industrious, they can offer updated versions that demonstrate their own tinkering spirits.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Have you ever made anything that you think embodies the spirit of the do-it-yourself movement? If so, what was it and why did you do so? If not, do you feel motivated to start now? Why or why not?
-What do you think is the most significant invention made by a historic tinkerer? Why?
-What do you think could be the most significant invention of the next generation? Why?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, enthusiastic involvement in class and group activities and thoughtful completion of their homework.
Vocabulary:
Turbine, gouts, strontium, pyromaniacs, anachronistic, fabricator, aerial, chronicle, audacious, anarchic, nonconformist, incubate, debased, virtuosity, vicariously
Extension Activities:
1. Prepare a photo-journal (in print or as a digital slide show) of images taken in your community that feature the maker spirit. Consider how D.I.Y. projects might be manifested in the community, like in community gardens, sculptures, handcrafted cars or public murals. Write a caption for each image that explains what it is and where it can be found.
2. Start a D.I.Y. club in your school and invite students to participate. Organize an annual fair to showcase projects.
3. Take apart a common household device to learn how it works, then build your own handmade version of it, either as a 3-dimensional model or a computer rendering.
4. Write an obituary for one of the historical figures featured in the article. Highlight the subject's life work, significant inventions and the impact of his work on future generations.
5. Prepare a "How-It-Works" poster that demonstrates the inner workings of one of the projects featured in "D.I.Y. Dreams."
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Economics - Develop a business plan that outlines how you might produce, distribute and/or market one of the inventions you read about in class.
Global Studies - Investigate the craft traditions of a foreign country. Who are the traditional makers of craft in this country? What do they make and how? What might the crafts indicate about that country's culture, values and interests? Prepare a report of your findings and show examples of the traditional crafts in class.
Science - Develop a do-it-yourself project around the idea of environmental sustainability in the spirit of the cupcake cars.
Social Studies - Organize a craft bee to support a community cause. Invite members of the school and local community to make crafts, then sell their wares and donate the proceeds to a charity.

HEADLINE: District Puts All the World In Classrooms

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
For nearly a decade, the lesson that the world is interconnected -- call it Globalization 101 -- has been bandied about as much in education as in economics, spurring a cottage industry of internationally themed schools, feel-good cultural exchanges, model United Nations clubs and heritage festivals.
 But the high-performing Herricks school district here in Nassau County, whose student body is more than half Asian, is taking globalization to the graduate level, integrating international studies into every aspect of its curriculum. 
 A partnership with the Foreign Policy Association has transformed a high-school basement into a place where students produce research papers on North Korea's nuclear energy program or the Taliban's role in the opium trade. English teachers have culled reading lists of what they call ''dead white men'' (think Hawthorne and Hemingway) to make space for Jhumpa Lahiri, Chang-rae Lee and Khaled Hosseini. Gifted fifth graders learn comparative economics by charting the multinational production of a pencil and representing countries in a mock G8 summit. 
 Starting this year, every sixth grader at Herricks Middle School is required to take art in French, Spanish, Italian or Chinese, a dual-language approach that the school is considering expanding to gym as well. Preparing to create a Haitian-style painting in one French/art class last week, the students reviewed indigenous plants and wildlife in photos of Haitian rainforests and beaches projected onto a screen. 
 ''Bird,'' called out one boy.
 ''En francais,'' chided the teacher, Tom Coleman.
 ''Oiseau,'' the boy corrected himself.
 The global outlook at Herricks comes amid an $8.4 million investment by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others in a nationwide campaign by Asia Society to create new public schools with an integrated global focus; 10 have opened since 2004, including two in New York, and up to 30 more are expected by 2013. 
 In other instances of educational globalism, New Jersey, Connecticut and more than 20 other states have convened task forces or held conferences on globalization in recent years, some of them appointing international-relations specialists to coordinate school programs.
 Last year, Indiana adopted ambitious new standards for classroom teaching of Chinese, Japanese and Korean, with a checklist of what skills students should master from kindergarten to 12th grade. 
 In Jacksonville, N.C., elementary school students recently paired up with their counterparts in Puebla, Mexico, to write a bilingual book and to trade astronomy lessons as part of North Carolina in the World, a $200,000-per-year program financed by the State Legislature. 
 ''The whole notion of having a global focus is a trend nationwide, but how deep it's going is more of an open question,'' said Anthony Jackson, who oversees the International Studies Schools Network at Asia Society, a nonprofit educational group that fosters ties between the United States and Asia. ''The real prize is to really think about the core courses and analyze them to see how they can be internationalized.''
 For example, at the College of Staten Island High School for International Studies -- one of the Asia Society schools -- a recent biochemistry assignment measuring the caloric content of food was followed by a discussion of world hunger.
 Some foreign policy specialists and parents say most schools are still taking the equivalent of baby steps and relegating much of the serious learning about international relations to electives and extracurricular activities. 
 Michael J. Petrilli, a vice president of the conservative-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Institute, cautioned that American schools were already giving short shrift to American history and government and could not afford to layer global studies on top of already stretched curriculum. 
 ''In some of these trendy schools, there is an ethos that we are all citizens of the world, and that's all that matters,'' he said. ''Students need to be taught to be American citizens first.''
 The Herricks district, located 20 miles east of Manhattan, is carved out of six affluent communities: New Hyde Park, Roslyn, Roslyn Heights, Albertson, Manhasset Hills and Williston Park. 
 The district was once primarily Jewish, Italian and Irish but shifted with an influx of Korean, Indian and Chinese immigrants beginning in the late 1980s. Today, officials say, Herricks High School students come from homes where 69 different languages are spoken, and Bhangra music from India is often played at school dances.
 Jack Bierwirth, the Herricks superintendent since 2001, said the district began developing a global curriculum not only because of its diversity but also because parents and teachers said they wanted to demand more from their students, who have posted some of the highest standardized test scores in the state. 
 ''What if you get finished with the A.P. exam but can't remember where Afghanistan is?'' Mr. Bierwirth asked. ''It's important to place knowledge in the context of the world.''
 Najiba Keshwani, 16, an 11th grader who is Muslim but jokes that she is half-Jewish because she has many Jewish friends and loves to nosh on matzo, put it this way: ''To be American, maybe you used to have to be white and own land, but now we define what American is, and I think that affects how we learn.''
 Herricks' officials reached out to the Manhattan-based Foreign Policy Association, tapping into its resources -- academic journals, speaker's series, teacher training program -- as it redesigned the high school social studies curriculum to include new courses in contemporary foreign policy and world philosophy. 
 Robert Nolan, an editor at the association, said Herricks has become a model for its efforts to help other schools internationalize. ''They're really dealing with policy and its repercussions and benefits,'' he said. ''I think it's more substantial, more in-depth, and in the long run more educational than going on a cultural tour of Shanghai.''
 The district, which has an $87 million annual budget, has not spent much directly on its global efforts -- about $25,000 a year buys some books and class materials, pays for transportation to Foreign Policy Association events and provides small stipends to teachers who advise student activities. But there is no way to calculate the cost of how globalization infuses the study of virtually all subjects and grade levels. 
 During a social studies lesson last week about rebuilding the South during Reconstruction, Neepa Shah asked her fifth-grade students, ''Where else in the world did people feel like they were not heard?'' 
 ''Kenya,'' one boy said.
 Just like that, an American history lesson morphed into one about modern problems facing an African nation trying to rebuild after tumultuous elections. Ms. Shah called up a map of Kenya on her computer screen and pushed students to delve ever deeper into the comparison. ''We're looking at this through the lens of what we just learned in our own history,'' she told her students.
 Ms. Shah graduated from Herricks in 1996, when the district was still predominantly white. When she returned as a teacher last year, she found that when she set aside Friday afternoon to talk about current events, students often tuned her out.
 So she revamped all her lessons to touch on the real world, in some fashion. Behind her desk is a world map labeled with ''civil rights watch,'' which evolved from a lesson on women's rights at Seneca Falls after a Chinese-American student asked about human rights protests over the Olympics. 
 For an English lesson, she assigned students to write a journal entry from the perspective of a Kenyan villager returning home after the elections. In math, she asked them to calculate fractions from newspaper articles about world events like the Pakistani elections. 
 ''It helps them make connections and personalize issues far away from them,'' Ms. Shah said. ''It makes them empathetic, rather than just sympathetic, and I just see them thinking more. I know it's getting to them because their questions are getting better.''
 While many parents support the approach, some have expressed concern that as the district teaches about world cultures, no particular one should be emphasized over another. Those parents boycotted a fund-raising dinner-dance for adults held by the Parent Teacher Association last year because they believed its theme of ''A Whole New World'' from the Disney movie, ''Aladdin,'' complete with belly dancers, was overly focused on Eastern culture. 
 Other parents worried when school officials decided in 2005 that teaching about different religions had to be part of its efforts to investigate world issues. It was a significant shift for a district that was the subject of a important Supreme Court decision in 1962 overturning school prayer. 
 ''I don't remember anyone saying Pandora's box, but it was like that, people saying, 'I think it's a good idea but I'm nervous,' '' Mr. Bierwirth said.
 Joy Matza, 47, the mother of twin eighth graders at the Herricks Middle School, said she found the new globalization efforts like the art immersion classes an improvement over the show-and-tell multicultural activities in past years. She recalled sending her kids to school with Oreos and red, white and blue T-shirts when they were asked to bring food or wear clothing from their culture. 
 ''I felt it always erred more toward stupid than educational,'' said Ms. Matza, whose family traces its roots to Eastern Europe and Greece. ''I mean, occasionally we'll eat a Greek cookie, but we're not sitting around singing Greek songs.''
 For students like Brittany Battista, a fourth grader whose travel abroad has been confined to resorts, the chance to learn in-depth about other countries has helped her learn more about her own corner of the world. As part of a ''global awareness club,'' Brittany and other students helped raise $600 from a bake sale for victims of a recent cyclone in Bangladesh, a place she had not even known was a country.
 ''You realize you take a lot of things for granted -- like, can I have that CD? -- and they don't even have clean water,'' she said. ''Now when people are talking about Bangladesh, I can say I studied that. It feels good not to be left out and to be involved in the conversation.''

HEADLINE: From Metalwork to Luxury Condos: Century-Old SoHo Shop Ends Its Run

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
In 1907, a metalwork shop opened in Manhattan in what is now a fashionable area called SoHo. The neighborhood was much grittier then, and the shop served the many local manufacturers.
 When SoHo began attracting a creative class a few decades later, artists and designers on low budgets would come into the shop with sketches and requests, and the De Lorenzos, who owned the shop, would set about building what was needed.
 Even today, the shop has plenty of work making custom furniture and fittings for the glitzy galleries and expensive lofts and apartments in the area, which is now known for manufacturing high-priced meals and cocktails. But no bending brake or arc welder or cutting torch can alter the hard economic fact that to the De Lorenzos -- the third generation is now running the business -- the place is worth more closed than open. 
 A developer seeking to put up a luxury condominium building has agreed to buy the De Lorenzos' one-story building, a 30-foot-by-100-foot structure on Grand Street near West Broadway, said Thomas De Lorenzo, 84, who owns the shop with his son Thomas 2nd.
 ''The only way we were able to stay in business in recent years is that we owned the building,'' Mr. De Lorenzo Sr. said. 
 Thursday was the last working day for the century-old shop, and some of the remaining artists and designers in SoHo dropped by to pay their respects.
 ''This place is really the last of its kind in an area that used to have so many manufacturing businesses,'' said Robert McDougle, a designer who has worked in SoHo for 30 years. He said he enjoyed and benefited from having a small metal shop with an experienced staff fabricate his designs and suggest methods and materials that expanded his vision as a designer.
 ''They helped many, many artists in SoHo,'' he said, as the De Lorenzos and three longtime employees rushed to finish their last few projects.
 Mr. De Lorenzo Sr.'s father, Anthony, who died in 1974, owned the shop for many years with his older brother, John. 
 Thomas Sr. said he worked at the shop after school as a child and then full time after serving in World War II. He became partners with his father in 1952, when the shop was on Thompson Street.
 ''It used to be all manufacturing down here,'' he said, looking out at Grand Street. Next door to the metal shop is an upscale boutique with many magazine clippings in the window. Around the corner is the SoHo Grand Hotel, and one can barely throw a $12 mojito without hitting a fancy cafe or lounge or gallery.
 Mr. De Lorenzo Sr. said that in 1968, he and his father paid $65,000 for the building -- ''and that was a lot of money then.''
 Now, he said, he will retire to his house in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The price he is getting for the building is more than the business ever made in a century, he said, without revealing the amount.
 Mr. De Lorenzo Sr. said he had had many famous clients. They built a terrace enclosure for Paul Newman's Upper East Side apartment. They made metal baseboards for fencers who competed in the 1976 Olympics.
 The actor Fred Gwynne used to come in regularly for metal for his artwork.
 The shop's faded sign -- ''John De Lorenzo and Bro., Iron and Sheet Metal Contractor'' -- painted blue and white over brick, looks fashionably retro in this area of snazzy signs and storefronts.
 The shop's contents seem to make up a history of New York. Mr. De Lorenzo 2nd, 60, showed a bulky metal cutter that he said the family bought in 1915 when it was the first of its kind in the City. He showed an old metal ashcan, used for ashes removed from coal-burning furnaces -- made by hand with heavy-duty rivets around the rim. 
 ''This was a De Lorenzo ashcan -- we used to specialize in them,'' said Mr. De Lorenzo 2nd, adding that he would continue to do consulting as a civil engineer.
 Rolando-Luis Rivera, a union welder who has worked at the shop for more than 20 years, used a blowtorch to repair a tiered rack used to support the different dishes of a restaurant meal. The hardest part of the job, he said, was maintaining concentration when so many fashionable women walked nonstop past the shop's open garage door in nice weather.
 ''The best part of the job is the women,'' he said, adding that he was married and that for that reason, ''it's also the worst part.'' 
 He showed some De Lorenzo repairs and creations. There was a small staircase, a stoop, a heavy-duty metal banister. There were tall metal objects with backpack attachments, which he said were custom-made for a puppet theater, to support tall puppets. There were also pieces that no one ever retrieved, including a metal pole with sharp prongs that was ordered as a giant skewer for pig roasts.
 ''We got all kinds of requests over the years,'' Mr. De Lorenzo Sr. said. ''We didn't ask questions. We just made it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Declines To Say China Manipulates Its Currency

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration on Thursday declined to label China a manipulator of currency to gain unfair trade advantages.
 Congress has been pressuring the administration for penalties because of America's growing trade deficit with China. The deficit last year hit a record high of $256.3 billion, the largest ever recorded with a single country. 
 In a report it is required to deliver to Congress every six months, the administration said that China needed to address the ''substantial undervaluation'' of its currency compared with the dollar. But the report said China did not meet the technical requirements under the law to be designated a currency manipulator.
 The report noted that the value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, had risen 18.4 percent against the dollar since the Chinese government loosened its currency system in July 2005. American manufacturers say the yuan is still undervalued as much as 40 percent, making Chinese products more competitive in this country and American goods more expensive in China.
 In the report, the Treasury Department said, ''China needs to intensify its efforts to rebalance its economy'' by bolstering domestic demand to reduce reliance on imports and by changing its financial system to let the yuan's foreign exchange value be set by the markets rather than by the government.
 John Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state, faced tough questioning on Thursday on the currency issue during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on United States relations with China.
 Senator George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican, said his constituents were ''livid'' about the China trade issue. He accused the administration of failing to get tough with Beijing because the administration wanted Chinese support for dealing with North Korea over nuclear weapons.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'EARL CUNNINGHAM'S AMERICA,' through Aug. 31. The folk artist Earl Cunningham (1893-1977) romanticized the American landscape without hyperbole. Cunningham didn't suffuse his paintings with divine light or invoke manifest destiny, like the Hudson River School artists; he simply showed the many small interactions of the Atlantic coastal ecosystem -- a delicate balance of dock workers, harbor pilots, fishermen, farmers, waterfowl and American Indian tribes. Some 50 of his cheerful, intensely colored paintings are on view at the Lincoln Square branch of the American Folk Art Museum. Whether you think of Cunningham as a folk artist or a Modernist, his paintings display an intuitive grace. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,' through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. 
 (Ken Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: DREAD SCOTT: 'WELCOME TO AMERICA,' through June 1. Dread Scott's installation with an American flag on the floor caused a flap in 1989 when the first President Bush disapproved, and this New York artist continues to make issue-specific work in a classic political-art mode. The installations, sculptures and videos in this survey dramatize Hurricane Katrina, the incarceration of black males and the Iraq war as if they were all part of a single national problem, and he argues forcefully that they are. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Holland Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'TAKE YOUR TIME: OLAFUR ELIASSON,' through June 30. Near the end of a decade crammed with junk-art collectibles geared to junk-bond budgets, we get bare walls, open space, light and color in this survey of work by an artist, born in Denmark in 1967, who is well known for creating immaterialist magic through bare-bones means: literally, in some cases, mist and mirrors. As optically enchanting as the results are, though, in the end we are left wanting more from Mr. Eliasson's less. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. 
 (Cotter) NEUE GALERIE: 'WIENER WERKSTaTTE JEWELRY,' through Sept. 1. Founded in 1903, the Wiener Werkstatte, or Vienna Workshops, set out to prove that the modern world still needed fine craftsmanship and good design. Its first product was jewelry, of which this stunning exhibition presents 40 gorgeous examples. Works in gold, silver and semi-precious stones by the workshop's co-founders, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, and others -- including, most notably, Dagobert Peche -- magically blur the line between personal ornament and miniature sculpture. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOUBLE ALBUM: DANIEL GUZMAN AND STEVE SHEARER,' through July 6. This intermittently interesting two-part exhibition presents two midcareer artists who work in various mediums and share a fascination with male adolescence and classic rock. Daniel Guzman's recent large-scale drawings combining mythic, tribal images and weirdly distorted, fragmented human figures are elegantly surrealistic, and his video of a Pied Piper-like character leading three other men in a dance along a crowded city sidewalk is delightful. Steve Shearer's best works are finely made drawings and woozy, Symbolist-style paintings of men and boys with long, rocker-style hair. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FLOW,' through June 29. Afropolitanism is the modish tag for recent work by young African artists. What unites them is a shared view of Africa, less as a place than as a concept, a cultural force -- one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean, part of the whole, but with its own tides and temperatures. This idea, or something like it, lies behind ''Flow,'' a fine-textured survey of 20 artists who, with a few exceptions, were born in Africa after 1970 but who now live in Europe or the United States. The show is a worthy successor to ''Freestyle'' and ''Frequency,'' benchmark surveys of new African-American art. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 * 'MARY CASSATT: PRINTS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF AMBROISE VOLLARD' The last of three Cassatt exhibitions held at the gallery since 2000, this show focuses on a body of work that passed through the hands of the influential Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939). Together, the drawings and prints here illuminate the working methods of this popular female Impressionist. They include etchings, aquatints, preparatory pencil drawings and pastel counterproofs. Soft-ground aquatints of women at the opera show Cassatt favoring painterly washes over technical precision. Several drypoints featuring charming, chubby-handed toddlers convey empathy and intimacy. Vollard's buy-in-bulk strategy is our gain, illuminating the complexity of process Cassatt brought to her limited purview. Adelson Galleries, 19 East 82nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 439-6800, adelsongalleries.com, through June 6. (Rosenberg)
 WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'THE FIGURE' While best known for his Pop-realist paintings of food products, Mr. Thiebaud has also been a skillful and innovative figure painter, as this fine show of paintings and drawings dating from 1963 to 1992 demonstrates. Outstanding are six oil paintings from the '60s, each depicting a man or a woman against a blank wall. The women are sexy and enigmatic, the men subtly comical. All the paintings have great visual snap and a slightly melancholy, Hopperesque distance. Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, allanstonegallery.com, through May 30. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 MEL BOCHNER The latest paintings of this erstwhile Conceptualist have gone over to the even darker side, perhaps in honor of our even darker times. The words and mood continue to be hilariously dour and pointedly negative, and to decline into a kind of linguistic entropy. Now the colors -- once cheerfully neon -- match them with shades of gray, forming seething modernist monochromes. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 'SUBSTRACTION' This show of large-scale paintings by six young artists proposes a new fusion of postwar abstraction and graffiti art. Despite an infectious spirit, originality is scarce. Reason for going: three canvases by Sterling Ruby push spray-can painting to new heights of atmospheric toxicity that some are calling ''Gangsta Rothkos.'' Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 GLADYS NILSSON: 'RECENT WATERCOLORS' Since helping to found the Hairy Who, a '60s-era group of rambunctious Chicago image-makers, Ms. Nilsson has been painting a zany world of giant women presiding over busy domestic interiors and pastoral landscapes. This exhibition presents 11 lush watercolors made with consummate but not overly polished craft. They might strike a hurried New Yorker as too sweet and whimsical, but close looking reveals captivating riches. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com, through May 31. (Johnson)
 GEDI SIBONY In Mr. Sibony's first solo at Greene Naftali, raw materials like garbage bags, hollow-core doors and galvanized steel pipes are neutralized by the artist's delicate touch and the gallery's clean, light-filled space. Shades of ''greige'' (the decorator's neutral of choice) dominate the main gallery, particularly in two works consisting primarily of carpet remnants. In several more intimate viewing rooms Mr. Sibony exhibits doors and cardboard boxes adorned with bits of paper and tape, and sections of Masonite and plexiglass modified with crude geometric cutouts. Taken as a whole, the exhibition suggests some kind of narrative -- perhaps that of a contractor who walked off the job to pursue a Ph.D. in philosophy. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftali.com; through May 24. (Rosenberg)
 PIOTR UKLANSKI One of the bad boys of contemporary art goes big time and sustains quite a bit of his badness. Diverse works in a labyrinth of galleries move through the pomp and circumstance of the Communist, Roman Catholic and Modernist beliefs; Polish Christmas traditions; and the Solidarity movement, with a closing reference to the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Germans. Festivalist identity-art spectacle is a target; yet a sense of Polish suffering and pride comes across. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com, through May 31. (Smith)

 'NEW YORK COOL: PAINTING AND SCULPTURE FROM THE N.Y.U. ART COLLECTION' This exhibition subjects the late '50s and early '60s -- a period normally seen as a transitional phase between Abstract Expressionism and Pop, Pollock and Warhol -- to intense scrutiny. It reintroduces minor characters like Seymour Lipton, Robert Goodnough and Conrad Marca-Relli, and exposes hidden sides of well-known artists (Miriam Schapiro's early geometric abstraction). It reminds us that the art world of that time was a multifarious scene shaped by artists beyond Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through July 19. (Rosenberg)
 Last Chance
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000' The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)ANTON KANNEMEYER: 'THE HAUNT OF FEARS' A fearless and funny South African political satirist, Mr. Kannemeyer paints and draws works on paper that expertly imitate the style of Herge's Tintin comics. This exhibition features pieces from a series representing letters of the alphabet. ''N is for Nightmare'' depicts a peaceful suburban home with circular vignettes representing two natives brandishing a spear and a machete, and a black woman serving a white man's head on a platter. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'DETROIT' The McDermott & McGough Wayback machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Nicholas Robinson consists of extraordinarily lucid, richly colored staged photographs resembling stills from an old film about teenage love, desire, wanderlust and guilt. Nicholas Robinson, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GUSTAVE COURBET' Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 BLAKE RAYNE The abstract paintings in this show, an important one for this impressive New York artist, were made with aerosol spray directed at folded, cut and stitched-together canvas. And the pictures are only part of a larger conceptual package that includes the display of the paintings' shipping containers and has involved closing the gallery for a week. Mr. Rayne's taking apart of art conventions is erudite, visually effective and of a piece: the installation looks like a cross between a paneled library and a spreading bruise. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

 RUINED BURMESE FARMERS
 May Miss Fall Harvest
 Tens of thousands of farm families lost their draft animals, their rice stocks and their planting seeds in Cyclone Nargis. Normally at this time of year, Burmese farmers in the southern delta of Myanmar would be draining their rice paddies, plowing their fields with their water buffaloes and preparing to plant seeds for an autumn harvest. But now the harvest is in doubt as well. PAGE A6 
 PROTESTS OVER JOB CUTS IN FRANCE
 Hundreds of thousands of French teachers, students, parents and civil servants staged a one-day strike across the country to protest government plans to cut jobs in the public sector. The strike was another test of President Nicolas Sarkozy's resolve in his efforts to decrease the size of France's large civil service as a way to reduce budget deficits and create more competition in the economy. PAGE A12 
 GROWING CONCERNS OVER FOOD
 Thieves in Kandahar, Afghanistan, raided the city flour market in broad daylight a few weeks ago, shooting and wounding two people before escaping with their loot. So the merchants got together and hired eight private security guards. But their fears remain, not only over gunmen, but because they sense a growing hunger and desperation in the general population. PAGE A8 
 IMMIGRANTS IN ITALY ARRESTED
 Police officers in Italy arrested hundreds of people this week in a sweep of migrant shanty towns in major urban areas, a strong signal from Italy's new right-wing government that it will keep its promises to pursue tougher policies toward immigrants. ''The anti-immigrant sweep was a positive thing because that's what people want,'' said Umberto Bossi, the minister of institutional reforms and federalism. PAGE A6 
 ANSWERS AFTER ABRUPT RESIGNATION
 The resignation this week of Marina Silva, the environmental minister of Brazil, sent shockwaves through the international environmental community, who saw her as an important bulwark against deforestation of the Amazon. Ms. Silva blamed ''stagnation'' in the government for her decision and acknowledged that governors in frontline Amazon states were pressuring the president to rescind measures intended to check deforestation.

 Faced with the possibility of the most severe water shortages in decades, Los Angeles is planning to increase fines for watering lawns during restricted times, tap into more groundwater, encourage the use of more efficient plumbing fixtures, and to augment drinking water supplies with sewage. Cleansed sewage, that is. Heavily cleansed. PAGE A15
 INCREASE IN MASTECTOMIES
 Magnetic resonance imaging, a relatively new technique that detects more possibly cancerous growths than does mammography, may be leading more women to have their entire breast removed, researchers said. The study was based on patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and there is some evidence pointing to a wider tendency. PAGE A16
 HOUSE PASSES VETERANS' AID
 The House approved an expansive new veterans education benefit that would be paid for by a tax on affluent Americans. Republicans joined in approving the aid, but an effort to provide $163 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan went down in a surprise defeat, at least temporarily, because of objections from members of both parties.

 A CALL FOR LESS SUN
 Its aggressive push into renewable energies has made cloud-wreathed Germany an unlikely world leader in the race to harness solar power.

 STRONG QUARTER FOR EUROPE
 Led by the German economy, which grew 1.5 percent, the euro zone grew 0.7 percent during the first quarter of the year, about double what most economists had expected.

 NEVER MIND CHEATING IN SPORTS,

 People in the National Football League cheat. We know that. They take drugs to make them even more humongous, and they spy on one another to pick up signals. And we should all let them cheat, or let the N.F.L. commission stop them, George Vecsey writes in Sports of The Times.

 Art viewers familiar with Robert Mapplethorpe's posed and polished studio photography of the 1980s may not know that a decade earlier he was making quickie photographs with Polaroid cameras.

HEADLINE: Labor Report Shows Gains in City's Job Picture While Rest of State Weakens

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For months, economists and city officials have been bracing for signs that the city's job market is weakening after several of New York's largest banks recorded huge losses in the mortgage market and said they would eliminate thousands of jobs. 
 But the latest report from the State Department of Labor indicates that the city's economy has remained relatively vibrant even as the rest of the state has continued to lose jobs. 
 Labor Department statistics released on Thursday showed that in April, the number of private-sector jobs in the city was up 35,500, or 1.1 percent, compared with April 2007, for a total of 3.2 million jobs. Much of last month's gain was a result of hiring in construction and retail trade, two sectors that ''likely benefited from unusually warm weather in April,'' said James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department.
 The report also showed that despite a small gain in employment, the city's unemployment rate rose last month to 4.7 percent from 4.5 percent in March after adjustments for seasonal fluctuations. That matched the statewide rate of 4.7 percent in April and remained lower than the national unemployment rate of 5 percent last month.
 The unemployment rate measures the share of the work force -- all those people working or looking for work -- that was unable to find work. It rises even though the number of people with jobs increases when the size of the overall labor force is growing even faster.
 Over all, the state's job market continued to weaken. The Labor Department said the total number of private-sector jobs in the state fell slightly in April, the third consecutive monthly decline. Employment in the state was down by 9,100 jobs, or 0.1 percent, to 7.26 million, according to the figures.
 But the state's unemployment rate dipped from 4.8 percent in March.
 Jobs in the city had accounted for most of the state's employment gains in the past year. Hiring in the financial services sector was especially robust in the first half of 2007, before reversing in the fall.
 ''It was going like gangbusters last spring and summer,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Certainly, the job market is less favorable than it was six months, nine months ago.''
 The sharp pullback on Wall Street sent economists scrambling to revise their forecasts for the city's growth, with many of them projecting a recession by midyear. Each new set of numbers that defies those predictions raises hopes that the city will suffer a mild downturn at worst.
 But economists caution that the apparent stability may be fleeting. 
 Mr. Brown and another analyst, Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment firm in Manhattan, said they believed that many of the announced job cuts had not yet shown up in the official statistics. 
 Ms. Denham said that many workers ''receiving pink slips remain on severance pay for a few months and, therefore, are counted on the payroll.''
 Still, Ms. Denham noted, the city had about 18,000 more jobs last month than it had at its peak before the last recession, in 2001.
 Statewide, the biggest job gains were in construction and the leisure and hospitality sector, while the biggest losses were in financial activities and manufacturing.
 In a separate report on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that manufacturers in the state said general business conditions were worsening. 
 In the Fed survey of companies in various industries, more said they saw conditions deteriorating rather than improving.
 ''The outlook for the next six months remains subdued, particularly for employment,'' the Fed report stated.
 It added that the number of companies reporting that the prices they paid for materials were rising was at an all-time high. 
 On average, respondents said that prices had risen 8.7 percent in the past year and that they expected them to rise an additional 6.8 percent, on average, over the next 12 months, according to the report. 
 On Wednesday, New Jersey's labor department said the state's unemployment rate rose to 5 percent in April from 4.8 percent in March even though employment in the state increased by 1,000 jobs. New Jersey lost about 11,000 jobs in the first three months of this year, the report said.

 'BRUCE HIGH QUALITY FOUNDATION: THE RETROSPECTIVE' According to the mission statement (short version) on its Web site, the Bruce High Quality Foundation collective (named after a sign on its building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn) ''was created to foster an alternative to everything.'' Now after three or four years of fostering, the six Cooper Union graduates who form the collective have decided that it's time to sum things up. 
 ''The Retrospective,'' the collective's first show in a commercial New York gallery, demonstrates an implicitly satiric, reactive style.
 Its best-known ''reaction'' was ''The Gate: Not the Idea of the Thing but the Thing Itself,'' inspired by Robert Smithson's ''Floating Island,'' a posthumous work of water-borne land art that was towed around Manhattan for a week in 2005. The Bruces pursued it one day in a speedboat pulling a miniature copy of one of Christo's orange ''Gates.'' They responded to Ugo Rondinone's ''Hell, Yes!,'' a sign in rainbow colors placed on the exterior of the new New Museum in the fall, by suspending the words ''Heaven Forbid'' in identical letters from a building across the street. 
 The exhibition (above, an installation view) covers other, more intimate responses, including a series of small self-portraits that mostly feature a goofy, slightly Jules Feifferish face applied to images of other artworks or artists; a few sculptures, among them ''Socialist Pizza,'' which involves a Ray's Pizza box, two of Picasso's hefty 1930s beach maenads and a hammer and sickle; and a work using a photograph by Hans Haacke. ''Art History With Food'' and ''Public Art and Collaboration,'' two wayward yet weirdly to-the-point videos, provide an especially pungent sense of the group attitude. (Through May 24, Susan Inglett, 522 West 24th Street, Chelsea, 212-647-9111, inglettgallery.com, thebrucehighqualityfoundation.com.) ROBERTA SMITH

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ASA AMES: OCCUPATION SCULPTURING,' through Sept. 14. This first show devoted to the American sculptor Asa Ames (1823-1851) is a gem. Its eight carved and painted wood portraits -- roughly two-thirds of the work of Ames's brief maturity -- introduce an artist who translated the style of self-taught American portrait painters into three dimensions, imbuing their artificiality with the sense of suspended life found in 19th-century photography. A crowded, wonderfully bizarre photograph that Ames orchestrated of himself, his work and a friend is a poignant tribute to his ambition. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'DARGERISM: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AND HENRY DARGER,' through Sept. 21. The great Outsider Henry Darger (1892-1973) was completely unknown as an artist during his own lifetime. Now his epic adventure, ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion'' is famous and a big influence on mainstream artists. This intriguing exhibition presents 12 of Darger's gorgeous, bizarre watercolors and works by 11 contemporary artists who have been inspired by him, including Justine Kurland, Trenton Doyle Hancock and, most surprisingly, Paula Rego. (See above.) (Ken Johnson)
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'EARL CUNNINGHAM'S AMERICA,' through Aug. 31. The folk artist Earl Cunningham (1893-1977) romanticized the American landscape without hyperbole. Cunningham didn't suffuse his paintings with divine light or invoke manifest destiny, like the Hudson River School artists; he simply showed the many small interactions of the Atlantic coastal ecosystem -- a delicate balance of dock workers, harbor pilots, fishermen, farmers, waterfowl and American Indian tribes. Some 50 of his cheerful, intensely colored paintings are on view at the Lincoln Square branch of the American Folk Art Museum. Whether you think of Cunningham as a folk artist or a Modernist, his paintings display an intuitive grace. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: '$;MURAKAMI,' through July 13. Bring the kids and the shopping-centered tweens. This survey of Takashi Murakami, the artist frequently called the Japanese Andy Warhol, has it all: immense, toylike sculptures; an animated cartoon that rivals Disney; and a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique (Brooklyn's first!) selling Murakami bags. But it also elucidates the trajectory of an artist who began by recycling Japanese popular culture and then gradually figured out how to go deeper, harnessing Japanese traditions of painting, craft and spirituality. The art-commerce, high-low conundrums are fun, but the steady improvement in the paintings is the real heart of the matter. Along with the animated cartoons, which should please aesthetes of all ages, there is a moral component as well. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Smith) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,' through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. (See above.) (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'THE GENIUS OF JAPANESE LACQUER: MASTERWORKS BY SHIBATA ZESHIN,' through June 15. In Japan, before there was plastic, there was lacquer. Shiny, waterproof and lightweight, it made an excellent coating for wooden cups, bowls, utensils and food storage containers. In the hands of a skilled, ingenious artisan like Shibata Zeshin (1807-1891) it was a high art. This beautiful show presents almost 75 objects -- many dumbfoundingly sumptuous -- and paintings by this man, considered the greatest of all Japanese lacquer artists. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ACTION/ABSTRACTION: POLLOCK, DE KOONING AND AMERICAN ART, 1940-1976,' through Sept. 21. With the help of some stupendous paintings and a beautiful installation, the same old story of postwar American painting's glory is told a new way: through the rivalry between its most prominent advocates, the art critics Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg and through their intellectual milieu. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'WARHOL'S JEWS: TEN PORTRAITS RECONSIDERED,' through Aug. 3. In 1980 Andy Warhol produced a series of portraits of famous Jews, including Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and the Marx Brothers. When they appeared at the Jewish Museum that year, the critics hated them. But they were warmly received by Jewish audiences when they were exhibited in museums and Jewish institutions around the country. Viewing them in this return engagement, it is hard to imagine anyone growing very excited for or against such bland, posterlike images. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ILLUMINATING THE MEDIEVAL HUNT,' through Aug. 10. As part of a conservation effort, the Morgan Library's 14th-century hunting manuscript ''Le Livre de la Chasse'' has been temporarily unbound, affording viewers a rare opportunity to study the individual pages. Fifty illustrated leaves are on view in this show, along with other manuscripts and printed books from the 11th to the 16th century. Gaston Phoebus's authoritative text examines the characteristics of various wild animals, explores different methods of hunting and provides instruction on caring for hounds. ''Le Livre de la Chasse'' was written for medieval aristocrats, but it will appeal to contemporary athletes, nature lovers and dog owners. See above225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PHILIP GUSTON: WORKS ON PAPER,' through Aug. 31. This enthralling exhibition of 100 works, mostly drawings, tracks Guston's evolution from his Abstract Expressionist efforts of the 1950s to his darkly comic and hugely influential representational pictures of the 1970s. While he went through several radical stylistic changes over those three decades, a determination to work from basic instincts and primal feelings runs throughout, giving the show a powerful autobiographical momentum. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: DREAD SCOTT: 'WELCOME TO AMERICA,' through June 1. Dread Scott's installation with an American flag on the floor caused a flap in 1989 when the first President Bush disapproved, and this New York artist continues to make issue-specific work in a classic political-art mode. The installations, sculptures and videos in this survey dramatize Hurricane Katrina, the incarceration of black males and the Iraq war as if they were all part of a single national problem, and he argues forcefully that they are. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Holland Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'TAKE YOUR TIME: OLAFUR ELIASSON,' through June 30. Near the end of a decade crammed with junk-art collectibles geared to junk-bond budgets, we get bare walls, open space, light and color in this survey of work by an artist, born in Denmark in 1967, who is well known for creating immaterialist magic through bare-bones means: literally, in some cases, mist and mirrors. As optically enchanting as the results are, though, in the end we are left wanting more from Mr. Eliasson's less. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I.'' Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt's most famous painted mural, the ''Beethoven Frieze''; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist's signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'WIENER WERKSTaTTE JEWELRY,' through Sept. 1. Founded in 1903, the Wiener Werkstatte, or Vienna Workshops, set out to prove that the modern world still needed fine craftsmanship and good design. Its first product was jewelry, of which this stunning exhibition presents 40 gorgeous examples. Works in gold, silver and semi-precious stones by the workshop's co-founders, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, and others -- including, most notably, Dagobert Peche -- magically blur the line between personal ornament and miniature sculpture. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'TOMMA ABTS,' through June 29. The small, hard-edged abstractions by this German-born painter, who is based in London and was the 2006 Turner Prize winner, are not showy, but they are intensely absorbing. Basic, formal elements like stripes, arcs, circles, planes and polygons are carefully layered, juxtaposed and interwoven in all sorts of subtly eccentric ways. Ms. Abts's colors are muted but seductive, and she adds highlights and shadows, creating mysterious, three-dimensional illusions. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOUBLE ALBUM: DANIEL GUZMAN AND STEVE SHEARER,' through July 6. This intermittently interesting two-part exhibition presents two midcareer artists who work in various mediums and share a fascination with male adolescence and classic rock. Daniel Guzman's recent large-scale drawings combining mythic, tribal images and weirdly distorted, fragmented human figures are elegantly surrealistic, and his video of a Pied Piper-like character leading three other men in a dance along a crowded city sidewalk is delightful. Steve Shearer's best works are finely made drawings and woozy, Symbolist-style paintings of men and boys with long, rocker-style hair. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LIBRARY: 'MONUMENTAL FRANCE: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDOUARD BALDUS' AND SKETCHES ON GLASS: CLICHES-VERRE FROM THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,' through June 28. This pair of exhibitions focuses on the experimental period after the birth of photography (the 1850s through the 1870s). Film had not yet been invented, but glass-plate and paper negatives allowed artists to micromanage the camera's performance or to bypass it entirely. ''Monumental France: The Photographs of Edouard Baldus'' gathers 38 artisanal prints of French architectural landmarks. ''Sketches on Glass: Cliches-Verre From the New York Public Library'' presents prints made with hand-drawn glass plates on light-sensitive paper (no camera required). Together these shows reveal that artists in mid-19th-century France blurred the distinction between the photograph and the unique object. Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 930-0830, nypl.org (Rosenberg)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through May 25. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FLOW,' through June 29. Afropolitanism is the modish tag for recent work by young African artists. What unites them is a shared view of Africa, less as a place than as a concept, a cultural force -- one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean, part of the whole, but with its own tides and temperatures. This idea, or something like it, lies behind ''Flow,'' a fine-textured survey of 20 artists who, with a few exceptions, were born in Africa after 1970 but who now live in Europe or the United States. The show is a worthy successor to ''Freestyle'' and ''Frequency,'' benchmark surveys of new African-American art. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)

 * 'MARY CASSATT: PRINTS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF AMBROISE VOLLARD' The last of three Cassatt exhibitions held at the gallery since 2000, this show focuses on a body of work that passed through the hands of the influential Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939). Together, the drawings and prints here illuminate the working methods of this popular female Impressionist. They include etchings, aquatints, preparatory pencil drawings and pastel counterproofs. Soft-ground aquatints of women at the opera show Cassatt favoring painterly washes over technical precision. Several drypoints featuring charming, chubby-handed toddlers convey empathy and intimacy. Vollard's buy-in-bulk strategy is our gain, illuminating the complexity of process Cassatt brought to her limited purview. Adelson Galleries, 19 East 82nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 439-6800, adelsongalleries.com, through June 6. (Rosenberg)
 WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'THE FIGURE' While best known for his Pop-realist paintings of food products, Mr. Thiebaud has also been a skillful and innovative figure painter, as this fine show of paintings and drawings dating from 1963 to 1992 demonstrates. Outstanding are six oil paintings from the '60s, each depicting a man or a woman against a blank wall. The women are sexy and enigmatic, the men subtly comical. All the paintings have great visual snap and a slightly melancholy, Hopperesque distance. Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, allanstonegallery.com, through May 30. (Johnson)
 'WINE, WORSHIP AND SACRIFICE: THE GOLDEN GRAVES OF ANCIENT VANI' In small but elegant new galleries, a study center founded in 2006 under the auspices of New York University presents its inaugural exhibition. This show offers more than 100 objects unearthed from ancient graves in Vani, a cosmopolitan city established in Colchis -- modern-day Georgia -- in the eighth century B.C. It includes beautiful, intricate gold jewelry discovered in grave sites of the rich and powerful; the life-size bronze torso of a youth made in classic Hellenistic style; and two strikingly exotic bronze lamps with functional parts in the form of elephant heads. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7810, nyu.edu/isaw, through June 1. (Johnson)
 Galleries: SoHo
 MEL BOCHNER The latest paintings of this erstwhile Conceptualist have gone over to the even darker side, perhaps in honor of our even darker times. The words and mood continue to be hilariously dour and pointedly negative, and to decline into a kind of linguistic entropy. Now the colors -- once cheerfully neon -- match them with shades of gray, forming seething modernist monochromes. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 'SUBSTRACTION' This show of large-scale paintings by six young artists proposes a new fusion of postwar abstraction and graffiti art. Despite an infectious spirit, originality is scarce. Reason for going: three canvases by Sterling Ruby push spray-can painting to new heights of atmospheric toxicity that some are calling ''Gangsta Rothkos.'' Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through May 24. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 GLADYS NILSSON: 'RECENT WATERCOLORS' Since helping to found the Hairy Who, a '60s-era group of rambunctious Chicago image-makers, Ms. Nilsson has been painting a zany world of giant women presiding over busy domestic interiors and pastoral landscapes. This exhibition presents 11 lush watercolors made with consummate but not overly polished craft. They might strike a hurried New Yorker as too sweet and whimsical, but close looking reveals captivating riches. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com, through May 31. (Johnson)
 GEDI SIBONY In Mr. Sibony's first solo at Greene Naftali, raw materials like garbage bags, hollow-core doors and galvanized steel pipes are neutralized by the artist's delicate touch and the gallery's clean, light-filled space. Shades of ''greige'' (the decorator's neutral of choice) dominate the main gallery, particularly in two works consisting primarily of carpet remnants. In several more intimate viewing rooms Mr. Sibony exhibits doors and cardboard boxes adorned with bits of paper and tape, and sections of Masonite and plexiglass modified with crude geometric cutouts. Taken as a whole, the exhibition suggests some kind of narrative -- perhaps that of a contractor who walked off the job to pursue a Ph.D. in philosophy. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftali.com; through May 24. (Rosenberg)
 PIOTR UKLANSKI One of the bad boys of contemporary art goes big time and sustains quite a bit of his badness. Diverse works in a labyrinth of galleries move through the pomp and circumstance of the Communist, Roman Catholic and Modernist beliefs; Polish Christmas traditions; and the Solidarity movement, with a closing reference to the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Germans. Festivalist identity-art spectacle is a target; yet a sense of Polish suffering and pride comes across. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com, through May 31. (Smith)

 'NEW YORK COOL: PAINTING AND SCULPTURE FROM THE N.Y.U. ART COLLECTION' This exhibition subjects the late '50s and early '60s -- a period normally seen as a transitional phase between Abstract Expressionism and Pop, Pollock and Warhol -- to intense scrutiny. It reintroduces minor characters like Seymour Lipton, Robert Goodnough and Conrad Marca-Relli, and exposes hidden sides of well-known artists (Miriam Schapiro's early geometric abstraction). It reminds us that the art world of that time was a multifarious scene shaped by artists beyond Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through July 19. (Rosenberg)
 Out of Town
 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM : 'COLOR AS FIELD: AMERICAN PAINTING, 1950-1975,' through May 26. An overdue, if far from perfect, reconsideration of Color Field painting reintroduces the joyful pictorial derring-do of an art movement partly done in by the single-minded advocacy of its biggest fan, the great American art critic Clement Greenberg. It is wonderful to see some of the best of this work float free of the Greenbergian claims for greatness and inevitability, propelled by the fantastic soft power of brilliant color, big scale and judicious amounts of pristine raw canvas -- especially as wielded by Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski. Perhaps humorless power-lust prevented Greenberg from seeing that if, as he said, Abstract Expressionism was Baroque, then Color Field might be Rococo: beautiful, sometimes frivolous and even comedic. Eighth Street and F Street, NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Smith)

 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000' The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) 
 ANTON KANNEMEYER: 'THE HAUNT OF FEARS' A fearless and funny South African political satirist, Mr. Kannemeyer paints and draws works on paper that expertly imitate the style of Herge's Tintin comics. This exhibition features pieces from a series representing letters of the alphabet. ''N is for Nightmare'' depicts a peaceful suburban home with circular vignettes representing two natives brandishing a spear and a machete, and a black woman serving a white man's head on a platter. Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'DETROIT' The McDermott & McGough Wayback machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Nicholas Robinson consists of extraordinarily lucid, richly colored staged photographs resembling stills from an old film about teenage love, desire, wanderlust and guilt. Nicholas Robinson, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GUSTAVE COURBET' Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 BLAKE RAYNE The abstract paintings in this show, an important one for this impressive New York artist, were made with aerosol spray directed at folded, cut and stitched-together canvas. And the pictures are only part of a larger conceptual package that includes the display of the paintings' shipping containers and has involved closing the gallery for a week. Mr. Rayne's taking apart of art conventions is erudite, visually effective and of a piece: the installation looks like a cross between a paneled library and a spreading bruise. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Those Gas Prices: Think Outside the Tank

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Gas Prices Send Surge of Riders to Mass Transit'' (front page, May 10) is only a portent of what is to come. 
 Given the ceiling on daily global oil production, the rise of demand in countries such as China and India and the lack of careful planning in the United States to deal with oil shortages, prices are bound to keep increasing. We could be paying $5 to $6 per gallon by midsummer. 
 We need to change our view of transportation and start changing our behavior now. We need to mandate new and higher fuel economy standards now; we need to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles now; we need to plan our trips better now.
 But above all, we need to start investing now in new and less polluting energy sources for transportation that do not rely on oil. By this fall we will look back at $4-per-gallon gasoline with nostalgia, wishing for the good old days that price reflected.
 Mark Safford Warwick, R.I., May 10, 2008
 The writer is an associate with the Futures Strategy Group.
 To the Editor:
 As a transit expert, I find it painful to watch local and state agencies cut back mass transit service just when demand is surging because of skyrocketing gas prices. 
 Federal transportation financing is both broke and broken. Many state and local governments are still spending foolishly to expand roads that fuel urban sprawl, traffic and global warming pollution. 
 Congress in future climate and transportation legislation must encourage innovation at the community and state levels through new incentives and accountability. Transportation spending should be tied to cutting traffic growth and greenhouse gas pollution. 
 Congress should promote pay-as-you-drive insurance to save consumers money and knock down barriers to congestion pricing that could finance better transit. With today's gas prices, we simply can't afford another transportation bill that favors highways and sprawl over public transportation and smart growth.
 Michael A. Replogle Washington, May 14, 2008
 The writer is transportation director, Environmental Defense.
 To the Editor: 
 The day of reckoning may finally be here for car-dependent suburbs and exurbs. Governments in America and other countries have allowed or encouraged sprawling urban areas that are environmentally unsustainable. 
 That never mattered enough for governments to stop sprawl, but now these areas are becoming economically unsustainable as well because of surging gas prices. 
 The Bush White House wanted to let markets rule, so now the people will have to pay the price for that.
 Paul Rogers London, May 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Oil Prices Are Up and Politicians Are Angry. Yawn'' (Week in Review, May 11):
 In Canada we understand resources. One way to lower gasoline prices is suggested by your May 10 article ''Gas Prices Send Surge of Riders to Mass Transit'': take the revenue from a healthy windfall profits tax on oil companies and invest it in mass transit.
 Subsidize monthly transit passes and more frequent service, expand transit networks, build more commuter rail and high-speed regional rail. Passenger traffic would expand exponentially. This will lower demand for gasoline, which will bring prices down. It will also lower carbon emissions and reduce road congestion.

HEADLINE: Teach for America

 BODY:
To maintain its standing as an economic power, the United States must encourage programs that help students achieve the highest levels in math and science, especially in poor communities where the teacher corps is typically weak. 
 The National Academies, the country's leading science advisory group, has called for an ambitious program to retrain current teachers in these disciplines and attract 10,000 new ones each year for the foreseeable future. These are worthy goals. But a new study from a federal research center based at the Urban Institute in Washington suggests that the country might raise student performance through programs like Teach for America, a nonprofit group that places high-achieving college graduates in schools that are hard to staff. 
 Teach for America started in 1990. By next fall, it will have more than 6,000 young teachers working nationwide. These teachers, many of whom come from elite colleges, commit to two years' teaching. Besides their salaries, they receive modest federal grants and the right to defer loan payments while teaching.
 Critics have challenged the program's usefulness, pointing out that the teachers it places are neophytes and that a majority leave the classroom after two years. But the new study suggests that talented young people can have a lasting effect even if they do not make a career of teaching. According to the study, Teach for America participants who worked in North Carolina between 2000 and 2006 had more impact on student performance than traditional teachers did, as measured by end-of-course tests. The difference was observed in several areas of science and was strongest in math. 
 The findings are especially significant because Teach for America teachers worked in schools with the neediest students. The results suggest that states that want students to do better in math and science need to focus recruitment on more selective colleges instead of on traditional teacher education programs, which are often little more than diploma mills.

HEADLINE: V.A. Disavows Combat Stress Memo

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
An internal e-mail message written by a Veterans Affairs Department employee suggested that the agency avoid giving a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder for veterans and instead consider a diagnosis that might result in a lower disability payment. 
 The message, dated March 20 and titled ''Suggestion,'' said: ''Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans, I'd like to suggest that we refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out. Consider a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, R/O PTSD.'' R/O stands for ''rule out.'' 
 ''Additionally,'' it said, ''we really don't or have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD.'' 
 A copy of the message was distributed on Thursday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, and by VoteVets.org, a lobbying group opposed to the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 
 In a statement, Dr. James B. Peake, the secretary of veterans affairs, called the suggestions ''inappropriate.'' The employee's name was not released. 
 ''We are committed to absolute accuracy in a diagnosis and unwavering in providing any and all earned benefits,'' said Dr. Peake, a retired Army lieutenant general and surgeon. ''P.T.S.D. and the mental health arena is no exception.''
 A recent study by the Rand Corporation reported that about one in five troops with service in Iraq or Afghanistan has symptoms of major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
