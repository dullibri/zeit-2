HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates for Governor Struggle to Stir Interest

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Peter F. Vallone rounded up a battery of police union leaders on the steps of City Hall the other morning to endorse his campaign for governor. When the speeches ended, Mr. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, invited questions about his candidacy. He was met with silence. "Unrelated question?" a radio reporter finally asked, as Mr. Vallone grimaced.
At a Democratic club on the Upper West Side a few days earlier, Betsy McCaughey Ross was discussing her campaign with leaders when the moderator of the evening abruptly cut her off, announcing that another gubernatorial candidate was waiting to speak. As a puzzled-looking Ms. McCaughey Ross, the Lieutenant Governor, gathered her belongings, the moderator beckoned an unfamiliar figure to the front of the room. After a moment's confusion, it turned out that "our next candidate for governor" was a reporter there to hear the speeches. 
 This is shaping up to be one of the most compelling political seasons in New York in years. But for now, at least, that does not seem to include the gubernatorial candidates, who are struggling to rally interest from the public, contributors, the press and even, as Ms. McCaughey Ross discovered, supposedly informed Democratic leaders.
Not surprisingly, the Democrats seeking to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki are encountering many of the same problems that Democrats faced against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997. They are challenging a popular, politically skillful and financially strong incumbent running for re-election during the kind of good times that normally work against challengers.
But candidates for governor are encountering an unexpected obstacle this time around: the race for United States Senate. The contest to unseat Alfonse M. D'Amato, which has drawn Geraldine A. Ferraro out of political retirement, is drawing interest, money and even potential campaign issues away from the gubernatorial race, leaving it an impoverished stepchild struggling for attention.
Democratic leaders these days are far more likely to perk up at the mention of Mr. D'Amato's name than they are at Mr. Pataki's.
"It's got the potential to be a very interesting race," David Eichenbaum, Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager, said of the race to challenge Mr. Pataki. But, he added with a note of sympathy for his compatriots running gubernatorial campaigns, "the challenge is how to make it one."
In addition to Mr. Vallone and Ms. McCaughey Ross, the other Democratic candidates for governor are Richard A. Kahan, a developer and the former chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation; James L. Larocca, the former State Transportation Commissioner, and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney.
To be sure, the candidates and their aides said, it is still relatively early in the race. Ms. McCaughey Ross, speaking to the single reporter who showed up to watch her serve as principal for the day on the Upper East Side last week, brushed aside any concern about the state of the race. "I'm sure that most voters aren't really paying attention yet," she said.
And several Democrats said they found it difficult to believe that New Yorkers do not have the appetite for two major contested races at the same time, even in these times of diminished interest in politics. "This is not a competition between races -- it's a competition between candidates," said Kevin R. McCabe, Mr. Vallone's campaign manager. "The Senate race will be the Senate race. The gubernatorial race will actually be just as exciting by the time it's over."
But with the state Democratic convention just three weeks away, and with the Senate race already a regular feature in news coverage and television advertising, an increasing number of Democrats are becoming concerned that the patterns being set today are likely to prevail between now and Election Day. Indeed, it is a measure of the standing of the governor's race that Democrats tend to grow more animated talking about the race for attorney general, in which the incumbent, Dennis C. Vacco, is seen as vulnerable.
That feeling that the gubernatorial race is a foregone conclusion might be underlined today if the Liberal Party, as is widely expected among Democratic leaders, announces that it will support Ms. McCaughey Ross in November. If that happens and if Ms. McCaughey Ross does not win the Democratic nomination, that would create a split in the anti-Pataki vote that would probably insure Mr. Pataki's re-election. Even if Ms. McCaughey Ross wins the Democratic primary, many party leaders see her as Mr. Pataki's weakest opponent because she served in his government before switching parties to run against him.
For all their obvious obscurity so far, the candidates have, to some extent, been active. Mr. Larocca, Mr. Hynes and Mr. Kahan, for example, have spent much of the last year traveling across the state, discussing in particular what they describe as the state's weak economic performance under Mr. Pataki. Mr. Larocca drew notice among Democratic leaders this week for his performance at a candidates forum in Rochester.
But Mr. Vallone, who by virtue of his campaign financing is seen as a leading candidate in the race, has chosen in recent weeks to pay more attention to his duties as Council Speaker than to the campaign. He skipped the Rochester debate, saying he had a prior commitment at a budget hearing in Queens.
And it has so far been Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, rather than the candidates, who have taken the lead in attacking $1.6 billion in vetoes that Mr. Pataki made in state spending -- a series of vetoes that Democratic leaders believe may provide candidates the opportunity they need to mount a strong campaign against him.
In the end, perhaps the best indication of the state of the governor's race comes from the actions of Mr. Pataki himself. Unlike Mr. D'Amato, who has packed his schedule with campaign-like appearances, Mr. Pataki has kept a markedly low profile, confining his activities to state government business and doing what he can to keep attention away from the race.
Mr. Pataki's political adviser, Zenia Mucha, said the lack of activity so far amounted to a public endorsement of the "Governor's policies of creating jobs, reducing crime and reforming welfare, which have made this state a better place." But a revealing moment later, the woman who is to help direct Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign was stumped when asked to assess the Democratic field facing her boss.
"What are there, five of them?" she asked. "Four of them?"

HEADLINE: U.N. Envoy Likely to Get Energy Post

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Bill Richardson, the United States representative to the United Nations, is likely to be chosen as President Clinton's next energy secretary, Clinton Administration officials said today.
While Mr. Richardson would be giving up one of the most high-profile jobs in American diplomacy -- a job that he seemed to relish, given the opportunity for diplomatic trouble-shooting -- the energy post could provide the former House member with a stronger platform to pursue higher political office. 
 Mr. Richardson is mentioned in political circles as a potential running mate if Vice President Al Gore wins the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.
Mr. Richardson would replace Federico F. Pena, one of President Clinton's longest-serving Cabinet officers, who announced last month that he would step down.
Mr. Richardson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982 and was re-elected seven times.
There was rampant speculation within the State Department and at the United States Mission to the United Nations over who would succeed Mr. Richardson in New York. Most officials agreed that there were two obvious candidates: Richard Holbrooke, the former diplomat who brokered the 1995 Bosnian peace agreement, and George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader who was the architect of last month's peace settlement in Northern Ireland.
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, insisted that there was still no decision on whether to name Mr. Richardson to the energy post.
"There is no decision on the energy secretary," Mr. Toiv said. "He would be a very strong candidate given his experience as a Congressman from New Mexico, but he's doing a fantastic job at the U.N."
Mr. Richardson, who was in Washington today to make a speech, called reports that he was a candidate to become energy secretary "just press speculation on a premature report."
Asked if he ruled out taking the job, Mr. Richardson smiled and said, "We all serve at the pleasure of the President."
The only apparent stumbling block for Mr. Richardson in obtaining Senate confirmation to the energy post would be the job offer that he made last year to Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who is alleged to have had a sexual relationship with President Clinton.
Mr. Richardson has said that he offered a position to Ms. Lewinsky only because she seemed well-suited to a job open at the United States Mission to the United Nations. Critics of the Clinton Administration have charged that the job offer was made at the request of the White House to get Ms. Lewinsky out of Washington.
Diplomats at the United Nations had some trouble today sorting out why Mr. Richardson, who is already a member of the Cabinet, would want to give up the excitement of international diplomacy for the nuts and bolts of energy policy.
But the energy job would provide Mr. Richardson with a platform on an important domestic issue and could bring him more attention than his niche at the United Nations, especially with such a visible Secretary of State as Madeleine K. Albright garnering most of the headlines.
Mr. Richardson, who is Mexican-American, is expected to be an appealing running mate to any Presidential candidate eager to capture the Hispanic vote in the big border states. He speaks Spanish fluently and was reared in Mexico City.
In his home state of New Mexico, he is frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for governor or for the Senate. The state's economy is hugely dependent on the Energy Department's national laboratories and on its nuclear weapons testing program.
F. Chris Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, said: "The energy position is so important, particularly to New Mexico, that if he's looking to run in a statewide race, this would certainly help him in a very tangible way. The United Nations position is more symbolic."
Mr. Garcia said that the energy post would also give Mr. Richardson a chance to prove his administrative skills in heading a large department. But whether Mr. Richardson goes to energy or stays at the U.N., Mr. Garcia said, "It's difficult for him to do the wrong thing."
While still in the House, Mr. Richardson served as a roving diplomatic trouble-shooter for the Clinton Administration, traveling to parts of the world where most Americans fear to tread: North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria and Myanmar.
The trips were often remarkably fruitful, with Mr. Richardson winning the release of several hostages held by governments or rebel leaders unfriendly to the United States. Last month, Mr. Richardson became the first American Cabinet member to visit Afghanistan in more than two decades and obtain agreements from the warring factions there to begin peace talks.

HEADLINE: Border War As a Ploy: Companies Seldom Lose

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Close the borders.
Wall Street is defecting to Jersey City. The Yankees are abandoning the Bronx for the New Jersey Meadowlands. The New Jersey Nets are vaulting over Manhattan to get to a new home at the Nassau Coliseum. 
 Officials on both sides of the Hudson River are loading their muskets with steely pronouncements and alluring tax breaks as the economic border battles threaten to break into a full-scale war.
Well, probably not.
In keeping with a longstanding tradition, corporations and sports teams today routinely play on the insecurities of public officials who fret over losing a business to the other side. H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, chalks it up to pure posturing by the corporations in an attempt to scare public officials into granting tax breaks, land and cash.
"The border wars are really a milking of the public sector, rather than a determining factor in where a company wants to go," said Mr. Shostal, a former real estate executive who once lured companies to New Jersey but now opposes the practice. "The region doesn't benefit from all this shuffling around."
In the latest skirmish, the New York Stock Exchange announced this week that it had received an offer by New Jersey to build a $1 billion trading floor with a glittering array of tax breaks. (Of course, that offer came after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he would try to grab up New Jersey's sports teams -- which came after New Jersey officials said they would welcome the Yankees.)
On Tuesday, New Jersey officials presented Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, with a menu of tax rebates, grants and loans that would be available to the exchange if it moved to Jersey City or elsewhere in the state.
On Thursday, Mr. Grasso called the deal rewarding. But not before saying that he would rather stay in New York, where he favored building a new home at Battery Park City.
It was all in the time-honored fashion of Prudential Securities, Bear Stearns and Standard & Poor's: pitting one state against another in a game of corporate poker that usually results in a multimillion-dollar tax break to stay in Manhattan.
In fact, despite New Jersey's fervor and enticements, three developers there who are most likely to build a headquarters for the exchange expressed doubts yesterday that the stock exchange would ever abandon lower Manhattan.
"We have spoken to the state, but we have not been approached by the exchange," said Leonard Stern, chairman of Hartz Mountain Industries, whose company is building a new office building at the Colgate center in Jersey City. "If they want to come to brush their teeth at Colgate, we're a player. But I think the stock exchange certainly wants to stay in New York."
But that did not stop the political back and forth across the Hudson, which was traded as fervently as a hot new stock.
"The fact that a body as auspicious and august as the New York Stock Exchange is even talking about New Jersey as a potential home shows what a good place it is to do business," Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday. "Whether it comes to fruition or not, I have no way of knowing."
Not to be outdone, Mayor Giuliani fired back, accusing the stock exchange of "pitting New Jersey against New York to get a better deal" and warning his neighbor that if it got "too interested in our businesses, we could become very interested in their sports teams and I think it would work, because some of them are very unhappy in New Jersey."
Mr. Giuliani's apparent preoccupation with sports teams may actually be the snag that has slowed down the talks between the city and the stock exchange.
Some executives at the stock exchange, who have been scouring lower Manhattan for two years for expansion space or a new headquarters, say city officials seem to be spending an inordinate amount of time on stadiums for baseball teams, rather than on a business that pours hundreds of millions of dollars into the state and city coffers.
They say the exchange is in desperate need of new quarters: the number of companies listed on the exchange has jumped by 550 since 1996, and the average daily trading volume has grown by 50 percent.
"We would like to finalize a deal," said Robert Zito, senior vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. "Whatever the reasons for the delay, you'll have to check with the city."
Mr. Zito also said that New Jersey was now an option, one "that we hadn't even thought of two weeks ago."
Of course, the exchange is looking for the sweetest deal it can get -- one that probably lies in New York. Officials say they want the same deal given the Mercantile Exchange, the commodity market that recently completed a new headquarters at Battery Park City with the help of a $183.9 million incentive package from the city. The deal with the Mercantile Exchange came after it had engaged in its own decadelong corporate poker game.
Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said that City Hall had not ignored the New York Stock Exchange.
"The Mayor and Governor have spent more time with Dick Grasso than anyone in New Jersey has," Ms. Roche said. "This is merely a negotiating strategy and an attempt to drive up the price."
Most often, corporations say that such deals with tax breaks are a key consideration in whether to relocate a business. But at this point, the deals have become so routine that it has become hard for city or state officials to say no.
In a moment of candor, Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of CBS, explained why his company had received a $49.5 million benefit package in 1992. "We never threatened to leave the city," he said at the time. "I just wanted to be treated like everyone else."
Yesterday, the Mayor said he doubted that there was even a lucrative offer from New Jersey, recalling that Mr. Grasso had promised him that the exchange would remain in New York.
Mr. Giuliani said he would prefer that the exchange try to expand on Broad Street, although he would consider other options, including a vacant lot at Battery Park City.
But Gualberto Medina, New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, said he believed that his state was in serious contention for the exchange.
"We are convinced that we are not just a stalking horse here," Mr. Medina said.
In keeping with the state of relations on both sides of the Hudson, Mr. Medina held out hope for a reconciliation. "We hope to invite the Mayor to the groundbreaking for the stock exchange in New Jersey," Mr. Medina said. "He is our friend, and we invite our friends to important events."

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE PLUNGES TO 4.3%, LOWEST SINCE 1970

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate tumbled in April to 4.3 percent, the lowest level in nearly three decades, and employers added more than a quarter-million jobs to payrolls, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The steep drop in unemployment, from 4.7 percent in March, is superb news for most Americans whose pay is now rising faster than the cost of living and who are employed in greater numbers -- 64.2 percent of the population -- than ever. 
 "It's a great number," said Arthur J. Rolnick, senior vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. "This is exactly what we have been shooting for for almost 20 years: strong growth and low inflation."
But signs that the labor market is getting tighter are also flashing yellow lights for forecasters and investors. They worry that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is now a step closer to raising interest rates at the central bank's next monetary policy meeting, on May 19. Other things equal, higher rates tend to slow the economy and thwart inflationary pressure by reining in purchases of interest-sensitive items like houses, cars and, especially, stocks.
Investors, on the lookout for hints of inflation or clues to the Federal Reserve's next move, reacted relatively calmly. Prices in the bond market eased slightly but there was no selloff. And the stock market rose, snapping a three-day decline, as the strength in the job market was seen as a sign that consumers would keep spending and corporate earnings might hold up better than expected.
The size of the decline in joblessness may have been exaggerated by an unexpected drop in the number of workers who said they were working or looking for work -- a figure that zigs and zags from month to month. But strong growth in employment, including self-employment, accounted for more than half of the April decline that took the jobless rate to its lowest level since February 1970.
The trend was widespread, affecting every major demographic group. For Hispanic workers, the April unemployment rate of 6.5 percent was the lowest since data were first collected separately in 1973; the rate for blacks, 8.9 percent, was the lowest in all but one month since 1973.
"You always have to be cautious with one month's data," said Tom Nardone, chief of labor force statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the jobs report. "But it does look as if unemployment has ratcheted down again."
The report underscored the very strong start to the second quarter. The momentum in the job market is such that most economists, inside the Fed and out, expect the unemployment rate to edge down even further.
"There's still room to move down," said Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton University, "because of the pool of the people who are available to work, especially high school dropouts and workers who have only high school degrees."
That does not mean that unemployment can fall forever, of course. Few economists believe that unemployment can stay at, say, 4 percent for a long period of time without causing inflation to speed up.
Job growth, which had stalled in March because of unusually cold weather, was back to the fast pace of most of the last year. Jobs in construction, restaurants and retail stores rebounded. Payrolls of local governments swelled sharply. Companies in the services sector did a lot of hiring, adding 139,000 jobs. Most of the jobs were in finance, insurance, real estate and computer services, exactly those parts of the economy where demand has been booming.
The rapid pace of hiring is leading to shortages of certain kinds of workers. Thomas Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, who has visited 60 cities in the last seven months, said trucking companies, hotels, restaurants and hospitals were facing the most acute shortages of qualified help. High-technology concerns, from telephone companies to software developers, are having trouble filling vacancies as well. "There's been a major acceleration in retirements, and the hot economy is demanding more people than ever before," Mr. Donohue said. "It's going to get worse."
Manufacturing, buffeted by the economic crisis in Asia and a pileup in inventories at the end of last quarter, is virtually the only cool spot in an otherwise hot labor market. Some 10,000 factory jobs disappeared last month, mostly in export-sensitive industries like electronics and heavy machinery. But Mr. Nardone of the Bureau of Labor Statistics pointed out that the losses were small relative to the strong gain of 169,000 industrial jobs from September through January.
April was an opportune time to go job hunting. Nearly 700,000 unemployed workers found jobs. The number of jobless fell below six million and the number of people who had been out of work for 15 weeks or more shrank sharply.
Almost every major demographic group had an easier time finding work. For teen-agers, the jobless rate fell to 13.1 percent, and for high school dropouts, to 7 percent. Unemployment among workers with high school diplomas and those with some college, roughly 60 percent of the work force, fell the most. Their unemployment rates dropped to 3.9 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.
Workers are taking home real pay gains as wages continue rising faster than inflation. Hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose 4 cents, to $12.67, and are up 4.4 percent over April 1997; the Consumer Price Index rose just 1.5 percent in that period.
Wage inflation, while hardly alarming, is creeping up. Compared with the 4.4 percent increase of the last 12 months, wages grew just 3.7 percent and 3.1 percent in the two previous years. Not surprisingly, given the buoyant stock market, the biggest gains in pay are showing up in the services sector in general and financial services in particular. Pay in finance, insurance and real estate was up 7.3 percent from a year earlier, for example.
Despite the boom in construction, however, the pay increase for hard hats is less than 4 percent, while factory pay is just inching up, at less than a 3 percent annual rate.
For the last couple of years, solid growth in productivity has offset part of the rise in wages, and the strong dollar, lower oil prices and the shift to managed health care have helped suppress price pressures. For those in the central bank who believe that the labor market is not a good predictor of inflation, yesterday's report did nothing to raise alarms. But for those who believe the opposite, yesterday's report confirmed longstanding fears.

HEADLINE: Fretting Over Grip on House, G.O.P. Courts Conservatives

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
After months of confidence that the nation was heading into a serene, status-quo election, Republicans are suddenly worried that they could lose control of the House this November unless they energize their conservative base.
"There's a whole host of warning signs," said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and former executive director of the Christian Coalition. "My own view is that the Republican House majority is in jeopardy. I'm not predicting a Democratic pickup. I'm just saying it's in jeopardy." 
 This concern has been driving a variety of House actions lately and was much in evidence today as House Republican leaders huddled at the Library of Congress with a wide array of Christian and other social-issue conservatives.
After a contentious three-hour session, the senior Republicans vowed a new commitment to the agenda of the groups, which were a crucial element of the Republican Congressional victories in 1994 and 1996. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, described the meeting as "a lot of good, solid, frank talk about our concerns, their concerns, listening to each other and carrying on a dialogue."
The meeting came at a pivotal political moment for the Republicans.
The chairman of the House Republicans' re-election committee, Representative John Linder of Georgia, still maintains publicly that House Republicans will pick up at least 10 to 15 seats. But Mr. Linder acknowledges, "We've got to energize the base. I also want very much to energize my colleagues who need an understanding it's a political year."
Republicans say Mr. Linder was far blunter in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican leadership just after the last Congressional recess in mid-April. He gave his fellow Republicans a strategy memorandum warning that they could endanger their majority status unless they started drawing sharp distinctions between themselves and the Democrats.
The sudden jitters among Republicans have several causes. For one thing, the Republicans have more districts to worry about than they had expected, defending 17 open seats as compared to 16 for the Democrats. And they have little room for error. The Republicans' 11-seat majority is the narrowest in the House in half a century.
The death of Representative Steven H. Schiff of New Mexico and the unexpected decision by Representative Wes W. Watkins of Oklahoma not to seek re-election have left the party with uphill fights. Mr. Watkins, for example, is a former Democrat and his district is known as Little Dixie because of its traditional Democratic allegiance. It was once held by Speaker Carl Albert.
In addition, voters for months now have consistently told pollsters they prefer a Democratic Congress over a Republican one or else they put the parties at a virtual tie. Such poll readings are considered a rough but useful indicator of the political terrain on which individual candidates must fight.
Democrats are also doing remarkably well financially. An analysis of reports to the Federal Election Commission shows that Democrats in the 33 open House seats are raising more money than the Republicans are. The typical Democratic candidate in an open seat has $112,415 cash on hand, compared with $77,688 for the typical Republican.
Perhaps most importantly, House Republicans have become concerned that social conservatives, who can help Republicans turn out their core supporters, are increasingly disaffected with a Congress that has not been able to deliver on their issues.
"It's very clear that the people who stand out in the rain for us have not been enamored with the past year," said Representative Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is one of the conservative members of the sophomore class.
Mr. Graham praised party leaders for reacting, saying, "What's stupid is to ignore the obvious."
These concerns, Republicans said, help explain why the leadership is scheduling an array of votes over the next several months on issues dear to conservatives, such as prayer in the schools, even though much of that legislation has no chance of passage.
It is also, Republicans said, one reason Speaker Newt Gingrich has returned to his old, more slashing style, accusing President Clinton recently of corruption, coverup and a dearth of moral authority.
Today, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. DeLay and Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, met with about 20 groups representing a conservative grass-roots base -- among them the Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, the National Right to Life Committee, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention and the Home School Legal Defense Association.
When it was over, Mr. Gingrich said that "on almost every major issue the people who are meeting represent the vast majority of Americans." He lashed out at the National Endowment for the Arts, saying "every time people see the latest example of pornography, the latest example of obscenity they say, 'Why are my tax dollars being wasted on that kind of activity?' "
Mr. Gingrich said House Republicans would dedicate themselves to phasing out from the tax code the so-called marriage penalty under which many couples pay more than they would if they were single taxpayers. He also pledged renewed drives to ban a particular form of late-term abortion, known by opponents as partial-birth abortion, and to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.
The House leaders created a new House task force called the "Values Action Team," headed by Representative Joseph R. Pitts, a Pennsylvania Republican, to coordinate with the groups on an array of legislation.
Next week the House takes up legislation important to Christian conservatives that could impose economic sanctions on countries that persecute people for their religious beliefs. Coming this summer is a vote on a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in schools.
The groups said the session could be the beginning of a rapprochement, but that they were looking for action, not just promises.
James Dobson, whose "Focus on the Family" radio show draws 5 million listeners, said there was "good discussion," but added, "only time will tell. It's easy to talk about things. It is tougher to get action in Congress and certainly in the Senate."
The Democrats have welcomed the Republicans' latest tack to the right, saying it also serves to energize their own core voters.
"Newt is a great fund-raiser for the Republicans and should not be discounted in any way," said Representative Martin Frost, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Democrats' election committee. "But the more Newt goes on television, the more small donations we get from the mail. He's a fund-raiser for them and a fund-raiser for us. It's a very interesting situation."
At the spring meeting of the Democratic National Committee today, Roy Romer, the party's national chairman, said that Mr. Gingrich was following a "losing political strategy."
Democrats at the meeting said they had a chance to reverse the historical trend in which the party in the White House loses seats in Congress in a midterm election.
"I think there is a chance the Democrats will gain seats, which is unprecedented, and I think there is a possibility they will regain control of the House," said Mark Gersh, the chairman of the National Committee for an Effective Congress, which is a Democratic advocacy group.
Not every Republican is comfortable with the latest tack of the party. Recent efforts by the House Republicans to end affirmative action and to pass a constitutional amendment limiting tax increases have failed, with some moderate Republicans bolting from the party.
Representative John Kasich of Ohio is also having a hard time selling to his fellow Republicans a budget plan he drafted that would cut domestic spending by $154 billion -- including elimination of the Commerce and Energy Departments and the National Endowment of the Arts.
Mr. Kasich acknowledged this week that he was still scaling back his proposal. "I don't know where we're going to end up at the end of doing this," he said. "We are not interested in making the Federal Government bigger."

A Call for Splitting Surplus

 WASHINGTON, May 8 (AP) -- Mr. Gingrich says projected Federal budget surpluses now look so big that they should be split evenly between cutting taxes and shoring up Social Security.
In recent weeks, Mr. Gingrich had been saying the surplus should be used to reinforce Social Security by distributing it among Americans to establish "personal retirement accounts" that would supplement their retirement income.
President Clinton wants the surplus to strengthen Social Security and the House Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Kasich, had said tax cuts should be paid for by cutting spending.

HEADLINE: Lessons of Rome For Today's Politics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Speaker Newt Gingrich invokes a powerful historical precedent in warning that 1990's America is confronted with many of the conditions that brought down the Roman Republic (news article, May 3). But the problems he cites -- a state "corrupted by foreign money, by personal ambition, by a politics so vicious" -- miss the causes of that disintegration. 
 The crisis sprang from growing social inequality and the unrestrained avarice of Rome's upper classes. After the assassination of the reformist Gracchus brothers, conservative senators blocked off avenues of peaceful political reform. Wealthy candidates lavished fortunes on campaigns that dealt less and less with real issues.
A frustrated populace began embracing conquering generals who confronted senate oligarchs with force, and a downward spiral began. Maybe the Speaker is on to something.

HEADLINE: The Georgia Republican Who Uses the I-Word

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Representative Bob Barr complained that he had a plane to catch, but the young female security guard at the airport metal detector cursed and instructed her colleague to take her time looking through his bag. When Mr. Barr angrily demanded her name, she stuck her ID in his face, and he slapped her arms down forcefully. She came charging back at him, and he yelled, "Nobody swears at me!" The guards who quickly surrounded them led her away, and he walked on.
A few seconds later, when he pulled out his ticket to check the gate, his hand was not trembling. Did the incident not bother him? "Not at all," he said. "The problem is they hire these people with no education or training." 
 Mr. Barr, a Republican of Georgia, is President Clinton's most energetic detractor in the House, where he is leading the drive for an impeachment inquiry, and he often has occasion to vent his anger these days.
As a frequent guest on the Washington talk shows, Mr. Barr, a former prosecutor, argues that the President has very likely broken a number of laws. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Barr's more unsettling shows of temper are well known among colleagues on both sides of the aisle, who whisper about the committee meetings where he had to be talked down and about aides who seemed to fear his tongue-lashings.
But if he is not Mr. Congeniality in the Class of '94, he is an important figure for members of his party's conservative base, who express disappointment that few Republicans on the Hill are as mad as they are about the Presidential scandals. A number of Congressional Republicans say they are glad Mr. Barr is on the case, acting out their common private resentment that the Democrat in the White House is probably getting away with something.
And though impeachment remains unlikely, the Republican leadership has moved somewhat closer to Mr. Barr's position. For the last two weeks, Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, has taken out after Mr. Clinton nearly every day. He also met privately in Georgia with Mr. Barr, who declined to talk about their discussion. But when Mr. Gingrich spoke of a cover-up and a "line in the sand" and said, "This is not about sex, this is about lawbreaking," he was echoing the language that Mr. Barr has been using for months.
Mr. Gingrich is still not even close to using the I-word, and many in Congress say he is considering appointing a special committee to handle any impeachment inquiry specifically to get around Mr. Barr and a couple of other firebrands on the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Barr said he did not consider himself a particularly angry guy. Of his outbursts in committee, he said, "Sometimes what we have to deal with is just beyond the pale. It's hard to sit there with a nice smile on your face."
And of the airport incident with the security guard on April 25, Mr. Barr said he merely "moved her arms away. I think if anybody had a security guard who got in their face and swore at them, they would get angry or be intimidated."
These days, Mr. Barr often travels nationally to speak about impeachment -- as he did recently at the invitation of the John Birch Society, which paid for a trip to Los Angeles. And on the road, his fight is anything but lonely.
On a recent weekend, Mr. Barr began Saturday morning in his heavily conservative north Georgia district in the new Douglas County courthouse, at an event for high school students who want to attend one of the service academies. Mr. Barr's father was a West Point man, and he is in his element. But he still does not smile much.
His wife, Jeri, who at the event wore red, white and blue and American flag earrings, heads a social service agency for homeless people in Cobb County, where the Barrs live. She says she often beeps her husband when he is on television: "Smile, honey," is the message.
At the next event, he joined a group of men in Confederate uniforms and women in hoop skirts, all suited up for a barbecue at Twelve Oaks on the edge of a parking lot.
"In Washington, particularly in the area of holding our leaders accountable, one of the great figures is Robert E. Lee," Mr. Barr said. "We try to keep in mind the standards of General Lee. There is more to our Southern heritage than whether the economy is running well."
Mr. Barr remarked how energizing these trips home were after the week in Washington, where he slept on his office couch, E-mailing his staff at all hours of the night.
After Mr. Barr rushed to the Atlanta airport, and had the run-in, his flight to Austin was delayed. While he waited, he voiced small and large resentments, about airline service, high prices and the I.R.S. Passing a cigar store reminded him that the Government "is trying to go after" cigars now: "Of course. People like it, so let's regulate it."
Mrs. Barr said the incident with the security guard reminded her of the time she was delayed by security people at Washington Dulles. "They were all from other countries, and they were talking about me in their language, and I couldn't even tell what they were saying," she said. "I thought, 'Hey, this is my country. This is my home airport.' "
There was one bit of good news. Glancing at a newspaper, Mr. Barr said, "Hey! They canceled 'Ellen.' " Mrs. Barr said: "It wasn't as funny after she made her announcement."
When Mr. Barr seemed buoyed by the sight of an airport Starbucks, she exposed him as a fan of the store's espresso shots. Her husband chuckled in guilty pleasure and said his staff did not really approve of him patronizing such a liberal company.
When the Barrs stopped for lunch at an airport TGI Friday's, he talked about his many problems with Mr. Clinton. It quickly became obvious that his objections were more legal than moral. He talked about the Constitution rather than the Bible. He seemed obsessed not by sex but by possible breaches in national security. And when he mentioned Monica Lewinsky, it was only to call her a bit player in the current spectacle.
"There's something very wrong with what this President is doing, and if we don't do something, I worry about the future of our country," he said.
At 49, Mr. Barr is only a year younger than Mr. Clinton but seems of another place and time. While Mr. Clinton grew up in the small-town South, apparently bonding for life with every member of his kindergarten class, Mr. Barr spent a rootless childhood in Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan and Panama, where his father took engineering jobs. The years abroad made him more patriotic, he says. He became a Southerner by choice, settling in Georgia as an adult.
In a telephone interview, his mother, Beatrice Barr of Manassas, Va., said her boy was "a usual, obnoxious" kid. "There were six kids and I can say that about every one of them."
While Mr. Clinton was protesting the Vietnam War and smoking dope, Mr. Barr "found other outlets for youth," he said, and cited the Young Trojan Republican Club at the University of Southern California. His mother said that as a freshman he considered joining a group of Democrats -- but came around when she threatened to cut him off. Mr. Barr said his mother, who turned him on to Ayn Rand, still considered him a "flaming liberal" and called regularly to blast his galling moderation.
Mr. Barr became active in a fraternity for young men who hoped to join the foreign service. He married before college graduation, and later went to work for the C.I.A. while studying law at Georgetown University. When he links Mr. Clinton to "the 60's counterculture," it is with considerable venom.
He first became interested in running for office, he said, when Richard Nixon disappointed him by tarnishing the reputation of the C.I.A.
And despite his antipathy for this President, Mr. Barr said that he would never call him names. "When I was young I was teased very maliciously at some times and I'm sensitive to that," he said. "I was short. I have scars on the side of my head from an operation I had after I was born." He recalled being chosen last for sports teams, and said he had never really been much for socializing and had made no close friends on the Hill.
In fact Mr. Barr is as hard on himself as on any of his political foes and often repeats that he does not consider himself very smart. But he is sensitive to the criticism he has taken in recent years, especially in sponsoring the Defense of Marriage Act. Critics said that as a twice-divorced man, he had no business moralizing about same-sex unions.
Mr. Barr seems to avoid attacking Mr. Clinton for his personal life. When asked to describe his primary emotion when he sees the President, he said, "amazement," and sighed. "Here is this man, there's serious evidence he's abused his power, and yet his wife sticks by him, every one of his colleagues in the House stick by him and a large number of the American people."
He seems to feel that he himself would not be so fortunate, though he has survived a few mini-scandals of his own, including minor campaign finance problems.
When he arrived in Texas just before dusk at a country club with a dazzling view of the hills outside Austin, Mr. Barr found himself surrounded by the like-minded members of the Texas Review of Law and Politics, which published his article on impeachment and named it "article of the year." They give him a standing ovation.
But he seems more comfortable battling an absent adversary than taking compliments. When one man told him how brave he was to go on programs like "Crossfire," he squirmed a little. And when another called him "a spokesperson for the truth," he changed the subject.

William Faulkner

BYLINE: By Beverly Lowry; Beverly Lowry is the author of "Crossed Over: A Murder, a Memoir" (Knopf).

 BODY:
This is not a dream. It's real. For lunch, one warm perfect day in Oxford, Miss., I had a grilled portobello mushroom and Italian ham sandwich. The mushroom had been quickly flamed so that it was nicely browned along the edges, but as juicy in the middle as rare beef. When I dipped a chunk of it into the olive oil in a shallow bowl beside my plate, I was careful to scoop up some of the freshly ground pepper at the bottom.
Later on, cruising the downtown courthouse square, I ran into a friend who asked me what I'd had for lunch. When I told her, she rolled her eyes. "When you can get a portobello sandwich in Oxford, you know we've gone too far," she said. 
 I knew what she meant. I grew up in Mississippi and went to college in Oxford, at the University of Mississippi -- Ole Miss. Back then, a noon meal in any small town in Mississippi meant either a blue-plate special, a burger or barbecue. These days in Oxford, the Bottletree Bakery makes excellent baguettes, croissants and brioche, Don Pancho's spoons up Caribbean fare, and the Henry Cafe serves strictly vegetarian fare on Fiestaware, in a minimalist setting. You can still get excellent barbecue and blue plates -- including huge breakfasts of ham steaks, grits and biscuits at Smitty's -- and good fried chicken breast on a stick at the Chevron station, but jazzier options are available, as well.
Leaving the square, I drove down South Lamar. The elegant, mostly antebellum houses lining that street are immaculately kept, and have a delicate, spindly look, like lace dresses preserved in a glass case. Azaleas, dogwood and wisteria ride the hilly yards in careful drifts. At the corner of South Lamar and Old Taylor Road, there is a small sign saying "Rowan Oak." Turn right, drive a couple blocks, park under some trees, and you've arrived at Oxford's main tourist attraction, the home of William Faulkner.
Oxford's no ordinary Southern town. Its population is only about 20,000, half of whom are students at the university. But Rowan Oak -- which Faulkner bought in 1930 and lived in with his wife, Estelle, and his daughter, Jill, until 1960 when he went off to Charlottesville, Va., to teach and ride horses -- draws upward of 12,000 visitors a year. People come from all over the world to trace the events in his books -- "The Sound and the Fury," "Absalom, Absalom!" and "Light in August" among them -- and attach them to the real places of his actual life, and to see where it was he lived and slept and ate. They like to ride around Oxford, the seat of Lafayette County, and reminisce about the fictional counterparts Faulkner created -- the town of Jefferson, the county of Yoknapatawpha -- and the characters he dreamed up and placed there, the Compsons and McCaslins, Sartorises and Snopeses.
"People like to think he planted his behind in that chair and never moved," says the novelist Cynthia Shearer, who has been curator of Rowan Oak for five years. She's referring to the completely ordinary ladderback chair, set at an angle in front of Faulkner's well-photographed and battered portable Underwood, facing a window overlooking his famous stables and horse barn. "We have pictures of him and his typewriter all over the house. Outside, in the library ... Anyway this room was a porch until 1950."
On the walls behind the writer's desk, the day-by-day outline of "A Fable" is famously hand-lettered by Faulkner on the wall. And, Cynthia Shearer points out, there's a potentially significant can of shellac on a bookshelf beside his office chair. After her husband had finished writing "A Fable," Estelle Faulkner, according to legend, rashly ordered the wall repainted, over the outline. Using photographs as a guide, the outraged writer redid it and afterward, shellacked the wall, for the sake of permanence and posterity. (Interestingly enough, the topmost lines of lettering are located about six feet from the floor. Faulkner was about five-two.)
When Faulkner died in 1962, his widow leased Rowan Oak to the University of Mississippi. At that time, only two downstairs rooms were open to public viewing -- his library and office. In 1973, after Estelle Faulkner's death, Jill Faulkner sold the house and 28.5 acres of its surrounding countryside, mostly woods -- known as Bailey's Woods -- to the university.
Set off from the street by a protective shell of swingy cedars and stolid oaks, the house itself, it must be said, is not a thing of beauty. It has columns, meant to lend it an air of grandeur, but really it's just a big old white house. The setting, however, is splendid -- green and whispery, lush with wisteria and roses in the spring. The yard is not fenced off or protected from local foot traffic. There is no entrance fee.
Inside the house, the same sense of stillness pervades. There is nothing for sale. A bowl on a table by the front door usually contains a couple of donated dollars. Guides are prepared to answer questions but if you don't want to ask any and don't feel like listening to stories, you get to do that.
The deed to Rowan Oak states that the house be shown as a memorial to the writer -- not a furniture show. In the beginning, nobody thought any of this out. Curators opened the doors and people came. Somewhere along the way, somebody scissored Faulkner's signature out of every Dickens novel in his collection ... presumably to sell. There is no way of knowing who did that. To this day, khaki pants, tux shirts and many pairs of shoes belonging to Faulkner are shut up in a chifforobe in his bedroom -- some of the shoes still caked with the red mud of northern Mississippi. In one of the curatorial offices, there are boxes of as yet uncatalogued items, including paper shirt collars and a vial of painkillers prescribed in Sweden to ease the writer's back pain so that he could make his 1949 Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
In 1979-80, the house was closed for renovations, including the painting of rooms and structural repair. In 1992, after an extensive fund-raising campaign, the university did major work on the exterior buildings, replacing rotten timbers, rebuilding the barn. But there is as yet no climate control mechanism in the house. In winter, it's heated by radiators. Room air-conditioners have been installed to offset the stifling summer heat. But time, dampness and light have done their work. Soon, Faulkner's books will be transported out of the house for their own protection, replaced with copies, or dummies.
"There are two schools of thought among museum people," Cynthia Shearer explains, as we stand in the formal parlor looking down at a seriously ugly and worn mouse-gray rug. One is to re-create the reality of Faulkner's time. The other is "to keep the original and worship it like the Shroud of Turin." Museum purists wish the university would move the furniture out and exhibit it somewhere where it can be properly preserved, say a real museum, where it would be put behind glass, beyond the reach of mildew and sunlight. Presumably, signs would be put up, saying "Faulkner's Writing Desk," "Faulkner's Hairbrush" and so on.
I spent a long time in Faulkner's bedroom, leaning across the Plexiglas barrier to study the books on the shelf beside his bed. They turned out to be mostly mysteries, as well as some fiction of the times ("Elmer Gantry," "Pal Joey"), a big book called "The Negro in the History of Methodism," which looked unread, and a tome called "The Judgment of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg." An entry number from a horse show is propped on the mantle above a fireplace containing a gas space heater. Faulkner, it is said, was a terrible rider, but loved the pomp and -- especially -- the outfits. There is a painting of him in the parlor in full pink-jacketed hunting gear, looking grimly proud of himself and a bit ridiculous in the top hat. In the library, on another mouse-gray rug, is the wooden shell of a phonograph that serves as an end table. William Faulkner would allow neither a radio nor music to be played in his home. When his wife and daughter bought a record player anyway, he ripped out the mechanisms, and there it sits. If he didn't directly write about his troubled life or his equally troubled marriage, it's not hard to get a strong impression of them, looking at his furniture and things.
Local people get a little weary of the Faulkner myth-making, but they don't minimize its importance. In the past 133 years, the South has had to reinvent itself many times over, and only the towns that have remained open to new ideas have found ways to thrive. Oxford is one of the few Southern towns I know of with a viable downtown. To acknowledge the contribution of the Faulkner industry to Oxford's economy, the mayor and board of aldermen asked William N. Beckwith to design a statue of the writer, to be situated in front of the City Hall. It was installed in September 1997, on the occasion of his 100th birthday. He's seated, with his pipe, looking quizzically away from the other town statue, of a Confederate soldier. Nobody pays much attention to that statue. But it's there.
Oxford was not a literary town in Faulkner's time, but it is now. Barry Hannah lives there, also Larry Brown, Cynthia Shearer and -- some of the time -- John Grisham. A big Conference for the Book takes place in the spring, and the Faulkner conference in August draws scholars from more countries than he probably knew existed. One of the best bookstores in the country, Square Books, stands on what is possibly the best corner on the square, downtown. You can sit in Square Books, drink cappuccino, read books and visit with friends pretty much all afternoon long.
Down the street from Square Books, there's a clever shop called Mississippi Madness, which sells all manner of foods, cookware and Mississippi-made ceramics. A sign of the times: many of the packaged foods are speciality dishes cooked by women who live in dying towns in the state -- caramel icing from Boyle, salad dressing from Yazoo City, black-eyed pea caviar from Clarksdale. At Material Culture, a virtual emporium of "all things Southern and good," I resisted buying a mostly ice-blue painting called "Mississippi the Magnolia State" by the folk artist Sam McMillan in favor of some less pricey purchases at other stores -- a new cassette tape for the drive home, a huge iced cinnamon roll from the Bottletree.
I ended my day in the cemetery, in the north of town. The stately stone marking Faulkner's grave doesn't offer much in the way of messages from the beyond -- only "Beloved Go With God." Like the furniture at Rowan Oak, it looks pretty much store-bought and without mystery.
I had a final dinner with friends at the Yocona River Inn, a small and very pretty converted catfish joint on a country road southeast of town. The restaurant doesn't have a liquor license and so we had to bring our own wine. But the rack of lamb and grilled fresh tuna were nicely cooked, and so was the creme brulee. Unquestionably these are the trendiest kind of dishes, light years from the greens and ham hocks of former days, but I didn't mind. Too much nostalgia can make you stupid, not to mention fat. On the other hand, for old and new times' sake, I've decided to buy that "Mississippi the Magnolia State" painting.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Safer Riding For Children

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
HERE are some cautionary statistics to consider: Traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among children in the United States, killing 2,122 children 15 years of age or younger in 1996 and injuring 330,000, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration figures. And last summer, the Travel Industry Association of America says, 43 percent of adults who traveled took children with them, most of them in the family car.
And in the most recent figures, 40 percent of injuries to passengers under 14 occurred during only one-third of the year -- from May to August -- said Richard A. Schieber, who is in charge of efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce child injuries and deaths. 
 So safety is the first watchword for travel with children, both in and out of the car. Here is a quick review of ways to protect children, plus information on a couple of new products.
Air bags have received a lot of attention, out of proportion to the overall statistics. The latest cars and most sport utility vehicles have air bags in front of both front seats. Since air bags appeared widely on the 1990 models, they have killed 55 children by force of inflation, all but 13 of them improperly buckled in or unrestrained. But air bags have saved 3,000 lives over all in the last decade, Federal regulators estimate.
Air bags pose no danger to children in the back seat. And that is where children of all ages should be riding, the National Transportation Safety Board said last year. So far only one state -- Rhode Island -- has a law requiring children to sit in back. A vote in the North Carolina Senate may come this week.
 
A Shift to Seat Belts
But safety advocates have shifted their focus from the back seat to seat belts. The Air Bag Safety and Seat Belt Campaign says that 6 out of 10 children who die in crashes are unbelted. The group, financed by automobile and air-bag makers and insurance companies, has figures showing that the child does as the driver does. In Colorado, it was found, if the drivers were buckled up, 72 percent of the passengers ages 4 through 15 were, too; if the drivers were not, the child figure dropped to 11 percent.
This group is therefore lobbying legislatures in states that have no adult seat-belt laws or laws that are not "primary," meaning they do not permit a traffic officer to pull over a driver simply for not wearing a seat belt. The group is also pressing for stricter enforcement in the localities with primary laws: 14 states and the District of Columbia.
Side air bags, to supplement the now mandatory front air bags, are on the way. Avis and Hertz say that they will appear in some 1999 models.
Dr. Schieber said the Centers for Disease Control had looked at tapes of children in their seat belts showing that within minutes of being buckled in, they were squirming or partly out of the belts. "A belt protects only when the passenger is sitting squarely in it," he said. The solution? Be sure that children sit straight and stay buckled, and build in time for stops where they can run around or otherwise work off the squirms.
Children in car seats also deserve frequent breaks on a long trip. Some car seats can be used to a later age, and it is worthwhile to keep a child in the safety seat or to use a booster seat, if adult chest straps chafe the neck.
Dr. Schieber also saw opportunities for safety training while on vacation. He started with an obvious one that might be missed. "Crossing an unfamiliar street is a teachable moment," he said. "Be sure the child looks left and right and tell him or her: 'Be sure you see the driver and the driver sees you before you cross.' "
Three of my grandchildren, who just made their first weeklong car trip, into Canada, were thrilled with room service and hotel pools. The first taste they share with Eloise; the other they share with most American children. Dr. Schieber considers the pool the main hazard for children at a hotel, because it is unsupervised and may not have a shallow end. Parents should keep children who are good swimmers in sight, he said, the others within reach. A child, even a good swimmer, should not be in the pool alone; a buddy system is needed. Most motel pools no longer have diving boards. If children dive from the edge, parents should test the depth of the water first and be in the water at the time.
 
What Hotels Are Doing
Going beyond the regular hotel "summer programs" for children, Novotel New York, at 52d Street and Broadway, began to think about keeping small children safe in a room devised for adults. Although the program is narrow -- at this Novotel only -- and its "safety pack" expensive at $35, it provides good alerts to parents with toddlers.
The hotel provides a list of safety tips devised by a company called Child Proofers. The tips -- keeping the toilet lid down, for example -- are mostly familiar to parents, but one is unusual: putting a towel over the top of the bathroom door to keep a child from getting locked in. The kit contains a bath thermometer (a wrist or elbow would do), an inflatable cover for a tub spigot, a night light, plastic covers for electric outlets and tape to secure electric cords out of the way. Child Proofers will mail its free checklist to parents who send a self-addressed stamped business envelope to: Child Proofers, 540 West Boston Post Road, Mamaroneck, N.Y. 10543.
A new item worth tossing into the luggage to supplement the first-aid kit is a six-by-five-inch plastic envelope offered by Johnson & Johnson called First Aid to Go. Intended for treatment of scrapes, it contains two antiseptic wipes, antibiotic ointment, four Band-Aid bandages and two Tylenol caplets. It sells for $1.79 a pack in pharmacies.
 
Tricks for Trips
Keeping the stress level down in the car eases the work of the driver and any navigator. On their road trip, the grandchildren field-tested a new card game: "Are We There Yet?", consisting of 430 cards challenging children to spot certain things on the road: "A driver with one hand on the wheel," for example, or "A sign with an X in it." These children, age 6 to 11, got five cards each and took a new card each time a challenge was met. The game costs $14.95 and is available at nondiscount toy stores, including F.A.O. Schwarz, and by mail order from L. L. Bean, (800) 809-7057; item QR 27323; $15. Information about other outlets: (800) 892-9012.
When the game got too exciting, the parents turned on the book tapes they had checked out of the library. Age has not dimmed the appeal of "Pippi Longstocking," I was told.
I have heard of parents who rely on the calming effect of a videotape playing in the back seat. At Soundcity on 45th Street in New York, Joe Kaufman, a salesman, said that the model most often bought for this purpose is the Philips Magnavox CCX 092, with a nine-inch screen and an attachment that plugs into the lighter outlet. It costs $399. For some sort of ultimate, it has a plug to accommodate the camcorder, so the family can review its day's activities.

Cooperstown Without a Car
Q. I will be visiting New York City and would like to take a side trip to Cooperstown, N.Y., to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Can I get there by public transit? -- Bill Van Deelen, Fresno, Calif.
A. Without a car, you may find it nearly as difficult to get to the Hall of Fame as Phil Rizzuto did. But the Scooter made it, and you can, too. 
 For now, Adirondack Trailways runs buses to Cooperstown from New York City only once a day Friday and Sunday. A 7 A.M. departure from the midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal, Eighth Avenue and 42d Street, arrives in Cooperstown at 12:30; the return leaves Cooperstown at 4:30 P.M., reaching New York at 10 P.M. Summertime service, June 24 to Sept. 8, has three trips daily from New York and two from Cooperstown. The round-trip fare is $76.70.
Another option is to travel to Utica on Amtrak, which makes at least two stops a day there from New York ($108 peak round trip), and take the daily Trailways bus to Cooperstown. For Adirondacks Trailways information, call (800) 225-6815; for Amtrak, (800) 872-7245.
But a much simpler -- and economical -- plan would be to reserve a place on the Catskill shuttle, a 14-passenger van run by Lans Transportation Service, (800) 607-2753. From May 15, Lans runs at least one shuttle a day except Tuesday and Saturday from New York to Cooperstown, leaving between 10 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. Bill Lounsbery, the owner, said you would have to stay overnight, though, because the return is early in the morning. The round-trip fare is $65.
The Hall of Fame is open daily 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. through September, then till at least 5 P.M. the rest of the year. Admission is $9.50; $8 for ages 65 and up, and $4 ages 7 to 12. Information: (888) 425-5633 or on the Web, www.baseballhalloffame.org.
 
Concorde Global Tours
Q. Are around-the-world trips on the Concorde still available? If so, how demanding is it for someone who uses a wheelchair? -- Annette Horstman, Freehold, N.J.
A. Both British Airways and Air France Concordes are chartered for around-the-world tours a couple of times a year, generally. This year, though, only Air France Concordes are making such trips. British Airways spokesmen said they knew only of a January 1999 around-the-world golf trip out of Hamburg.
But Intrav, a St. Louis company, is organizing two around-the-world excursions on Air France Concordes this fall, and plans three more next year. The ones this year are sold out, said Richard Hefler, senior vice president of Intrav, but there are waiting lists.
The itinerary for this year's excursions -- leaving Sept. 15 and Oct. 8 from New York, Dallas-Fort Worth or Las Vegas -- takes travelers to eight countries in 24 days. After two days in Hawaii, the tour makes three-day stops in Queenstown, New Zealand; Sydney, Australia; Beijing; Hong Kong; New Delhi (and the Taj Mahal); Nairobi, Kenya (and a game preserve), and Paris. The cost: $55,800 a person, double occupancy. Air travel will be in daylight hours. All meals are included, as are special parties, all sightseeing and gratuities.
Two of the Concorde global tours leave on the same dates in 1999: Sept. 15 and Oct. 8. The Sept. 15 itinerary is identical to this year's, but the Oct. 8 trip will have a few different stops, heading first to South America, then across the Pacific.
Intrav's third 1999 global charter is an 18-day trip leaving Dec. 24 -- to Hawaii (for Christmas), Australia, Hong Kong (for New Year's Eve), India, Kenya and Egypt. The cost: $75,000, double occupancy.
Asked about the rigorousness of such a trip, Lohn Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways, likened it to a cruise. Dennis Overman, vice president and general manager of Intrav, has led several of these trips and said that people confined to a wheelchair might find their enjoyment of some sights minimized. He said that there might be special arrangements needed for someone who is confined to a wheelchair, and that Intrav would make those arrangements.
Keep in mind that the Concorde is fairly narrow, and that Intrav has another global tour by air: 24 days starting in Indianapolis or Las Vegas on a refitted L-1011 wide-body jet. This trip makes many of the same stops as this year's Concorde trip, but with no more than 88 people on a plane designed for up to 362 seats, and which has been refitted with two lounges. So this plane may be more comfortable. This trip costs $37,800, double occupancy; an optional golf package is an additional $2,000.
For information on either trip, call Intrav at (800) 825-2900.
 
Finding Polish Roots
Q. I am traveling to Warsaw and Lodz to investigate my family history. I need a guide who speaks Polish, and perhaps knows some Hebrew. Do you have any information on finding one? -- Sophie Zimmerman, Great Neck, N.Y.
 A. The Polish National Tourist Office, at 275 Madison Avenue, New York 10016, can provide a list of Polish-tour operators and the general services they offer. Call (212) 338-9412; Web: www.polandtour.org.
At Air Tours Poland in New York, one of the companies listed, Beata Zieja, the sales manager, said her agency can arrange custom excursions with a driver who speaks English. The company's Warsaw office deals often with travelers from Israel, she added. She can be reached at (800) 223-0593, extension 243.
At another New York agency, Orbis Polish Tours, Richard Cichocki, the manager, said his company also can help you find a guide and plan excursions. Call (800) 867-7247 and ask for the FIT department.
Orbis also works with a genealogist, Miriam Weiner, whose company, Routes to Roots, specializes in genealogical research and travel in Poland, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. Based at 136 Sandpiper Key, Secaucus, N.J. 07094, she can be reached at (201) 866-4075 and has a Web site, www.routestoroots.com.
Miss Weiner also recently published "Jewish Roots in Poland," a guide to sites and archives. It includes descriptions of cities and towns (including several pages on Lodz, an industrial center once known as "the Polish Manchester"), chapters on genealogical research, and archives in Poland. On page 123, it lists The Jewish Information and Tourist Bureau (Our Roots), "a travel agency specializing in Jewish sites"; call or fax (48-22) 620-0556.
The book costs $50, plus $8 shipping (and $3 tax in New Jersey), and can be ordered from (800) 742-5403. RAY CORMIER

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Gay Cruises Draw Hostility in the Caribbean

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
AFTER hundreds of demonstrators heckled some 800 lesbian passengers who arrived in Nassau, the Bahamas, last month aboard Premier Cruises's Seabreeze, a headline in Cruise Week, a trade publication, asked, "Homophobic Protests on Rise in Ports?"
Two previous antigay incidents occurred in the Caribbean this year. In January, the Cayman Islands denied boarding rights at Grand Cayman to the Norwegian Cruise Line's Leeward, which was carrying some 900 gay passengers on a charter. And in March, religious groups in Nassau protested the scheduled arrival of Holland America's Veendam -- chartered by gay passengers, according to the protesters -- at Half Moon Cay, Holland America's nearby private island. Stipulating that it does not check on passengers' sexual orientation, Lawrence A. Dessler, a Holland America spokesman, said the ship was not chartered to a predominantly gay group, or any group; the situation was defused when rough weather eventually prevented the landing. 
 Even as the Veendam was heading for the Bahamas, Hubert Ingraham, prime minister of the Bahamas, denounced the antigay rhetoric in a televised news conference. After reminding his country of the large economic impact of the 1.7 million cruise visitors last year, and another 1.6 million stopover visitors (i.e., those spending a night on an island), he restated the islands' policy of nondiscrimination. "The future of the Bahamas is not threatened by foreign persons of homosexual orientation," he said. "Homosexuality is not a contagious disease, and it is not a crime in the Bahamas."
After the speech, some Bahamian religious leaders called for the prime minister's resignation. And when the Seabreeze subsequently arrived in Nassau, demonstrators, organized by a religious group called Save the Bahamas, were on hand to greet passengers with protests, heckling and signs saying, "No gay ships."
After the Cayman Islands incident, Billy Kolber-Stuart, the editor of Out & About, a travel newsletter for gay men and lesbians, wrote, "Few destinations in the Caribbean are truly gay friendly." Much of the Caribbean, he added, is out of touch with the realities of modern gay travel. The newsletter has called for a boycott until the Cayman Islands publicly assures gay travelers that they are welcome.
The 1,350-member International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, hoping to arrange a meeting with Thomas C. Jefferson, minister of tourism for the Cayman Islands, has not yet taken a formal position on boycotting the Caymans. But it has suggested that individual members, including 900 travel agents who cater almost exclusively to gay travelers, conduct their own boycotts.
The growing importance of gay travel can be gauged in part by the growth of the international association, which had only five airline members five years ago and has 50 today, including most major airlines. It has also added about 400 members -- including travel agencies, hotels, airlines and cruise lines -- since last May.
"I personally believe these are just the expressions of a very few religious people," Richard E. Thompson, the executive director of the association, said of the Bahamas' protests. "I see it as just pockets of individual objections, not as a trend."
But a month before the Leeward set sail from Miami on its seven-day cruise, Mr. Jefferson wrote to Norwegian Cruise Line saying: "Careful research and prior experience has led us to conclude that we cannot count on this group to uphold the standards of appropriate behavior expected of our visitors. So we regrettably cannot offer our hospitality."
In a recent telephone interview about that "prior experience," Mr. Jefferson said that a ship chartered by gay tourists came to the Cayman Islands in 1987, and that the visitors' public displays of affection in George Town, the capital, offended many residents. "We are deeply religious and culturally conservative, and it is not in our nature to show public affection," Mr. Jefferson said. "So it is disturbing to see others do it."
After that 1987 incident, Mr. Jefferson said, "the Government made a decision to deny landing rights to chartered ships that we perceive to be party boats with single people. We did not and do not intend to criticize the life style of any individual aboard those ships, but we continue to consider it our right and responsibility to insure culturally compatible conduct on this island." While the Cayman Islands will continue to review each charter request, he said, it welcomes every individual, regardless of race or sexual orientation.
Derek Bergl, owner of Pied Piper Travel, a New York travel agency, has two gay groups booked on cruises scheduled for Bermuda this year -- about 30 people on the Norwegian Crown's weeklong cruise departing New York on May 23, and about 60 on the Queen Elizabeth 2 departing New York Sept. 4. Though not in the Caribbean, Bermuda is usually lumped with it in cruise itineraries and industry statistics, and, like the Caymans, it is a British dependency. But its attitude toward gay tourists appears to be markedly different. "We've been doing groups to Bermuda for about eight years, and we haven't had any problems," Mr. Bergl said. "The Bermudian Government is gay friendly."
As for other Caribbean nations, "We haven't taken an official position," said Michael Youngman, executive director of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, to which 33 governments belong. However, he added, there will be an attempt to formulate one during the meeting of ministers of tourism on May 27 in New York.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Markevitch as Composer: An Icarus Who Flew Too High?

BYLINE: By RICHARD TARUSKIN; Richard Taruskin's latest book is "Defining Russia Musically."

 BODY:
TALL, gauntly handsome, icily cultivated, the subject of many reverential memoirs and just as many backbiting or salacious rumors, Igor Markevitch was for more than five decades a spook of the first magnitude in the musical life of Europe and some of its North American artistic colonies like Cuba and French Canada. In the United States, however, he has been relatively little known, or known only as a conductor, a situation that may begin to change when the American Symphony Orchestra, directed by Leon Botstein, performs "Icare," Markevitch's reputed masterpiece, on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall.
Like Prokofiev's "Prodigal Son," a farewell offering to Serge Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes before the composer's return to the U.S.S.R., Markevitch's Icarus ballet has been all too easily interpreted as a metaphor for its composer's fate. Intended as a memorial to Diaghilev, in 1932, it tells of the arrogant high-flying youth of Greek mythology who fell to earth and perished in consequence of his hubris. Along with Erich Wolfgang Korngold one of the 20th century's most amazing composer prodigies, Markevitch burned himself out creatively by the age of 30. For most of the next 40 years, although he maintained an active career as a conductor, he never performed his own music, which mainly languished unpublished, and neither did anybody else. 
 Although his former pupils, many of whom have far outstripped him in fame and fortune, still swear by him as one of the great conductors of the century, Markevitch never held a major post. The best-known orchestra he ever directed was that of the Concerts Lamoureux in Paris, with which he made recordings in the late 50's that are highly prized by collectors. For the rest, he worked in Stockholm, Montreal, Havana, Madrid and Monte Carlo, appeared frequently in England (where he made more legendary records) and held court for many summers at the Salzburg Mozarteum.
A curmudgeonly stickler for textual fidelity, Markevitch retreated in his late years into the realm of maverick scholarship, leading to a vast study of Beethoven's symphonies published in German in 1983, shortly before his death, at 71. His tell-all (but in fact, withhold-most) autobiography had come out in French a few years before. An earlier memoir about his wartime experiences in the Italian underground was written in English. This was a man of parts, a man of legend.
But behind the legend of the phantom conductor-ascetic lay the bigger legend of the wild Wunderkind composer. Now that story can at last be told with musical illustrations, thanks to the yeoman work of the English conductor Christopher Lyndon-Gee, who has recorded Markevitch's complete orchestral music -- eight works in all, dating from 1929 to 1937 -- with the Arnhem Philharmonic Orchestra, a Dutch ensemble, on three Marco Polo CD's (8.223653, 8.223666, 8.223724). On a companion disk (Largo LC 8943), Mr. Lyndon-Gee and other excellent musicians perform four chamber works, including a version of the Icarus ballet for a Bartokian ensemble of pianists and percussionists.
So, how high did Markevitch fly?
Born in Kiev in 1912 but raised abroad from his second year, he composed his first published piece, a stylish little suite for piano called "Noces" ("Wedding") at 13. (It's on the Largo disk.) On the strength of it, he became a protege of Alfred Cortot, who taught him piano and farmed him out to Nadia Boulanger for training in harmony and counterpoint. He quickly progressed to free composition, since (as Boulanger liked to say) he was born knowing all the rules.
In 1928, he played part of a Stravinsky-saturated Sinfonietta for Diaghilev, who fell hard for him and immediately began touting the young man as his latest great discovery. In this case, Diaghilev's passion was requited only artistically. As with his other young men -- Vaslav Nijinsky, whom he presented to Paris at 19, or Boris Kochno, who wrote the libretto for Stravinsky's "Mavra" at 17 -- the great impresario took over the young Markevitch's life. He "unveiled" the lad in a concert hurriedly held at Covent Garden in 1929, 12 days before Markevitch's birthday, so he could still be presented as a 16-year-old in a hastily composed Piano Concerto Diaghilev had commissioned from him. (It is the one piece that the publisher Boosey & Hawkes, when it belatedly signed Markevitch on as a composer in 1978, could not get him to reissue.)
A couple of days earlier, Diaghilev had published an open letter in The Times of London proclaiming that his "young countryman" would finally put an end to the gaudy "Paris orgies" of the last two decades: artistic orgies that Diaghilev himself, of course, had perpetrated, but of which he now blaringly repented. It could even be said (and was said) that the great man laid down his life for his last boy toy. Against his doctor's orders, Diaghilev romanced Markevitch with a whirlwind tour of Germany, where they met with Hindemith, heard Mozart (under Richard Strauss) and Wagner ("Tristan und Isolde"), and went to all the museums. Diaghilev returned to Venice exhausted, and died 12 days later.
He left Markevitch a marked man, at 17 already a figure of jealous controversy. The protagonists of the "Paris orgies," Stravinsky and Prokofiev, not pleased with what they had been reading, snubbed him.
Stravinsky settled scores with the young Markevitch, as he did with so many others, in his books of "Conversations" with Robert Craft. He tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his own German publisher, Schott, from taking an interest in Markevitch's work, writing that the boy was not so much Wunderkind as "altklug," a precocious flash-in-the-pan. He even sent his son Soulima, also a pianist and composer, to insult Markevitch at the premiere of a choral cantata in 1930. "It must be awful being another Igor," Soulima taunted. "It must be worse to be another Stravinsky," little Igor shot back.
THE anecdote comes courtesy of Prokofiev, who included it in a letter home along with uncomplimentary remarks of his own. But Prokofiev's put-down, however ill-meant, gives insight into why Markevitch's composerly career ultimately fizzled. "He has definite abilities," Prokofiev allowed, "but the good moments drown in waves of Beckmesserisms."
The reference to Wagner's inept mastersinger, whose name is synonymous with clumsy pedantry, was Prokofiev's catty way of signaling that Markevitch suffered from German influences, mainly Hindemith's. Probably few listeners today would agree, even though one of the pieces now recorded, the Concerto Grosso of 1930, took Hindemith's Concerto for Orchestra as a model.
The composer whose music Markevitch's most resembles is Arthur Honegger: not the Honegger of Les Six (though there's an echo of those composers in Markevitch's "Galop," which would make ideal theme music for "The Simpsons") but the biblical Honegger of "King David" and "Judith" and the muscular "polytonal" Honegger of the early symphonic poems ("Chant de Joie," "Rugby," "Pacific 231").
Even without benefit of Hindemith, though, Beckmesserisms there certainly were. Markevitch's great flair was for colorful orchestral textures, often polyrhythmic. In works like "Icare" and "Rebus" (his other ballet), and in two monumental suites -- "Hymnes" (1933) and "Le Nouvel Age" ("The New Age," 1937) -- he often builds up magnificent sonic montages combining concurrent ostinatos with two, three, four, six and nine beats to the bar. But then, usually, his imagination stalls, and he just sits on them, or alternates a couple or three, for pages at a time. Not only that, but the units so tiresomely reiterated are almost invariably a dull two or four bars in length.
Foursquareness also pervades the harmonic rhythm, the rate at which chords change. The "Cantique d'Amour," of 1936, a lush jungle growth of virtually themeless orchestral tissue, is an obvious homage to the Scriabin of the "Poem of Ecstasy," and also, perhaps, to the Brasilianas of Villa-Lobos, then a frequent presence in Paris concert programs. Its sensuality quickly palls, however, as polyharmony succeeds hyperharmony (as Rimsky-Korsakov would have said) with clockwork predictability at every bar line. Call it the march of ecstasy or the poem of accuracy: either way, the effect is nugatory.
The deadness of his "larger rhythm" despite all the inventive tinycraft is Markevitch's most obvious liability today. When his work was new, there were esthetic handicaps as well. The music is resolutely modernistic yet old-fashioned at the same time, because what it tended to flaunt was yesterday's modernism, or even the day before's. This was something about which Diaghilev cautioned Markevitch at their first meeting. Suspecting that his young idol was worshiping the thoroughly outmoded Ravel, Diaghilev upbraided him. "Why get so excited about yesterday?" he asked. The 16-year-old drew himself up as best he could and retorted, "I'm not interested in yesterday or today but in what is forever." From that moment, Diaghilev was smitten.
But he was right. Markevitch remained always about a decade behind the avant-garde, and in avant-garde circles a decade or two is maximum lag. Stravinsky sensed Markevitch's fixation on his own "Rite of Spring" (of which the later Markevitch became an intrepid exponent on the podium) and chided him mercilessly in a letter of 1934 about his devotion to a work "from whose esthetic tendencies I have been moving further and further away in what I have been doing for more than 15 years."
Stravinsky may have had in mind "Hymnes," a set of four noisy paeans to contemporary life that kept alive (or on artificial life-support) the neo-primitivist esthetic of "The Rite" long into the age of Neo-Classicism. They also reverberated with the "Symphony of Machines" rhetoric of the Italian futurists, already stale in George Antheil's "Ballet Mecanique," by then a decade old.
The second movement, the "Hymne au Travail" ("Hymn to Work"), even smacks of Alexander Mosolov's dowdy old "Iron Foundry," the emblematic "constructivist" opus of the Soviet 20's, and it is no surprise to learn from the CD booklet that Sergei Eisenstein, the great director, tried to entice Markevitch to return to Soviet Russia at the height of Stalinism to collaborate on films. (Only his mother's objections -- her "irrational fear" of Soviet Communism, as the booklet puts it with remarkable obtuseness -- prevented Markevitch's acceptance.)
But even Stravinsky was impressed with the Icarus ballet, the one piece that deserved a future. (Markevitch gave symbolic assent to this judgment in 1943, when he revised and simpflied the ballet, originally titled "L'Envol d'Icare," or "The Flight of Icarus," as the symphonic poem "Icare," the version Mr. Botstein will conduct. It was his last creative act; only arrangements -- Bach, Mussorgsky and Johann Strauss, of all unlikely trios -- lay ahead.) The ballet was planned in collaboration with the dancer and choreographer Serge Lifar, the other significant young man of Diaghilev's last years.
LIFAR, who in his autobiography claimed credit for the idea and for commissioning the ballet as a memorial to Diaghilev, pulled out, calling Markevitch's music "anti-danceable." (Since he also said that of Stravinsky's music, the remark only shows why as a choreographer Lifar was only Lifar.) Nevertheless, its rhythmic momentum is irresistibly corporeal; for once the ostinatos and the polyrhythms conspire to produce exaltation and, yes, "elevation."
Ultramodernistic touches abound: quarter-tone harmonies (removed in the revision, after they had caused the BBC to reject Markevitch's own early recording as unsuitable for broadcast due to poor intonation); toneless blowing into the brass instruments when the slain Icarus's wings are discovered, a marvelous symbol of deflation and mute grief; measured accelerandos and ritardandos, anticipating Elliott Carter by 15 years, in the section where the singing birds (anticipating Messaien) teach little Icarus to fly. But they are un-self-consciously evocative, never mere stylistic effrontery.
Finally, there is the strangely moving ritual dance, set to imitation gamelan music, to mourn the hero's death. This score has magic. The poetic justice of its influence on Stravinsky's "Orpheus" (1948) is satisfying.
Unfortunately, like the rest of the orchestral music recorded by Marco Polo, it receives a somewhat shaky, tentatively paced and haphazardly balanced performance from Mr. Lyndon-Gee and his orchestra. It is possible that one reason I have been left relatively unimpressed by Markevitch's polyrhythms is that I have not heard them performed with the requisite independence of parts. Big triplets, in particular, are reduced to rhumba rhythms in a manner that anyone who has rehearsed such a passage will instantly recognize. It's a hard task for any orchestra and for the conductor who has to teach the players how to "group" and "subdivide" their count against the general beat. I wish Mr. Botstein luck.

Riverhead Considers 2 Offers on 2,900-Acre Site

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: CALVERTON

 BODY:
JUST over two years ago Northrop Grumman closed its operations at the 2,900-acre Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant here, laying off or transferring the last of 3,000 workers and leaving behind 1.1 million square feet of industrial and office space and two runways.
Grumman and its successor, Northrop Grumman, , had been leasing the property from the Navy and assembling and testing military aircraft in this rural corner of the Town of Riverhead for 42 years. 
 In 1994, Congress authorized the Navy to turn the property over to Riverhead's Community Development Agency at no cost after the military contractor's departure.
A 3,000-acre buffer zone, also owned by the Navy, will be turned over the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Now that the transfer to the town appears imminent -- town officials estimate it could take place in as little as 60 days -- Riverhead has two bidders vying for the property.
One is First Industrial Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago, which offered $17 million for the 550 acres containing the industrial and office buildings, a 10,000-foot-long runway and development potential for buildings with an additional 2 million square feet of space.
In a letter of intent signed March 17, the town agreed to temporarily withdraw the 550 acres from the market, and First Industrial was given 120 days to evaluate and assess the land and buildings. A $500,000 earnest money deposit would be payable upon the signing of a contract, with the balance of the $17 million due at closing.
The second suitor is Mentmore Development, of San Francisco, a subsidiary of the privately held Mentmore Holdings Corporation of New York City. Mentmore's offer, presented to the town on March 20, is to purchase the entire 2,900 acres for $35 million in cash, with the town receiving a 25 percent share of future profits. William D. Talmage a local real estate consultant, is a partner with Mentmore in the offer.
Mentmore has offered to pay $20 million at closing, with the $15 million balance to be paid out as the various components of its $1.1-billion proposed project are developed. The construction schedule would be by mutual agreement. The town as a limited partner could receive, under Mentmore's estimates, more than $375 million in additional revenue over 20 years.
Many other candidates have expressed interest in leasing or buying the property, said Andrea H. Lohneiss, the director of Riverhead's Community Development Agency. Several prior offers have been rejected, she said. The town's goal, Ms. Lohneiss said, has been "from day one the creation of quality jobs and a tax base to support this community."
"Also," she said, "this has never been perceived to be a Town of Riverhead project, but a regional project with regional impact and benefits. In our evaluation of all proposals, those factors are paramount."
Jack O'Connor, the president of Grubb & Ellis/Island Realty of Melville, the brokerage handling the marketing of the site for the town, said he favored the First Industrial offer because "if you parcel out the properties you maximize the dollars."
He noted that the town could realize $55 million to $70 million if it sold parcels individually. And because the economy is so strong, he said, "we have the confidence that we can move two-thirds to three-quarters of the property in a year's time."
Rents for the available buildings have been set at $4.50 annually per square foot for industrial space, and $11 per square foot for office space, with tenants paying for their own electricity in both cases. Vacant land is for sale for $20,000 to $35,000 an acre depending on the amount of acreage purchased, the zoning and the location.
A portion of the property has been proposed for inclusion in New York State's Economic Development Zone program under which businesses that make physical improvements and/or create jobs receive state tax credits and other benefits. A maximum of 1,280 acres could be set aside for the zone under state legislation.
T HE Calverton property is so unusual that real estate experts say any appraisal of value is difficult.
Northrop Grumman left the buildings in pristine condition. One is the 300,000-square-foot Building 6-01, formerly the main operations building. It now houses the remains of TWA Flight 800, the airliner that exploded over the Atlantic off Long Island in July 1996, with no survivors.
The structure has been leased by the National Transportation Safety Board on a year-to-year lease with options to extend the lease for 51 years or until its investigations are completed. The lease would be transferred to the new owner.
The other main structures include a two-story, 73,400-square-foot office building; the 191,000-square-foot former final assembly building, known as Building 7, which houses four hangars, the airport control tower and about 35,000 square feet of office space and a 110,000-square-foot building with 33,000 square feet of offices and two hangars.
In addition to the 10,000-foot runway on the property First Industrial is bidding for there is one measuring 7,000 feet and a railroad spur. The balance of the property is woods and flat open area.
Except for a manned guardhouse at the entrance, the site is eerily empty, although it looks as if it could jump back to life any moment. With people gone, herds of deer graze placidly next to the buildings, and Canada geese roost next to the roadways. But the runways are well-maintained. In the control tower, phones and monitors are at the ready.
A re-use strategy prepared for the town two years ago by Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler of Manhattan, a real estate and economic development consulting firm, suggested turning the existing buildings into an industrial park and keeping at least the larger of the runways in operation for the industrial tenants.
For the remaining 2,350 vacant acres the report suggested a hotel-conference center, a golf course, a sports complex, a theme park and other tourist attractions. The plan projected 2,200 new jobs within five years and 6,400 jobs within 20 years.
First Industrial would not comment on its proposed plans, saying only through Steve Solomon, a public relations spokesman, that "we are still a long way off from consummating a deal." The company, formed in 1994, owns almost 57 million square feet of industrial space in 24 major markets around the country.
Mentmore Holdings Corporation owns steel, life insurance, plastics, entertainment and aerospace companies among others. It also is a major developer, having built more than 20 million square feet valued at $3 billion in various projects around the country, several of them under the public-private partnership arrangement it is proposing to enter into in Riverhead.
Its projects, which usually combine office, retail, residential and occasionally hotel development under one roof, include the 1.2 million-square-foot Market Square at Pennsylvania Avenue and Seventh Street in Washington, D.C. The company also has another project there, the 3 million-square-foot The Portals, under construction at the 14th Street Bridge across the Potomac River.
In Riverhead, its proposed project would create 10,500 jobs, said Robert H. Mendelsohn, the chief executive of Mentmore Development.
The components would include the re-use of the existing buildings and new construction for an industrial park designed to attract high-technology tenants offering the high-paying jobs lost when Northrop Grumman left, he said. The park would include a job-training center. Another element would be a showcase for new technology that would combine the entertainment of a traditional theme park with technology exhibits and demonstrations.
In addition, a resort hotel and conference center would include golf, horseback riding and skeet shooting among its recreational facilities. And a family-oriented hotel featuring an indoor swimming complex among other climate-controlled recreational activities would offer year-round moderately priced short-term stays.
There would also be a retail and entertainment center with shops, restaurants and a 16- to 20-screen movie theater. And Mentmore is also proposing to build a retirement community with on-site health services and recreational facilities.
"We have proposed a master development program with a master developer, where the various elements are integrated and each one is interdependent with another," Mr. Mendelsohn said. "We think it would be a tragic, missed opportunity for the town to allow the Grumman site to be developed in a piecemeal way."
Ms. Lohneiss, the Community Development Agency director, said that the town would prefer "not to be in a partnership situation under which we would have to audit the books over a long period of time." And Mentmore is free to make an offer on the acreage First Industrial doesn't want, if that deal goes through, she said.
And should that happen, would Mentmore be interested in the balance of the site? "No comment," Mr. Mendelsohn said.

As Office Squeeze Tightens, Builders Grab Trowels

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
THE signs are clear -- dirt being moved here, steel going up there -- that after two good years of job growth, declining vacancy rates and rising rents, 1998 is shaping up to be a year of development and redevelopment in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market.
"The market is getting down to a very, very short supply of space," said Donald P. Eisen, executive managing director of the New York area for Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage. So landlords are seeing "now as their turn, and are building," he added. 
 In a market where real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, seem to have an insatiable appetite to buy properties to continue their growth "national and local developers are also looking to create product to sell to them," added Robert J. Rudin, executive director of the Saddle Brook office of the Insignia/ESG brokerage.
He also said that as REIT's continue to compete for a thinning supply of properties "the prices some are paying are approaching, and in some cases exceeding, the $150 to $180 a square foot cost of building a new building."
But buy they did. The amount of properties investors purchased in 1997, some of which closed in the first quarter of this year, reached $2.1 billion, up from $934 million in 1996, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Leading the way was Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, of Cranford, among the nation's largest REIT's, which purchased 1.3 million square feet of office space this year. Its purchases included the Prudential Business campus straddling Parsippany and Hanover, which has five existing buildings with a total of 860,000 square feet of office space and space for an additional 1.3 million more square feet.
With most of the major properties spoken for, some REIT's may also enter the development arena this year, brokers and analysts said. All told, there are more than 4.5 million square feet of office space currently under construction in the 11-county northern and central sections of the state, according to the West Orange office of Grubb & Ellis, another national brokerage.
In areas where the space squeeze is the tightest some builders have taken or will soon take the plunge into developing space on speculation -- without a signed lease from a single tenant in hand.
Among the largest such projects are a 350,000-square-foot two-building complex now under development in Parsippany by SJP Properties, a local development company, and the 285,000-square-foot structure being built along Interstate 78 in Berkeley Heights by Connell Realty & Development Company of Westfield. And Gale & Wentworth of Florham Park is developing the last of four buildings in its Park Avenue at Morris County complex in Florham Park. It will have 175,000 square feet.
Existing buildings are being or will be reshaped on speculation into modern offices. They include a 180,000-square-foot former silver plating plant in Clifton that is being converted by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville L.I, another REIT. Reckson is also planning to renovate a 128,000-square-foot building two miles away in Nutley. And Wellsford Property Trust of Chatham is renovating and expanding the old Estee candy warehouse in Parsippany into a 250,000-square-foot office structure.
The Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City may get two new buildings this year -- the first in nearly a decade. There, the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, is putting up its own money for a 561,000-square-foot building scheduled for a groundbreaking on Thursday in its 600-acre Newport mixed-used complex. In addition, Samuel LeFrak, the company chairman, said there were plans for a second office building, of 450,000 square feet.And in June Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus will start driving piles for a 419,000-square-foot riverfront tower about a mile south on part of the 20-acre Colgate Palmolive Center site in Jersey City, once occupied by a toothpaste factory.
Other builders have development sites ready to go and will build to a specific tenant's need. One case in point is the Rockefeller Group, which is constructing a 175,000-square-foot building for AT&T in Florham Park. Still others will build only after a tenant signs on for a sizable amount of space, which is needed to obtain construction financing from lenders. For unlike the halcyon days of the 80's, lenders "are still lukewarm when it comes to speculative development" and therefore require an equity cushion from developers, said Douglas H. Haynes, president of Alexander Summer, a real estate concern based in Paramus. As a result, there "will not be a whole crop of new buildings," he said.
AND that, in a way, reflects the two sides of the 1998 office market in which caution and optimism seem to be running on parallel courses. "The market is good and there is confidence, but we don't have the unbridled optimism of the 80's," said Mr. Eisen of Cushman & Wakefield, "and that will mitigate against excess building."
Other factors will also help keep the lid on new construction. In the first quarter of this year the state gained 20,000 new jobs, indicating that it will match the same level of growth achieved in 1997 when 87,000 new jobs were added, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. He added that 1997 had been the best year since 1984, when 150,000 new jobs were created.
While this growth pattern will continue to yield the lowest unemployment rates of the 90's, Dr. Hughes said it also "presents a potential speed bump in the highway of the future -- the lack of available labor." It is an issue that has come to the forefront in the last six months, he added, noting that "it becomes a natural inhibitor" to overbuilding. Dr. Hughes stopped short of talking about a recession in a state that is entering its 72d month of recovery. "It is an amazing economic run we are going through," he said, "and while there is always the possibility of some economic shock, the downside potential is not likely for '98."
Most industry executives added that while demand may level off from its feverish pitch the market will stay on a relatively even course through this year. But some are not so sure about what will happen in 1999 and beyond if more developers -- REIT's as well as pension funds -- jump on the building bandwagon.
"Everything comes in waves and my concern is that the market not get carried away with its success," said Andrew J. Merin, executive director of the financial services group at Cushman & Wakefield. "Those with buildings in the ground this year have a good shot, but it takes 18 to 24 months to finish an office building and one has to figure that at some point from now until the year 2001 there will be a downturn in the economy." While Wall Street "can turn on a dime, our business can't," he added.
In the short term, however, the state's job growth has translated into a need for space in a market where steady leasing has chipped away at much of the excess inventory left over from the recession. "Tenants looking for 100,000 square feet of prime space have only 10 alternatives and there are serious negotiations on half of them," said David Simson, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of CB Commercial.
The lack of premium space led to increased demand for secondary properties, which accounted for 56 percent of the overall leasing activity in the first quarter of this year, according to Cushman & Wakefield. In turn, the first-quarter vacancy rate for the overall market dropped three percentage points from the same time last year to 12.4 percent, the lowest level since the brokerage began keeping records in the 1970's.
The rate for Class A space fell to 7.2 percent from 10 percent during that same period. At the same time, average asking rents rose to $20.19 from $19.66 for all space and to $25.35 from $23.79 for prime space.
Most of the demand came from expanding companies, not new arrivals, and big deals were missing, reflecting the dwindling supply of large blocks of space in all categories. Among the space takers was the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which leased all 164,000 square feet at 2 Montgomery Street in Jersey City, a building undergoing a complete renovation to modern office space. Additionally, Philips Consumer Communications, a new entity that is a joint venture of Philips Electronics and Lucent Technologies, leased 73,000 square feet at the former K-LineShipping headquarters off I-78 in Murray Hill.
Mr. Rudin of Insignia/ESG said that there would be a temporary oversupply of space in the first half of the year. But then the "market will catch its breath before it moves forward and sort itself out in the second half," he said.

HEADLINE: Q&A: William Flynn;
Guiding the Knights of Malta in Charity

BYLINE: By LINDA TAGLIAFERRO 

 BODY:
THE Sovereign Military Order of the Knights of Malta traces its origins to the time of the Crusades. This Roman Catholic charitable organization is currently dedicated to the relief of poverty and sickness around the world.
William Flynn of Garden City has been the president of the American association of the order for two years. He is the former chief executive officer and present chairman of the board for the Mutual of America Insurance Company in Manhattan. 
In the past, he has served as chairman for the Advisory Committee to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the Ireland Chamber of Commerce and the New York Foundling Hospital, among others. He is a member of the board of the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity and the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board and many other organizations.
He also played a part in the recent peace talks in Northern Ireland. The chairman of the National Committee on Foreign Policy, Mr. Flynn was instrumental in bringing the Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams to the United States.
The son of Irish immigrants, Mr. Flynn was born in Manhattan. He is the father of four children and e has lived in Garden City for more than 25 years with his wife, Peg.
Q. How did you become involved with the Knights of Malta?
A. I was involved in various and sundry organizations such as the New York Foundling Hospital and others. About 30 years ago, someone suggested I apply for membership in the Knights. You've got to have the approval of your bishop when you apply, and I passed the tests.
At the time, the organization was under the leadership of Peter Grace. He was the first to open the organization to women. A lot of good was being done at the time, but few people knew about it. There were no newsletters sent out and the members weren't called to be part of these projects. Perhaps it took too much initiative on the part of the members to become involved in these.
Q. How does the American branch of the order fit into the international organization?
A. I'm the president of the American Association of the Sovereign Military Order of the Knights of Malta. With 1,800 members, we're the largest group within the Order of Malta in the world. There are two other orders in the United States. The Federal operates out of Washington and the Western is based in San Francisco. They're smaller, but they're very effective.
I think there is a feeling that the American association hasn't realized its full potential. There's much more that can be done, and we're striving to perfect our ability to be more effective in taking on our mission, which is to help the sick and the poor and to defend the faith.
Q. When you say that part of the Knights' mission is "to defend the faith," what do you mean?
A. I'll give you an example. There are many organizations in the country that are fighting the battle against abortion. Partial birth abortion is one extreme version of this. There are government people who have been unable to do away with this, and that has distressed us. It distresses me.
So the Knights have helped in that fight. We call that a defense of faith because we believe that partial birth abortion is infanticide. Since we believe that, we have to put our energies where our thinking is.
We raised a quarter of a million dollars to help the bishops fight that battle, but there are some members who think that we shouldn't be in that battle. There are those who say that the money would be better spent helping the sick and the poor, so there's a theoretical battle between these two missions.
The great truth is, that no matter what our activities, very few people are aware of what the organization is doing.
Q. Why isn't the organization more well known?
A. It's the best kept secret because part of the philosophy of many people is the idea that what is done should be done privately and quietly. Unfortunately, in today's world, if that's how you operate, the perception is that you're doing nothing.
There are those who think that we shouldn't be communicating what we're doing because it's gauche. I believe quite the contrary, that we have to publicize what we're doing. How else can we get the public and our membership to support what we stand for?
If even some of our members don't know what we stand for, then we haven't got a prayer of effectively accomplishing our mission. I look at that as my charge, and there are those who feel quite strongly that this is an error and that I'm leading them in the wrong direction as a result.
Q. What are some of the establishments that have been founded by the Knights in the United States?
A. In Haiti, which is probably one of the poorest countries in the world, there's a Malta installation that was started by people in St. Louis. They have a very strong contingent of Malta, very small in number, but very effective, who felt that they had an obligation to help, so they started a small hospital out there.
It's only 30 beds, but there is nothing else there, and it takes care of an incredibly large number of people. There are volunteer doctors like Dr. Carlos Reese and others. They do surgical procedures and deliver babies. Without them there would be no help for the people there.
In the Dominican Republic, there's a clinic where we work together with the Dominican Association of Malta. There's also a clinic in Honduras that was started by a couple in New Jersey, which has a very effective chapter.
Within the United States, in various areas, work has been done. In St. Louis, there's a facility that looks after recovering drug addicts.
I feel we're not doing enough because we have a very limited budget. It's been a tradition that we don't go out raising funds, so we operate off our dues. We have to challenge that tradition. Why shouldn't we raise funds? Our budget is less than $2 million a year.
Q. Are there any Malta facilities on Long Island?
A. We have an area chairman in Long Island who is just getting under way. His name is Carl Schwartz. He's a man of great initiative and great strength. He's put together a facility for pregnant women who want to keep their children but don't have husbands or anywhere else to turn. It's called Malta House and it's in Brentwood. It's another well-kept secret.
Q. On the international level, do the Knights have more financial resources available and a chance to be more widespread?
A. Yes. Internationally, the Order of Malta accounts for over 200 hospitals around the world. In Ireland, for example, they run an ambulance service.
I feel that with our 1,800 members here, if we can be better organized, we're capable of doing much more here than what we have done in the past.
Q. You said that you are trying to be more inclusive of ethnic groups. Can you explain?
A. This was an order that originally was restricted throughout most of its history and in Europe is still restricted to the nobility. In America, they ran into a problem. There may be noble people, but there is no such thing as nobility here.
So now, our preference is for people who have contributed to education or religion or the world of science. That's the American nobility, really.
In the next century, half of us are going to be of Hispanic backgrounds. We should have more members of that background to reflect this. I would also like to see members of black and Asian origins. We have to promote the idea of including these people.
The Knights of Malta will profit, just as America has profited, from diversity. That makes for great strength, and unless we do that, we'll become a feeble, old organization.
Q. Some members of the Knights have asked you to resign, but you have the backing of Cardinal O'Connor. Can you explain?
A. There are some members who feel differently about the direction in which I'm taking the organization. I stand for change. There are those who stand for the status quo or who stand for change, but in a different direction, and that's perfectly legitimate. But some opponents feel very strongly about it and feel that the only way they can accomplish what they believe is the right course is for the entire board to resign and for me to resign.
Cardinal O'Connor is a member of the board, and the board supports me. The Cardinal does not care to be partisan, and he has offered to be a bridge for those who feel strongly one way. I'm quite certain that he will succeed and that we will succeed.
Q. What would you like to see happen with the organization in the future?
A. I want to see us be much more effective in helping the sick and the poor across the country. Remember, we can only do so much, so what is being done successfully in one place such as in New Jersey or here in Long Island, we must do right across the country. We must marshal our members to get up and become a part of getting the mission accomplished.

HEADLINE: Main Street, The Movers Behind A New Look

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
EAST HARTFORD, tucked away across the Connecticut River from its parent city and namesake, has always had something of an identity problem.
From its days as a farming community and river town to its more recent role as a highway nexus and home to aircraft-engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, the city was never much of a stopping point for people who didn't live there. 
 "The way I put it was, I wanted East Hartford to be a place to go to rather than a place to go through," said Bob DeCrescenzo, the city's mayor from 1993 to 1997.
The problem, as Mr. DeCrescenzo and others readily admit, was that East Hartford wasn't even much of a place to go through.
Pratt & Whitney was diminishing its presence drastically and the city faced double-digit unemployment. The storefronts along Main Street were dingy and often vacant, and crime was becoming an overriding concern.
"We were dying," said Raymond E. Tubbs, an art dealer and 28-year East Hartford resident.
Skip forward a few years to the present: The storefronts are being spiffed up and their interiors refurbished, unemployment is down to under 6 percent, and community spirit is high. The four-and-a-half-acre parcel on Main Street that for years was an abandoned supermarket site has been transformed into a town green that is host to annual music festivals as well as young mothers who take their toddlers to the playground there.
The improved state economy is one reason for the turnaround, as are efforts by business and civic organizations.
But one other factor is also cited by residents: East Hartford's membership in the Connecticut Main Street Program, a downtown renovation project sponsored by Connecticut Light and Power.
Lisa Bumbera, an employee of the utility company who coordinates the Main Street program in the state, describes it as tough love. Rather than sending grant money to participating municipalities, the Connecticut Main Street Program forces them to organize and figure out the financing of their projects.
"It's not a grant program," she said. "It's roll up your sleeves. You're going to do the work. We'll provide access to consultants, technical assistance, provide knowledge from other parts of the country on what's worked elsewhere."
Forty-three states have Main Street programs, but Ms. Bumbera said Connecticut is the only one where the program is entirely supported by a private business. The Main Street approach encourages communities to develop their own businesses, foster cooperation between local groups and preserve older buildings that give each downtown a particular character.
The Connecticut Main Street program began in 1995 with four communities, including East Hartford. Two years later three more municipalities joined in. They range from commerce centers to bedroom communities.
All have one thing in common: a desire to revitalize their downtowns.
"Main Street is a process," said Jerry Lintner, director of the Simsbury Main Street Partnership Inc. "There is a pattern that works."
Simsbury, like East Hartford, enrolled in the program in 1995; the two have been Connecticut Main Street's biggest successes. It's hard to imagine two more different communities: East Hartford, proudly blue-collar; Simsbury, affluent and suburban. Yet both saw hard times in the early 1990's.
"We had an eroding middle class," Mr. Lintner said. "Simsbury was very affected by unemployment. The answer for a lot of people was to relocate. It became too expensive to live here."
Reinvigorating a downtown area more than a square mile in size was seen as the answer a year before Simsbury joined Connecticut Main Street. Once joined up, the town was provided with structure and advice.
Another of the original four, New London, is the most likely participant in a downtown renewal project, as it is the business center of southeastern Connecticut. Its Main Street program, though, is a step behind East Hartford and Simsbury; it is still trying to organize itself and find an executive director.
James Mallove, chairman of a steering committee for the New London program, said Main Street in the past "was never able to involve the community."
"Part of the problem was there wasn't as much cooperation between city groups like the City Center Tax District, the neighborhood alliance, and church organizations," Mr. Mallove said. "New London has always been a kind of fractionalized city."
Creating cooperation is a major part of Main Street programming, its administrators say. Committees are formed to court opinion from landlords, tenants, home owners and others while adding muscle to common goals.
Not every town that has joined Main Street has been successful: Torrington, also one of the first four, pulled out after failing to find a director.
"A program manager is like the conductor," Ms. Bumbera said. "They're going to keep the various committees of Main Street going, hopefully in the same direction in conjunction with the board. Unless they have that cooperation, it's not going to work."
Even today, in better times, no one would ever confuse East Hartford with Litchfield County. Yet its Main Street has a certain undeniable visual quality, much of it in the form of a streetscape that looks plucked right out of the past.
In 1817, James Monroe reportedly called East Hartford the most beautiful Main Street in America. Back then, it was a fairly sleepy, pastoral town, its Main Street lined with Colonial-era mansions and shady trees.
The road grew busier with the passage of time, and the construction of highways like Interstate 91 and Interstate 84 sliced huge portions out of the city's flat landscape. With the emergence of the military industry during and after World War II, multifamily housing and postwar prosperity arrived. Its residents tended to be working-class immigrants trying to make a new life for themselves and their families.
"East Hartford is a big-shouldered city," said Main Street coordinator Tana Meier Parseliti. "People here are plain-spoken about things."
Then came the 1980's, and with them the beginning of the end for Connecticut's prosperous military industry. Pratt & Whitney's East Hartford work force was gradually winnowed from a high of 20,000 in the late 70's to 7,500 last year. Other businesses, particularly stores, fled.
Main Street was left with some attractive but quiet buildings, like Governor's Corners, built a century ago in Spanish Colonial Revival style. There was the Sage-Allen Building, a block-wide Art Deco edifice from the 1930's vacated by its original chain-store tenant after 50 years and left empty.
Then there was the Comstock Building, a one-time theater built in 1899 and a source of special pride to residents even as parts of it moldered quietly away.
"Every town in Connecticut had a building like this at one time, but very few are still standing," Mr. Tubbs said of the Comstock Building. "It has a Main Street look, a strong architectural presence."
After taking office, Mayor DeCrescenzo had the city buy the Comstock Building, renovate its exterior and light it up at night, a move described as symbolic of his commitment to a better future by pointing to the city's rich past. Now the building is being privately developed.
How much of this is due to Connecticut Main Street is an open question. Mary Beth Reid, executive director of the East Hartford Chamber of Commerce, noted that things like the Comstock rehabilitation and the creation of the town park were "not really connected" to the city's Main Street Plus campaign.
But Mr. DeCrescenzo called the Main Street program "a natural fit."
"Connecticut Main Street should be funded and run by the state government," he said. "Thank goodness C.L.&P. is willing to do it. They audit us and help us move forward. You can't let inertia set in. You've got to keep current, and have a sense of urgency."
Ms. Bumbera said East Hartford has seen the most success of any community taking part in Main Street, with $2.5 million in new investment and 50 new jobs. Those might not seem large numbers, but "We have to take baby steps before we can walk and run," she said. "For every new business that moves in, eyes are watching and people are looking. Investment shows confidence."
For East Hartford natives, the visible changes are small but profound. Three major development projects are being reviewed or supported by Main Street Plus, including one to renovate the Old Town Hall.
A new restaurant has just opened a block away from the downtown headquarters of Main Street Plus, which means you don't have to take a prospective business tenant to Hartford for a nice meal.
Mike Cardello grew up in East Hartford before moving out to make a living on the West Coast. Now he is back working on the interior of the city's first coffee bar and intends to stay awhile. "I see a big turnaround for the good," he said, "I think the visual change here is quite impressive."
One major problem still dogs the city. Main Street is an emergency alternative to Interstate 91 and a major traffic corridor between highways. Despite such volume, retail businesses don't thrive along a downtown where shoppers must cross the street with caution.
Bob Fortier, a town council representative and building supervisor, said he sees an average of 20 U-turns every morning and 30 every afternoon.
"Traffic is a major problem, and the speed of it," Mrs. Reid said. "You look at the big traffic count as a retail person, and you think you'd move there. But the traffic moves so fast it's dangerous."
Main Street Plus leaders say they are working to help devise a solution to this problem. In the meantime, three new municipalities have joined the state program in the past year: Middletown, Windsor and Coventry.
Coventry represents a new sort of challenge for Main Street. It regards itself not as a city or town but as a village. Its downtown is dominated by a lake and mills that date to the Industrial Revolution. The Coventry Main Street manager, Mary Lou Sullivan, says the village doesn't want new retail business so much as it wants innovative uses for the mills and a lower tax burden on residents.
"We could use a hardware store, a delicatessen, another restaurant," she said. "But most people want Coventry to stay rural."
If Main Street is about anything, Ms. Bumbera said, it is about making communities understand just how large a role they can play in their own development.
"People aren't aware of the leverage they can have, and developers take advantage of that," she said. "We need things like malls. But we need to understand why a downtown is important.
"We already have a core here. Rather than enlarge the infrastructure, which costs money to the towns and the utilities, let's build on what we have."

HEADLINE: Providing Trained Liaisons in Health Care

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
"WE HAVE all had personal experiences with doctors, hospitals, clinics and the like, and as more and more of us find ourselves in managed-care plans, it has become increasingly difficult to navigate the health care delivery minefield," said Joan Marks, director and founder of a graduate program in health advocacy at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers. "We all could use a friend at court."
The program, the only one of its kind in the country, was founded in 1980 by Ms. Marks, a psychiatric social worker. 
 "I realized the need for trained health advocates back in 1969 when I was working as a geriatric counselor," Ms. Marks said. "Patients needed someone to act as a liaison between them and health care providers. In one scenario, 51 different specialists saw the same patient and neither she nor her family spoke English. Clearly, there were difficulties. What they needed was an ombudsman, but when our program began, the term 'health advocate' was barely understood."
Sarah Lawrence College, a small private institution with a focus on the humanities, provided the broad educational base needed for the expanding roles of the health advocate, Ms. Marks said. "The college recognized the growing need for professionals to represent the consumer in health care issues," she said. "And today, consumers need professionals more than ever to help them get through the health care maze that changes in managed health care have brought about. Consumers are beginning to have serious questions about the intentions and integrity of everyone involved in health care."
The Health Advocacy Program, she said, offers an unusual approach to the study of health care. "Unlike other advanced-degree programs, the focus is on health care from the perspective of the patient-consumer," Ms. Marks said. "Graduates of the program work in diverse positions such as patient representatives and administrators, on ethics committees and medical policy boards at hospitals and health agencies. Health advocacy draws on concepts from medicine, law, economics, social work and health care administration."
At a recent open house, potential students from a variety of backgrounds were represented. What they had in common, Ms. Marks said, was a desire to enter a profession "where they could make a difference."
She added: "The first health advocates were nurses and social workers because they knew the system. But now students come from many occupations across the board in such fields as economics, law or photography. "
The need for professional advocates is being fueled by national and state debates over managed care and consumer rights. In New York, a bill calling for a state ombudsman program, which would include a network of community-based agencies to provide direct help to all health care consumers, is under consideration.
"The opportunities for careers in health advocacy are growing accordingly," Ms. Marks said.
"Our graduates can expect to find a wide variety of jobs. Some will become patient representatives, hospital administrators, health educators and consultants to community groups. Others will staff health agencies, serve on ethics committees and medical policy boards, while others may find work sorting out inequities in the insurance industry."
Salaries range from $45,000 to $100,000 for someone heading a department dealing with major moral and physical issues, Ms. Marks said.
"The bottom line is that advocates play a vital role in health care today," she said. "They give objective advice from the smallest question posed by patients to the largest. They are in contact with the family. They can be found at a patient's bedside explaining a medical procedure or before a senator's desk, discussing legislation. And they have the ability to interact with doctors, administrators and community agencies alike."
As students they are exemplary, said Dr. Marsha Hurst, who teaches two of the program's courses. "They are mature, highly motivated adults who have made an unusual choice to go into the field of health care advocacy in its early stages," she said. "And many have made sacrifices in order to be in the program. This is a professional discipline that attracts people who are not only smart and looking for new career opportunities but also those who are interested in helping others and making a difference. They are wonderful to teach."
The importance of a master's degree as a health advocate, Dr. Hurst said, is demonstrated by the success of the program's graduates. There are patient representatives' programs at major teaching hospitals, including the Hospital for Special Surgery, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Westchester Medical Center. The programs have employed Sarah Lawrence graduates, who also serve in advocacy roles in groups like the San Francisco Health Plan and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
"From the very beginning, when consumerism was just beginning to be an issue, major hospitals were impressed with the advocacy concept," Ms. Marks said. "A compelling reason is economic. Having an impartial patient advocate on the staff enables a hospital to operate more effectively, which translates into cost saving."
Citing one hospital, Ms. Marks said: "They were experiencing an inordinate number of complaints about their pediatric department. The advocate went into the pediatric clinic to see what was going on and to try to solve the problem. What was discovered was that the clinic scheduling was unacceptable to parents. They were complaining because they were not permitted to stay overnight with their very ill children. When the advocate brought the problem to the attention of the hospital administrators, the scheduling was changed, and complaints dropped off."
In another, more harrowing incident, Ms. Marks said: "This hospital was responsible for the death of an infant. The ombudsman suggested that the hospital tell the parents the truth and admit the blame. Because the hospital treated them honestly, the parents never filed a malpractice suit against the hospital."
Ombudsmen perform such an important job in hospitals that 3,000 annual requests for their help from the medical staff -- as was the case tracked by one metropolitan hospital -- is not considered unusual, Ms. Marks said. "They are skilled listeners, communicators who are objective, empathetic and smart," she said. "And most important of all, they are trained for the job, with the best will in the world. Do-gooders who mean well can do more damage than good."
Representative Sue W. Kelly, Republican of Katonah, is a graduate of the program. So is Janice Levy, now patient representative director, department associate hospital administrator at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. "In the health advocacy program, the advocacy role is defined and developed in a way that enables graduates to work creatively and effectively in a multitude of settings," Ms. Levy said.
Hope Ryan, who worked as a photo editor at Gannett Newspapers in White Plains for 18 years, is now health information specialist at the March of Dimes national headquarters in White Plains.
"This is a second career for me," Ms. Ryan said. "I was always interested in health care, and when a friend told me about the program, I checked it out. I have always wanted a job in which I could really help people and now, as an advocate for the children and parents across the nation, involved with more than 5,000 birth defects and genetic diseases, I provide information and referrals to the proper source in the country where they can get help. I love my job. At the end of the day I feel I've really done something and made a difference in people's lives."

HEADLINE: The Task Of Filling School Jobs

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
WHILE school enrollment soars -- leading to more advertisements for teachers -- vacancies are also appearing at administrative levels. Searches for high school principals are under way in Ardsley, Chappaqua and Pelham, and superintendents are needed in Irvington, Hendrik Hudson, Scarsdale, Mount Vernon, Tuckahoe and Yonkers.
Dudley Hare Jr.'s recent announcement that he would resign as Superintendent of the Yorktown-based Putnam-Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services as of Oct. 15 underscores only the latest vacancy in what many educators see as a growing leadership crisis. 
 "There's no question that for administrative positions it's becoming more difficult to find people," said Dr. Donald R. Kusel, Superintendent of the Tarrytowns public schools. "Aside from the dollars and cents, there's huge stress and huge pressures for anyone in a public position today. A lot of people argue about how the standards are being raised. The superintendent becomes the focal point for things that don't go well in the schools."
Having so many openings in the county has become a matter of concern. As the future of education gains attention on the national and state agendas, fewer people seem willing to assume leadership roles. Some attribute the shortage of candidates to the narrow salary gap between experienced teachers and beginning administrators, while others believe the pressure put on superintendents and principals, especially in high school, is the major deterrent.
"It's a problem," said Dr. Charles T. Wilson, Superintendent of the Pelham school district. "The pay differential with respect to the top paid teachers in comparison with principals has caused a lot of people to think twice. The workload and pressures for principals are so intense. There are higher expectations from parents and students, along with the push for higher standards, the state report cards and new assessments. And the general public is far more vocal and assertive. No wonder that would-be principals see themselves in the crossfire."
As a result, Dr. Wilson, whose district is looking at finalists for high school principal, said "we're finding that the scope and range of choice is narrower than we'd like to have it."
"We're not seeing the same volume of applicants," she said. "We're seeing good people, but we had to be very aggressive in soliciting people."
For Jackie Roy, president of J. A. Roy & Associates in Cambridge, Mass., which is conducting the search for an Irvington superintendent, the situation in the county mirrors national trends.
"A lot of people prefer staying in the assistant superintendent role as the superintendent's job has changed and become a political lightning rod," Ms. Roy said. "We have to do a lot of active, vigorous recruiting to reach out to people and really persuade them that it's a wonderful opportunity. We still get high-quality candidates for high-quality districts, but we are getting fewer candidates. It's down by half from 10 or 12 years ago, when we might see 85 to 100 candidates. Now it's 35 to 50 candidates."
Some people seem to feel that finding good leaders requires a shift to a more corporate outlook, especially regarding compensation.
"This is now a very accountable business, with the public demanding that districts run cost effectively," Dr. Wilson said. "The salaries and compensation package have to reflect that economic reality check. The reality is that you're losing people. Historically, people who became district superintendents were those who wanted regional responsibility, and often there was considerably more compensation. Now to do all those things, regional leaders will have to take pay cuts in some cases."
At issue in the resignation at the Board of Cooperative Educational Services is a combination of economic pressure and other factors. As Superintendent, Dr. Hare is paid $128,625, the limit imposed by the State Legislature in 1993 after a Suffolk County superintendent retired with a compensation package of nearly $1 million. Under a 1997 law, Dr. Hare's compensation would actually decrease by about $7,000 when his contract came up for renewal in the fall.
"This impacts the rate for a pension basis," said Dr. Hare, who has been on the job since 1995. "I took the job with an awareness and acceptance of the cap placed on the Boces' superintendent's salary. But as I approach my retirement years, the compensation decrease makes the decision to stay here difficult. The other part of it is that the Commissioner of Education has an aggressive reform agenda that I agree with and support. Within the strategy of a reform agenda, the Boces district superintendent has to implement it. The state role has significantly increased, and it's more difficult to be a hands-on superintendent."

HEADLINE: Women at Helm Set A Course To the Top

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
ONE built an empire from her kitchen table, another turned her back on a Fortune 500 employer and struck out on her own and the third was determined to fly solo even though she was married to the boss. These three entrepreneurs from Westchester are on Working Woman magazine's first list of the largest 500 female-owned businesses in the United States, published in the May issue.
Although each of the three pursues a separate dream, they share much in common -- in particular their penchant for taking risks, a tenaciousness when it comes to fulfilling goals and an ability to spin ideas into gold. And as concerns owned by women, their companies represent the fastest growing segment of the American economy. 
 A few of the entrepreneurs on the magazine's list -- which encompasses almost every business endeavor from manufacturing and construction to publishing and entertainment -- are household names like Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, but most are less well known. Prominent or not, the women own businesses that showed annual earnings ranging from $13.2 million to $5.4 billion last year.
In Westchester, the top female-owned businesses are Lillian Vernon, the New Rochelle catalogue business, which was the idea of a young housewife in the early 1950's and showed $258 million in revenue last year; the Wen Technology Group in Yonkers, which was started by an International Business Machines early retiree seven years ago and reported $84.7 million in revenue last year, and Robison Oil, an Elmsford-based heating oil and home-improvement company, which resulted when a determined boss's wife struck out on her own two decades ago and last year reported $53 million in revenue.
The three -- Lillian Vernon, chairwoman of the board and chief executive officer of the catalogue business; Dr. Sheree Wen, president and chief executive officer of the Wen Technology Group, and Fran Singer, president of Robison Oil -- are among the nearly 8 million female business owners in the United States employing more than 18.5 million people and generating close to $2.3 trillion in sales in 1996, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, a research organization in Washington.
Between 1987 and 1996, the number of female-owned companies increased by 78 percent nationwide, outpacing overall business growth nearly 2 to 1 and accounting for 36 percent of all companies in the United States, the foundation said.
In recent interviews, the three Westchester businesswomen, like their counterparts across the United States, described themselves as hard driving and demanding. And each said she was committed to a goal that she expected her employees to share. None said the course that she had chosen was easy, but neither did any of them say she would choose differently if she had the option to do so.
"My husband said: 'You don't have to do this. Why don't you just stay at home and live a quiet life?' " recalled Dr. Wen, president of Wen Technology Corporation in Yonkers and inventor of low-emission computer monitors, voice activated notebook computers and touch-screen tele-video conferencing systems, among other things.
"But I believe we each do what we have to do in life to fulfill our mission," said Dr. Wen, 47, of Briarcliff, a former I.B.M. vice president who started her own company and now has 12 patents under her name. She holds a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in materials engineering, solid state physics and statistics. The Government and the United States Army are her largest clients, buying among other things the low-emission Wen monitors, which are designed to thwart the theft of high-security information from a computer's memory.
For the 70-year-old Ms. Vernon, who emigrated from Leipzig, Germany, with her family in the early years of Nazi rule, it was the concept of monogramming belts and handbags and turning $500 spent for an advertisement in Seventeen magazine into a $32,000 profit. "There were naysayers along the way," she said recently, "but I was never defeated, even though I cried a lot in the early days."
Ms. Vernon wished she had done some things differently, like putting up her feet occasionally at the end of the day instead of taking work home. But she said she would not choose -- not in the 1950's or today -- to stay at home and leave the bread winning to a husband. Still hard driving and now a frequent visitor to the White House, she raised two sons along the way to success, left two husbands and grew a business that is publicly owned. As a septuagenarian, she is planning to marry for the third time -- this time, though, promising herself to set limits to her six-day work week.
She was born Lillian Menasche and took the name Lillian Vernon, for Mount Vernon where her original warehouse was. She now lives in Greenwich and Manhattan.
For Mrs. Singer, 58, of Dobbs Ferry, the first step was becoming the partner of her husband, Saul, in an oil supply company in the Bronx, and the next was taking off on her own to start a Westchester-based concern. She still bristles when businessmen call her "hon" or "sweetie" -- "I tell them I prefer Fran, thank you" -- but she knows that the long days and stretches without a break have paid off in respect from most people she meets, even if some still derogate her and other successful women.
Robison Oil is currently expanding to include home-improvement services as well as oil deliveries, and two of her three grown sons have become vice presidents in the business. Notwithstanding the grueling schedule of running one's own company over the years, she said she never served a TV dinner to her children or her husband (they have been married for 38 years). As for juggling a growing business, a busy household and the Singer family's philanthropic efforts in Israel, she said that like other business owners, "I thrive on stress."
Studies of the traits of successful female entrepreneurs show that they have "unbelievable perseverance and are disciplined to stick with a task," said Edie Fraser, president of the Business Women's Network, a Washington-based organization with 10 million members.
Female entrepreneurs differ from their counterparts who work for Fortune 500 companies in that successful corporate managers are politically savvy and tend to work comfortably within the framework of a group. By contrast, entrepreneurs tend to ignore the rules, strike out on their own and flourish when taking risks, Ms. Fraser said.
"A lot of it is street smarts, common-sense intelligence," said Ms. Vernon, who graduated from high school but did not go to college. "It's wisdom, not a degree, that gets you ahead in business, even though at first I thought I was just getting lucky."
Lillian Vernon, which ranked 53d on Working Woman's list, employs 1,350 workers year round and more than 4,500 near the Christmas shopping season. The company, which markets gift items and household, gardening and children's products, will relocate its headquarters to Rye this summer. It also has a distribution center in Virginia Beach, Va., and a buying and quality control office in Florence, Italy.
Wen Technology Corporation manufactures its products in Yonkers and sells them through distributors, government agencies and chain stores. The company introduced its first voice-recognition notebook at a consumer electronics conference in 1995. Two years ago, it introduced a 29-inch, high-definition television with Super VGA computer monitor capabilities. And last year, it announced two new products -- an extra-thin liquid crystal display monitor with a wide viewing angle and a portable wireless security monitor with a 4-inch screen, which can be carried anywhere within a 150-foot radius.
Dr. Wen has invented all the products that her company manufactures. She most recently invented and patented an electronic cleaning processor, which can destroy bacteria, viruses, microbes and pesticides on food.
A self-described risk taker, she said, "You have to be brave enough to take risks and shrewd enough to avoid those that are too big." She called her managerial style with her 40 employees "quite demanding," but said that was necessary in a small and growing company like hers, which ranked 127th on Working Woman's list of 500.
And while she often begins her workday before 8 A.M. and does not end it until midnight, Dr. Wen leaves her weekends free for her 9-year-old daughter, Aileen McGroddy, and her husband, James C. McGroddy, a former director of research at I.B.M. and now a Government consultant for security matters.
Robison Oil, which Mrs. Singer bought from Mobil Oil in 1978, serves 25,000 homeowners in Westchester and Putnam Counties and was 178th on the list of 500 female-owned companies, with 120 employees. In addition to selling fuel oil, the company markets electricity, furnaces, humidifiers, air-conditioning equipment, awnings, storm windows and other home-improvement items.
Mrs. Singer said a critical thrust of her business is letting customers know that there "really is a Fran Singer" behind the company name and that she will "answer each and every call and letter she receives." The personal touch -- one could call it the woman's touch, she said -- is one of the keys to her success.
Although one could argue that women demonstrate the same characteristics of success that men do, studies have shown that their styles are different.
"When a man says, 'I'll think about it,' he means no and he is probably giving you the brushoff," said Sharon G. Hadary, executive director of the National Foundation for Women Business Owners in Washington, offering an example. "But when a woman says the same thing, she really means that she will think about it. Any salesman who assumes that a female C.E.O. means what her male counterpart means and fails to check back is mistaken and probably out of a sale."
Or as Dr. Wen explained it: "If I'm not interested, I'll simply say, 'I'm not interested.' Perhaps women are just more straightforward than men."

HEADLINE: The Fresh Air Fund;
Family Welcomes Girl's Return

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
MICHELLE RIVERA hadbeen to Yankee Stadium before but never in $20 seats right behind home plate. That is where Michelle sat when she went to a ball game last summer with Gary and Kristin Friedman and their children, Sarah, 9, and Matthew, 6.
"It was excellent," Michelle, a fifth grader, said. "The best. Terrific. I had been to Yankee Stadium before but never so close to the players." 
 Michelle, 11, of the Bronx was visiting the Friedmans, who live here, for two weeks, thanks to the Fresh Air Fund. The fund, a 120-year-old noprofit agency, provides free summer vacations for disadvantaged New York City children. This year, 7,000 children will visit volunteer host families in suburban and rural areas in 13 states and Canada; 3,000 children will also attend Fresh Air camps in Fishkill, N.Y., and 1,000 youngsters will take part in year-round Fresh Air camping programs.
The Friedmans decided to open their home to a Fresh Air visitor after reading about and contributing to the fund for several years. They would have been hosts sooner, Mrs. Friedman said, but they were initially reluctant to sign up "because we thought a suburban house might not be the proper venue -- we were afraid that we didn't have enough countrified things to offer."
Her misgivings turned out to be completely unfounded: not only did both visitor and hosts have a great time but Michelle is also returning this summer.
Their activities will probably be almost identical to those of last summer: swimming in the Olympic-size Scarsdale municipal pool, going to a Yankees game and a Broadway show (last year it was "Beauty and the Beast"), watching Fourth of July fireworks ("I think each fireworks display is a little miracle," Mrs. Friedman said) and relaxing on the front porch of the family's 94-year-old, Tudor-style house.
Michelle said she enjoyed swimming in the Scarsdale pool and added that she "can't wait to go back" to visit the Friedmans this summer.
Mrs. Friedman, who is a landscape designer, will also show Michelle, the many plants and flowers that grow in the garden and inside the house, and Michelle will most likely make a few contributions of her own.
"Last year she showed us Rollerblading," Sarah said. "She's really good."
The Friedmans' background led them naturally to reach out to others. Mr. Friedman, a 45-year-old lawyer, grew up in Merrick on Long Island. Although he had a comfortable upbringing, his grandparents were Jewish immigrants who came to America with very little money. His father eventually became a labor arbitrator, but as a young man he had to find work through the Works Progress Administration. His mother dropped out of high school to go to work; it wasn't until later in life that she became an economist.
In the 1930's, Mr. Friedman said, both of his parents "were part of a group of young Jewish intellectual socialists."
Although they did not explicitly tell young Gary to look out for those less fortunate than he was, the message was certainly implied.
Mrs. Friedman, 39, grew up in TriBeCa "before it was chic." Her mother, a sculptor, and her father, an art dealer, divorced when she was a child. Some summers she spent visiting her father and his new wife in Italy, but mostly Kristin went camping across the country with her mother to visit grandparents in Dallas.
"We camped because we had to -- we couldn't afford motels," she recalled. Asked if her mother ever directly told her about children who had less than they did, Mrs. Friedman laughed and said, "I don't think she ever would have said, 'There are kids who are not well off,' because we ourselves were not."
As for Michelle and other Fresh Air children, they come from low-income families and are chosen on the basis of need.
First-time visitors are 6 to 12 and their stay is two weeks long. Those invited back to the same family may continue until they are 18 and may stay longer.
There are no financial requirements for being a host family, nor is there financial reimbursement. As Fresh Air Fund literature says, "Most hosts simply want to share their homes with inner city youngsters."
Volunteer hosts are always needed. The number to call to volunteer is (800) 367-0003. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania County Resumes Commercial Growth

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: EXTON, Pa.

 BODY:
WITH the recession of the early 90's ended, Chester County is once again the fastest-growing county in eastern Pennsylvania, with plans for five million square feet of new commercial space set in motion last year alone.
The 756-square-mile county is a 45-minute drive from both Philadelphia and Harrisburg, the state capital. Its growth is the result of move-outs by companies that had been operating in the more fully developed nearby Montgomery and Delaware Counties in Pennsylvania, and New Castle County in Delaware, as well as growth by companies already based in Chester County. 
 The main corporate centers are in West Chester, Devon, Exton, Downingtown and Coatesville, although the best-known sites are in Brandywine Valley, a tourism center in the southern part of the county.
The total office and warehouse-distribution space in the county is only about 25 million square feet. But with sites in the more developed counties at a premium, the key to commercial growth has been lower costs and the regional road system. The Pennsylvania Turnpike crosses the county in the north, and Route 30, linking Philadelphia with Lancaster, runs roughly parallel to it farther south.
The Exton-Downington ramp off the turnpike, Exit 23, was a magnet for corporate growth in new parks in the 80's. Now construction at these parks has resumed, in part because of the completion a 5.5-mile four-lane bypass that diverts around the center of Exton. Opened in late 1995, the bypass is considered the key that unlocked the area's commercial potential.
The county's two largest employers, The Vanguard Group, one of the nation's largest mutual-fund companies, and QVC Network, the shop-at-home cable television retailer, have both added new buildings in the last year. And smaller companies are moving into the county from nearby centers in Montgomery County, where King of Prussia, 20 miles northeast of Exton, is a principal corporate center and a retail hub as well.
Among the beneficiaries of the new growth has been the Oaklands Corporate Center, a 305-acre office park in Exton that had 1.16 million square feet of occupied space in 26 buildings at the end of 1995.
Within the last year, said James J. Gorman, a partner in the ownership, six new companies have moved in, taking 145,000 square feet of space. One company, Omegaflex, an existing tenant that makes corrugated steel pipe, doubled the size of its building to 60,000 square feet.
It was King of Prussia's growth that led to a demand for warehouse and distribution space in Chester County, Mr. Gorman said, with companies forced out by rising demand for space from retail and office tenants who pay higher rents. Rents have risen in Exton, too, he said, but office tenants still pay under $20 a square foot a year, compared with roughly $25 to $30 a square foot closer to King of Prussia.
"It's like a game of checkers," said JoAnn West, a director in commercial brokerage in Cushman & Wakefield's suburban leasing office. She has watched companies move progressively farther west along turnpike exits in Fort Washington and King of Prussia, both in Montgomery County, and now to Exton.
THE projects now facing the approval process would add 20 percent to the total inventory of office, warehouse and distribution space, said Gary Smith, executive director of the Chester County Development Council. Last year nearly 500,000 square feet of new or renovated office space was added to the county's inventory, which totals about 11.6 million square feet, according to figures compiled by Smith Mack & Company, a regional real estate management company.
Much of this growth had been forecast for towns like Exton and Downingtown because of their proximity to Exit 23, Mr. Smith said, but there has also been growth to the north in Lionville and in Malvern south of Route 30. Expansions by existing tenants include a new 265,000-square-foot building for Shared Medical Systems Inc., which makes computers for the health-care industry, and a 300,000-square-foot campus for CFM Technologies, which makes electronics cleansing equipment for semiconductor manufacturers.
The Vanguard Group opened a 150,000-square-foot data center last year in Devon, not far from its corporate headquarters in Malvern.
And QVC Network unveiled its $20 million studio and office facility in a 585,000-square-foot building in West Chester. The studio adds 1,000 jobs to QVC's local workforce of 2,000 people.
Most of the area's corporate parks are owned by local developers, but the market has drawn the attention of real estate investment trusts, said Peter O. Schultz, regional director of First Industrial Realty Corporation.
The Chicago-based REIT made its first Philadelphia-area purchase in the Exton area, buying 16 buildings with 535,000 square feet built years ago by a local developer, Raymond Carr. "The Exton office market is relatively small but there's strong growth, particularly for technology and pharmaceutical companies," Mr. Schultz said.
Chester County is the only suburban county in southeastern Pennsylvania that shares no border with Philadelphia. More than 60 percent of its residents work within the county or in other suburbs, said William H. Fulton, executive director of the Chester County Planning Commission.
WE have people who travel to work by commuter train in the south end of our county," Mr. Fulton said. "And people who travel by horse-drawn carriage in the north as you enter Amish communities." Agriculture remains the county's top industry, anchored by mushroom growers clustered around Kennett Square, near the Delaware border.
Population forecasts estimate 500,000 residents by the year 2020, up from 420,000 today. Many of the transplanted employers are high-tech companies that include light manufacturing, research or subassembly operations along with their headquarters offices. Adopting a policy favoring "prudent development" years ago, county officials put in place a land-use plan allocating open space and office usage throughout the town's 73 municipalities, which has served as a guide to new growth.
Some employers are relocating to escape a road construction program in King of Prussia that will surely delay commuters near the Pennsylvania Turnpike's interchange with Route 202 and Interstate 76. An estimated 85,000 cars each day clog a four-lane, seven-mile-long section of highway between Exton and King of Prussia at rush hour, according to a local planning agency.
The newer corporate parks in Exton, Malvern and West Chester, the county seat, offer day-care and fitness centers, and stores and restaurants are usually closer by than they were in older parks. And Eagleview, a 700-acre planned community, will include not only offices but also a town center and at least one hotel, said Jack Purcell, marketing director for its builder, The Hankin Group.
Anthony J. Izzi, president of GEI Mateer Burt, which manufactures equipment for food and pharmaceutical companies, said he had surveyed his employees and found many already live in Chester County. After considering several sites, the company chose a new building in the Eagleview complex, about a 20-minute drive from its current headquarters in Devon, Pa. Last month, his company moved into 80,000 square feet of space.
"I wanted to go west because the pricing was lower and the next five years in this area will be a mess because of the Route 202 construction," he said. "We intend to have 4,000 square feet of lab space for the pharmaceutical industry where they can run clinical trials on our equipment."

HEADLINE: New York Area Retirees Get More Housing Choices

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
AT 73, John Curran has made a decision about where he wants to live next. He will be moving when he turns 75 from his one-bedroom co-op on East 76th Street to a new retirement community in New Jersey called Seabrook Village, in the Monmouth County town of Tinton Falls.
"My health is good," Mr. Curran said, "but I'm getting leery of living by myself. When I move I want to forget my worries about taking care of myself. It will be up to them to take care of me to the day I die." 
 Seabrook Village, which went into construction only this year, is a formidable symbol of the growth in the forms of housing available for older people in the metropolitan area, especially those in their 70's and 80's. It is a continuing-care retirement community, with independent living, assisted living and nursing care available for life. The entry fees for the independent-living apartments vary, but most are under $200,000, with monthly service charges averaging $1,500. Buyers will have the option of moving on later to assisted-living or nursing care, at additional costs, in facilities that are to go into construction late next year.
There are few such communities in the Northeast -- most are in Pennsylvania and Maryland -- and even fewer that have been built by a for-profit developer. Because of its scale, Seabrook Village is a departure among all of them in the New York metropolitan area. It will have 1,650 apartments for independent living, plus 192 assisted-living apartments and 160 private rooms for nursing-home patients. About 2,500 people will eventually live there, most of them in their 70's.
Seabrook Village will not be a traditional "life-care" community, however, because residents do not contract for life upon entry for possible future nursing care or other supportive services. Instead, they pay for these if and when they are needed. Also, they or their estate get a 100 percent refund of their entry fee upon move-out or death, once the apartment is reoccupied.
Seabrook Village serves to drive home the point that middle-income people of retirement age are getting a wider choice in independent-living accommodations. This is especially so for those who have long lived in a house that has appreciated in value. It can be sold, and the profits plowed into retirement housing, making many of the newer choices affordable. An expansion is also under way in pure assisted-living developments, in which residents usually get all their meals served plus help in the tasks of daily life.
The main choice for healthy, vigorous retirees has historically been what are now called active-adult leisure communities -- age-restricted communities of houses or condominiums where at least one member of the household is 55 or older. Most of them in the metropolitan area are in New Jersey beyond typical commuting distance to New York City, in Ocean, Middlesex or Monmouth Counties. Some have golf courses, but all have at least a clubhouse. They take years to complete and some are still expanding even as new ones continue to open. And recently new retirement communities have opened closer to the population centers of northern New Jersey.
One of the new ones, Brookfield, will ultimately have 300 single-family homes and 185 apartments on 115 acres in White Township adjoining the town of Belvedere, the county seat of Warren County, two miles from the Delaware River. Land clearance got started this year and the first homes are to be ready for occupancy in December.
With a sales campaign due to start next month, early shoppers have been quoted prices from the $120,000's to the $150,000's for single-family detached houses. Belvedere Development Company, whose principal is Kenneth G. McDermott, is the builder.
Another new community is Fox Hills, 30 miles to the east of Brookfield in Rockaway Township in Morris County. Fox Hills will have 600 apartments in three-story steel-and-concrete buildings plus a 23,250-square-foot clubhouse in a gated community near Interstate 80. Sales on the first phase of Fox Hills, with 84 units, began just last month, and 56 buyers have already signed up, said Morton Salkind, the developer.
"This area could take 10 more communities like ours," said Mr. Salkind. Most buyers live within a radius of 30 miles, embracing Morris, western Essex and southwestern Bergen Counties, where the population is more than one million, he said. The price range is $130,000 to $219,000.
In New York City, Brookdale Living Communities, based in Chicago, is moving forward with plans for a $45 million development for retirees in in Battery Park City, a pure-rental project on which marketing may begin as early as this summer for occupancy in about two years. Rents for a one-bedroom are expected to be at least $4,500 a month. It will have 216 apartments, including a small assisted-living component.
AS these and other projects indicate, the character of housing designed for retired people is diverse. The market includes younger, robust people, often couples in their 60's ready to sell their homes after retirement and start out on some of the most pleasurable years of their lives. But it is not necessarily easy for them to adjust to the idea of moving at all.
"I had to convince my husband to move to an adult community," said Deanna Zacune, 60, who succeeded. She and her husband, Harmon, 63, a dentist who taught dental-hygiene students after he sold his practice, both retired this year. They sold their condominium in Edison, N.J., and bought an 1,800-square-foot three-bedroom detached house with a two-car garage at K. Hovnanian & Company's Four Seasons at Lakewood community off Route 70 in Ocean County.
"We're now 40 minutes farther from our son, but I thought it would be nice to be in something new, with other adults all over 55 or 60 so we can grow old together, rather than be dependent on our children to watch out for us," said Mrs. Zacune, a former state employee. "This place helps keep you younger. There are so many places to go. There's something to do here every day if you want to do it."
The Lakewood community, with a nine-hole golf course, is Hovnanian's largest adult community in New Jersey. It opened in 1995, and so far 850 houses have been sold and occupied. When construction is completed, there will be 1,300 detached and attached homes on the 407 acres of land. Houses are currently selling from $141,000 to $192,000. The most popular model -- a two-bedroom with 1,860 square feet of space and a two-car garage -- has a base price of $189,000.
Farther north, in Monmouth County, homes are more expensive. At the new Four Seasons community in Wall Township, off Route 34, detached two-bedroom houses with two-car garages, for example, sell for $228,000 to $240,000.
Eventually, some of the residents at active-leisure communities move out, perhaps to assisted-living developments, where meals and personal care are offered. At the Shady Oaks retirement community in Lincroft, N.J., in Monmouth County, which has attached homes and multifamily two-story buildings built in the mid-80's by Hovnanian, about 70 apartments a year turn over because of vacancies or death, said Bernice Jachter, a real estate broker who lives there. Prices range from $90,000 to $190,000.
The appreciation in value has been greater in downstairs units than upstairs units, Ms. Jachter said. "People are looking for one-level living -- with no steps," she said.
People in their 70's and 80's are often looking for long-term care as well as a secure environment and social activity among other adults of their age. The assumption that there is a broad middle-income market for this type of housing in the region will be tested by the ambitious Seabrook Village project.
The developer is Senior Campus Living of Baltimore, the developer-operator of the large-scale communities of Charlestown, outside Baltimore in Catonsville, Md., and the newer Oak Crest Village in Parkville, Md. Seabrook Village has bused more than 500 prospective buyers to Oak Crest Village for a daylong inspection, an experience that has been a prelude to a purchase by some of them. The company is also developing Henry Ford Village, with the Ford Motor Company, in Dearborn, Mich.
Seeking a large-scale New Jersey site five years ago, Senior Campus Living was rebuffed by local opposition first by Franklin Lakes, in Bergen County, and then by Wayne, in Passaic County. But Tinton Falls was welcoming. After final site acquisition last fall, the developer is in construction on the first of three large "neighborhoods," each of which is to have 550 apartments for independent living. The entrance is on Essex Road off Asbury Avenue near the Garden State Parkway.
The apartments at Seabrook Village will be in interconnected buildings of four to seven stories, linked to a central 70,000-square-foot three-level community building with a main dining room capable of serving 275 people at a time, various special purpose rooms and a 4,800-square-foot medical center with staff physicians. Residents reach the community building from the residential wings through glass-enclosed walkways. There are also landscaped outdoor courtyards, and about a third of the site is to be kept in a natural state. The land planner is Schoor DePalma of Freehold, N.J., and the architect is The Hillier Group, of Princeton.
According to Gary T. Engelstad, the director of sales, there have been 200 reservations for the 253 apartments that are so far on the market, with first occupancy planned for November. The entrance fees range from $111,000 to $340,000. An 850-square-foot one-bedroom, with a fully equipped kitchen, has an entry fee of $148,000; for a typical two-bedroom, with 1,100 square feet, the fee is $197,000. Entry fees are used principally to pay down mortgage debt and thereby reduce monthly service charges.
The monthly charges, ranging from $1,100 to $1,700, cover operating costs and include one meal a day, all utilities except phone service and apartment upkeep, plus the on-site and off-site activities and transportation services offered in adult communities generally. For additional charges residents can also get reserved parking, housekeeping services or home health care.
If a resident moves into the assisted-living section, the charge rises. It is currently projected at $2,500 a month. The projected cost of care in the nursing-home unit is $176 a day.
The fee-for-services system at Seabrook Village shows how developers have modified the original approach in continuing care, which was to guarantee care for life without any rise in monthly costs. Buyers who moved out would get no refund, nor would their estates get a refund if they died while living independently.
Some of these life-care developments went into bankruptcy in the 60's when they promised more medical benefits than they could deliver. In New York State the bankruptcies led to new regulations that made development conditions so restrictive that for-profit development has virtually ceased. The state has also been conservative about adding new nursing home beds unless a local need can be demonstrated.
Nowadays even nonprofit continuing-care developments rarely guarantee future assisted-living or nursing care at no increase in cost. And they, too, refund most of the entrance fee when the resident dies or moves out. Usually fees are 90 percent refundable, although at Seabrook Village refunds 100 percent. And some projects are designed as pure rentals.
OUR goal is to get to the large population centers with middle-income retirees," said John C. Erickson, chairman of Senior Campus Living. "You can have one every 30 miles." The company is currently developing a community for 3,000 residents called Riderwood Village in Silver Spring, Md., 30 miles south of the 2,000-resident Charlestown community, which itself is only 20 miles southwest of Oak Crest Village.
But the company cannot build in New York State, Mr. Erickson said, because the state requires that revenues are set high enough to cover the future cost of extended care, including a certain amount of nursing care. Only one in 14 residents of Senior Campus Living's projects turn out to need extended care, he said. Requiring charges to independent-living residents to cover it would mean that monthly carrying costs would have to be twice as high -- about $2,000 a month instead of $1,000, he said.
"New York State says charge $2,000 a month and make no distinction on whether the services are needed or not," Mr. Erickson said. "Middle America won't do that." To prevent overconstruction of nursing-home beds, the state also puts a limit of 90 on the number allowed in a continuing-care project, a figure too low for developments the size of those that Senior Campus Living builds, Mr. Erickson said.
In Connecticut, another private owner-operator, David Reis, the principal in Senior Care Development in North Branford, Conn., is developing a major continuing-care community in Fairfield County. The 136-acre site is on a hilltop off Route 107 in the Town of Redding, with panoramic views of the countryside. Mr. Reis bought the land last year from the Perkin-Elmer Corporation, a maker of scientific instruments based in Wilton, Conn., which had planned to build a new corporate headquarters.
Mr. Reis said he would break ground in June for Meadow Ridge. It will have 380 units for independent living plus assisted-living and nursing-care rooms. Its typical two-bedroom apartments will have 1,350 square feet, and its three-story community building will have a 10,000-square-foot atrium and an Olympic-size pool. The buildings will be reached from a winding road rising nearly a mile through woodlands from a manned gatehouse on Route 107.
With entry fees starting at $360,000, Meadow Ridge will be a high-end community, a reflection of the higher-income characteristics of the area in which it is built. "We'll be attracting a lot of wealthy couples," said Mr. Reis, who also developed Evergreen Woods, a continuing-care development with 247 apartments for independent living in North Branford, Conn., near New Haven.
Meadow Ridge will be a true life-care community, with assisted living or nursing care provided with minimal additional charges. Its nursing-home component will take private-pay patients from the start, and the revenue generated will be used in part to meet the expense of providing nursing care for those Meadow Ridge residents who eventually need it. About 20 percent of the monthly fee of those in independent living -- where charges are expected to average $2,000 -- will also be set aside for this purpose, Mr. Reis said.
New York State, for its part, defines a continuing-care community as one that accepts prepayment for possible future health services, and it must be licensed by the Department of Health. An interagency Continuing Care Retirement Community Council within the state's Department of Health is in place to help move applications through the five agencies that must approve any project (after a feasibility study, an actuarial study, a demand study and a market analysis).
According to Nicholas J. Mongiardo, a principal in the White Plains health-care consulting firm of Cicero Shapiro Velazquez & Cicero, at least four major projects are in the process of seeking regulatory approval. They would provide more than 1,000 independent-living units in the greater metropolitan area. And in the 90's, two projects have been completed -- Kendal at Ithaca, in Tompkins County, and Glen Arden in Goshen, in Orange County. Two others are in construction -- the Jewish Home, in Rochester, and Canterbury Woods, in Amherst in Erie County. All four are nonprofit development projects.
"My feeling is that the for-profits have been busy marketing in other states around New York, but they also know that eventually they'll have to come to New York because there's such a big market here," said Mr. Mongiardo, a former deputy director in the Department of Health and the former chairman of the interdepartmental Lifecare Community Council, as it was then known.
The "fee for service" approach used in other states has also begun to show up recently in New York State. Developers are building independent-living units without Department of Health licenses, while contracting with licensed health-care providers to offer services to residents on a fee basis. The developments are usually rentals.
MR. REIS, the Connecticut developer, doubts this, however. The reserve requirements that developers in New York are required by the Department of Insurance to keep are too high to allow projects to pay down development debt from entrance-fee revenue, he said, a practice that allows projects to run economically.
Also, Mr. Reis said that a requirement that the insurance department reserves the right to pass upon future increases in monthly rates, which he said are pass-throughs of rising operating costs, is unacceptable to him. "We could not take the risk of being denied an increase in charges needed for operating," he said.
Whatever the new developments are that are built for retirees and older people generally, many of them will find other options -- if they can bring themselves to move at all.
Dr. Morton Salkind, an 86-year-old retired dentist in Nyack, N.Y., said he resisted moving out of the house he had lived in for 40 years even though he had been living in it alone since the death of his wife, Helen, six years ago. He finally sold the house and moved last August into a rental building called West Shore apartments on the Hudson River in Nyack.
"I was living alone but I couldn't make up my mind to move," Dr. Salkind said. "I kept putting it off and putting it off. Last year I decided it was time."

Solutions to Traffic Problems

 BODY:
The number of cars in the state keep increasing, but there is no room for new roads. How should the state handle its traffic problems?
 
Gas Is Too Cheap 
 Until a gallon of gas exceeds a gallon of milk in price, nothing will change. The general population will believe (based on advertising) that today's cars are more efficient and less polluting, and thus feel free to drive more often. Public transportation is still geared for getting people to Newark, New York City, and Philadelphia in the morning and getting them home at night, with limited service everywhere else. If officials really want people out of cars, public transportation needs to provide more service to more locations.

Keep Right
One quick, no-cost way to greatly increase the capacity on present high-speed roads is to cut down the radar traps and have the troopers moving and enforcing the "keep right except to pass" law. The speed limit will soon be at 65 and since most traffic on I-295 in south Jersey has always moved only slightly only above that (at 72) there is less need for radar traps. If all kept to the right except when passing there would be three lanes continuously moving with no slowing as each lane would find a comfortable steady speed and there would be no bunching up.

Move Truck Traffic
One of the most obvious problems is the mix of auto and heavy trucking traffic during the rush hours. Trucking during rush hour impedes the flow of traffic, increases pollution and increases the economic and social costs to all of us. A simple solution would be to restructure our shipping and distribution system to exclude heavy truck traffic during the rush hours. A more radical and controversial approach would be to have our distribution system operate between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M.

Increase Tunnel Tolls
 From where I sit, in a bus seat high above the passenger vehicles approaching the Lincoln Tunnel, I would say that most cars have but a single occupant, their driver. I propose changing the toll structure as follows: cars with only their driver must pay $100 to drive through the tunnel; two occupants, $50; three occupants, $4 (the current toll), and four or more go free. For most of these motorists there are alternative ways to get into Manhattan. Let's force these inefficient users of our resources to seriously ponder their extravagance.

First-Quarter Housing Sales Top '97 Quarter by 23%

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
WITH almost a quarter more homes sold in the first three months of this year than in the same period last year, Westchester County continues to benefit from the Wall Street boom and the fallout from New York City's surging real estate market.
The total number of residential sales in Westchester rose 23 percent in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. That total, which includes single-family homes, cooperatives, condominiums and two- to five-family houses, represented 1,778 closings in the first quarter, against 1,448 for the same period last year. 
 "It's really a continuation of the level of sales we've been seeing for several years now," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "It's reflective of the strong local economy and, of course, low mortgage rates."
In the period from October 1997 to January 1998 when most contracts were signed that resulted in first quarter closings, the average interest rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage dropped from about 7.5 percent to 7 percent.
Another factor contributing to the sales increase was the resurgent residential market in New York City, which enabled people to sell their co-ops and move to the suburbs, Mr. Mercurio said. "Also renters are now making the decision to buy due to improved job security," he added.
The total dollar volume for first-quarter sales was $560 million, up from $434 million in the first three months of 1997. All housing categories experienced double-digit increases in numbers of sales from the year-earlier quarter, with condominiums rising 19 percent and co-ops 41 percent.
"The market's been so good, everybody is gasping for air," said Merritt Mitchell, president of Merritt Associates, a brokerage with offices in Scarsdale, Rye and Larchmont. "We're tied to the fortunes of the stock market. As long as that keeps gaining, we'll be in good shape."
The one downside to the good times, according to brokers, is lack of sales inventory. "Across the board, it's light," Mr. Mitchell said. The inventory of detached homes declined 24 percent to 3,945 units, from 5,171 units the same time last year. Condominiums are down 35 percent, to 685 units from 978 in 1997. And co-ops declined 21 percent to 1,422 units from 1,790.
Even with such robust sales activity, prices across the board are relatively flat. The first quarter median sales price for a detached home was $290,000, up just 3 percent from the prior year; the average price was $403,020, a 7 percent increase from a year earlier.
"The mean price shows there wasn't much shift in the relative proportion of inexpensive to higher-end sales," Mr. Mercurio explained. "While the average price indicates there were some price increases at the higher end."
Mr. Mitchell confirmed this, saying that in his markets "our brokers are amazed at the prices some houses are getting." But, he added, "the buyers don't seem to wince." There's also been a noticeable increase in the number of multiple bids, he said.
"It's something I don't like to see, frankly," Mr. Mitchell said. "Some brokers unfortunately encourage it. And the sale comes down to a bidding war. We also saw it in the 80's."
In a recent sale, Mr. Mitchell said, there were 11 bids on a three-bedroom colonial, which was in foreclosure. "The house was in disrepair," Mr. Mitchell said. "The bids started at $160,000 and went to $205,000. The house eventually sold at close to its $236,250 asking price."
Mr. Mitchell said he had seen instances where a house sold for $50,000 above its asking price. "In one particular case, a house hit the market on a good weekend," he said, "and everyone went after it."
Nevertheless, in most areas, pricing still matters. "Realistic pricing by sellers is still imperative in order to make a timely sale," said Ebie Wood, a regional manager for Houlihan/Lawrence. "If a home is priced competitively, it flies out the door. But if it's above the market, it will languish. Our buyers are extremely savvy."
In general, houses are taking less time to sell, according to Ms. Wood. In the year ended April 1, for example, there were 201 transactions in Bedford. The average time on market was 175 days. A year earlier there were 195 sales and average time on market was 226 days.
Edmond and Mary O'Reilly didn't want to wait until the spring market to buy their new home. "We wanted to get this house off the market," Mr. O'Reilly said. "We wanted to close before the spring rush."
The couple paid $395,000 for a five-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath Tudor in the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon. They closed on March 17 and moved in on April 18. "We had set our limit at $400,000", Mr. O'Reilly said.
WE did get a lot of calls on that house," said Liz Lindsey, of Lindsey Real Estate, which handled the sale. "If the O'Reillys hadn't already been under contract, there probably would have been multiple offers. Luckily for them, they moved with dispatch."
The couple had been living in a two-bedroom co-op in Yonkers. But with three children and another due in August "it was definitely time to move," Mr. O'Reilly said. They were able to sublet their apartment, which was a critical factor. "With co-op prices what they are now," Mr. O'Reilly said, "we couldn't have afforded to sell it at this time and take the loss."
The O'Reilly's bought their apartment at the height of the co-op market in 1987. And while co-op sales posted the biggest increase in the first quarter, prices continued to drop. In the first quarter 260 co-ops were sold, compared with 185 in the same period last year. But the median sales price fell to $63,000 from $64,000 last year, a 2 percent decline.
Mr. Mercurio explained that just 20 percent of co-ops in the county sell for over $100,000, so the presence or absence of just a few sales in the higher price ranges noticeably affects the countywide averages.
In some markets, co-op prices have fared a little better. In the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon, where there is an abundance of co-ops, there were 21 sales in the first quarter, compared with 19 in 1997, which represents a 9.5 percent increase, according to Liz Lindsey.
More significantly, prices during that same period were up 6.9 percent. "We're a real co-op area," Ms. Lindsey said. "People come here because we're right by the train station with access to Manhattan. The broker who handles co-ops in our office now has 11 under contract."
A total of 231 condominiums were sold in the first quarter, compared with 194 last year. The median sale price increased to $157,000, from $153,000 last year, a 3 percent change.
"Condominiums tend to track the progress of single-family homes more than co-ops," Mr. Mercurio said. "There's still a big inventory in co-ops. I don't expect prices to climb until the inventory is substantially reduced."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
The Hill Gets Steeper For State's Land-Use Plan

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When Governor Whitman vowed earlier this year to use the state development plan to help slow down suburban sprawl, she was applauded by the lobbying group that represents local officials.
The New Jersey State League of Municipalities has been a longtime supporter of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, which was created six years ago to help cities and towns avoid haphazard development. 
 But now the League of Municipalities has joined forces with the New Jersey Builders Association to oppose what Whitman administration officials view as a routine housekeeping matter intended to help municipalities manage growth.
The administration is proposing to consolidate state government's planning and land-use functions within one state agency by moving the Office of State Planning from the Treasury Department to the Department of Community Affairs.
"Our core mission is community development and planning," said Jane Kenny, Commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs. "And the state plan is the blueprint for community planning."
So why has this proposal caused such a ruckus and created an unusual alliance between the New Jersey Builders Association and the League of Municipalities?
In the past, the builders association and the League of Municipalities have taken opposing sides in the debate over the state's efforts to guide planning and development.
The new alliance troubles those who view the plan as the state's best hope to manage growth and prevent acres and acres of open space from being gobbled up by new construction. Environmentalists and other proponents of the plan fear that local officials, represented by the League of Municipalities, could derail the administration's attempts to move forward.
"We must take steps now to scale back overdevelopment to some sane level, or in the near future the New Jersey we know will disappear beneath bulldozers," said Bill Neil, assistant director for conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society. "The lobbyists for local municipalities should be part of that effort, rather than providing political cover for the special interests who are sitting in the driver's seat of the bulldozers."
William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the League of Municipalities, said that there was no grand conspiracy between his group and the builder's association to block implementation of the state development plan or Governor Whitman's vision to manage growth.
"We just happen to agree that the Office of State Planning should remain in the Treasury Department," said Mr. Dressel, in an appearance before the Assembly's Local Government and Housing Committee last week.
Mr. Dressel says his biggest concern is that the Department of Community Affairs is a regulatory agency while the Treasury Department does not have any regulatory authority over land-use decisions. And he is concerned that land-use functions, within a state regulatory agency, could erode New Jersey's longstanding tradition of home rule, which allows cities and towns to determine their fates.
He asked the legislative committee to consider blocking the administration from making the move without legislative approval.
Patrick O'Keefe, the executive vice president of the Builder's Association, echoed Mr. Dressel's concerns. He also criticized the Whitman administration for not consulting his organization and other groups before proposing the move.
"In the end, the lack of consultation regarding the transfer may be the single strongest argument against it," he said.
But Barbara Lawrence, head of New Jersey Future, a watchdog group created a decade ago to oversee the implementation of the state plan, said she is concerned that the League's opposition is sending a signal that the powerful lobbying group does not recognize that residents want their state and local officials to take a stronger stance against haphazard development.
"I think it means the league is out of step with the people of New Jersey," Ms. Lawrence said.
The proposal by the Whitman administration to consolidate state government's land-use planning functions demonstrates that the Governor is serious about using the state plan to guide development and growth in New Jersey.
Ms. Lawrence and other proponents of the plan wonder if that is what local officials fear.
New Jersey has already demonstrated its commitment to winning consensus from local communities for the plan. That is what makes New Jersey's state plan different from similar plans in other states.
In New Jersey, the state does not impose its own ideas about where development should or should not occur in each of the state's 566 municipalities. Those decisions are made with the consent of local officials through a lengthy process, involving a great deal of public discussion and debate.
The debate over this proposed transfer of the state planning office from one state agency to another shows that Governor Whitman is likely to face uphill battle over implementing her vision for managing development and growth in New Jersey. It was easier for local officials to say they agreed with the state plan when it seemed as if state government was ignoring it.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOHO/GREENWICH VILLAGE;
Non-Artists' Housing Seen as Blot on Local Canvas

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
Most of the housing in SoHo consists of lofts, where only city-authenticated "artists in residence" are supposed to live. But the city has approved a developer's plan to build more than 100 conventional apartments in the neighborhood, which has some local residents up in arms.
The Continuum Company is planning two buildings on parking lots on the south side of Houston Street, from Mercer Street to Wooster Street, in an area zoned for manufacturing. Until recently, variances allowing residential use of buildings in the neighborhood were granted only under state law and city zoning rules that allow artists -- certified as such by the city -- to inhabit large "joint living work quarters" in low-rise buildings, said Sean Sweeney, a member of the SoHo Alliance neighborhood group and the chairman of the landmarks committee of Community Board 2. 
 But the Continuum Company applied for variances to put up buildings that would be taller than the five- and six-story structures that predominate in the area, and to create smaller units, mostly studios and one-bedroom apartments. There was no mention of any artist requirement in its application.
Local groups opposed the project, citing concerns about increased congestion in an already crowded area and worries that SoHo's distinctive flavor would be eroded.
"We want to preserve the character of SoHo as a working artists' center," said Alan Gerson, who is the chairman of Community Board 2. "We're against any type of land use that doesn't bolster that." The community board has formally opposed the plan.
The SoHo Alliance faulted Continuum's calculation that large loftlike spaces would be uneconomical. "If they had only one or two apartments per floor, they would still make a lot of money," Craig Whitaker, an architect hired by the Alliance, said, citing recent sales in and around SoHo at prices exceeding $400 a square foot for lofts of 1,200 to 2,400 square feet.
But Continuum's lawyer, Bob Davis, said the company's economic data showed otherwise. He also said many non-artists are already living in SoHo. "The addition of the residents of these apartments is not going to change the character of the area," Mr. Davis said.
On April 21, the city's Board of Standards and Appeals approved the developer's plan, which calls for a building of nine stories with 60 apartments on one of the lots and another of eight stories with 43 apartments on the other. Members of the SoHo Alliance said they plan to sue the city in hopes of getting the decision overturned.
"We must win this," Mr. Sweeney said. "The future of SoHo as an artists' center depends on it." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST NEW YORK;
Weed-Choked Acres Bring Forth Frustration, Not Housing

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
"Future Site of Gateway Estates," reads a sign at the edge of a weed-encrusted plot of land in East New York. "A Planned Community of 3,000 Affordable Homes, Regional Shopping, Parks and Schools."
That community was to be Brooklyn's largest housing development in two decades. For more than five years, the Starrett Corporation, the builder of Starrett City, has been molding and remolding plans for the land, 227 acres of a former city dump in the Spring Creek area of East New York. Starrett had also agreed to let the Nehemiah Project, a nonprofit that builds subsidized housing for working families, to put up 500 homes on the land. 
 But the project has hit snag after snag, and its fate is increasingly uncertain. Today, the vacant land seems less a symbol of urban rebirth than of a bureaucratic and political morass. It also testifies to some potential complications in the public-private partnerships that the Giuliani administration favors as an answer to many of the city's woes.
In March, the administration withdrew $10 million that it had promised to build roads, sewers and the like at the site. City officials, particularly Richard T. Roberts, the Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, have said that the infrastructure money was withdrawn because the Starrett Corporation had been unable to buy a piece of land needed to build a shopping center that the city feels is crucial to the project.
As it turns out, that land, 10.55 acres, is owned by the state, which is negotiating with Starrett over the purchase price. "There is a dispute over the value" of the land, said a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, Caroline A. Quarterero.
And now, the development's originator, the Starrett Corporation, is suddenly its wild card. In December, the company, which was publicly traded, was bought for $80 million by a group of private investors. Its new chief executive, Joel Simon, said that the Gateway project was being re-evaluated and that it was unlikely that the more than 2,000 housing units that were part of the original plan would be built. The shopping center is a better bet, he said, but not a sure one. "We are looking very earnestly to see whether we can proceed with the commercial part of the development," Mr. Simon said.
Michael Gecan, the regional supervisor for the Industrial Areas Foundation, which has worked with Nehemiah for 14 years, said even if the Gateway homes were not built, the Nehemiah homes would be. "We will build at Spring Creek," he said.
As to the infrastructure money, Mr. Roberts did not respond to a request for comment. Officials of East Brooklyn Congregations, the church consortium that runs Nehemiah, said administration officials have refused to meet with them. At a City Council hearing on Thursday, a deputy Housing Preservation commissioner, Hector Batista, said, "When this project is ready to go, we will re-evaluate."
The City Council has the power to restore the money without the Mayor's approval, and Mr. Gecan said that tomorrow, he and East Brooklyn Congregations officials will formally request that it do so.
And, at least one hurdle has been removed, if only temporarily. The New York City Audubon Society had sued the state over a building permit granted to the Starrett Corporation without a public hearing. On March 24, a State Supreme Court judge dismissed the lawsuit. The society, however, said it plans to appeal. AMY WALDMAN

Creditors Lead Push To Curb Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
WHAT was once a staple of the economic cycle -- recession driving more people into bankruptcy and then recovery thinning their ranks -- seems to have disappeared.
Last year, the number of Americans declaring themselves bankrupt jumped by nearly 20 percent, to 1.34 million, despite an economy that marked its sixth full year of uninterrupted expansion with the lowest jobless rate in a quarter-century. 
 Whatever the reason for this decoupling, the fact that one family in 75 winds up in such financial distress during boom times has fueled a long-simmering effort by banks, credit card companies and other lenders to persuade Congress to fix what they regard as overly permissive bankruptcy rules. The resulting clash with consumer groups has turned the bankruptcy issue into one of the most heavily lobbied in a Congress that is also weighing tobacco legislation and Social Security reform.
Bankruptcies are now more than six times as common as when the debtor-friendly Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 was passed. And too many people, the lenders and their political allies contend, are legally walking away from debt they could repay. As a result, the lenders say, costs they estimated at about $44 billion in 1997 -- or $400 for each American household -- are shifted onto more prudent consumers.
"The only reasonable explanation is that the stigma of bankruptcy is all but dead," argued Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, whose measure to limit filings is set to reach a sharply divided House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
This view is hotly disputed, however, by the National Consumer Law Center, labor groups and others as unfairly burdensome to those who are struggling to pay their bills. In addition, they say, it constitutes an assault on the long-established principle that society needs a mechanism to give the hopelessly indebted a fresh start.
"The credit industry has launched a massive media and lobbying campaign to discredit the consumer bankruptcy system," said Gary Klein of the Law Center, which represents low-income people. The proposed legislation, he argued, would jeopardize spending by its clientele on "essential items like their homes, cars and utilities." Moreover, debtors would be "yoked to unmanageable credit card and medical debts by a taxpayer-funded Federal collections bureaucracy."
DESPITE a short election-year calendar, Congressional action has become likely. In the House, the main bill, sponsored by Mr. Gekas and James P. Moran, a Virginia Democrat, would introduce a means test to determine how much relief debtors needed and would require them to repay what they could.
Supporters say the bill's focus is on those who have come to regard bankruptcy as a financial planning device or a Government program for debt forgiveness rather than on those who are overwhelmed by, say, catastrophic medical bills.
Under the measure, those with incomes at least 75 percent of the national median for households of equivalent size and who have the ability to pay at least 20 percent of unsecured debt within five years would be forced to enter into a Chapter 13 repayment plan. Money spent on priority items like alimony and back taxes, though, would not count toward the 20 percent.
Applying this test, and using the 1996 household median income of $42,300, earnings of more than $31,725, adjusted for inflation, would touch off the plan.
Proponents figure this requirement would force some 15 percent, or 200,000, of the least-stressed bankruptcy filers to make some payment instead of seeking relief under Chapter 7. That section of the bankruptcy law, under which virtually all debts are erased without regard to financial situation, is used for 70 percent of all personal bankruptcies.
Debtors earning less than 75 percent of the national average would be unaffected and could continue to choose between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13, which requires the debtor to agree to at least partial repayment.
The Senate has scheduled a drafting session for Thursday on its version of the legislation, whose chief sponsors are Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.
It seeks to curb abuse by allowing lenders, rather than a Government trustee, to argue in court that someone filing for bankruptcy can afford to pay. Banks and credit card issuers object strongly to a provision that would make them liable for at least $5,000 of a debtor's legal costs when the court rules against the lender.
IN arguing that the bankruptcy surge reflects undisciplined spending and an indulgent law, the credit card sponsors and their allies cite research showing that some 25 percent of those filing under Chapter 7 had their debts erased even though they could have repaid a "significant" proportion. Ten percent of those filing, they contend, could have repaid it all.
Consumer advocates counter that these industry-financed studies are irrelevant and misleading. Indeed, the advocates contend, lenders are promoting the studies with the same aggressiveness with which they marketed high-rate credit cards to marginally solvent consumers.
Opposition has also come from women's groups concerned that raising credit-card claims to a status equal to that now granted child support would make it harder for mothers to collect delinquent support. With more debtors forced to use Chapter 13, the mothers would have to wage continuing battles with powerful claimants like credit-card companies, the groups contend.
It is not yet clear how another issue will play out: a little-publicized move that would likely make it harder for businesses to get bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.
"It really puts the screws to the small-business person," said Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School who opposes the bill.
But the National Federation of Independent Business still supports the legislation. "For every small business that's a debtor," said Nelson Litterst, senior manager for legislative affairs, "there's about five or six small businesses that are creditors."

Huddled Masses Of the Wealthy

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THE fortunes being made in Silicon Valley draw much attention, but they are not enough to lift the average incomes in that high-technology center into the top tier of the nation's counties, new financial data show.
Five of the 10 counties with the highest average adjusted gross incomes reported on Federal tax returns are in the New York area. Only San Mateo County, at the northern edge of Silicon Valley, is in the top 1 percent of the 3,140 counties, according to figures for 1995, the most recent available. 
 The poorest counties are no longer concentrated in the South but rather in Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico and South Dakota.

HEADLINE: Capitalism Victorious (Thanks, Everyone)

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
THE Daimler-Chrysler deal is the model for global capitalism, a marriage of champions of free enterprise whose success has been driven by their ability to deliver products that customers around the world want at prices they are willing to pay.
Well, not quite. 
 While no one disputes the technological or marketing savvy of these giant auto makers, their profitability, their staying power -- and, at times of crisis, their very survival -- have depended as much on cozy relations with the state.
"Both Daimler and Chrysler have been masters at getting what they need from government," said Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Hitler, Eisenhower, Adenauer, Carter: all will figure in any honest history of the new DaimlerChrysler, alongside the founders and ahead of many of the chief executives as key characters in the stories of the predecessor companies. And that makes last week's stunning $39 billion deal, the biggest industrial merger ever, an intriguing study of just how "free" free markets really are.
Look back, first, at the early decades of Daimler-Benz. Almost everyone knows that Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz were among the very first to produce commercially feasible cars. What is less well remembered is how closely Daimler-Benz's early fortunes were tied to the German state.
In 1934, Hitler, a car enthusiast with a special affection for Mercedes, commissioned the deeply depressed company to build the world's best racing car. Daimler-Benz satisfied its patron, dominating Grand Prix racing through the late 1930's and literally showing the Nazi flag across Europe.
"The cars were painted with little swastikas," said Bob Casey, the curator for transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.
Daimler-Benz also built the 1,200-horsepower diesel engines that powered the Hindenburg and Graf Zeppelin dirigibles, yet another symbol of German technological superiority. And during World War II, the company manufactured 100,000 of its DB-601 aeronautical engines, the workhorse of the Luftwaffe, prized for both their reliability and their capacity to operate at high altitudes.
Not surprisingly, Daimler-Benz's factories -- the company also made diesel engines for tanks and military trucks -- were reduced to rubble by bombing raids in 1944. But even in defeat, the hand of government lifted the company up. The rapid reconstruction of Germany's flagship industrial corporations became an Allied priority after the fall of the Third Reich. With assured access to capital, Daimler-Benz was churning out trucks and buses in quantity by 1949. And with the mark deliberately undervalued by the postwar financial regime, the company's exports got a jump-start.
"To make the spectacular comeback, they had to have help from the state," said David Lewis, a historian at the University of Michigan's business school.
The fortunes of Chrysler have also turned on government patronage. As a leading armaments producer during World War II -- Chrysler built the Sherman M-4 tanks that went head-to-head with Daimler-powered Tigers -- the company amassed the capital to compete effectively against the far larger General Motors.
And what the hot war facilitated, the cold war sustained: Chrysler's armaments subsidiary, the prime contractor for the XM-1 tank, generated a recession-proof flow of income for a company that otherwise had few cushions against the ups and downs of the auto industry.
Indirect dependence on Washington, of course, segued to outright dependence in 1980, when Chrysler ran out of cash and required Federal credit guarantees to keep its production lines running.
AND while that "bailout" during the Carter Administration has been widely celebrated as a stroke of Government leadership that allowed Chrysler to pull itself up by its bootstraps, the company's continued success has been no less tied to the corridors of Washington power.
In the early 1980's, Lee A. Iacocca, then Chrysler's chief executive, led the political lobbying for barriers against Japanese vehicle imports. The "voluntary" restraints that were negotiated protected the Big Three's core market even as the domestic steel, electronics, machine tool and earth-moving-equipment industries were mercilessly battered by Japan's high-quality goods and the strong dollar.
American consumers, meanwhile, paid extra for the Japanese cars they so dearly wanted -- or could not get the models they wanted at all. (And Chrysler was selling rebadged Mitsubishis imported from Japan.)
"Nobody navigates the regulation maze better than Chrysler," said Lawrence White, an economist at the Stern School of Business of New York University.
CHRYSLER'S skill at playing the Washington game is even more apparent in its exploitation of the corporate fuel-economy standards.
On the one hand, the company successfully beat back efforts to relax the mileage standards for cars during the Bush Administration, when it had a competitive edge over Ford and G.M. in compact cars. On the other hand, as the maker of the Chrysler Town & Country, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, it has benefited even more than its competitors from the less demanding mileage standards applied to truck-like passenger vehicles.
Of course, it isn't just Chrysler and Daimler that are masters of the free enterprise system's dirty dance with the state. France is eager to overlook Iraq's interest in anthrax to sell oilfield equipment. Brazil and Israel sell everything from Uzis to howitzers to Central American generals in mirrored sunglasses. Washington does Boeing's bidding in China, while European governments, wrapped in national pride, provide billions in subsidies to Airbus Industrie, the Continent's principal aircraft maker.
Indeed, Airbus may figure in the Daimler-Chrysler merger. As a 38 percent shareholder in Airbus, Daimler has made no secret of its wish to privatize the consortium, whose other members are government-controlled French, British and Spanish companies.
But that probably will not happen unless Airbus can fend off future efforts by Boeing to contain the Europeans' penetration of the American market. An alliance with a giant American company that has more than 100,000 unionized employees cannot hurt the cause of Airbus in Washington.
None of this reflects badly on Daimler-Benz or Chrysler; to thrive, modern corporations must adapt to the environments in which they do business.
But it does offer another perspective when free markets get credit for triumphing over central planners, and when globe-spanning deals are heralded as victories for the world's shareholders over narrow national interests.
"Big business," Mr. White of New York University said simply, "has always been a creature of big government."

HEADLINE: Into the Island Lair of a Currency-Trading Tiger

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

DATELINE: LYFORD CAY, the Bahamas

 BODY:
JOSEPH C. LEWIS is a private man. He lives regally, but quietly, in a low-slung, beachfront manse that abuts a golf course and a yacht-filled marina in this luxurious, palm-swept enclave. His neighbors include others who value their privacy, and the island's tax-haven status: the actor Sean Connery; the novelist Arthur Hailey; Fahad Al Sabah, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family; the mutual fund legend Sir John Templeton.
Like many of these men, Mr. Lewis's public acts make waves. Last week, he sold a $244 million stake in Christie's International P.L.C., the auction house, to the French businessman Francois Pinault. Mr. Lewis is also the owner of a world-class art collection, which includes a Picasso and a Miro, and owns Isleworth, a Windermere, Fla., country club community that is home to the golfer Tiger Woods, the baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. and the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal. 
 His significance, though, stems from the business that has allowed him to amass a personal fortune of at least $2.5 billion. Mr. Lewis is among the world's most formidable currency traders, having grown rich by winning huge bets that have shaken the British pound and the Mexican peso, among others. The spoils of his trading coups are allowing him to build a new estate here in the Bahamas; local residents say it will cost more than $50 million and be even more secluded than his existing lair.
Yet for all this, Mr. Lewis remains largely unknown, rarely mentioned in the same breath as well-known currency-trading peers like George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr. Even within the rarefied realms of high finance and high-priced art, a sense of mystery accompanies discussions of Mr. Lewis, a situation he is in no hurry to remedy. Until now, he had never granted a newspaper interview.
"I really feel that if one is successful, one of the rewards of your success is the quiet enjoyment of it," said Mr. Lewis, who is 61, during a recent conversation here. "Being on the front page of newspapers doesn't allow that."
Cordial and self-effacing, Mr. Lewis hastened to add that "the mystery to me is why there's anything of particular interest about me."
Of course, there is much of interest about Mr. Lewis.
BEYOND the substantial influence he wields in the art world, his role as a speculator highlights the increasing economic impact of currency trading in the brave new world of computerized, global finance. In the last few years, the rapid-fire movement of capital across international borders has helped fuel sudden, vicious economic meltdowns in such far-flung places as Mexico, Thailand and South Korea and forced the hands of European central bankers, most notably in Britain, in response to speculative attacks.
Little of this was apparent when the world's industrial powers first allowed exchange rates to float in 1971. Even after that, currency trading remained a quiet backwater until about 1985, when central banks around the globe began trying to drive down the dollar's value to stimulate American exports. Traders then began exploiting profitable differences among international currencies, a game that grew more heated as country after country opened its borders to international trade in the next 13 years.
Propped up by lush lines of bank credit, currency speculators can trade billions of dollars while putting up only a fraction of that in their own cash. And the world can only guess what they are doing: Unlike stock trading, which occurs on public exchanges, currency trading is loosely regulated, conducted over private telephone lines and computerized networks operated by bank dealers. Insiders may know of one another's positions, but the public has a more difficult time divining what currency traders are up to until exchange rates start yo-yoing.
As traders pounce on country after country, attacking weak currencies en masse, they have become the favorite bogymen of the elites in developing lands. The leaders of Malaysia, India and Zimbabwe have all recently called for restrictions on currency trading, saying rampant speculation has made it impossible for their countries to get their economies on track. Even Mr. Soros, whose fortune was spun from hefty currency gambits, has spent much of the last year decrying the problems of unregulated markets and free-wheeling speculation.
For their part, traders -- who tend to be a pragmatic and apolitical lot -- say they are merely responding to flawed economic policies reflected in currencies.
Six years ago, for instance, as Europe tried to lay the groundwork for a common currency, traders set a target on the British pound after deeming it overvalued relative to the German mark. Mr. Lewis is said by fellow traders to have made hundreds of millions of dollars speculating against the pound. While he confirms that a succesful wager against the pound netted him one of his biggest windfalls, Mr. Lewis declined to quantify how much he actually made.
But he waved off his critics' assertions that picking on the Bank of England was somehow unfair.
"All it proved was that the markets were right and the politicians were wrong," Mr. Lewis said. "It's part of making a market. It's the free flow of cash around the world."
REGARDLESS of the differences separating currency traders and their critics, there is no question that traders now have as much impact on international politics and economics as any of the world's major central banks -- a case proved most recently by the economic turmoil that has accompanied the currency gyrations in East Asia. And few currency traders wheel and deal with the panache of Mr. Lewis.
"He's a financial speculator and prides himself on it," said John Davitte, an emerging-markets analyst with I.D.E.A., an economics consulting group in London. "He's a Soros type of player who takes big, leveraged positions for his own account."
Mr. Lewis's path to the top of the currency and art markets began modestly. He was born in 1937 in London's gritty, dockside district, the East End, where his father owned a pub. That is where Mr. Lewis went to work shortly after dropping out of school at 15.
By the early 1970's, he had parlayed his father's grubstake into a group of warehouse-size theme restaurants catering to tourists. The restaurants, which bore names like Shakespeare's Tavern and the Beefeater, were decidedly low-brow, offering entertainment that included sword swallowers and knights in armor. They helped unleash a whole dining genre; one Lewis protege, Robert Earl, later helped found the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.
"He's extremely confident, but I don't know of any people he's hurt along the way," allowed Mr. Earl, though he briefly stopped speaking to Mr. Lewis in the early 1980's, after he had begun competing with him. "That's very unusual for someone who has risen to the top."
The restaurants were tremendously lucrative, and their success financed an array of other enterprises in England, including travel agencies and fashion, real estate and foreign exchange businesses. Already a stock market speculator and an avid gambler -- at one point he indulged his passion for horse racing by buying thoroughbreds -- Mr. Lewis used his foreign exchange operations to gain a bird's-eye view of the daily fluctuations in currency rates and the opportunities for profiting from them.
"If you're European, currencies are always a part of your life," Mr. Lewis said. "Not to be aware of what's going on is impossible."
By the late 1970's, Mr. Lewis had a substantial fortune, most of it tied up in his British holding company, Hanover Grand P.L.C. He declines to say how much he was worth at the time, but it was enough to persuade him to become a tax exile, decamping to the Bahamas when he sold Hanover Grand in 1979.
Mr. Lewis's move, which allowed him to forgo huge capital gains and income taxes in Britain, was entirely legal under the British tax laws. In return for gaining a new, tax-free existence in the Bahamas, Mr. Lewis cannot return to Britain for more than three months a year, on average, over any five-year period. He still maintains an estate in England, as well as homes in Argentina and Florida.
It was upon Mr. Lewis's arrival in the Bahamas -- flush with cash, unencumbered by his old businesses, newly wed to his second wife, Jane -- that he began to devote his full attention to currency trading. The timing was impeccable. By the mid-1980's,currency traders were a force to contend with on Wall Street and around the world.
THE strength of currency traders perhaps first became publicly apparent when Andrew J. Krieger helped the Bankers Trust New York Corporation rake in more than $500 million in currency trading profits in 1987. Mr. Krieger's gains derived in part from a speculative attack on the New Zealand kiwi. Forced to spend precious foreign reserves defending the currency's value, New Zealand officials threatened to raise interest rates, which would have forced Mr. Krieger and the bank to eat large losses. Central bank officials did not follow through on the threat, and Mr. Krieger resigned from Bankers Trust shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons.
In 1992, Mr. Soros would gain fame as the man who broke the Bank of England when he reportedly earned $1 billion betting against the pound. One overanimated French official, angered by speculation against the franc around the same time, called for currency traders to be beheaded.
The meteoric rise of some traders has been matched by some equally precipitous falls. Victor Niederhoffer, a protege of Mr. Soros and the author of "The Education of a Speculator" (John Wiley & Sons, 1997), celebrating the joys of trading, made millions of dollars speculating in currencies and other assets before an ill-considered series of wagers last fall -- involving the Thai baht and the United States stock market -- forced him to close his Westport, Conn., firm.
"These guys come and go," said David DeRosa, president of DeRosa Research and Trading in New Canaan, Conn. "They're speculators, and many of them get wiped out and others get fantastically rich."
For his part, Mr. Lewis approached trading methodically, gradually building up a war chest from a computerized trading room at his Bahamian estate. By the early 1990's, currency trading was responsible for the bulk of Mr. Lewis's wealth, which now was measured in the billions of dollars rather than the hundreds of millions.
Mr. Lewis declined to say how much money he had earned from various currency plays. But he said that in addition to winning his own bet against the pound in 1992, his other biggest gain came from speculating against the Mexican peso in early 1995.
Mexico had run up a huge deficit by late 1994, and speculators began betting that the currency, lacking support from the Government, would fall. Indeed, by late December and early January, the peso had been routed, and traders like Mr. Lewis reaped lush profits. The ensuing economic crisis in Mexico led Washington to undertake a $20 billion rescue plan for its neighbor.
THERE were rumors that Mr. Lewis was actively involved in Asian currency markets last fall and winter, during the economic crisis there, but he said the chatter was unfounded. Still, though Mr. Lewis claimed to be poorly informed about Southeast Asian markets, when asked what currency he saw as particularly vulnerable right now, he did not miss a beat: "the Hong Kong dollar."
If Mr. Lewis is correct and the Hong Kong dollar falls this year, it would likely ignite anew the economic troubles in East Asia, prompting other countries in the region to pursue competitive devaluations that would compound the difficulty of paying off external debts.
Mr. Lewis is more optimistic about the prospects of the euro, the currency that will eventually replace the separate currencies of 11 European countries. He sees few opportunities for traders to exploit weaknesses in the new currency.
"The euro will be a strong currency for the foreseeable future," he said last week. "It's necessary to have a central currency that's credible, and you need one currency in Europe, not 11."
Traders say Mr. Lewis is known to put up as much as $1 billion to $1.5 billion of his net worth when he takes a position against a currency, figures that Mr. Lewis declined to confirm or deny.
"He's definitely fairly concentrated when he makes his bets," said a currency trader for a major hedge fund who, like many of his ilk, spoke on condition of anonymity. "The one difficulty everyone has in pinning him down is that he's able to trade with great stealth. So far, he's been a very quiet trader."
Mr. Lewis manages his currency operations under the umbrella of a holding company, Tavistock Group, and has made acquisitions through another vehicle, the English National Investment Company. Earlier this month, he transferred his controlling stake in English National to his 35-year-old son, Charles, and others at the company.
His trading coups have become legend among a small group of traders privy to the identity of the man behind them. These traders have bestowed one of their highest accolades upon Mr. Lewis: a nickname. They refer to him as the Boxer, in recognition of both his heavyweight status in currency markets and the similarity of his name to that of Joe Louis, the boxing legend.
PREMIER commercial and investment banks -- including Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Chase Manhattan Corporation -- have lined up to extend credit to Mr. Lewis, hoping not only to snag fees from him but also to gain insight into his trading practices.
Traders have linked Mr. Lewis to a trading cabal made up of Kerry Packer, the Australian media giant; Sir James Goldsmith, the late corporate raider, and an Irish trio comprised of Dermot Desmond, a property magnate and stockbroker; J. P. McManus, a kingpin of the legal bookmaking business, and John Magnier, a horse breeder. But Mr. Lewis said that he had traded only for his own account.
He acknowledges, though, that Messrs. Desmond, McManus, and Magnier are his friends. And those relationships placed him in an uncomfortable spotlight on one occasion.
In 1991, investigators for the Irish Government began looking into the circumstances surrounding the sale of land to Telecomm Eireann, the state-owned telecommunications concern. The investigation was prompted by concerns that the land -- jointly owned by Mr. Lewis, the three Irishmen and others -- was sold at a vastly inflated price, a result of the group's influence with the administration of Charles Haughey, then the Prime Minister.
None of the men was ever charged with any wrongdoing in the matter, although a report issued in 1993 by John Glackin, a special investigator for the Irish Government, was highly critical of almost all those involved. The report included a series of rancorous letters between Mr. Glackin and Mr. Lewis's lawyer, regarding Mr. Lewis's unwillingness to provide information about his role in the affair. Mr. Lewis declined to comment about his involvement in the land deal.
IN any event, Mr. Lewis clearly had bigger projects in mind than land deals in Ireland. In 1994, he quietly began buying shares of Christie's, the legendary British auction house. His stake in the company was slightly less than the 30 percent threshold that would have triggered a formal takeover offer under British securities laws.
Although Mr. Lewis owns an impressive collection of modern art, including major works by Matisse and Magritte as well as Picasso and Miro, he is a relative newcomer to the art world, having begun building his collection in the early 1990's. Moreover, his resume lacks the social cachet of the British blue bloods who oversee Christie's, and his interest in the legendary auction house stirred an anxious debate within the company about his intentions.
In February, Mr. Lewis and the investment banking firm SBC Warburg Dillon Read sought to take Christie's private, a move that Mr. Lewis said would give the auction house greater flexibility in managing its financial affairs and allow it to take more risks.
Foiled in that effort, he sold his stake last Tuesday to Mr. Pinault, who, like Mr. Lewis, dropped out of school as a teen-ager and made a fortune assembling a hodgepodge of businesses in markets like footwear, luggage, real estate, retailing and wine. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, and Mr. Lewis declined to comment on them, citing confidentiality agreements.
None of this has distracted Mr. Lewis from his main love -- currency trading -- nor has it kept him from buying other companies. He has added to his real estate holdings in Florida and owns one of the most popular rugby teams in Britain. But even with such high-profile investments, Mr. Lewis says he is content to remain in the shadows.
"I really don't enjoy sharing my life with the rest of the world," he said.

Judging the Many Newsletters That Judge Fidelity's Funds

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
ERIC M. KOBREN, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, a newsletter that picks Fidelity funds, boasts about the loyalty of his 75,000 subscribers. Which, of course, is cause for a rival, Donald R. Dion Jr., publisher of the Fidelity Independent Adviser, to snipe, "It used to be 125,000."
Mr. Kobren, for his part, says Jack Bowers, editor of the competing Fidelity Monitor, pinched his original newsletter concept in 1986. Mr. Bowers denies it and says Mr. Kobren used a "fabricated track record" back in 1987. Mr. Kobren denies that. 
 One thing is clear: When it comes to feuding, the Hearsts and the Pulitzers can't teach a thing to these publishers.
There is an avalanche -- a paper one -- of mutual fund newsletters. More than a half-dozen focus on the funds offered by Fidelity Investments, including those that specialize in market timing and sector rotation.
And the competition has become fiercer: Just this January, Phillips Publishing Inc. started another one, The Fidelity Investor. Its editor, James H. Lowell, used to work for Mr. Kobren.
Why so many newsletters? The seemingly endless manager changes at Fidelity have probably helped circulation. And the growth of the 401(k) market has also been a factor.
There is money to be made, too. Subscriptions cost $95 to $177 a year. And most of the newsletter companies also manage portfolios directly, which makes the practice even more lucrative. Mr. Kobren manages $1 billion on the side.
All the newsletters purport to bolster returns for investors who follow their advice. But only two, Monitor and Insight, have records of three years or more. And because the newsletters all build portfolios of different funds with varying amounts of risk, precise, apples-to-apples comparisons with other portfolios are not always possible.
Mark Hulbert, publisher of the Hulbert Financial Digest, which ranks the performance of newsletters, tracked the performance of four of the newsletters in the 12 months ended on March 31. The data show that returns have varied considerably.
What do the different newsletters offer investors?
 
FIDELITY INSIGHT Started in 1985, Mr. Kobren's newsletter, based in Wellesley Hills, Mass. is the granddaddy of the bunch (though Mr. Bowers says it was he who had the idea of a Fidelity newsletter earlier). With a circulation of 75,000, it is also the largest.
Based on one-year returns, Insight is the clear winner when it comes to picking a conservative portfolio: its Income and Preservation portfolio has returned 24.5 percent, more than the similar portfolios of other newsletters. But Mr. Kobren includes stock funds in his income portfolio, while most of the others stick to bond funds.
And its Growth portfolio, with a 12-month return of 30.7 percent, lagged behind those of its rivals, which is not surprising given that Insight generally takes a more conservative approach to fund-picking.
Mr. Kobren says investors benefit from his staff's research and their access to Fidelity and its managers; many interviews with those managers can be found in the newsletter.
He also sends out "postcard alerts" to share breaking news like the announcement of a new fund.
 
FIDELITY MONITOR Started in 1986, Mr. Bowers's missive is filled with news and trend articles, but few features. Dominating the publication, which is based in Rocklin, Calif., are reviews of its model portfolios and new recommendations: Mr. Bowers says such reports have the most interest for readers.
When it comes to performance, Monitor is neither tearing up the road nor lagging terribly. Relative to the newsletter's peers, its worst-performing portfolio is Growth and Income, which returned 25.4 percent over 12 months. It suffered because of a bond fund position of nearly 50 percent, intended to protect investors from a possible bear market.
The newsletter offers specific portfolios for investors who hold Fidelity variable annuities or 401(k)'s. There is also a recommended portfolio for those who use Fidelity's often-volatile sector funds.
"I pride myself in offering a wider range of risks," Mr. Bowers said.
Fidelity Monitor does not send postcards, but its telephone hot line is free and updated weekly. The newsletter has 14,000 subscribers, a simple layout and a drab typeface.
Investors seeking to beat the Wilshire 5000 index, which returned 47.6 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, could have done so by using the newsletter's Aggressive portfolio, which returned 49.9 percent. That portfolio included the Select Brokerage fund, which returned 85 percent.
 
FIDELITY FORECASTER This data-driven newsletter provides extensive historical performance figures -- probably more than many investors want. That format also means a busy design, and the writing is serviceable at best.
On the other hand, if you like crunching numbers, Forecaster is your hot book. It tracks funds based on price volatility, risk-adjusted returns and how they perform in rising and falling markets.
"We study the Fidelity funds to put together well-balanced portfolios that investors can feel comfortable owning," said George S. Shirk, managing editor of the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield Beach Fla., which publishes Forecaster.
As for performance, the newsletter recently has had a stratospheric high and a lowly low. Its Income portfolio, which had big positions in cash and the Short-Term Bond fund, returned just 11.7 percent for the 12 months ended on March 31, the worst of the portfolios tracked. Its Aggressive portfolio, led by Select Brokerage, beat all comers, with a sizzling 55.6 percent return.
 
FIDELITY INDEPENDENT ADVISER This slim, eight-page newsletter can have a clunky writing style, but its 25,000 subscribers probably aren't too worried. Its average performance has been the best of the lot. The Growth portfolio, which included the hot Low-Priced Stock fund, was the best in its category, returning 43 percent for the 12 months ended March 31. Likewise, its Growth and Income portfolio outperformed its rivals', gaining 44.3 percent. That was in large part because it included the Growth and Income and Convertible Securities funds.
The Aggressive portfolio, however, lagged behind other newsletters', returning just 36 percent -- a result of the portfolio's conservative holdings, including Select Food and Agriculture and Select Chemicals.
Mr. Dion, the editor, credits the newsletter's staff and its "extensive research of Fidelity holdings" for the superior returns.
"There continues to be a need as Fidelity adds funds, almost on a monthly basis now, for people to have some help selecting what's appropriate for their investment objective," he said.
 
FIDELITY INVESTOR Although this newcomer does not have a 12-month track record, it is loaded with personality -- and it offers a slightly cynical tone.
The newsletter has a clean, attractive layout and includes an index that measures the monthly performance of the entire Fidelity fund group.
It also publishes a helpful asset-allocation breakdown that shows the percentage of assets each fund has in stocks, bond, cash and foreign holdings. The April issue rates the tax efficiency of Fidelity funds.
Mr. Lowell says Fidelity's 12 million shareholders and its breadth of offerings can support another newsletter. "What I saw that investors could use was somebody who understood Fidelity inside and out," he said.

Bullish on Buybacks? Take a Second Look

BYLINE: By INGRID EISENSTADTER 

 BODY:
WHEN a publicly traded company says it will buy back some of its stock, the reaction on the Street is almost always positive. Even if analysts were not enthusiastic about the company before the announcement, many investors cast aside caution and dive in, on the theory that no one knows better than the company's management whether a stock is a bargain and a good investment. Are they right?
One thing is clear: The usual positive reaction from investors has helped the number of buybacks surge in recent years. In the first four months of 1998, publicly traded companies announced plans to repurchase more than $53 billion of their own shares on the open market or through share-repurchase plans offered to shareholders. In April alone, almost 100 companies announced buyback programs amounting to $19.5 billion, continuing a strong trend that began in 1994 and bringing the number of announcements to nearly 8,000 since the decade began. 
 But investors who pounce on buyback announcements indiscriminately may find themselves chasing some chimeras. According to the Securities Data Company, as many as two-thirds of companies that announce intentions to repurchase shares fail to see their plans through to completion, and some never buy back any shares. Companies are often vague in their plans: they may announce a buyback of up to $2 billion in stock, only to buy just $1 billion, or nothing.
And some stocks fare poorly even though the company is buying. Reebok repurchased 24 million shares with borrowed money in 1996, when its stock was trading in the $36 range; it now fetches only $30.0625.
That doesn't mean a careful investor cannot profit from a strategy centered on buybacks. David Fried, who edits the Buyback Letter, a two-year-old newsletter in Malibu, Calif., publishes a model portfolio of buyback stocks that has outperformed 447 of the 460 newsletter model portfolios tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest, an independent newsletter tracking service. Mr. Fried's buyback portfolio gained 57.8 percent from January 1997 through March 1998, well ahead of the 48.5 percent gain of the Wilshire 5000 index, Hulbert's data show.
The main attraction of buybacks comes when the programs retire shares, reducing the number outstanding and leaving the company's earnings pie to be divided into fewer, bigger slices. Programs whose purpose is to gather shares for use in employee incentive and stock purchase plans are thus much less favorable for shareholders than other buybacks, because the shares bought aren't retired. Company announcements do not always make clear whether shares will be retired, so investors may want to call the company's investor relations office before buying.
A share-repurchase program can provide useful support to a stock during a market downturn. I.B.M. is widely given credit for unfurling a safety net under the entire market when stocks plunged last fall. After its stock dropped from $98 to $90 on Oct. 27, I.B.M. announced the next morning that it would proceed with its previously announced plans to buy back up to $3.5 billion of its shares; that encouraged other investors to step in and buy.
As companies have shed unwanted holdings, laid off employees and increased productivity while the economy has remained strong, many have piled up large troves of cash. Soaring markets, meanwhile, have made stock, not cash, the currency of choice in making acquisitions. So managers can easily conclude that a buyback is the best way to use cash not needed for internal growth.
Richard Peterson of Securities Data, however, said high equity prices might now be slowing the trend somewhat. In the first quarter of 1998, repurchase announcements slipped to $43 billion from $55 billion in the first quarter of 1997.
But that is still a rapid pace compared with 1996 and before. In the last two weeks, at least 60 companies have said they would begin or extend buyback plans, among them Bristol-Myers Squibb (a $2 billion extension) and I.B.M. (a $3.5 billion extension), according to the Online Investor in Redwood, Calif. Mr. Fried of the Buyback Letter said buyback plans were " here to stay for companies that believe in their own bright future."
Whether they are an urgently flashing "buy" signal is another matter. The numbers in the announcement can sound big, but repurchase plans may take years to complete, and companies are under no obligation to make good on them.
One reason for withdrawing a buyback is an impending merger. Recent repurchases of shares can imperil a deal's eligibility for the coveted "pooling of interests" accounting treatment, under which the exchange of shares to complete the deal is not taxable. In order to merge that way with Daimler-Benz, Chrysler has halted its buyback program, and may partly reverse it by issuing new shares. J. C. Penney, Gillette and Nationsbank have also halted buybacks for recent mergers.
But companies can scrub buybacks for other reasons, too, and need not state them publicly.
And there is little that shareholders or regulators can do if management reneges on its plans. For legal action by shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission to succeed, "it would be necessary to prove the company had absolutely no intention to buy back its shares, or that the buyback didn't fall through for legitimate reasons," said Duncan King, a spokesman for the S.E.C. The commission has never taken disciplinary action against a company that announced a buyback but failed to make good, Mr. King said.
The S.E.C. does restrict when a company can buy its own shares, to prevent price manipulation. A company may not make the first trade of the day or trade in the final half hour, may not buy on an uptick (when the most recent price change has been upward) and must limit any one day's repurchases to 25 percent of the average daily volume for the previous four weeks.
NOT everyone on Wall Street is enthusiastic about buybacks, preferring to see a company use its cash to make acquisitions or to share its wealth with stockholders by issuing dividends. But Yakov Amihud, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, pointed out that money returned to investors through dividends becomes taxable as ordinary income, while money returned through stock buybacks would largely escape tax. Only the seller's profit is taxable, and then only at the lower rates for capital gains. He said this tax advantage would continue to encourage the buyback trend.
And buybacks and other uses of corporate cash are not mutually exclusive, Mr. Fried said: "It's not an either-or situation. Buying back has not stopped General Electric from acquiring assets all over the globe, and Wal-Mart continues to expand its business while increasing its dividend and buying back shares, too.
"I love the people who don't like buyback announcements," Mr. Fried said, "because as long as they're out there saying that, they won't do what I'm doing."

Rolling Some Big Dice In the Euro Casino

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THREE decades ago, the French writer Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber electrified Europe with his book "The American Challenge," warning of the dangers of the "economic invasion of Europe by the United States." The world, he predicted, might soon be dominated by three great industrial powers: America, Russia and American industry in Europe.
Things didn't quite sort out that way. By the late 1980's, the Europeans, still desperate for global reach, were toying with huge "strategic alliances," most notably between Daimler-Benz of Germany and Mitsubishi of Japan, prompting plenty of snide commentary about the reunification of the Axis powers. It turned out to be the wrong axis. 
 Now they're trying again. The announcement last week of Daimler's $39 billion takeover of the Chrysler Corporation -- the largest industrial merger in history -- could prove to be far more than the megamerger that puts the new DaimlerChrysler in direct contention with General Motors, Ford and Toyota. It is an integral part of Europe's huge double-or-nothing bet on the European Monetary Union and the new currency it is spawning, the euro. At a moment when Japan's economic paralysis is marginalizing its role on the world stage, and when Americans feel economically invulnerable, the Europeans are thinking big.
 
They Try Harder
The subtext of monetary union is political: to bind together a continent whose countries have a long history of warring with one another. But the biggest benefits are economic. If the euro becomes the world's No. 2 currency -- a dubious proposition a year ago but one that seems a near certainty today -- it could help Europe harness its financial and industrial power to give it the kind of political clout it hasn't enjoyed for a century.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, that meant sustaining a global (and expensive and unruly) colonial empire. In the late 20th century, when political power often arises from institutions that have little to do with governments, it means doing deals like DaimlerChrysler.
"This is a bet about a coming shift in global power," said Kenneth Courtis, chief strategist for Deutsche Bank Asia Capital Markets. "The Japanese are in retreat. Europe has an opportunity, and confidence. Daimler is building on that, putting together a company that is every bit as powerful as the G.M.'s and Toyotas of the world."
At every level this could all easily fall apart. The Europeans may be brimming with confidence, but Germany and France marked the countdown to monetary union last weekend by spitting at each other over whether a Dutchman or a Frenchman should be the first head of the new European Central Bank. That is a battle for the soul of the new Europe, and it could be a prelude to far uglier conflicts tinged with nationalist sniping. If the battles over sovereignty can be overcome, though, the realities of global competition might unite Europeans in a way politicians never could.
"Henry Kissinger used to say, 'If I want to call Europe, whom do I call?' " Klaus Friedrich, the chief economist of Dresdner Bank, told an economic conference here last week. "Well, here's the number," he said, giving out the digits to ring up the headquarters of the European Central Bank.
Even if the countries get their act together, though, there is no assurance that their companies will. The corporate styles of Daimler and Chrysler, for example, have about as much in common as a $15,000 pickup and a $135,000 Mercedes CL600 coupe. But no one doubts who is in control. It will be Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chairman of Daimler, whose own predecessor describes him as a man of "ruthless brutality" when it comes to business decisions. Mr. Schrempp is about to meet the United Automobile Workers, though the union says it is unconcerned about layoffs, because there is virtually no overlap in the companies' products.
This deal, of course, might have come together even in the absence of the monetary union. Daimler has been on a roll ever since it began shedding a sprawling but unprofitable set of new businesses it entered in the 1980's, getting rid of tens of thousands of workers along the way. The fact is that Europe isn't big enough for Daimler anymore. The company's growth depends on becoming a global automotive giant, a feat only G.M., Ford and Toyota have truly achieved. Daimler's decision several years ago to build its new sport utility vehicles in Alabama marked a huge breakthrough for a European company -- a recognition, two decades after the Japanese paved the way, that American workers could build a German-quality car as skillfully as Germans.
 
Global Partners
But the merger takes this strategy to a level most European companies have only begun to think about. Combined, Daimler and Chrysler boast a remarkable range of cars and trucks -- from compacts to Jeeps to the ultimate in luxury sedans -- and a distribution network that goes far beyond America and Europe. The only thing missing from the puzzle is a Japanese partner, and already there is speculation that struggling Mitsubishi Motors (which has manufactured a Chrysler car for years in Japan) or even an engineering dynamo like Honda might get drawn into the new empire.
That's the logic for the merger. What the monetary union adds to the mix is some high-octane fuel -- in ways that Americans are just beginning to appreciate. For the most competitive companies in Europe, monetary union makes it cheaper to do business. Gone are many of the annoying transaction costs, like constant dealings in fluctuating exchange rates that affect the cost of parts and labor, or the expense of keeping separate teams of accountants in each country.
If the experiment in monetary union works, though, the real advantage is political. "Over time, this is going to force Europe to make the kinds of structural changes that the politicians have resisted for so long," a senior American official said. "That's a nice way of saying that they are going to have to downsize and get competitive, because there will be no other safety valves."
 
New Restraints
For example, a country whose exports are falling off and whose unemployment rate is soaring will no longer have the luxury of devaluing its currency to make its goods cheaper abroad. After all, if you no longer have a currency of your own, you can no longer manipulate its value.
Similarly, individual countries will not be able to lower interest rates to spur companies to build new factories. That authority is being surrendered to the European Central Bank. Government spending programs to jolt national economies with big public works projects will be constrained, because they could throw the euro out of kilter. In short, the politicians are slipping into a straitjacket -- and when politicians have less power, markets have more.
The risk, of course, is that the backlash from voters could be horrific. But under the treaty that set all this up, there is no turning back. This is the Roach Motel of international economic experiments: countries check in, but they can't check out.
What does this mean for America? The European companies that have the vision and muscle will build their empires around the world, if they can get beyond a century of nationalistic thinking. Daimler made that leap years ago, but there may be only a dozen or so other European companies big enough to follow its lead.
If so, it will be a while before "The European Challenge" becomes a best seller in American bookstores.
 
From Bailout To Yawner
 IT was 19 years ago that Congress bailed out the Chrysler Corporation, back when $1.5 billion sounded like a lot of money to keep an American icon afloat. But when the news came last week that the company America saved was now becoming German, Congress's reaction was, well, a yawn.
Depending on how one thinks about the bailout, that may or may not make sense. The primary motivation in 1979, in the words of then-Vice President Walter F. Mondale, was to "provide security for thousands and thousands of jobs." Measured that way, the bailout was a huge success. The United Automobile Workers gave up large raises, and the company came back from the dead, churning out innovative new vehicles and paying back the Government early.
Of course, when Congress saved the workers it also saved Chrysler shareholders, who stand to profit handsomely from the Daimler deal.
No one on Wall Street was overheard last week suggesting that their winnings should be shared with Washington, but the Treasury will get a good slice of the deal through capital gains taxes.
There were other reasons to save Chrysler. With the Japanese making inroads into the American market, the loss of one of the Big Three seemed a threat to American economic security. And with the cold war still raging, conservatives were sold on the deal because Chrysler produced tanks and other defense equipment for the Pentagon.
Those businesses have since been sold. But Chrysler is about to get a piece of that business again. Daimler is one of Europe's biggest aerospace and defense contractors, a partner in two major consortiums, Airbus Industrie and Eurofighter. Both are major competitors with American industry. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: The World: Foreign Entanglements;
Aid Dresses Up in a Uniform

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
CONGRESS is wrestling with the future of three great international institutions: NATO, the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. One is wildly popular. The other two, to put it mildly, aren't.
Which is a little strange because each in its own way has the same overriding goal in the 1990's: to assure international stability. 
 But in the American psyche, it seems, it isn't always the goals that count. It's always easier to sell items identified with defending the ramparts of freedom than to sell those perceived as sacrificing American money or sovereignty.
The Senate voted earlier this month, 80 to 19, to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Proponents argued that enlargement of this military outfit under American command would nurture three emerging democracies and promote political and economic stability in Europe.
By contrast, the Administration's request for $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund -- to replenish the Fund's treasury to help insure future financial stability worldwide -- is bottled up in the House, largely because many Republicans view the organization more as the problem than as the solution in helping to safeguard fiscal order.
 
Bad Debts
And nearly $1 billion in back dues the United States owes the United Nations hangs in jeopardy because in the House, where there has long been deep hostility to the United Nations, Republicans have attached an anti-abortion provision to the payments. President Clinton says the rider would force him to veto the entire bill.
Does the successful NATO experience on Capitol Hill offer any lessons for supporters of the I.M.F. and United Nations? Only pessimistic ones, it seems.
There is, first of all, a long American tradition of supporting causes with a military rationale, no matter how far-fetched. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sold Congress and the public on a new national interstate highway system, not as a way to connect the country in a new transportation grid or spur the growth of suburbs and the auto industry -- all of which it accomplished. No, the highway system was sold as a means to evacuate cities and move military equipment in case of nuclear war -- something Eisenhower and his successors avoided in other ways, including adept use of the United Nations, the I.M.F. and, of course, NATO.
NATO has enjoyed strong bipartisan backing on Capitol Hill since the alliance was founded in 1949 as a bulwark against Communism. That made NATO easy to understand. The organization was relatively small -- 16 members now -- and it had a clear focus. No such luck for the 182-member monetary fund and 185-member United Nations, whose missions and mandate often are as complex as their diverse membership.
NATO meant a very large United States foot in Europe. A real general -- a United States Army four-star officer -- runs the show, not a secretary-general, as the United Nations has. Although all three organizations operate by consensus, and although the United States is clearly the most influential member of all three, there is a perception that the United States calls the shots at NATO in a way it does nowhere else. In the United Nations Security Council, for example, there is still a worry that China or Russia will veto an American plan even though the idea of an automatic Russian veto all but ended with the cold war.
And, of course, Americans like winners. NATO won the big one: the cold war. And so far it's maintained a fragile peace in its first post-cold-war test: Bosnia. But had NATO's operation in Bosnia gone sour, Administration officials say, the debate over expanding NATO would have been much more contentious. "There's a strong Congressional and public preference for things that work," said Jeremy D. Rosner, the State Department official who oversaw the Administration's efforts on expanding NATO.
NATO, in the American mind and in reality, is connected to American-led purposes and success in a straightforward way, visible in the military chain of command. The I.M.F., on the other hand, has a more subtle relationship to American goals. It was set up with the thought that international prosperity would help achieve the broadest of long-range American ideals -- democracy and peace. The problem is that it works by offering diffuse economic benefits to prop up or strengthen the economies of faraway countries that many Americans view as economic competitors.
"Congress has never understood precisely how the I.M.F. works, what its principles are or to what degree the United States has control of the process," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana.
The United Nations draws even more hostility, especially from Congressional Republicans who view it as a bloated, ineffective bureaucracy forever linked with ill-fated forays into peacekeeping.
Americans are not "beating down the doors for the United States to pay for its fair share at the U.N.," Mr. Lugar said. "There's even grudging toleration of it."
 
Hedging and Hoping
In the debate over expanding NATO, proponents argued that enlargement would provide a hedge against a resurgent Russia. But there is no imminent security threat to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The more compelling argument was one of encouraging economic and political stability.
In fact, the real interest of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is fully integrating their economies into Western Europe. But the three nations quickly realized that entry into NATO would be a lot easier than pushing their way into the European Union.
"If you give the Czech Republic the immediate choice, E.U. or NATO, my guess is they'd say, E.U.," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat and ardent supporter of NATO expansion. "They want to be part of the West. But none of them feel threatened. They view NATO membership as their ticket to economic growth and economic integration."
NATO 's original charter envisioned a military alliance that would provide the political stability for economic revival to take place in postwar Europe. This fit an American view that survives today: that military security, economic stability and diplomatic calm intertwine to promote the larger ideal of peace-loving democracy.
But if the I.M.F. and the United Nations have roles to play in that vision as well, it has been hard to tell in the recent debate. So the ultimate lesson may be that there is no formula for winning Congress's support for the institutions that undergird international stability.
"We're at a very malleable moment in the history of American foreign policy," said Mr. Rosner, "where coalitions change issue by issue, and outcomes are rarely predetermined."

HEADLINE: Rock Hall Journal;
Town's Revival Is Feared As a Peril to Its Charm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ROCK HALL, Md., May 6

 BODY:
It started with a sunset four years ago.
"A gorgeous sunset," said Arlene Douglas. 
 After breaking his arm, her husband, Tom Sabol, a real estate lawyer in Philadelphia, could no longer work on the old boat he just bought. So they spent a Sunday afternoon in August driving around Maryland's Eastern Shore. Somehow, Ms. Douglas said, they ended up in Rock Hall, a 290-year-old town of 1,600 that has sent watermen into Chesapeake Bay for generations.
Driving past the town's small public beach, the couple stopped to watch the sun disappear over the bay and, as Mr. Sabol recalled, "we fell in love with the place."
Then they started buying it.
First, it was "a shack" across from the beach that they made a weekend hideaway. Next they turned a long-dormant general store -- "Frank Kline's: The Big Store With the Little Prices" -- into the America's Cup Cafe, a coffee shop, which grew to include a bookstore, which grew to include a restaurant, which sells Miss Virginia's crab cakes, reputed to be the best on the bay.
Then Mr. Sabol began scouting around Kent County for old, unused wooden buildings, which he transported to a lot adjacent to the cafe. Spruced up, the structures provide exhibit space for artists like Bob Powitz, who works with driftwood, and Jane Hackett, who paints.
Next to the cafe, the couple helped turn an old grocery into a 146-seat theater that features live concerts from February through October.
And all along the 200 yards of Main Street between Rock Hall's two traffic lights are other signs that the commercial center is popping back to life -- quaint new shops, refurbished restaurants and a growing artists' colony -- reminding old timers like James Culley, a 78-year-old waterman, of when a beer on Main Street cost a dime.
It is all dazzling to Ms. Douglas. "It's just a beautiful place to drive around, with the marshlands, the wetlands and the bay," she said.
Rock Hall is beautiful, all right, enough so that on most summer weekends the head count more than doubles with increasing numbers of tourists and pleasure boaters from Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and southern New Jersey.
And that is beginning to worry some of the town's residents.
Rock Hall's rejuvenation has come at a time when the bay's fishing industry is in slow decline because of state-mandated limits, pollution and a diminishing supply of fish. But it has also brought about rising real estate prices, crowded sidewalks and more traffic, prompting some people to wonder whether economic development might cost Rock Hall part of its charm, much in the way that places like New Hope, Pa., and Carmel, Calif., were discovered by outsiders, then overwhelmed.
"You should see all the chicken-neckers down here," said Jennifer LaPore, 18, a cook at the Rock Hall Snack Bar, using a colloquial expression for out-of-towners. (Visitors use chicken necks for bait; locals prefer eels.) "They spend money and think they own the place."
"And they can be rude," said her friend Tammy Hawkins, 19.
Returning from the bay on his 60-year-old boat, Go Girl, with bushels of blue crabs, Mr. Culley said even local watermen were feeling the pinch of warm-weather visitors, many of whom moor their boats in the same marinas that watermen use and take them into the same areas where watermen are working.
"It's a little bit too many out there for me," Mr. Culley said. "Used to be a pretty quiet town. Now it's like everywhere else."
Al Cornelius, 57, is a fourth-generation waterman who was born in Rock Hall and steered his two sons away from continuing the family tradition. Both are local house painters, and he is just as happy. "It has really changed in the last seven or eight years with more city people moving in," Mr. Cornelius said. "You can't stop progress, but I liked it the way it was years ago, when you knew everybody by name, every family."
Ronald H. Fithian, the town manager, sees no cause for alarm just yet. With Rock Hall's protected harbors long known to watermen and boaters, virtually all the local marinas are full, he said. And few lots in town are available for improvement. "We're almost to the point where everything that could be developed has been developed," Mr. Fithian said.
That is not necessarily the case just beyond the town's northern limits on an undeveloped tract across Swan Creek, where a developer has proposed building a golf course, conference center and vacation villas.
The developer, Tim Wyman, who is president of the B.A. Charters Corporation, said the project would create the kind of jobs that attract young people to Kent County, the least populated of all Maryland counties since 1960. It would also, he said, provide more permanent stability to an economy that, until the recent boom in tourism, relied mostly on fishing and agriculture.
But even recognizing that some longtime residents might object to the changes along Main Street that she and her husband have initiated, Ms. Douglas wondered, "How much do we really need?"
"More business doesn't mean the quality of life is improved," she said. "If I can go to the grocery store or gas station and say, 'Oh, I forgot my wallet,' and the guy says, 'So pay me tomorrow,' that's where I want to live. That's how it is here now, and I would hope that doesn't change."

 BODY:

DaimlerChrysler A.G., A Global Challenger
Creating a formidable global company through the biggest industrial takeover ever, Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany agreed to acquire Chrysler, Detroit's No. 3 auto maker, for stock worth $39 billion. The merged company would have a market value of $92 billion and a vehicle lineup ranging from the little Plymouth Neon to the luxurious Mercedes-Benz S-Class, with Jeeps, mini-vans, pickups and less-expensive Mercedes sedans in between. "Today, we are creating the world's leading automotive company for the 21st century," said Jurgen E. Schrempp, Daimler's chairman. Another German auto maker, Volkswagen, one-upped BMW, persuading Vickers P.L.C. of Britain to accept its $710 million bid for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
 
THE ECONOMY
Racking Up Sales
The auto industry's sales showed unexpected strength in April, rising 6.3 percent over April 1997 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.5 million. Heavy mortgage refinancings have given buyers extra money to spend and hefty rebates have drawn them to showrooms. Other economic reports also showed continuing strength, with the unemployment rate falling to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April from 4.7 percent in March. Still, the Federal Reserve found inflation benign as economic growth continued in March and April. Factory orders rose a moderate 0.3 percent in March, while the Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose 0.2 percent. Retail sales rose 10.2 percent in April, the best monthly sales gains in four years. But worker productivity grew in the first quarter at the slowest pace in more than a year, rising at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent.
 
MARKETS
Nervous, Then Buoyant
With investors fearful that the Fed might push up interest rates, stock prices, buoyed just weeks ago by big bank mergers, were battered for the better part of the week. But Friday's strong jobs report erased the gloom, and market indexes resumed their winning ways. One of the most chaotic bouts of trading in memory came with Entremed, which may or may not find a cure for cancer. Investors bid its stock up $39.75, to $51.81, in chaotic trading on Monday, but by the end of the week it was down to $33.25. The Dow industrials ended the week down 91.92 points at 9,055.15, and the yield on the long bond rose to 5.97 percent.
 
THE BUDGET
A Growing Surplus
The nation's fiscal condition is improving at a startling pace. Tax collections surged in late April, with much of the money apparently coming from capital gains chalked up in last year's strong stock market. The Congressional Budget Office now sees a $43 billion to $63 billion surplus this year. After years of trying to reduce the deficit, Washington is now deeply divided over what to do with the surplus -- cut taxes, save Social Security or pay for other programs. Saying it could reduce borrowing, the Treasury will eliminate the three-year note.
 
PEOPLE
A Survivor's Victory
Estelle Sapir, 72, of Far Rockaway, Queens, whose health is failing, emerged as a rare victor in Holocaust survivors' battle with Swiss Banks. Credit Suisse, which her father had entrusted with his money before perishing in the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, finally settled her claim for an estimated $500,000. For decades, the bank had demanded a death certificate -- something the Nazis had failed to provide. . . . Francois Pinault, a wealthy French investor, has bought 29.1 percent of Christie's, the London auction house. . . . Sidney Taurel, Eli Lilly's president and an expert in drug marketing, will become chief executive on July 1 and chairman on Dec. 31, succeeding Randall L. Tobias, who has decided to retire.
 
TECHNOLOGY
Fractious Growth
Microsoft, caught in a web of antitrust battles that threaten to delay the scheduled June introduction of its Windows 98 operating system, persuaded a number of computer industry leaders to back its case for no delay. . . . Compaq Computer will cut 15,000 jobs at Digital Equipment, or 28 percent of Digital's work force, after the companies complete their merger, an executive disclosed. . . . Whatever the industry's internal problems, users keep increasing. With new subscribers growing, America Online reported profits that sharply ecceeded analysts' expectations. . . . Steve Jobs, the interim chief executive who is nursing Apple Computer back to health, showed a new version of the company's G-3 computer with a shark on its screen in Cupertino, Calif, on Wednesday.
 
WALL STREET
Goodbye, Arbitration?
A proposed settlement of a discrimination suit filed by women brokers against Merrill Lynch could lead to the end of Wall Street's system for dealing with employee cases through mandatory arbitration, allowing cases to go into open court . . . Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced that Nationsbank, one of the country's largest financial institutions, had agreed to pay almost $7 million to settle charges that it misled customers who bought two bond funds in 1993-94. The announcement came as bankers and brokers lobbied for a sweeping overhaul of the laws separating their institutions. So far, Congress has not voted on the issue.
 
CHOCOLATE
A Bitter Forecast
Gold in short supply? Silver will do. Fine wines scarce? Plonk will do. But a shortage of chocolate? What's the world to do? With demand exceeding production of cocoa beans, the world's reserves could run out within 5 to 10 years. Consequently, an unusual alliance of manufacturers and environmental groups has formed to tackle the problem. Representatives of the Mars, Cadbury, Nestle and Hershey chocolate companies met with conservation groups last month at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama to discuss how to save farms under siege worldwide from insects and from fungal and viral diseases.
 
I.R.S.
Senate Votes for Overhaul
After hearing taxpayers' horror stories and complaints about the tax code's ever-increasing complexity, the Senate voted 97 to 0 to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service. Among other changes intended to make the I.R.S. more friendly to citizens, the bill would create an independent board to oversee the agency and establish an independent taxpayer advocate. To assure that collections are not unduly hampered, the White House said it would press for some changes when a joint committee reconciles the bill and a narrower version passed last year by the House. . . . Shirley Barron, who accused the I.R.S. in a $1 million lawsuit of driving her husband to suicide, said that the agency had agreed to a settlement that would eliminate her tax debt of more than $400,000 and let her keep her New Hampshire home.

HEADLINE: Smashing Windows 98

 BODY:
The accelerating confrontation between Microsoft and the Justice Department seems likely to become one of the most bitter antitrust cases ever and perhaps one of the most important. The department may try to delay the debut of Windows 98, the next generation of Microsoft's operating system, while it looks for any predatory practices by Microsoft. The department is clearly right to try to promote competition in a fast-changing business. The question is whether it is being unfair to Microsoft, stifling innovation or demanding "remedies" that create more problems than they solve.
In the world of computers, the battle over Microsoft has been likened to the fight over Standard Oil a century ago. The comparison is not that farfetched. John D. Rockefeller controlled 90 percent of American oil production, whereas Bill Gates controls 90 percent of the operating systems that are the lifeblood of the new American economy. The terms of the disputes may be highly technical, but the underlying drama is that of a morality play. Microsoft sees itself as the heroic pioneer being punished for success. The company's critics view it as an evil empire bent on killing its rivals. How the public judges the case will depend on the evidence of predatory conduct behind the scenes brought by the Justice Department. 
 The immediate point of contention is the insistence by Microsoft that it has total freedom to add its own features to Windows 98, even if that puts rival software manufacturers at a disadvantage. The Justice Department disagrees, siding with competitors who charge that Microsoft uses its leverage as a monopoly to shut out rival software that consumers may prefer. The makers of Netscape, the most popular browser, charge specifically that Microsoft has browbeat Internet companies not to do business with them. Microsoft vehemently denies the accusation and charges that any step to block the introduction of Windows 98 will wreak havoc throughout the industry.
How the browser wars are resolved will have enormous ramifications. Microsoft is extending its reach into all kinds of Internet commerce, from banking to selling cars and real estate to providing news and entertainment information. All companies, indeed all consumers, have an interest in preventing Microsoft from using its Windows monopoly to muscle rivals aside and to put its own products up on the initial screen in such a way as to block or slow access to other options that consumers want.
The question facing the Justice Department is how such broad principles of equity are implemented. Microsoft is on firm ground when it warns that the Government should not get into the business of imposing elaborate rules on the writing of software. But Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein is right to guide Justice's antitrust division toward an engaged role to promote competition and protect the interests of consumers. With nearly 40 percent of American households due to be linked to the Internet by 2001, the Justice Department's action in the next few weeks could shape the American economy in much the way it did with the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911.
Because of the pace of technological change, any approach from the Government runs the risk of becoming obsolete almost as soon as it is adopted. But the issue taken on by the Justice Department is not a matter of controlling Microsoft simply as a show of authority. It is about the Government acting to make room for some future Bill Gates to enter the market even as it protects the legitimate interests of the Bill Gates who has made the entire existing system work so well.

HEADLINE: To Prevent a Wider War in Kosovo

 BODY:
The long-simmering tensions in Serbia's province of Kosovo turned violent in recent weeks and threaten to ignite a wider war in the Balkans. Only a concerted diplomatic effort by the United States can keep the conflict from escalating. Though he has been attentive to the problem, President Clinton must do more to take the lead with European nations to insure that Kosovo is not left adrift.
Since Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989, Kosovo's overwhelmingly Albanian population has engaged in mostly peaceful resistance. It brought them nothing but more repression. In recent months, an Albanian guerrilla army has emerged, targeting mainly Serb policemen. The guerrilla campaign has angered Serbs and given Mr. Milosevic an excuse to bomb villages and carry out indiscriminate attacks. He appears to be trying to push the 1.8 million Albanians out of Kosovo entirely. 
 A war in Kosovo, massacres of Albanians or a rush of refugees into Albania and Macedonia could bring those two neighboring countries into the conflict. It might also destabilize the fragile peace in Bosnia and flood Turkey with refugees. Even Turkey and Greece, ancient enemies, might be tempted to intervene to enhance their influence in the Balkans, especially if Macedonia is in chaos.
International responsibility for dealing with the Kosovo crisis rests primarily with the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia. Acting together as the Contact Group, they are trying to force Mr. Milosevic to accept internationally supervised negotiations with the Albanians. But the group has proved ineffectual because its powers are limited and some members, notably Russia, oppose strong pressure against Serbia. The group has frozen Serbia's assets abroad and this weekend imposed a ban on new foreign investment in Serbia. The sanctions, however, are impossible to enforce among countries outside the Contact Group and difficult even inside it, given Russia's views.
When President Clinton meets Boris Yeltsin later this week at the annual economic summit meeting, he should seek more Russian cooperation in pressuring Serbia. He sent a high-level delegation to Belgrade this weekend to say that Serbia will remain isolated if fighting continues. But there is little indication that Mr. Milosevic cares.
The White House has not ruled out the use of force to prevent Serbian aggression in Kosovo, but other, intermediate steps should be used before Mr. Clinton considers military action. NATO at this stage can play an important role by increasing its visibility in the region. NATO soldiers ought to be added to a peacekeeping force already based in Macedonia, and a similar group should be stationed in the north of Albania to secure the border and control weapons smuggling. But NATO should also push Mr. Milosevic to accept NATO observers in Kosovo, which he might do if he fears the guerrillas are growing too fast. If Western nations cannot muster a clear and unified message to Mr. Milosevic to restrain his army, he will unleash a new round of ethnic killing in the Balkans.

HEADLINE: POLLUTION POLICY IS UNFAIR BURDEN, STATES TELL E.P.A.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
State governments and major industrial groups are challenging a new Environmental Protection Agency policy intended to insure that minority neighborhoods are not saddled with an unfair share of incinerators, dumps and other sources of pollution.
The agency's policy addresses mounting complaints by civil rights and environmental advocates that state agencies are guilty of racial discrimination in granting pollution permits. 
 But opponents of the policy, which the agency put in place three months ago, are urging the Clinton Administration to withdraw it, arguing that it would hamstring state and local governments, encourage frivolous lawsuits and discourage companies from investing in depressed cities.
The widespread opposition puts the Clinton Administration in a delicate political position because many of its allies in the environmental and civil rights movements support the Administration's longstanding policy of trying to reduce the burdens of pollution on the disadvantaged.
In celebrating Earth Day on April 22, Vice President Al Gore directed all Federal agencies to re-emphasize the Administration's policy, saying that "there have been strong expressions of concern from community leaders that our efforts to date have not been sufficient."
The Federal environmental agency's policy provides detailed guidance to the E.P.A. office of civil rights, which considers complaints of discrimination filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That law prohibits state agencies receiving Federal money from taking actions that unfairly burden racial minorities. The guidance has been in effect on an interim basis while the agency collects public comments.
The E.P.A.'s policy holds that even when a pollution permit passes the ordinary tests of environmental laws, it might be illegal under the civil rights law if it contributes to a pattern of disproportionate pollution in a minority neighborhood.
In that case, a state would have to change the permit, justify it to the Federal agency or face a loss of Federal money and possibly a Federal lawsuit.
Civil rights groups, advocating what they call "environmental justice," have complained that pollution falls most heavily on poor and minority communities, a practice they call "environmental racism."
The broad questions of whether environmental racism exists and if it does what policies can best foster environmental equity have been debated for years.
An executive order issued by President Clinton four years ago telling all Federal agencies to reduce environmental injustices put the Administration squarely in the camp of those who believe, based on demographic studies and other evidence, that minority groups have faced discriminatory treatment in the form of excessive pollution.
But the narrow question of how to use pollution permits as a tool to redress the problem has caused an unusually vehement response from business groups, which in the past have shied away from the debate.
Business groups and state officials said their operations could become hobbled if the agency's new guidance was left in place. Every time a permit comes up for review, they warned, a company could be held hostage by a civil rights complaint.
"It runs contrary to Federal programs designed to bring jobs and cleanup to low-income and minority areas," said William L. Kovacs, vice president for environment at the United States Chamber of Commerce, one of several business groups opposing the new policy. "For the last 10 years, we have been trying to move financial resources into urban areas, trying to encourage jobs and growth. No one is looking at the long-term economic benefit."
Five years ago, many civil rights groups began challenging state environmental agencies for issuing pollution permits that the groups say violate Title VI. State environmental agencies, financed partly with Federal grants, issue most of the permits required by Federal laws governing air and water pollution and disposal of hazardous waste.
But complaints challenging the location of incinerators, dumps, factories and other installations have languished at the E.P.A., which has at least 15 such cases under active consideration. The agency has rejected more than half of the 51 cases filed in the last five years, often on procedural grounds.
If anything, the civil rights groups say, the E.P.A.'s new policy is too weak.
"Many of us have been pressuring E.P.A. to issue just such a guidance for many years," said Luke W. Cole, general counsel for the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. In comments filed on behalf of 20 groups with discrimination complaints pending before the E.P.A. and seven groups whose complaints have been rejected, Mr. Cole said, "The present guidance is deeply flawed in a number of respects."
He said the agency should make clear that discrimination could occur not just by exposure to pollutants but also by increased health risks, changes in land values, the stigma of living near undesirable installations and other changes in quality of life.
The first big case being considered under the new policy involves a $700 million chemical plant that Shintech wants to build in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge, La., and New Orleans. Last year, the E.P.A. held up the Louisiana's air pollution permits for the plant on technical grounds and has been reviewing complaints by civil rights groups since then. Decisions on the permits are expected in the next two months.
In another case brought under Title VI, civil rights groups in the mostly black area of Chester, Pa., opposed the state's grant of a waste treatment permit to Soil Remediation Services. That case has been wending its way through Federal courts. A lower court's ruling that the plaintiffs had no right to bring the case was overturned on appeal.
The Environmental Council of the States, which brings together each state's top environmental official, voted in March to reject the E.P.A.'s policy. Among the states that have formally written in opposition are New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, California, Virginia, Oregon, Wisconsin and Louisiana. Several local government agencies have also complained.
The states' environmental council passed a resolution saying that the agency's policy conflicts with state and local land use policies, including those involving the resurrection of closed, contaminated industrial sites. The E.P.A. has a program that encourages states to clean up those sites and build factories there.
"This guidance would have the effect of working against efforts to achieve environmental protection and promote sustainable economic development," said the resolution, which also criticized the policy as vague and scientifically unsound.
The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, set up by the E.P.A. to advise it on how to address pollution's effects on minority groups, urged the agency last week to strengthen the new policy.
"Rescinding the document, as has been suggested by some, is not a positive approach and should be avoided," the advisory group said.
E.P.A. officials said they might modify the policy to address some of the opponents' concerns, but probably not rescind it.
"The Administration is committed to enforcing Title VI and protecting the legal rights of communities that might be disproportionately affected, but at the same time allows for economic growth and prosperity, and is not stifling," said Loretta Ucelli, the agency's spokeswoman. "With the guidance, nothing is final. It did open a dialogue and does provide a structure for us to refine."
In detailed comments filed with the agency, lawyers for industry groups argued that the E.P.A. had no authority under any environmental law to put the new policy into effect and complained that the agency had, in effect, illegally expanded its authority over state permits.
"If the permit applicant meets the requirements of a statute and its implementing regulations, the agency must issue the permit, regardless of the racial composition of the surrounding community," said the comments of the Business Network for Environmental Justice, which includes the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups.
Several state officials echoed the assertion that the E.P.A.'s new policy was not only a guidance to its own officials but also a heavy-handed exercise of Federal authority over local governments.
"It appears to be really aimed at influencing, if not intimidating, the state permitting agencies," said Donald S. Welch, deputy secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
Complaining that state officials were left out of the document's drafting, Mr. Welch added, "Not surprisingly, the end result is a guidance which is disconnected from the real world of permit decision making, and which focuses on how to second-guess and criticize the state's permit decision, rather than on how to actually accomplish environmental equity."

HEADLINE: Capitol Becomes a House United

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 9

 BODY:
The legislative session here ended on Wednesday at midnight, and in this and other state capitals around the country, a strange thing has happened. While Republicans and Democrats in Washington continue to do battle, a spirit of bipartisan cooperation has dominated the politics of many state governments.
"A lovefest" is how State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, the Democratic leader of the Senate, described this year's session here. 
 State Senator James T. Fleming, the second-ranking Republican, agreed. "No one who has been around this building in the past would believe that this is an election year," he said.
Lawmakers from around the country said the bipartisan peace was partly a reaction to the budgetary standoff in Washington three years ago and the public disgust over that bickering.
But legislators and others who follow state government also said that the strong economy and the accompanying budget surpluses have made it more difficult to find things to fight about. The debate has shifted from which programs to cut to which programs to finance and which taxes to cut.
"There is less wrangling and a greater level of comity and cooperation," said William T. Pound, executive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures. "It has not been a terribly contentious year."
The New York State Legislature passed a budget in April, the earliest it had done so since 1993, and neither party picked a fight until Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed more than 1,000 items. Republicans in Florida, who control the Legislature for the first time since the Reconstruction, talked about what a pleasure it was working with Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, after finishing the budget earlier than at any other time in recent history.
Even in California, where the Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, has clashed often with Democrats, who now control the Legislature, things have been surprisingly quiet. "This has been a tea party," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor at the Center for Politics and Economics at the Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, Calif., comparing it with other recent sessions. "There's even a modicum of decorum."
Of course, some legislatures continue to see deep partisan divisions. Republicans and Democrats in Indiana were unable to agree on how to spend their surplus, and in Pennsylvania, the Republican majority barely talks to the Democratic minority.
"I have to fight every day of the week to be recognized," said State Senator Robert J. Mellow, a Pennsylvania Democrat. He added, "There are no personal relationships -- these Republicans aren't the kind of people I would want to go out to dinner with."
Yet Mr. Pound of the National Conference of State Legislatures said that the bipartisan harmony in legislatures overshadowed the divisions, and among the places where peace prevailed, Connecticut was at the forefront.
Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, remarked on this political cooperation in the text of his address at the end of the session, writing, "At a time when our national politics has become a blood sport, the men and women of this General Assembly -- Republican and Democrat -- have set the standard for how our democracy is supposed to work."
The Legislature passed budget revisions in record time, approved a rebate that would send checks of as much as $150 each to thousands of taxpayers, raised the minimum wage and set aside $20 million to improve reading instruction for young children. It allotted hundreds of millions of dollars to economic development projects for the state's three largest cities, changed campaign finance laws, raised the speed limit and ended the monopolies enjoyed by the state's power companies.
The cooperation came from an unusual alignment of people, politics and money, but at the beginning of the session in February, few lawmakers predicted that this combination would yield such harmony.
It was, after all, an election year, with Governor Rowland seeking a second term. The most powerful Democrat in state government was Thomas D. Ritter, the retiring Speaker of the House and the campaign co-chairman for his party's likely challenger to Mr. Rowland. Add to this mix a State Senate in which the Democrats gained a one-vote majority in 1996 and that has been known for its partisan fights.
Mr. Rowland and Mr. Ritter had worked closely in the three previous years, though often with periods of tension. But there were no such periods this year, and State Senator William H. Nickerson, Republican of Greenwich, said the reason was simple: "the S-word, the surplus."
Like many other states, Connecticut is expected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with the largest surplus in its history, at least $460 million, in a budget of $10.5 billion. This abundance meant that the tough debates of recent years, mainly over what programs and services to cut, were easily resolved this year.
While some state governments, like those in Indiana and Massachusetts, have fought bitterly over how to spend their surpluses, that did not happen in Connecticut, and some credit Mr. Rowland's willingness to compromise. "He was skillful enough to know when he need bend, and when he need not," Mr. Nickerson said.
Democrats said the prospect of a tough gubernatorial challenge from United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly made Mr. Rowland move to the left.
Last year, Mr. Rowland proposed cuts in the education budget, while this year, he added money for schools and state colleges. In addition, he quickly yielded on his proposed cut in the income tax rate -- despite his 1994 campaign promise to eliminate it entirely -- agreeing instead to a property tax credit that Democrats had been seeking for years.
Still, Mr. Rowland walked away with a deal that will use surplus money to send rebate checks of as much as $150 to 1.2 million taxpayers in July. The compromise could help Democrats maintain their hold on the Legislature; it left no issue that Republicans could use to attack them. But the agreement was also borne from a sense that voters here were tired of the partisan politics associated with Washington.
"When the Federal Government shut down, people got angry, and the message reverberated to many of the state houses," said Roy Occhiogrosso, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats. He added that Connecticut politicians from both parties had learned from the efforts of third-party politicians: Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s gubernatorial victory in 1990 and Ross Perot's Presidential campaign in 1992. Both men ran on the idea that partisan bickering was destroying government.
Lawmakers remarked that the desire for a civil, well-run legislature may have transcended politics. They said that in this Capitol, where lawmakers from both sides of the aisle gather at the end of the session for a midnight-to-dawn party with blaring rock-and-roll, personal relationships often supersede partisan politics.
Mr. Ritter, the only person to serve three terms as Speaker, made bipartisan chumminess the hallmark of his tenure, and it was apparent Wednesday as the session prepared to adjourn. Early in the afternoon, he received one of many standing ovations from both Republicans and Democrats in the House, and he could not get them to stop.
"I'm not going to cry until later, no matter how much you try," he said.
That night, State Representative Robert M. Ward, the Republican minority leader, spoke before the House and declared, "I will miss you, Mr. Speaker," adding that Mr. Ritter had treated him as a partner. Later he said that at national legislative conferences, some Republicans were shocked when he and Mr. Ritter would go out for a beer.
"We would be hard-pressed to find anything we didn't like in the session," Mr. Ward said.
Mr. Ritter agreed, saying, "If you'd asked what would have been a perfect session, this would be close to it."

HEADLINE: Dominicans Allow Drugs Easy Sailing

SERIES: LETHAL PARTNERS: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
In the early 1990's, Colombia's drug barons were fed up and eager to rearrange their business. Impatient with the Mexican traffickers who were demanding half of every load delivered and distributed in the United States, they went looking for a country with weak law enforcement, proximity to the United States and established drug distribution networks.
It did not take long for them to find the Dominican Republic. By the spring of 1995, Colombian cartels were ensconced here and looking to expand their network, which is what led one boss to invite Hidalgo Elias Velez, the Colombian owner of a struggling tropical-woods business here, to a lavish party outside Bogota and recruit him as an agent. 
 The Dominican Republic was "excellent," Mr. Velez, now serving a prison term here, recalled being told by his Colombian host.
"You don't have any problems with your merchandise," the Colombian said. "Getting the money out is easy." Compared to their Mexican and Colombian counterparts, the Dominican authorities were so inexperienced, unprepared and ill equipped, "you don't even have to pay protection."
The Colombian drug cartel leaders also recognized, Mr. Velez said in an interview recently, that low-level Dominican drug dealers based in New York City were pushing their way up to the next echelon of the drug business, bidding for a bigger share of the wholesale distribution of cocaine and heroin in the New England and mid-Atlantic states.
Just a few years later, the alliance between Colombian cartels and their Dominican partners has changed the geography of the drug trade once again. For the first time since American authorities began trying to blockade South Florida in the early 1980's, a significant portion of the drugs sold and profits made in the Eastern United States is moving through the island countries of the Caribbean, with the Dominican Republic, a nation of eight million, serving as the main gateway.
With that flood of drug profits have come a wave of corruption and a growing threat to political stability throughout the region. The amount of money from the United States laundered through Dominican financial institutions has doubled over the last three years, according to United States Customs Service estimates, to more than $1 billion annually. Much of this is being invested in real estate, banks and businesses here.
At the same time, Dominican and Dominican-American drug traffickers are popping up in Puerto Rico, Haiti and the English-speaking Caribbean as the heads of smuggling operations. Since they are willing to work for commissions of only 25 percent, or sometimes even for cash rather than merchandise, they are increasingly favored by the Colombian cartels.
The Dominicans are supported by Colombian cartels determined not to repeat the error they made with Mexican rings, which are now gobbling up the Colombians' markets in the United States and even trying to encroach on operations in South America.
A University of Miami expert on international drug trafficking, Bruce Bagley, put it this way: "When the Colombians saw the Mexicans becoming greedier and even develop into rivals, they began to look to the Dominicans as more reliable partners."
The Colombians moved huge amounts of drugs through the Caribbean in the early 1980's, prompting the Reagan Administration to mount its major crackdown. That in turn spurred the Colombians to emphasize other routes, primarily through Mexico. The alliance that ensued has ravaged that country's already weak judicial system, corrupted high officials and shaken its growing partnership with the United States.
While the bulk of Colombian cocaine and heroin continues to move through Mexico, the Colombian traffickers have in the last few years come full circle, returning to the Caribbean as a base of operations.
A big obstacle remains in the way of this new breed of techno-savvy Dominican trafficker: Leonel Fernandez, the country's reformist President. Mr. Fernandez, 44, a lawyer, grew up in Manhattan, where in the 1960's he watched a drug culture emerging around him. It was then, friends say, that he developed an antipathy for narcotics and the corruption they engender.
But as President, Mr. Fernandez must combat a recalcitrant Government bureaucracy and a political opposition that controls the Congress and is becoming increasingly dependent on drug money, American and Dominican officials say.
Those drug profits are finding their way into the economy in this island nation. Office buildings, hotels and shopping centers are springing up in Santo Domingo, Santiago and San Francisco de Macoris -- often in a gaudy style that some describe as narco-deco. Dominican banks have opened branches as far away as Thailand, raising new fears about the growing economic influence of the traffickers.
"There is a process of Colombianization going on," Marino Vinicio Castillo, the outspoken law-and-order crusader whom Mr. Fernandez chose as the leader of his anti-drug program, warned in an interview here. "It is a very serious threat," he said, adding, "The Colombians may not have been able to detect it happening there, but here we can see the narcotics traffickers covertly infiltrating the banking system, political parties and the media."
 
The Safe Drug Channel
A Nation Ill-Equipped Against Traffickers
To hear Mr. Velez and American officials tell it, the Dominican Republic in the mid-1990's was a drug dealer's paradise. Less than 24 hours from Colombia by fast boat, and only 75 miles from Puerto Rico and American territory, this country was forced to rely on a weak, corrupt and ill-equipped military as its main line of defense.
Traffickers were aided, Mr. Velez said, by Colombian military officials, who were routinely selling the coordinates of the American and Dominican vessels on patrol in the Caribbean. With that information in hand, it became a simple matter to land drug cargos of a ton or more on isolated beaches here.
"You can get eight days of information for $5,000," said Mr. Velez, "and I know because I went to Cartagena and saw it happen with my own eyes." His job was to supervise the landings and deliver shipments to a warehouser known to him only as Robocop.
"Without that information, we wouldn't have been able to do what we did."
At that time, as during much of the last three decades, the Dominican Republic was ruled by Joaquin Balaguer. Now 91 and still politically active, Mr. Balaguer came to office after the American invasion of his country in 1965, and kept himself in power through a mixture of guile, rampant voter fraud and other forms of corruption.
But when the Colombians were moving in here, Washington's main policy focus was not on drugs. Instead the Clinton Administration was desperately seeking the Balaguer Government's cooperation with a United Nations economic embargo aimed at toppling the military dictatorship in Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
After a come-from-behind victory in a runoff vote, Mr. Fernandez succeeded Mr. Balaguer on Aug. 16, 1996, promising change and less corruption. American officials expressed pleasure, describing him as a Kennedyesque figure who knew the United States intimately and shared the view of trafficking as a menace to both countries.
Cables from the American Embassy in Santo Domingo in late 1996 drew a grim picture of the situation Mr. Fernandez had inherited. One described how corrupt personnel routinely incapacitated airport X-ray machines here to let drugs through. A second cable detailed corruption as "widespread among airport employees, the national police, military security and the army's J-2," the military intelligence division.
From the start, Mr. Fernandez was also hamstrung by his party's weakness in Congress, where it controlled less than a tenth of the seats. He has since faced an uphill fight to cleanse a corrupt bureaucracy, replace judges and prosecutors who delayed and undermined drug cases, and cajole banks to tighten rules aimed at thwarting money launderers.
"Fernandez can only go so far," said John F. Forbes, a senior United States Customs investigator who works on Dominican money-laundering cases. "The head of General Motors can fire people, but the President is stuck with the existing civil service and bureaucracy from 30 years of one-man rule."
The results so far, American and Dominican officials acknowledge, have been mixed.
On the positive side: Dominican drug suspects are for the first time being extradited to the United States; the tiny budgets allotted to anti-drug agencies have been increased; more than 50 properties linked to narcotics-related crimes were seized last year; wiretaps are more widely used to monitor trafficking groups, and a newly appointed high court has been given powers to remove corrupt, incompetent judges from lower courts.
In a report issued in March certifying that the Dominican Republic is cooperating fully with American anti-drug efforts, the State Department noted that under Mr. Fernandez's leadership, "promising reforms began in 1997."
But the department also noted that the Dominican Government "only achieved sporadic seizures" of cocaine and heroin last year, "as it has not adequately motivated its police and military forces to join in the struggle against the illicit drug trade."
Drug Enforcement Administration figures indicate that only 1.2 metric tons of cocaine were seized in the Dominican Republic in 1996, compared with 3.6 metric tons in 1995. Last year, the figure rose slightly, to 1.35 tons, but arrests for drug-related offenses declined, and the impatience of American officials has increased accordingly.
"The fact is that under President Fernandez, not a single drug-related case has been prosecuted," said a State Department official who deals with Dominican policy. And in a recent intelligence report, the Drug Enforcement Administration asserted that "Colombian and Dominican trafficking organizations continue to maximize well-established cocaine routes through the Dominican Republic" and that "heroin trafficking continues to be on the rise."
Meanwhile senior aides to Mr. Fernandez, under pressure from voters demanding that campaign promises to ease poverty and improve public services be fulfilled, are divided as to how much emphasis to put on cooperation with the United States to fight drug trafficking. Mr. Castillo, President Fernandez's drug czar, cited the flow of "narco-dollars" into local political campaigns. He expressed concern that cooperation might become more difficult after crucial elections scheduled for Saturday to choose the legislature that would have to approve any new anti-drug treaties or laws.
Dominican officials say they are doing the best they can with meager resources at their disposal, which are being drained by the need to patrol a long, porous border with Haiti. And they assert that even more drugs flow through the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico than their country.
The country's attorney general, Abel Rodriguez del Orbe, criticized the United States for a "lack of cooperation."
"If we had the proper equipment," he said, "planes with infrared lights, for example, we'd be finished with this plague in a year."
 
The Bend in the River
A Tough New Leader Allows Extradition
At the peak of their criminal careers, Maximo Reyes and Francisco Medina were among the most wanted men in New York City, accused of the contract killings of more than 30 people on behalf of Dominican trafficking groups. With the police closing in, they returned to the Dominican Republic, certain that they were finally beyond the reach of American authorities.
Last August, however, President Fernandez broke with decades of tradition and bypassed the Dominican Congress, signing an executive order that sent the two men back to New York City to face charges. That day, law enforcement authorities in New York City detected a dramatic increase in telephone conversations among Dominican traffickers alarmed that they would no longer enjoy impunity in their homeland.
In a larger sense the episode illustrated the strategy that the Fernandez administration, trying to turn a liability into a strength, has adopted. With limitations on equipment, personnel and spending that weaken its ability to interdict drugs, the Dominican Government has instead decided to use the instruments of law to attack traffickers and curb the enormous profits they make.
"The only thing the cartels fear is extradition," said Mr. Castillo, the country's anti-drug program director. "That is the most powerful tool in the hands of both Governments."
Heartened by Mr. Fernandez's cooperation, the Clinton Administration is now seeking the extradition of more than 30 other Dominicans wanted in the United States. But that process promises to be even more controversial and convoluted, with resistance rising in the Dominican Congress and media coverage against returning those on the list, including the two most prominent, Edmon Elias and Ricardo (Tito) Hernandez, both influential businessmen.
Mr. Elias's interests include casinos as well as hotels and other real estate investments; Mr. Hernandez is an owner of the popular Cibao Eagles baseball team. Both face charges in Miami concerning a Mexican-American named Luis Cano. They are accused of having helped him buy airplanes he reportedly used to smuggle 10 tons of cocaine into the United States.
Mr. Hernandez did not respond to calls requesting comment, but Mr. Elias, in an interview here, denied wrongdoing, calling himself "an enemy of drugs and a friend of the United States" and dismissing the charges as a "fantasy." He acknowledged that he had introduced Mr. Cano to leading Dominicans but said Mr. Cano had gained his confidence under false pretenses.
Still, Dominican law enforcement officials describe the country's casinos, Mr. Elias's among them, as a main mechanism by which drug profits are laundered here. They say that banks, boutiques, businesses, sports betting parlors -- almost all forms of private enterprise -- are being used to turn illicit cash into tangible, legitimate assets.
As a result, Dominican officials and business people say, more and more drug money is flowing in unimpeded. The problem is probably most acute, they maintain, in cities like Santiago and San Francisco de Macoris, in the northern Cibao Valley, birthplace of many of the most notorious Dominican traffickers based in the United States.
For instance Santiago, the country's second-largest city, has in the last two years gained many new businesses like as auto dealerships and hardware stores. That would not be suspicious in itself, since the Cibao Valley is enjoying a tobacco-led economic boom. But many of these new businesses are selling their products below cost.
As one Santiago businessman put it: "How can you buy steel rods or cement blocks in the capital, transport them up here and then sell them for less than you originally paid? There are suddenly a lot of people around who went to New York as nobodies a few years back and have come back with lots and lots of money whose origins no one seems able to explain."
Along the country's north coast, multimillion-dollar weekend homes are also going up. Nor is it unusual to come across expensively protected country mansions adorned with stained glass windows, mock Greco-Roman pillars and tile images of the Virgin of Altagracia, the country's patron saint.
"All this recycled money that can't be traced is creating a new culture," said a lawyer in San Francisco de Macoris. "You go into a restaurant, and there are all these guys wearing ostentatious rings and glittering medallions of the Virgin of Altagracia, flashing big wads of thousand-peso notes and boasting about their big cars outside. It's a new reality that is very disturbing to us and which no one seems able to control."

The Course Yet Uncharted
A Reformer's Future In the Voters' Hands
This week, voters here will go to the polls for elections that Dominican and American officials regard as crucial to the Fernandez Government's success during its two remaining years in office. At the moment, the President's party controls only one of 30 Senate seats and 10 of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, meaning that no legislation can be passed without the backing of at least one of the two main opposition parties.
The Fernandez administration has expressed support for tougher money-laundering legislation and streamlined extradition procedures, which Congress would have to approve to go into effect. So it is obvious why the stakes in the vote are so high. Mr. Castillo, the Dominican anti-drug chief, said trafficking groups here and in New York and Colombia had responded by funneling money into the campaigns of candidates they believe will vote against the proposals.
"This is the greatest problem we face in these elections," he said. "Not only that, narcotics traffickers from New York are putting their own people, by which I mean their brothers and cousins, into the campaigns, and some of the candidates know that."
American officials have long harbored similar suspicions of the Dominican political process. During the 1996 presidential campaign here, in fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration, responding to a Central Intelligence Agency inquiry, took the highly unusual step of organizing a sting operation in the United States against Mr. Fernandez's chief opponent, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, in an effort to determine whether he and his party were involved in drug trafficking.
Mr. Pena Gomez was running well ahead of Mr. Fernandez in election polls when he took his campaign to New York City's large Dominican immigrant community early that year. At a rally at the Washington Heights headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, or P.R.D., members of his staff were approached by a couple who said they were representatives of a Colombian cocaine cartel but in reality were Drug Enforcement Administration agents working undercover.
The pair offered the Pena Gomez campaign an immediate $50,000 and said $250,000 more would be forthcoming each month if Mr. Pena Gomez, once elected, would agree to let five planeloads of drugs land unobstructed. Such an agreement was already in place with Dominican military and police authorities, they said, urging Mr. Pena Gomez and his aides to check the authenticity of their claim with the officials involved.
One of his New York representatives later met the drug agents at an office at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, but Mr. Pena Gomez eventually rejected the overture, and shortly afterward he sent a letter of protest to President Clinton. American suspicions were again aroused, however, when, just days after Mr. Pena Gomez won the first round of the election and declared himself "virtually president," several of his party members were detained and a shipment of 778 pounds of cocaine seized, according to Dominican officials.
In an interview here, Mr. Pena Gomez attributed the case, which those officials say is still pending, to a political vendetta against his party. "An accusation like this can destroy a person in this country," he said, "and that's what my enemies are trying to do to me. I was the victim of a campaign in which false denunciations were made to middle-level American officials in an effort to involve me in this."
Recent polls indicate Mr. Pena Gomez as favorite in the race next month for mayor of Santo Domingo, the second-most-important elected post in this country. But Mr. Pena Gomez is also suffering from an advanced case of pancreatic cancer. The struggle to succeed him as party leader is already under way, and American and Dominican law enforcement officials said there is ample evidence that some of the contenders are receiving support from drug traffickers.
"The narcotics traffickers don't like to have all their eggs in one basket," a senior Dominican Government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And so they donate to all the parties. But the biggest problem is in the P.R.D. We don't like to say that publicly, however, because then people think we are acting from political motives."
In the United States, Federal drug agents and local law enforcement officials have also been looking closely at the party's branches and leaders throughout the Northeastern United States. The drug enforcement agency's documents identify the party's New England headquarters in Worcester, Mass., as a major drug distribution center. They say that local party officials in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, some of whom have previous drug convictions, are also involved in such activities.
Even if the drug traffickers' candidates are defeated, the rings will offer no respite, warned Mr. Velez, the Colombian businessman who is in custody here. The Colombian cartels, having established an enormously lucrative foothold in the Dominican Republic, will stop at nothing to expand it, he said, even if that means "killing judges, lawyers, cops and reporters," as well as ordinary citizens who stand in their way.
"In whatever country they establish themselves," Mr. Velez said, "the cartels get involved in politics and the economy, buying up properties and infiltrating all aspects of public and private activity. That's what's coming here, and this country isn't prepared and doesn't know how to stand up to it. It's going to be a catastrophe."

HEADLINE: West Puts Pressure on Serbs With a Ban on Investment

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 9

 BODY:
The main Western industrial nations imposed an investment ban on Serbia today and froze its assets abroad as their concern grew about the violence in Kosovo, a southern Serbian province. They also froze the overseas assets of Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
Foreign and Finance Ministers of the Group of Eight countries, meeting here as part of the summit meeting in Birmingham next week, called for urgent discussions between Belgrade and the Albanian leadership in Kosovo, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. 
 Because Yugoslavia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, has not met conditions set by the West to withdraw special police forces from Kosovo and begin negotiations, the sanctions were approved by all the countries meeting here today except Russia and Japan.
Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, opposes the sanctions outright; Japan said it would study the measure. Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada all supported the sanctions.
To help bring the message home to Mr. Milosevic, the Clinton Administration has sent Richard C. Holbrooke, a banker who helped negotiate the Dayton accords to end the war in Bosnia, and Robert S. Gelbard, the American special representative to the Balkans, to warn the Yugoslav President of the dangers of civil war breaking out in Kosovo and spreading.
In the past, Mr. Holbrooke has had mixed success in persuading Mr. Milosevic to bend to the will of the United States, which is seeking a form of enhanced political autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sharply criticized Mr. Milosevic today for rejecting talks with the Albanians in Kosovo.
She expressed regret over Russia's opposition to the new sanctions, but said the measures would "significantly hamper Belgrade's ability to fund its repressive policies." Even Russia, she said, agreed that "the situation in Kosovo is unacceptable."
In their final communique, issued today, the Foreign Ministers made clear that they do not support independence for Kosovo.
Together with the Finance Ministers, they also spent much time on issues of nuclear safety; controlling the spread of dangerous materials, weapons and technology; developments in Iran, and regional investment, aid and debt-relief initiatives in Africa.
They also expressed the hope, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said, that Israel would agree to American proposals for a West Bank withdrawal and allow talks on a final settlement with the Palestinians to begin in Washington on Monday. Israelis should consider what might happen "if America and others are not encouraged to believe that efforts to assist in the progress will be rewarded with cooperation," Mr. Cook warned.
Ms. Albright said she remained hopeful that the Israeli Cabinet, which meets on Sunday, would make it possible for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom she again praised for his "constructive ideas," to go to Washington.
In their private discussions, the seven Finance Ministers (Russia does not take part) spent most of their time on the shaky prospects for Indonesia, and how best to present a united view to President Suharto for the need to continue economic and political reforms.
Officials said the ministers were troubled by political unrest in Indonesia and by how much Mr. Suharto is "internalizing" the need to continue on the path laid out by the International Monetary Fund and Western governments.
In a speech here today, the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said that "in Asia, we are beginning to see a return to financial stability in a number of the countries affected by the recent crisis." But he emphasized that Japan in particular must push for structural reform to boost its lagging economy.
In their final communique, the Foreign Ministers also welcomed "recent encouraging political developments in Iran," and urged the country "to build on this and play a more constructive role in world affairs."

Surely Mickey Kaus must be joking (Op-Ed, May 5). Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration in the face of gross unemployment, not the "abuse" of a welfare system. 
 It was a major program of public works to create decent jobs for people whose only crime was that the Depression put them on bread lines.
Roosevelt did not conspire to undermine other workers.
There were literally no other workers.

HEADLINE: Warren Beatty Is Trying to Say Something

BYLINE: By Lynn Hirschberg; Lynn Hirschberg is a contributing writer to the magazine. She has written about Quentin Tarantino, Tom Ford and Jamie Tarses, among others.

 BODY:
There was no one moment when Warren Beatty decided not to run for President. In the late 60's and early 70's, he was greatly distracted and intrigued by Presidential politics, working on the short-lived campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968 and then, in 1972, for George McGovern. "I enjoyed the tumult," he recalls. "Partly it was because it didn't have to do with the work that I did." But he was never really tempted to run himself, for President or anything else. "I've never seriously found it attractive," he says. "Everyone who has any involvement with politics thinks about what it would be like to be stuck with having to get elected."
Beatty long ago decided he wasn't going to get stuck doing anything. He is, and has long been, a movie star, and he has used the power of that office to insure he would never have to do anything less than what he wanted to do. He would produce and direct his own movies as well as star in them. He would make movies when he wanted to -- only seven in the last 20 years. And in an era that would see the political center move to the right, he would make movies rooted in the ideas of the cultural and political left: "Reds" (1981), a sweeping romance about John Reed and the American Communists caught up in the Russian Revolution, and now "Bulworth," a dark comedy about race and class in America, in which Beatty plays a corrupt Democratic Senator from California who, just days before an election, remakes himself as a rapping radical populist. 
 About all this -- his politics, and how they find their way into his movies -- he would rather not say too much. Attention of this sort makes him squirm, and like any good politician, he dodges inquiry. Beatty is much more comfortable asking questions than answering them. "Why do I feel like making movies instead of getting votes from people?" Beatty asked one afternoon late last month, just a couple of weeks before "Bulworth" had its opening in New York and Los Angeles. He is in an empty suite at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. He is wearing all black -- black T-shirt, black exercise pants, black sneakers -- and he is munching on a carrot stick from the room-service tray. "Well, the thought of having to buckle down and get things done in a political sense does not strike me as a thoroughly enjoyable endeavor. It's more fun to say what you think."
Much of what "Bulworth" says is what Beatty thinks. "Bulworth" says, among other things, that America is divided by class, that elected officials serve mostly the interests of the rich and that black America has been ravaged by the globalization of the economy. This is not what the majority of Americans think or what the Democratic Party, with which Beatty has a life-long involvement, thinks.
"I would never know if I'm going to have impact," he says, rolling up a slice of smoked turkey. "That's not my goal. It can't be. I think things and I'm lucky enough to be in a profession where I can express them."
But isn't the point to have an impact? Why do something political if the goal isn't to change things?
He answers, after a long pause, with a different question, his question. "The question is," he says, "When you have the freedom to make choices, what do you do? What are the choices that you make?"
Warren Beatty is seductive, and it's not just a sex thing. With Beatty -- and it is said that this is the key to Bill Clinton as well -- it's all about interest, his interest in you. He will ask about your mother, where you were born, your politics, your father's politics. And he will remember the answers, link them up, connect the dots.
I first spoke to Beatty last fall. "Good evening," he purred into the phone. It was late morning. His voice -- light, insinuating, sly but disarming -- is all midnight. Years ago, when he was in his 20's, he would begin calls with "What's new, pussycat?" and you can see how this would work. Initially, he wouldn't talk at all about "Bulworth" -- nor would he volunteer anything. "If you have something to hide," he told me once, "then hide it."
Occasionally, when pressed, he would confide some bit of nonconfidential information, like a change in the release date of the film. More typically, he would simply find a way -- a polite, nonconfrontational way -- of not answering a question. At one late-night meal at the Apple Pan, in West Los Angeles, Beatty sat at the counter and ate a hickory burger, fries and a tuna-fish sandwich (very deftly). I asked him if he'd ever slept with Brigitte Bardot. He stared, took a bite and never answered. "Is this off the record?" he finally asked.
Even when he is saying nothing, he is saying something. Beatty is a study in counterpoint. He's physically manic -- he jumps up, sits down, stretches his legs, drums the table, fidgets -- but he can lull you with his voice. A comb falls out of his pocket, but he's tousled and boyish and wears the same clothes for weeks. He bores in on a conversation but often seems to be answering a question that someone else asked a few days ago. What comes across most, perhaps, is that Beatty is one of the least angry people I have met. Working and socializing in Hollywood, a town full of feuds, he has nothing awful to say about anyone. He sees no point. Instead, he tries to understand. He asks. He asks.
All this questioning, while seductive, is a little unnerving. You begin to wonder, as people must about Clinton, how much of it is genuine interest and how much of it is reflexive charm. To charm is to be gracefully distant -- to remain in control. As Beatty studies the artifacts of my life as if they were long-lost Mayan ruins, his attentiveness seems genuine. But is it real? Or is this Beatty the politician, working hard to get my vote?
It's March 30, Warren Beatty's 61st birthday, and he's celebrating with a trip to the South Bronx with his wife, the actress Annette Bening, and some friends for a test screening of "Bulworth." Beatty has a lot invested in this project. He co-produced, co-wrote, directed and stars in the movie. He is test-screening it in the South Bronx because places like the South Bronx are what the movie is concerned with.
As Senator J. Billington Bulworth, Warren Beatty talks a lot about racial and class divisions. At the beginning of the film, the Senator is alone in his office on Capitol Hill, sunk in a deep depression watching his own TV ads, in which he asks for the votes of middle-class whites by preaching racial code: family values. Self-loathing and suicidal, Bulworth arranges to have himself assassinated while campaigning in Los Angeles on the weekend before election day.
The pending hit sets him free -- he drops his stump speech about the millennium, with its clear echoes of Clintonian bridge building, and starts preaching populism. At first his speeches are largely aimed at Washington and the electoral process -- the corrupting power of campaign contributions. But at a church stop in South-Central Los Angeles, Bulworth meets a beautiful young black woman, Nina (played by Halle Berry), and falls in love. Revitalized by this woman and his rediscovered political voice, Bulworth tries to call off the hit and begins talking more and more about racial injustice, first in fitful rhyme and then, soon enough, in pure inner-city rap.
"Rap music is the language of social protest," Beatty explains on the phone from the van as he heads to the South Bronx. "He who fails to listen, fails to hear at his own peril."
The message Bulworth raps is funny and outrageous. It is also unlike anything in America's discourse about race. It is certainly not about welfare reform or taking a hard look at affirmative action; but neither is it about the kind of identity politics you find on the cultural left. During one CNN-like appearance, Bulworth raps about how average white people really have more in common with black people than with rich whites. In one of the movie's most intimate scenes, the Senator and Nina stare into each other's eyes and discuss the lack of black leaders -- how when blue-collar jobs got exported to Korea and Thailand and so on, blacks lost not only employment but also their place in the political structure.
"The picture has. . .a message," says Beatty, still on the phone in the van. "My political conduct has changed. I now think as a person who deals in mass media. I don't think I'd be very effective in practical politics, the way I used to be with Bobby Kennedy or George McGovern. But you can say things in a movie. You can say black people are treated badly in the United States. It's an oversimplification but it needs to be said. You can say rich people control politics. It's an oversimplification but it needs to be said.
"I'm in the entertainment business," he goes on to say. "The message happens to be true, but any time you try to have a message in a movie, you sound like you're on C-Span. Listen, I have a lunatic in this movie who has a nervous breakdown, runs around in short pants, acts like an adolescent, talking in a voice that's not even his own. He oversimplifies the message pretty drastically, but he's funny. I tried to make it funny enough and move it quickly enough so they don't walk out."
As always, Beatty is canny. "Reds" may have been about radicals, but it was also a dramatic love story. "Shampoo" (1975) may have been about Nixon-era sexual and political deceit, but it was wildly entertaining. "Bulworth" may be brimming with indignation over racial strife and political compromise, but it is full of laughs. "It doesn't work unless they laugh," he says. "The intention is always to entertain."
Around 3 in the afternoon on a day in early April, two black female singers are rehearsing a gospel song in a recording studio on the 20th Century Fox lot in Los Angeles. This song will be added to "Bulworth," replacing some singing that Beatty isn't quite satisfied with, and these two women have the rather complicated task of matching their vocal intonations to those of the actresses singing in the film. The movie should have been finished by now, but it isn't. Beatty is off somewhere, talking on the phone.
"W. F. W.," jokes one of the sound editors. "Waiting for Warren. We do quite a lot of that." Moments later, Beatty bursts in, wearing the all-black outfit he'd wear most days I saw him this spring, and looking, as he often does, a mix of preoccupied, overwhelmed and excited. He hugs one of the female singers and inquires about the other's pregnancy. "Do you want to hear?" the first woman asks. Beatty raises an eyebrow -- with Beatty, a flirt is always possible -- and he coos, yes, let's hear.
Beatty stands while they sing, rocking back and forth, studying the film projected behind them. The scene they're synching takes place in a restrained all-white church, and the joke, like most of the humor in "Bulworth," is about racial contrast: these two black girls let loose with full-bodied gospel voices while the stuffy white congregation looks on in discomfort.
When Beatty set up the deal for "Bulworth" in 1992, he did not mention to Fox, the only studio he pitched, that the movie would be set in the rap world. He did not mention that he would play a politician or that there would be an interracial love story. He sold the idea on a simple, high-concept premise: a man pays someone to kill him, then falls in love and tries to call off the murder. "I thought it was a good idea," recalls Joe Roth, who, as chairman at 20th Century Fox, made the initial deal with Beatty for "Bulworth." (Roth is now chairman at Walt Disney Studios.) "And as long as he didn't exceed the budget, which was $32 million or $34 million, he could do what he wanted. Beatty has final cut."
Control was crucial to Beatty. "I wanted to have complete freedom to do what I wanted to do," Beatty recalls. "I always felt I would set it in this world, but I didn't want to be influenced by commercial considerations. I wanted to do a movie about contemporary politics because I felt I knew it better than other people in the movie business."
Beatty became fascinated with the world of rap music about 10 years ago. Through his friend Bobby Shriver, a producer and the nephew of Robert Kennedy, he met two of rap's leading black impresarios, Russell Simmons, who runs Def Jam Records, and later, Suge Knight, the controversial chief executive of Death Row Records, who is currently serving a nine-year prison term for violating his parole by beating up a man in a Las Vegas casino. Simmons recalls sending Beatty videotapes of "Def Comedy Jam," an HBO series. "He wanted to see everything," Simmons says. "He would watch them unedited. He wanted to know everything about the rap world -- he'd ask the same question three times sideways. He'd call me in the middle of the night to ask me who Cheryl Underwood is. She was a comedian on one of the 'Def Comedy' tapes and I didn't even know.
"Once, I went to his house with Bobby Shriver and a date," Simmons goes on to say, "and it was us and Annette and Warren and we had this long dinner and, finally, Annette went to sleep and my date was dozing off but we sat for hours and hours. He's such a charming person that you don't mind all the questions."
Knight, too, would travel up to Beatty's house in the hills above Los Angeles. Unlike Simmons, who was raised in Hollis, Queens, Knight was from Compton, the tough South-Central neighborhood where Beatty planned to set "Bulworth." Knight and his gangster-rap record label, Death Row, also had an outlaw reputation -- guns and drugs and pit bulls -- and he was impressed by Beatty, by the outlaw roles he'd played in "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) and "Bugsy" (1991).
But it was mostly Beatty's reputation as a world-class romancer of women that gave him street credibility in the rap world. "Warren Beatty is a mack," Simmons explains. By "mack," he means a "mack daddy" -- a smooth, big-time lady's man. "He's been with a lot of women," Simmons says admiringly.
Beatty and Knight spent a lot of time together. "Suge, who is always at least four hours late, would show up on time for Beatty," recalls a former Death Row employee. "He was honored by the association." Beatty was intrigued by Knight's world and pumped him for information. By the time he began writing the script in 1996, Beatty was saturated in rap culture.
Simmons is not troubled by Beatty making a movie about black ghetto life. Blacks, he says, "don't care that he plays a rapper in this movie, but everybody likes everybody doing certain things. They would rather see him as Bugsy."
Probably the people at 20th Century Fox would share that sentiment. It will be interesting, to say the least, to see what Rupert Murdoch, the right-wing media baron who owns the studio, makes of "Bulworth" and its politics -- especially the Senator's raps about communications-industry monopolies. "Every time I see Rupert Murdoch," Beatty says, "he is extremely nice and says, 'When can I see your movie?' I look at my watch and say, 'What time would you like to see it?' "
Even as the movie was being screened two weeks before its May 8 opening in New York and Hollywood, Murdoch had not, to the best of Beatty's knowledge, gone to any screenings. Fox also seemed to be avoiding preparing a marketing plan for the movie. There were no television commercials on the air, no advance advertising.
"Bulworth," even with its relatively modest budget, is a commercial risk. "The audience is ghettoized," says a studio head who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of seeming to sound racist. "Blacks go to certain movies and whites go to others. How many white people saw 'The Players Club'?" (It was set in South-Central and directed by the rapper Ice Cube.) "How many black people went to see 'The English Patient'?"
But then, Beatty is Beatty -- a star, and also, as people in Hollywood will tell you, a very smart producer. And a perfectionist: in the recording studio, after the girls finish up their gospel number, Beatty asks the engineers if he can rerecord part of his dialogue, a rap that Bulworth delivers during an interview on national television. They say sure, and the image of Bulworth is projected on the screen. He is wearing cutoff sweat pants, a red T-shirt, a black stocking cap pulled low, narrow sunglasses and a three-day growth of beard; and he is rhyming: "That's the real obscenity/ black folks living every day/ Is tryin' to believe a expletive word/ Democrats and Republicans say."
Repeating the rap quietly to himself, Beatty is completely focused. He clears his throat and singsongs the rap in an angry, growly voice. He does it again. And again. Two days later, he will go back to his original take, but this afternoon he wants to get the message across exactly as he hears it in his head. "Was that loud enough?" Beatty asks. "I want it loud."
When Beatty likes someone, thinks they're smart, attractive, handsome, clever, perceptive, whatever, he will say they're funny. Funny. That's his all-purpose adjective. As in his thoughts on his ex-great love and still great friend Julie Christie: "She makes me laugh. She's funny." Or his opinion of Ronald Reagan: "A funny guy." Sometimes he will elaborate. "I showed 'Reds' to Reagan," Beatty recalls. "I always had a good time with Reagan. He was very funny about the movie. He's an actor, and he was very impressed that I had done all those jobs on the movie and still acted in it. He said he wished the movie had a happy ending." They discussed the marbling of meat and how, in "Reds," Beatty had botched a joke. "He was funny," Beatty says. "Reagan was funny."
He often says someone's funny, in lieu of saying anything else. An example: I say, "Oliver Stone wanted to cast you as Nixon." "Uh-huh," Beatty responds. He pauses, seems to remember an amusing moment he has no intention of sharing, then says, "Oliver is funny."
Beatty gravitates toward funny. He wrote a part for the actor Oliver Platt in "Bulworth" because "I thought he was funny." He entertained the notion of playing the pornographer Burt Reynolds eventually played in "Boogie Nights" because he found the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, "funny."
"Funny" can mean talented, it can mean gorgeous, it can mean anything. Only Beatty knows. The way he uses it, "funny" is an inexplicable compliment, but a compliment all the same. You never know what he really thinks; "funny" encompasses all.
Beatty and Bening and their three children live in a large white Spanish house in the hills above Beverly Hills. Beatty lived for years in a suite at the Beverly Wilshire hotel until after he made "Shampoo," when he built a white glass house with spectacular views on Mulholland Drive. The house collapsed in the 1992 earthquake. The new house, although beautiful, feels empty, temporary. There's very little furniture, and the children and Bening are away in New York. (She is filming a movie.) It's late, around 10 P.M., and Beatty, again in the all-black ensemble, is eating dinner.
The white dining-room table is covered with small, lighted candles and Beatty is tearing into his corn chowder, the first course of many, with his usual gusto. The phone rings every 10 or 15 minutes, and Randy Ledarman, his cook, has twice passed him a note with a name on it. "Does he need me?" Beatty says, pondering one such name. A pause. He abandons his soup and jumps up to return the call.
In the Beatty universe, it is now as it has been: they were always calling and he was always eating a four-course meal. He has been famous for so long, since his first movie, "Splendor in the Grass," in 1961, when he was 24, that he can't even remember a time when he wasn't known. "After that movie, I was like Leonardo DiCaprio is now," he says, having returned to the table and his soup. "Dustin always says to me, 'You've been famous longer than you've been a person.' I'm in there 10 years before Dustin or Jack or Redford or any of those guys."
In a way, he was famous even before he was known to the world. Growing up in Arlington, Va., Beatty was president of his class and a football star. "I was a center and a linebacker," Beatty recalls. "I learned more from football than anything else. I couldn't con anyone into anything. I was there with the tackle or the block or I wasn't. There was no choice. You just had to do it."
Beatty's father, Ira, was an educational psychologist and a public-school administrator, and his mother, Kathlyn, taught dramatics and directed plays put on by local amateur drama groups. His sister, the actress Shirley MacLaine, danced and performed as a child, but Beatty did not show any interest in the theater until he attended Northwestern University. He found he loved it. "I stopped playing football," he says now. "I was in the process of consigning myself to a more effete way of life."
He visited New York after his freshman year and never returned to college. "I was having such a good time," Beatty says. "I decided to study acting. I went to Stella Adler. And she liked me. A lot. She convinced me that I was a good actor."
To film a TV show, Beatty came to Los Angeles in 1958; he was impressed. "I liked L. A. from the get-go," he recalls, starting in on an artichoke. "I stayed a week, two weeks, something like that and, finally, I thought, All right, I'll make a movie deal. I went under contract to MGM. I was rolling in money. Four hundred dollars a week. I was not used to this kind of money. It coincided with a certain liberalization of my life style. I was having a very good time."
For a while, Beatty was content being a boy about town, but soon, he says, he came to a realization: "I wasn't doing anything that meant anything." A meeting at MCA, which was representing him, changed all that. William Inge, who would later write "Splendor in the Grass," was at that meeting. "They asked me why I was not doing a play," Beatty recalls. "I said, 'Because it's not fun, it's work doing a play.' And they said, 'Are you afraid of work?' By the end of the conversation, I realized I had to get out of California."
He borrowed $2,600 from MCA, bought his way out of his five-year MGM contract and returned to New York, where he did an Inge play called "A Loss of Roses." It was not a success, but the director Elia Kazan saw Beatty in the play and cast him in "Splendor in the Grass."
Randy appears with the main course of fish and pasta, and the conversation shifts. "From the beginning," Beatty says, "I definitely had some feeling that if I was to go out and just take the gigs and do the press and be in the public eye, I wouldn't live much of a life. I would live a pretend life of story after story on celluloid, and I didn't want to do that."
Beatty's fame allowed him access to many worlds and he was (and is) an avid collector of worlds. When he speaks about the last fashion show he attended, he was in the company of the legendary editor Diana Vreeland. (She was my buddy.") "Do you know Kissinger?" he'll ask, by way of introducing an anecdote about the former Secretary of State.
Beatty says that he does not simply seek out famous people but only those who interest him. "I'll give you an example," he says, twirling some pasta. At my first big Hollywood party, I looked across the room and saw Rita Hayworth. It was before 'Splendor in the Grass' and I. . .stared. She was dancing with a guy with floppy shoes. She got a little closer and she was looking at me and I'm looking at her and she's looking at me and, finally, I said, 'You're Rita Hayworth,' and she said, 'You're Warren Beatty.' I said, 'How did you know that?' And the guy with the floppy shoes said, 'I told her.' I said, 'Hello, I'm Warren Beatty,' and the man with the floppy shoes said, 'I'm Clifford Odets.' And at that point, you could have airbrushed Rita Hayworth out of the picture because he was Clifford Odets. I said, 'Can I talk to you?' Odets was my hero."
Through Odets, Beatty goes on to say, he met Jean Renoir, the great French director of "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game." "I've always been a guy who stays up late," he says. "And I like to talk to people. I like talking as much as. . .many things." He laughs. "As an actor, I passed on a lot of good pictures. But if I'd done them, I couldn't have stayed out till 4 in the morning in different cities around the world."
Beatty revered Odets because he thought his plays were full of political insight. No matter that when Beatty met him he was living in Beverly Hills and rewriting Elvis Presley movies. Odets, to Beatty, was still an artist with a conscience. He would much rather stay up all night talking politics than romance a famed Hollywood star. (Or maybe he could do both, but that's a story he's not about to tell.)
Beatty's introduction to electoral politics was Bobby Kennedy's brief campaign in '68. "I felt that I was living in my time," he recalls. "I remember Cary Grant saying to me when I asked him why he didn't want to make one more movie, 'Why would I go and trip over a lot of cables?' He knew that how you appear to be in front of a camera is not who you are."
It was through his connections to people who had worked for Kennedy that Beatty became involved with the McGovern campaign. He traveled with McGovern, giving speeches on his behalf in small towns in New Hampshire and Florida. His biggest contribution to the campaign may have been the five fund-
raising concerts he organized. For the one held at Madison Square Garden, he convinced Simon and Garfunkel to reunite and perform. The concerts raised a million dollars -- in those days a staggering sum -- for the campaign.
Gary Hart was McGovern's campaign manager, and he and Beatty, who were born less than six months apart, formed a close bond. (Beatty also met Bill Clinton during the McGovern campaign.) When Hart sought the Democratic nomination in 1984, Beatty was one of his closest advisers. Many have said that Hart wanted to be Beatty -- that he envied and emulated Beatty, who was then single, and his movie-star life full of women, money and luxury. Beatty has repeatedly refuted this assessment, claiming it's much more complicated that that.
In any case, it was Beatty who persuaded Hart to reenter the race for the '88 Presidential nomination after the Donna Rice scandal drove him out in the spring of '87. Hart's bid failed, and some feel that his flameout spelled the end of Beatty's intense involvement in politics. "You could say," Beatty told the author Ronald Brownstein after Hart withdrew from the race, "that what a man has to do to obtain public office is to destroy himself."
One suspects that a good deal of what Beatty learned from Senator Hart was used to create the despondent Senator Bulworth. One suspects too that Hart's travails and burdens led Beatty to better appreciate the freedom of the movies. And yet, he is nervous about "Bulworth" finding its audience. The movie is scheduled to open wide, on 2,000 screens across the nation, later this month, opposite "Godzilla," the summer's monster, which will open on 6,000 screens. Beatty fears his smallish movie with a political message, unless properly marketed, will be crushed.
"The movie culture is totally dependent on TV advertising," he says. "That's the whole thing. And what that has done is decimate anything that is not already known." Beatty pauses. "You could say this is all very democratic. Or you could say that the public votes with their feet. But it doesn't have a lot to do with movies as a near art form. It causes everybody to trim their sails. And that's true in every other phase of life. It's true in politics. You can't succeed unless you're espousing things people already know."
So why try? "Did I tell you what John Huston said at that gin game with Willy Wyler and Sam Spiegel?" Beatty asks, providing, again, his own question to answer. "They were all in their 80's and someone said: 'We're really old. If there's one thing you could still have, what would it be?' They went around the table and Wyler and Spiegel said: 'Food! Women!' When they got to John Huston, he said, 'To be interested.' " Beatty pauses. "Now, I'm not near the age of John Huston, but at a certain point you realize you do what you're interested in. Interest is all that really matters."
"Do you know how Lenin met with people?" Beatty is saying. It's around 4 p.m. and he's in yet another empty suite at the Carlyle Hotel. He's still wearing the black, still eating carrots off a room-service tray. "This is how." He jumps up, pulling a straight-back chair opposite me. He sits down, so that our knees are touching, placing his hands flat on my legs. He holds the pose. "They say," Beatty says with a grin, "that his interviews were not long."
Beatty laughs and pulls his chair back. A few hours ago, Paula Jones's sexual-harassment case against President Clinton was thrown out, and this seems to have put Beatty in a good mood, although he will not admit that. Earlier, he was flipping around the TV, looking for some coverage of the event. The networks had gone back to their regular programming and all Beatty could find was a very pretty blond lawyer on ABC who seemed very earnest but not terribly well informed. Baffled yet intrigued, Beatty studied her presentation. Naturally, he would not say anything harsh, but he kept chuckling, as if to say, This is the movie, this is what I was getting at in "Bulworth."
When I ask him, flat-out, what's wrong with America, he answers: Those of us in politics, culture and business whose high standing empowers us to lead, are, in fact, led by public-opinion polling in order to maintain our standing. We follow rather than lead. So, our politics and culture don't develop. They stagnate. What doesn't stagnate is business. The profits go to the upper class, whose advertising money has itself formed public opinion. And the classes are pushed further and further apart." This is the essence of Beatty's new movie, his mission statement.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BOERUM HILL;
Circular Makes the Rounds and Residents Complain

BYLINE: By ERIN ST. JOHN KELLY 

 BODY:
Last month, Sandy Balboza set out to do some spring cleaning. She and a few neighbors got about 200 Boerum Hill residents to sign a petition calling on The Marketeer, a free weekly advertising circular, to cease its "indiscriminate littering of our neighborhood."
"I was annoyed a long time before that," said Ms. Balboza, who lives on Atlantic Avenue and is the president of the Atlantic Avenue Betterment Association. She said she had called The Marketeer's office several times to get delivery stopped and was unsuccessful. So she asked for help from Ralph Perfetto, the Democratic leader in the 52d Assembly District and an ombudsman in the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. 
 Mr. Perfetto got the drive moving. He drafted the petition and delivered it to the Sheepshead Bay office of The Marketeer on April 21. And given his ombudsman role, his involvement may raise the stakes of the controversy beyond Boerum Hill.
"We're using the Atlantic Avenue corridor as a pilot project," Mr. Perfetto said. "If we're successful here, than I'll start with other areas."
Mr. Perfetto said that his ombudsman office gets complaints from all over the city about circulars, menus and the like, as well as about the littering summonses that addressees sometimes get from the Sanitation Department. "The worst problem is calls from senior citizens with their little brooms in front of their homes," Mr. Perfetto said.
In the Boerum Hill controversy, which was reported late last month by The Park Slope Paper, the petitioners have put forth several ways The Marketeer can tighten up on distribution. "You must sign up to get it," is what Ms. Balboza prefers. Mr. Prefetto suggests that only as many circulars be delivered to a building as there are households inside, and that The Marketeer make sure people who don't want the publication don't get it.
Mr. Perfetto added: "I don't want to hurt the people making minimum wage who do the delivering, nor the store owners who advertise. But we want to stop the indiscriminate delivering."
Has the petition changed The Marketeer's policies? "No," said Jerry Mallach, the publisher, who said his company does maintain a do-not-distribute list. "We're not going to force-feed them," he said.
The Marketeer has been landing on Boerum Hill stoops only for six months, Mr. Mallach said. The paper is already distributed throughout Brooklyn and Staten Island.
Delivered in a clear plastic bag, the weekly has a circulation of 500,000. Its advertisers include small businesses and large chains like Caldor, Pathmark and Sears.
"We deliver a neat package," Mr. Mallach said. "And we keep the local economy strong. Where else can the pizza man with a shop on Third Avenue get 30,000 families to find out about his pizzas?" ERIN ST. JOHN KELLY

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Neighborhood Report last Sunday about attempts to curb the distribution of circulars in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, misidentified the employer of Ralph Perfetto, a leader in the drive. He is an ombudsman in the office of the city's Public Advocate, not the Department of Consumer Affairs.

HEADLINE: Adrift in the Global Economy

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten, an Under Secretary of Commerce from 1993 to 1995, is dean of the Yale School of Management. He is the author of "The Big Ten: The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
When the heads of state of the top industrial nations hold their annual summit meeting this week in Birmingham, England, one of their most important tasks will be to figure out how to prevent another Asian-type crisis. Unfortunately, they cannot succeed.
This is not to say the leaders cannot shore up parts of the world economy. They can start designing what Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, call a "new architecture" for global finance -- including tighter regulation and more extensive disclosure of financial statistics in emerging markets. They can create the conditions for a more effective International Monetary Fund. They can even propose experimenting with controls on short-term investments that can destabilize developing nations by moving in and out of markets with startling speed. 
 But even if all these ideas are carried out, the problems threatening the global economy will not go away, because the international financial system has become crisis-prone over the last two decades. In the early 1980's, the Latin American debt bomb was detonated, and in 1987 stock markets crashed around the world. In the 1990's, Japan's bubble burst, the European monetary system nearly collapsed, and Mexico needed a bailout of unprecedented size. The East Asian meltdown is only the latest in a series of financial collapses.
Although no one can predict where the next crisis might come from or precisely when it will happen, there are at least four reasons to suspect trouble is on the way.
First, the combination of explosive growth in world trade, direct foreign investment and cross-border trading in stocks and bonds has created an ever tighter web of connections among countries, all of which are in very different stages of development. The network is highly vulnerable to its many weak links.
Start with Japan, the world's second largest economy. Its problems include $600 billion or more in bad debts, dragging down the banking system, as well as shrinking industrial production, sagging consumer confidence and a political system that is all but paralyzed. China, too, is potentially at risk. While Beijing has carried out many important reforms, it has yet to tackle a banking system that is as insolvent as Japan's, and it has yet to close down thousands of bloated state companies, a move that would result in the layoff of tens of millions of workers.
Then there is Brazil. Its economy, which constitutes 40 percent of South America's gross domestic product, has an overvalued currency and a large budget deficit, the kinds of imbalances that could cause foreign speculators to pull out. And the fate of the new European currency is creating nail-biting uncertainty in currency markets.
The global economy is vulnerable to wild market swings, too. In the last five years, the American balance-of-payments deficit has risen by more than 100 percent, while Europe's surplus has grown fivefold. In the last three years the American dollar has risen 60 percent against the yen. Meanwhile, the total amount of capital flowing to Southeast Asia dropped to $12 billion from $93 billion from 1996 to 1997. In an ever smaller international marketplace, these sharp course changes are akin to major storms in a big ocean, and emerging markets, being small boats, could be easily capsized.
A second reason for concern is that financial regulation lags well behind the phenomenal expansion in banking and in securities trading. More money is moving around the world than ever before, in more complicated ways and at ever faster rates. Take the $1.5 trillion in foreign exchange dealings that occur each day and the tenfold increase in private capital that has moved to emerging markets since 1989, not to mention the trillions of dollars of so-called derivatives, including options, futures and swaps.
If this were all that was happening, regulators in each nation would have a hard enough time. But the supervisory agencies face additional uncertainties. In the United States the rules separating banking, securities underwriting and insurance are being rewritten, while in Britain, regulatory agencies are being merged into one Securities and Investment Board, and in Japan there is extensive deregulation of financial services. In this unsettled environment, there are too many complicated moving parts, and no one is minding the entire global store.
A third cause for alarm is the so-called emerging economies. These nations have yet to meet the awesome challenge of building economic and social systems able to deal with global capitalism. Virtually all of them lack antitrust laws, bankruptcy courts, patent and copyright protection and a history of effective corporate governance. It will take at least a generation for these countries to develop a culture of objective credit assessment to replace the typical take-care-of-your-family-and-friends ethos. The most serious threats to financial stability occur when an economic and political system is in transition -- as is the condition today in Asia, Latin America and the former Communist countries. We can expect all manner of booms and busts in the emerging markets, with global fallout.
 Finally, while the financial playing field is supposedly more sophisticated now, investors and lenders are no smarter today than in the past. They take the same risks that traders always have, whether in the early 1700's, when European financial wizards went broke investing in the South Sea Company, a speculative real estate venture, in the prolonged spree of the 1920's that led to the crash, or in the current Asian debacle.
Similar features recur in all these crises. To begin with, there is good news, and confidence rises. Then more lenders and investors appear on the scene, attracted by the new opportunities.
Soon, optimism turns to euphoria, and new theories emerge to justify why this particular business cycle will not have a downswing or why these super-high valuations aren't really excessive. (Remember how in the 1970's lending to Latin America exploded on the theory that sovereign nations couldn't go broke? Or how just before the '87 crash, experts declared junk bonds and highly leveraged companies to be the wave of our financial future?) At last, a troublesome event -- a default, or a change in investor sentiment -- causes the bubble to burst, and everyone rushes for the exit. The pattern has hardly varied.
Today two new developments reinforce it further. Computers now insure that investors, traders and bankers have instant real-time information. As a result, hundreds of billions of dollars move by keystroke in response to a rumor, thereby worsening the damage caused by lemming-like financial behavior. Also, lenders have become emboldened to take ever greater risks with increasing sums of money because they believe -- with good reason -- that in a crisis Uncle Sam and the I.M.F. will bail them out to limit global fallout.
None of these factors should deter the leaders at this week's summit meeting from doing the best that can be done now. But down the road they'll have to do more, like stabilize exchange rates among major countries and establish real global financial regulation. For the time being our leaders resemble King Canute, who, in the old legend, tried vainly to hold back the tides. As things now stand, the global economy will not be submerged, but we're all going to get wet for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: Filmmakers Optimistic On Summer

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, May 10

 BODY:
The summer movie season opened this weekend with a catastrophe that delighted Hollywood. "Deep Impact," the disaster film about a colossal comet the size of New York City hurtling to Earth, opened the season with an unexpectedly strong box office.
The film received mixed reviews, and the expected box-office take of more than $41 million was seen by executives and producers not only as a positive omen for the summer, when Hollywood releases more than 100 movies, but also as a powerful indication that moviegoers have been eagerly awaiting the season. Producers of the film also saw it as the beneficiary of some smart marketing. 
 "There's been a paucity of big pictures, and Paramount wisely put together a trailer for this film that showed with 'Titanic' -- and it played and played and played," said Richard D. Zanuck, who produced the film with David Brown.
Terry Press, the marketing chief of Dreamworks, which financed the $80 million film with Paramount, said: "The movie was intended to jump-start the summer season, and it has. It's been a long time since there's been a big movie. And I think people are captivated by the trailer and TV spot showing New York being decimated by a tidal wave. Let's face it, any time you wipe out New York or L.A., people love it."
Several executives said that the film had, essentially, two weeks to make the bulk of its money at the box office before the opening of "Godzilla," the most lavishly promoted film of the summer. The movie, about a prodigious lizard that stomps all over Manhattan (is New York a new whipping boy in Hollywood?) must match the $229 million box-office take of the "Jurassic Park" sequel, "The Lost World," or it will be viewed as something of a disappointment.
The other big film of the summer is expected to be "Armageddon," opening on July 1, with Bruce Willis leading a team of roughneck oil drillers who are launched into space to implant a nuclear bomb in an asteroid (this one is the size of Texas) hurtling not only toward New York but also the rest of the Earth, too. Whether "Deep Impact" hurts "Armageddon" is, of course, unclear.
"You're dealing with talented filmmakers here, and you have to be concerned," said Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of "Armageddon." "There's nothing we can do about it, except make as good a movie as possible."
What top studio executives are hoping for is a sleeper or two: a film that cost $30 million to $60 million, is relatively unknown at this point and then seizes the attention of moviegoers and unexpectedly grosses more than $100 million. There were three sleepers among last summer's big winners: "The Full Monty," the serious comedy about a group of unemployed British men who become unlikely strippers; "My Best Friend's Wedding," the Julia Roberts comedy, and "George of the Jungle," based on Jay Ward's late-1960's television cartoon.
Several studios are already predicting their sleeper hits. Robert Daly, co-chairman of Warner Brothers, predicted that a relatively modest film, "The Negotiator," directed by F. Gary Gray and opening on July 31, would emerge as a hit. "This is one that nobody has really talked about, but it's going to be a big surprise of the summer," Mr. Daly said. The film, which has tested very strongly, stars Samuel L. Jackson as a smart Chicago police negotiator who takes hostages after he is framed for murder, and Kevin Spacey as an equally smart negotiator who comes in to resolve the crisis.
At 20th Century Fox, William Mechanic, president of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said that a zany romantic comedy, "There's Something About Mary," directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, would emerge as a surprise winner. The Farrelly brothers are known for their hilarious grossness: they made "Dumb and Dumber." In the new film, Ben Stiller plays a loser who hires a private eye (Matt Dillon) to find the prom date (Cameron Diaz) who jilted him years ago. Mr. Dillon falls for Ms. Diaz, and turmoil ensues.
At Disney, executives predicted that the sleeper hit would be "The Parent Trap," opening on July 29. The film, directed by Nancy Meyers and starring Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson, is an update of the 1961 Hayley Mills classic about twins (played by Lindsay Lohan in the new film) who meet for the first time and seek to reunite their divorced parents. The film has been hugely popular among young girls.
"It's tested terrifically," said Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group. "It's as good as any live-action Disney movie we've ever had."
Another potential winner: Dreamworks and Universal's "Small Soldiers," opening on July 10 and directed by Joe Dante, about toy soldiers who unexpectedly spring to life and wage war against one another and their human owners. The film is seen as a young boys' movie.
Looking toward the summer, producers and studio executive see several trends: with the exception of Warner's "Lethal Weapon 4," which opens on July 10, there are far fewer sequels than in previous years. "Everyone started to realize that a certain amount of originality was required, and if you make a sequel it should be better than the last one," said Mark Gill, president of Miramax's Los Angeles office.
There are also seems to be, especially in the early part of the summer, an unexpectedly large number of pictures for grown-ups at a time when Hollywood usually unleashes escapist movies. The grown-up films include "The Horse Whisperer," Robert Redford's romantic drama, and "Bulworth," Warren Beatty's political fantasy (both opening on May 15); "The Truman Show," the Peter Weir drama starring Jim Carrey as a man who doesn't know that his life is actually a television show (June 5), and Steven Spielberg's World War II drama "Saving Private Ryan" (July 24).
Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group, said of the summer: "No one said let's do more adult films. It's a coincidence. But if I had to say anything about the summer, it's that it feels less popcorny than other summers."

HEADLINE: City of Angels Is the City of Death for Magazines

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
When Buzz magazine put out its first issue in 1990, seven other city magazines were trying to distill the essence of Los Angeles and find a loyal following. With its focus on hip clothing designers, personalities and inside-Hollywood tales, Buzz outlived nearly all its rivals. But even a booming California economy was not enough to insure that the monthly made money. Buzz filed for bankruptcy-law protection last month.
Its demise leaves the nation's second-largest city with a single city magazine, the money-losing Los Angeles, owned by the Walt Disney Company's Fairchild division. In a pre-bankruptcy deal that put its competition out of business, Disney agreed to pay what is considered the steep sum of $5.3 million for Buzz's subscription list and its trademarks. Just 10 percent of Buzz's 138,475 paid circulation came from newsstand sales; a third was mailed out of state, according to figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
 "Buzz was worth more dead than alive," said Allan Mayer, Buzz's former editor, who co-founded the magazine with his New York publishing colleague, Eden Collinsworth, and Susan Gates, its former publisher.
Buzz often teetered near ruin. Twice it was revived with fresh capital from out-of-the-blue investors, who ultimately became impatient with the high cost of glamour publishing. Buzz executives have little hope for a third 11th-hour rescue. Even so, publishing executives say Buzz achieved some measure of success because the largest markets typically only support one glossy general-interest city publication.
The city of Angels is a notorious magazine graveyard, having buried California, Angeles, L.A. Style and Exposure among other defunct titles. The survivor, 36-year-old Los Angeles, has been unprofitable for three years and has a third of the circulation of New York, one of the nation's most successful city magazines.
There are various theories about why that is true.
While New York is one city with five boroughs, the Los Angeles region is one county and 88 cities. It is a checkerboard of political and cultural interests.
"It's a disparate sprawling city that feels more loyalty to individual cities than to a whole," said Michael J. Caruso, a Tina Brown protege and editor of Details, whose stint as editor in chief of Los Angeles magazine lasted little more than a year. "L.A. is a tough nut to crack."
Joie Davidow, founder of long-gone L.A. Style, blames transplanted East Coast editors. "They don't get the city. L.A. is so different from New York; it's amazing they speak the same language."
Another explanation comes from David Adler, a spokesman for Primedia Inc., publisher of Chicago and New York. "The common conception is that L.A. is not a reading market," he said, also suggesting that Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety, serve, in effect, as city magazines.
"The economics of one-title companies don't work," he added, because independent magazines lack clout when bargaining for services.
Bruce A. Hoenig, vice president of print services for Western International Media, a media buyer in Los Angeles, disagreed. "You can succeed if you're focused," he said. "But it's very difficult to provide to all the constituencies."
For the last year, Buzz's majority owner, Sharon Chadha, had tried to make the magazine profitable. A technology investor, she got her entree into publishing from a neighborhood friendship with one of the magazine's editors. Now, she said she expected a 45 percent loss on her $4.5 million investment. "Buzz had been given many lives," she said.
While advertising revenue had grown 40 percent last year, Mrs. Chadha said, operating losses continued unabated. Buzz's ad pages rose 16 percent last year, to 642.5, according to the Media Industry Newsletter. But, she said, "We ran into our risk limit."

HEADLINE: American Publishers Add Readers in Booming Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RECIFE, Brazil, May 6

 BODY:
In this languid beachfront city, home to Latin America's oldest newspaper, newsstands are suddenly filling with glossy upstarts -- Selecoes, a new Brazilian edition of Reader's Digest, and newspaper supplements of Time and Fortune in Portuguese.
Hot on the heels of American cable television's invasion of Latin America, magazines and newspapers from the United States are stampeding south. In the last two years, magazine publishers started Spanish-language editions of Newsweek, Glamour, Discover, People, National Geographic and Rolling Stone. 
 In the newspaper field, 20 Latin American newspapers now publish Wall Street Journal Americas, a daily section of The Journal's business news translated into Spanish or, for Brazil, Portuguese. For tourists and business travelers, The Miami Herald has rapidly become Latin America's international English-language newspaper, establishing 10 satellite printing sites in two years, including Sao Paulo Brazil, last month.
"By the end of the decade, I see probably three more printing sites and total distribution going up to 35,000 to 40,000," said Jose C. Romano, The Herald's international manager. With these sales, Latin America could soon account for 10 percent of the Herald's daily circulation, currently 366,243.
Several publications have become jaw-dropping success stories in Latin America. Brazilian sales of Reader's Digest in Portuguese soared to 600,000 last month, from 35,000 two years ago. And six months after their debuts, National Geographic en Espanol is selling 290,000 copies a month, while Glamour en Espanol is selling 500,000 copies.
"Europe and Asia have traditionally been the largest revenue areas for Time Inc. International, but now we view Latin America as the place for explosive growth," said Hugh Wiley, president of Time Inc.'s Latin American division. "It is the only region in the world we can cover entirely in two languages."
At Reader's Digest, Christopher Willcox, the magazine's editor in chief, said: "After the war, we did most of our expansion in Europe. We now see Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region as our 21st century."
The explosion in American publishing is part of a wider surge in foreign investment into Latin America. Over the last five years, the annual flow of new foreign investment into Latin America quadrupled, hitting $50 billion in 1997. During the same period, the foreign investment flow to Brazil, the region's behemoth, increased fourteenfold, hitting $18 billion.
American publishers are discovering Latin America for the same factors that lure other investors: newly opened markets and newly tamed inflation rates.
"It's very difficult to sell subscriptions in a market where inflation is hyper," Mike Brennan, the Digest's vice president for developing markets, said, referring to the early 1990's, when Brazil's monthly inflation regularly hit four digits. This year, Brazil's inflation is expected to be 4 percent.
With a stable currency allowing long-term subscription sales, Reader's Digest has become Brazil's second-best-selling magazine, after Veja, a long-established newsweekly owned by Editora Abril S.A. For the Digest's Spanish edition, Selecciones, subscription sales have allowed the Digest to sell 150,000 copies in Chile and 250,000 copies in Argentina, becoming the best-selling magazine in those two countries. Last month, Selecciones started selling subscriptions in Peru and Colombia.
"If you look at Europe today, you see Latin America 10 years from now," Mr. Brennan predicted, noting that the Digest now sells 1.7 million copies a month in Latin America.
Digest sales, he said, often give a clearer picture of a country's middle class than official statistics, which miss unreported income. Though Government statistics show low levels of per-capita income, he predicted that the Digest could double its Brazilian sales in five years.
Indeed, the strength and huge size of the Brazilian economy have prompted American publishers to overcome ingrained biases in favor of Mexico and Spanish over Brazil and Portuguese. Two years ago, Brazil, for the first time in recent memory, surpassed Mexico as the region's largest recipient of foreign investment.
With a population of 172 million, Brazil has a domestic car market five times the size of Mexico's.
In "mature" newspaper markets like Europe and the United States, newspaper sales are largely stagnant. In contrast, with low inflation and growing literacy, Brazil's reading market is expanding. In the last five years, newspaper sales in Brazil have jumped 9.5 percent.
"Latin America is now the best market in the world for offset presses," said Rosental Calmon Alves, a Brazilian newspaper columnist who teaches journalism at the University of Texas in Austin. Over the last year, he noted, new daily newspapers have been started in Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
This August, Globo, Brazil's largest media company, plans to open a $120 million printing plant outside of Rio de Janeiro and to start Brazil's third major newsweekly, Epoca.
American investors are catching this wave.
Time and Fortune, both owned by Time Warner, and The Wall Street Journal, owned by Dow Jones & Company, have followed the path of selling translated material for local language supplements in Latin American newspapers.
Time, which started only in March, now appears in nine newspapers, with a total circulation of 900,000. Fortune appears every two weeks in 23 newspapers, with a total circulation of 1.4 million.
Some Latin American publishing groups have been wary of buying these inserts, suspecting that the Americans merely want to familiarize Latin readers with their titles, before selling the magazines separately. Mr. Alves said, "Once they become a known brand name in the market, they could say 'bye-bye' to the paper and launch their own product."
Mr. Wiley of Time replied: "We looked long and hard at paid circulation. But it is very difficult to develop paid circulation in Latin America."
The Wall Street Journal's supplement reaches 2.2 million readers through a network restricted largely to one newspaper per country. In Brazil, a nation of continental size, The Journal will limit itself to one newspaper per state, planning to add six newspapers in coming years.
"Of all the American ventures, Wall Street Journal Americas is by far the most successful," Laura Lopez, a former Time reporter in Latin America, said from Santiago, Chile, where she is a spokeswoman for a United Nations economic research agency. "It is read by everyone, quoted in every cocktail party, quoted by ministerial level people at conferences. People love it."
In a symbiotic relationship, The Journal's five-day-a-week supplements have proved to be so profitable since they started in 1994 that the newspaper has tripled the size of its news staff in Latin America to nine, and a bureau is opening in Sao Paulo this month.
"When reporters' material can be read by people they are covering, they get better access -- and better access begets better quality," Richard J. Tofel, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said of the Latin America articles that are printed in the mother newspaper as well. Wall Street Journal Americas proved so successful that The Journal has expanded from Spanish and Portuguese and produces supplements in Turkish, Polish, Korean, German, Chinese, Hebrew and Greek.
Another Dow Jones investment, a Spanish-language business magazine, America Economia, has proved so successful that it added a Portuguese edition in 1995. The magazine went from monthly to twice monthly publication in April. America Economia and its Miami-based rival, Latin Trade, have circulations of about 85,000 each. Latin Trade, an English-language monthly now owned by Freedom Communication Inc., added a Spanish edition last year.
The Miami Herald, which is owned by Knight Ridder, is aiming for the niche market of English-speaking visitors and residents in Latin America. Half a century ago, The Herald introduced an international edition, named The Clipper because it was carried south on Pan Am Clipper planes.
More recently, by printing locally via satellite, The Herald moved its deadlines ahead 12 hours, cut its newsstand prices in half, and guaranteed home delivery in key foreign markets by 8 A.M.
In two years, this two-section daily newspaper has tripled its circulation to about 20,000.
Competing for some of the same market, TimesFax, an eight-page daily summary of The New York Times, has moved from a regional base of selling to Caribbean hotels and cruise ships to selling to hotels and businesses in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru.
The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, has virtually ceded Latin America to The Miami Herald. The paper, which prints at 15 sites around the world, stopped printing in Miami a few years ago and sells only 1,500 copies in South America.
"Latin America is not really where our growth goals are now," said David Auchincloss, the newspaper's vice president for the Americas.
Despite the success stories, some publishing executives experienced with Latin America's ups and downs foresee a shakeout in coming years.
"This is a part of the world that is volatile," said Richard Burns, president of Latin Finance, a 10-year-old investment monthly owned by Euromoney Publications P.L.C. "I do not assume that it will be blue skies forever. Latin Finance has been through good times and bad times, and realizes there are cycles."
But for others, weaned on Latin America's deep-rooted protectionism, the region's new publishing environment is stunning.
"I'm flabbergasted by the turn of events," said Gary Neeleman, who first worked as a reporter in Brazil in 1958. Now responsible for Fortune's distribution across Latin America, he said: "People in Ecuador want to read about Bill Gates. It's refreshing to me, this newfound zeal for the print media throughout Latin America -- and their willingness to try new things."

'I Don't Think It Works'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
With President Clinton going to China next month, attention is focusing again on the question of how the United States should try to improve the human rights situation there. I raised the question in an interview with the Dalai Lama, who for 40 years has been a pre-eminent symbol of resistance to oppression by the Chinese Communist Government.
"China should not be isolated," the Dalai Lama said. "It must be brought into the mainstream of international life. Now the next question: How?" 
 He laughed heartily at his own question. Then he continued, emphatically:
"Confrontation or condemnation: I don't think it works. The only practical way is to be a genuine friend. Within that framework, the American stand on issues like human rights, democracy, liberty and Tibet should be made very clear to them.
"So I feel the American Administration's current policy of engaging the Chinese and establishing friendly relations is right."
When President Clinton came to office in 1993, he first adopted a policy of pressure on the Chinese Government to end its violations of human rights. But then he decided that that approach was ineffective and changed it to a policy of "engagement." In recent months, Beijing has released and sent to the United States its two best-known political prisoners, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
The Dalai Lama, who was here visiting Brandeis University, took a similar view of his own relations with Beijing. "At this moment," he said, "meaningful dialogue with the Chinese Government is crucial."
Attempts to open a dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Beijing were broken off in 1993. The Chinese Government has treated his current effort in that direction disdainfully, suggesting that his talk of autonomy rather than independence for Tibet is a sham. He said the United States, "knowing my view, can help dispel the suspicions of the Chinese."
"Inside Tibet things are really bad," he said. "There are human rights violations, damage to the environment, degeneration of spirituality. Talks with the Chinese Government are the real hope to solve these problems."
He said he was "very optimistic" about the trend of conditions in China. "It is comparatively more open," he said. "Now some critical articles about Government policy regarding Tibet are appearing. They may not be in big-circulation journals, but they are there. These are very, very positive factors."
The Dalai Lama made clear that his support of a friendly U.S. approach did not mean silence on human rights issues.
"If you are only concerned about the economic side," he said, "that would be a terrible mistake. President Clinton should not go there and just forget about the issues of human rights, freedom and Tibet."
A strikingly similar view was taken by Wang Dan, who spoke at Harvard University soon after his release from prison last month. He said he thought improved U.S.-Chinese relations "will help economic and political reform in China." But he added that the United States must keep emphasizing its "moral standards."
Wang Dan was a leader of the democracy movement crushed in Tiananmen Square in 1989. President Clinton has agreed, at the Chinese Government's request, to visit Tiananmen Square next month. That seems a craven concession, a violation of the principle that America should hold fast to its ideals.
But it is equally true, I think, that we should avoid gestures likely to do more harm than good. An example is the proposed Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, which the House takes up this week. Designed to please the Christian right, it would largely duplicate existing human rights laws, except for a shameful provision making it easier for those claiming religious persecution to win asylum in this country than for those tortured or threatened with death because they want political freedom.
I have always believed that Americans committed to human rights should follow the advice of the oppressed in any country, as in the Soviet Union and the old South Africa. In the past I favored sanctions on China. Now there are signs of change: much greater freedom of movement, local elections, some lawsuits against authority. I think we should follow the advice of Wang Dan and the Dalai Lama.

HEADLINE: Road to Riches Starts In the Golden Triangle

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
Chauffeured about town in his gleaming white sedan, Lo Hsing-han befits his reputation as one of the most influential businessmen in Myanmar, as Burma is now called.
A crisp business card identifies him as chairman of Asia World Company Ltd., a conglomerate managed by his son, Steven Law. Their commercial empire includes jade, ruby and teak concessions, real estate in Yangon (formerly called Rangoon), its renovated port buildings, a container shipping business and toll booths on the resurfaced Burma Road winding north to the Chinese border. 
 Mr. Lo has traveled far from his bare-knuckle origins as an opium warlord of the Golden Triangle in the early 1960's, when American drug officials linked him to much of the heroin winding up on the streets of American cities. He later survived seven years in a Burmese prison under sentence of death for treason, but after his release in 1980 he earned the Government's gratitude for brokering a critical cease-fire with ethnic insurgents in 1989.
Now, Mr. Lo says, there's more profit in selling cars across the Chinese border than in smuggling drugs.
The United States views Mr. Lo's prosperity as evidence that Myanmar's economy is awash in laundered drug money and that its military rulers have encouraged those who trade in drugs to invest in its development projects.
"Drug traffickers who once spent their days leading mule trains down jungle paths are now leading lights in Burma's new market economy and leading figures in its new political order," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright told the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, knows as Asean, in Kuala Lumpur last July.
Proving Mr. Lo's complicity is more difficult. "There are no smoking guns, no evidence linking him to any investigation whatsoever" at present, a Western official who follows narcotics conceded. "We're going to keep him out there as a target, because there's rampant speculation that he's involved in moving large quantities of heroin."
At 64 years old, Mr. Lo has not lost the nerve that helped him thrive in the opium trade. Told that several American reporters wanted to interview him, Mr. Lo invited them to dinner. He denied any involvement now in trafficking or money laundering.
"I welcome the whole world to investigate me," Mr. Lo said and promised $5,000 to anyone who could link him to drugs in the last 25 years.
Barely glancing at his diamond-studded gold Rolex wristwatch, Mr. Lo fielded questions in Chinese while his chopsticks poked at a succession of sumptuous dishes.
He reminisced about the late 1960's and early 70's when his opium-laden mule caravans stretched several miles across the mountainsides and ravines of Kokang, his ethnic Chinese home region in northeast Burma. What drove him, he contends, was not greed but benevolent concern for Kokang's struggling poppy growers.
"I don't bother about eating, drinking or traveling," he said. "My whole life has been spent just helping the poor."
Mr. Lo is hardly the only reputed drug trafficker to succeed in business in Myanmar. Khun Sa, the world's biggest heroin producer, surrendered his rebel Shan army in January 1996 and moved into a villa in a Government military compound in Yangon.
The Myanmar Government refuses to extradite Khun Sa to the United States, where he has been indicted for trying to smuggle 3,500 pounds of heroin into New York. He has described himself as a real estate agent and his investments are said to include a new resort casino and a bus route between Yangon and Mandalay. Until his health deteriorated, he also played golf with the generals whose army he once bloodied.
Mr. Lo's drug career began when he commanded a home guard unit battling Communist insurgents. The only way to equip and feed his troops, he said, was through the opium trade. "In the Kokang mountains, people earned their living from poppy for over 100 years," he said. "Over that period, poppy-growing and trading was legal. It was the only income for people."
As he tells it, rival traffickers demanded commissions of 25 or 30 percent to take the opium for refining in Thailand. Mr. Lo undercut them by charging 20 percent.
Twice a year from 1963 to 1973, Mr. Lo said, he moved 10 to 20 tons of opium to the Thai border, using his own troops and 800 to 1,000 mules per convoy. "It stretched out for three miles," Mr. Lo said. "If it went smoothly, it took about 26 days."
Mr. Lo waved aside questions about how much he earned. "I was working for the Kokang people and the poor people who were looking for a way to sell their product," he said. "I did so much for them, and I felt it was honorable."
When the Government ordered him to disband his troops, Mr. Lo refused. "The Kokang people needed the opium market," he said. "I was their sole agent, so the Kokang farmers got a reasonable price."
In 1973 he was lured across the Thai border, captured, extradited to Rangoon and sentenced to death. "I didn't think any harm would come to me," he said. "The Government didn't charge me with opium trafficking. They charged me with treason and violating socialist economic law."
He served a month short of seven years in prison before being released in a 1980 amnesty. Mr. Lo opened a bakery in Rangoon, raised livestock in Lashio and mined precious stones, using what he explained were family loans, not drug profits.
In 1989, he persuaded Peng Jiasheng, another opium dealer who led Kokang's rebel army, to accept a cease-fire with the military junta. The junta rewarded Mr. Lo with choice gem and timber concessions.
Since then, Mr. Lo said, "I have done a lot of import-export business, and also Chinese-border trade," delivering new cars from Yangon to China's Yunnan province. Mr. Lo described Asia World as "doing quite well" with an annual profit somewhere "over $1 million." He declined to say how much more.
Mr. Lo said he does not need to traffick in drugs now. "Since the market economy appeared in Myanmar, it is easier to earn money trading vehicles on the Chinese border," he said. He estimated that he turns a profit of about $2,500 on every car he sells to the Chinese.
Moreover, Mr. Lo said, he was shocked to discover so many addicts in his Kokang homeland and wants to stamp out opium. "When a family has a drug addict, the family is totally destroyed," he said. "I realized that drugs are not good."
Col. Kyaw Thein, the head of the Government's drug control program, said of Mr. Lo, "He's been out of the drug business since he was released from prison, because he knows that every intelligence agency will be keeping their eyes on him."
But a Western diplomat charged that the Government let Mr. Lo launder his money in legitimate businesses. "He has the connection with the banks," the diplomat said.
Mr. Lo was upset when his son Steven Law, who travels widely as Asia World's managing director, was denied a visa to the United States in 1996 because of suspected drug links.
"Steven is a genuine businessman," he said. "He doesn't know about drug trafficking. He wasn't born when I was in Kokang." Another son, Henry, lives in Los Angeles, but Mr. Lo said, "I can't remember the details."
Mr. Lo wants to see America himself. "If the United States is a democratic country, why doesn't it allow me to enter?" Mr. Lo asked. "Have I committed any crime?"

HEADLINE: Tobacco Bill Said to Cost 50% More

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
An analysis of anti-smoking legislation released today by the Senate Republican leadership concludes that the bill before the Senate would cost the tobacco industry more than half again as much over 25 years as the amount estimated by the White House and the measure's chief sponsor.
The analysis put the 25-year cost of the bill, approved by the Senate Commerce Committee last month and scheduled to go before the full Senate next week, at $755.3 billion to $868.9 billion. The White House and the bill's sponsor, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, calculate the cost at $516 billion. 
 The main reason for the discrepancy is that the Republican analysis included the expected effect of inflation, at a rate of 2.7 percent a year, over the next 25 years, expressing its conclusion in what economists call current dollars. The White House and Mr. McCain did not count inflation, expressing their estimate in what are called constant dollars.
The bill would impose a tax on cigarettes of as much as $1.10 per pack, strengthen the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products, require cigarette makers to pay penalties if the number of teen-agers who smoke does not fall to specified levels and give the tobacco companies little of the immunity they want from lawsuits filed on behalf of smokers.
The study is certain to figure prominently in the Senate debate. The tobacco industry and opponents of Mr. McCain's bill have argued that the measure is so costly that it could put American tobacco companies out of business and lead to a black market in cigarettes.
The industry wants legislation that would embrace the agreement the tobacco companies reached last June with 40 state attorneys general, which was said to cost $368.5 billion over 25 years.
The new calculations also take some of the steam out of the arguments supporters of the legislation made last week after the tobacco industry agreed to a $6.5 billion settlement of a lawsuit filed by the State of Minnesota and health insurers there. They argued that the large settlement showed that the cigarette makers could afford to pay much more money than they had indicated.
The analysis released today was prepared by the staff of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, an arm of the leadership, and was distributed by Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader and a foremost critic of the McCain bill.
"This analysis confirms my suspicions about the high cost of the Commerce Committee bill," Mr. Nickles said. "I don't believe it is necessary to raise taxes and spending by hundreds of billions of dollars to have a good anti-tobacco bill."
Explaining the rationale for counting the effect of inflation, the analysis said, "Americans don't earn or pay constant dollars." The Administration's estimate, the analysis said, "does not reflect actual pocketbook expenses as taxpayers would experience them."
John Raidt, the staff director of the Commerce Committee, accused the policy committee staff of "playing a silly numbers game."
Mr. Raidt said, "They know that the debate has always been in the context of 1998 dollars." He noted that the $368.5 billion cost of last June's agreement was expressed in uninflated dollars and that if inflation were counted, the cost would be $608 billion.
"They want to compare the apple to the orange, and that makes it wildly out of context," he said.
All this will doubtless be hashed out on Tuesday when the Senate Judiciary Committee holds a public hearing on the cost of the legislation. The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, is another critic of the McCain bill.
In their calculations, the Administration and Mr. McCain assumed that levels of smoking among young people would fall to specified levels so the tobacco companies would not owe penalties for not meeting the goals.
The policy committee staff expressed its estimates as a range, with the low figure assuming that no penalties would be assessed and the high figure assuming that the goals would not be met.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, Not All Gifts Well Received

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
When Fritz Martial left Haiti in 1969 to immigrate to the United States, his hometown of Tiburon had one elementary school, no hospital and no potable water to serve the town's 50,000 or so residents. Today, Tiburon, a dusty outpost about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince, boasts of six schools, including two high schools and one of the best irrigation systems in Haiti.
"It would have remained a backwater," said Mr. Martial, of Uniondale, N.Y., who in 1976 helped create the Committee to Help and Develop the Parish of Tiburon, a New York-based organization with chapters around the country. "We could not stay here, live well and let that happen to the place of our ancestors." 
 The story of Tiburon has been repeated across Haiti as Haitians in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America have banded together in regional associations to finance small but critical projects to keep their impoverished country of seven million afloat.
The aid is crucial: money wired from the United States, estimated at $3 million a day, is considered the largest source of hard currency in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Without it, Haitian economists and central bank officials say, the country's dire financial straits would be far worse.
The Mayor of Tiburon, Adrien Jeanty, said: "Tiburon is a place that has been and continues to be ignored by the central Government. Without the help of the diaspora, I don't know where we would be. They do almost everything."
Still, many in the Haitian diaspora -- particularly those in the United States, where roughly one million Haitians live -- express a deep sense of rejection by the same people they are helping. They say they are constantly reminded that their contributions, however welcome, are largely insignificant. And they say their loyalty to Haiti has come under attack because they are seen as having carved out a comfortable life style overseas, far from the dust-filled cities of their homeland, with their constant power shortages and poor telephone lines.
So when a group of Haitian mayors met to discuss economic development with roughly 40 Haitian-American business and regional leaders -- about a dozen from New York -- in the southern coastal city of Jacmel for three days in late April, the Americans grumbled over and over that the country did not appreciate their contributions.
Organizers held the meeting in Jacmel, a picturesque city whose streets are lined with gingerbread colonial-era homes, in part to coincide with the celebration of its 300th anniversary.
The meeting, the first of its kind, was held outdoors at a large beachfront restaurant, and was significant in bringing together the mayors, private-business owners and potential investors from overseas.
Organizers said that one of the meeting's goals was to help bolster the power of the elected mayors, whose positions have been rendered largely ceremonial because officials in the capital make important decisions without consulting them. Economic alliances with Haitians living abroad, they said, would give the mayors the financial clout to direct aid to their municipalities as they saw fit. Such arrangements would allow organizations like Mr. Martial's to build not only schools but also factories.
Indeed, several mayors brought proposals for projects like restoring maritime ports and building food-processing plants that would not only help meet the domestic need for food, but begin exporting it, particularly tropical goods like mangoes and avocados. Many of the Americans present said they welcomed the proposals.
"What is most important is for us to provide the diaspora a structure to work within," said Gary Mazile, the mayor of Miragoane, a city about 40 miles west of Jacmel. "People can say all they want about them, but they are our best and brightest. Furthermore, because of their strength, they won't accept the perverse exploitation that exists right now."
But other Haitians have a less favorable view of the Haitian-Americans' largess. The stream of cash from the United States, they say, has created a welfare state in which millions of people simply wait for their relatives abroad to wire money. They argue that the money, which could go toward building factories and other job-creating enterprises, is largely squandered. And at times, they add, the Haitian diaspora tends to be condescending and patronizing, acting like foreigners insensitive to the realities of the country.
"The diaspora does care about the people here," said Danielle St. Lot, who organized the meeting. "But they tend to be emotional. They land at the airport and immediately they start handing out money left and right."
Haitians living abroad say that such comments miss the point and at the same time intensify the psychological wounds in a group that has always felt a sense of guilt over the country's pitiful condition. The immigrants, many of them members of the middle class, chose to move away rather than stay to fight the brutal 29-year rule of Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier, which ended in 1986. It is a fact that many in Haiti are quick to remind them of.
"I hate being called diaspora," said Stanley Barbot, co-host of "Moment Creole" on WLIB-AM, one of the most popular shows in New York. "Because in most circles it is a put-down. It means a lower class of people."
Mr. Barbot and others attending the meeting said that Haitians treated them with the same coldness that Africans often reserve for American-born blacks who flock there for spiritual and cultural connection. Their ties, unlike those of black Americans, are not purely visceral, Haitian-Americans said. "Their attitude is, give us your money and go back home," Mr. Barbot said.
"The absurd part about it is, they know we're not that dumb and they know that the country cannot move forward without us," he said.
Frantz Verella, a former World Bank official and a professor of economics at the State University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince, conceded Mr. Barbot's point.
"If we're able to convince the Haitians overseas that they should invest here, we will create an important synergy," he said. "It will bring a big boost to the Haitian economy. We have one of the largest diaspora in the Caribbean. The possibilities are endless."
But Mr. Verella, a former Minister of Public Works, said that the fundamental question remained: whether Haitians living overseas had the patience and the will to uproot a small clique of businessmen who have monopolized just about every enterprise in the country.
The central Government, while pledging its support to privatize moribund state enterprises and decentralize its bureaucracy in the provinces outside Port-au-Prince, has taken few concrete steps in those directions.
"The democratic process is elitist," Mr. Verella said. "It is being played out in small circles. What the Haitians living abroad can do is to widen that circle."

HEADLINE: For the Apollo, Audits and Anger;
A Landmark, in Eclipse, Faces Questions About Finances

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER and ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Almost two decades ago, Percy E. Sutton had a vision: he would buy the Apollo Theater, a spiritual home of African-American music whose doors had been shut, fix it up and put on shows like the ones he remembered from his youth, which featured stars like Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan.
Mr. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President who owns a chain of radio stations, did rebuild the Apollo in the 1980's. But the Harlem landmark lost money, and in 1992, he turned it over to a nonprofit foundation. 
 Now there are signs that the latest attempt to restore the Apollo may be falling short, too, even amid a strong commercial turnaround on 125th Street. Glass panes were broken on one side of the theater's marquee last week, and capital letters appeared in the middle of words, suggesting that the Apollo's strained budget does not permit an adequate supply of lower-case letters. The theater's terra cotta facade is pulling away from the brick on the building's west wall. Inside, the Apollo is dark most nights.
Last week, state officials sounded a loud alarm about the condition of the celebrated theater. They said they were withholding $750,000 in loans and grants to the Apollo Theater Foundation until serious questions about its finances had been answered. The foundation manages the theater for the state, which owns it.
The announcement unleashed a political furor. Members of Harlem's Democratic establishment accused Republicans in Albany and City Hall of a political cheap shot. The Rev. Al Sharpton called for a community hearing tomorrow to allow Mr. Sutton and others to present information about the theater's finances.
City and state officials spoke ominously about mismanagement and a lack of financial oversight of the Apollo, and they linked its difficulties to the troubled history of other state economic development projects in Harlem over the past 25 years. Audits were ordered and investigations started.
But in the end, the tumult will come down to two questions: Did Mr. Sutton shortchange the nonprofit foundation to which he had entrusted the Apollo, or are his critics relying on a strange reading of the contract that transferred the Apollo to the foundation?
Six years ago, when Mr. Sutton handed over the Apollo to the foundation and nearly $12 million in loans to him from the state and a commercial bank were forgiven, he kept control of his syndicated television show, "It's Showtime at the Apollo." He obtained a five-year licensing agreement, in which his company, the Inner City Theater Group, agreed to pay the foundation for use of the Apollo and its name. The fee was set at $2,000 per taping or 25 percent of the show's profits, whichever was greater.
State officials said Mr. Sutton may have significantly underpaid the foundation. Randy Daniels, a senior vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that owns the Apollo, said the foundation's executives told its board of directors a few months ago that Mr. Sutton owed $3 million under the contract. When the board pressed for payment, it received only $145,000, Mr. Daniels said.
State officials questioned whether the foundation's board -- whose chairman is Mr. Sutton's close friend, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel -- had properly enforced the agreement. "What it really comes down to: Is this foundation capable of being the steward of this national landmark?" Mr. Daniels said. "It's losing money, it's in bad shape and it's failing to collect money that it's apparently due. Now, why is that?"
But Mr. Sutton and Mr. Rangel insisted that the foundation had received everything it was owed. "They're trying to say that, because I am close with Percy Sutton, that there was a sweetheart deal," Mr. Rangel said. "There is no one closer to me, but we've never discussed the contract."
Mr. Sutton, having exhausted considerable capital and energy in trying to save the Apollo for more than a decade, feels aggrieved to find himself accused of having underpaid the theater foundation. "At this time in my life, when I am 77 years old and I have never had any scandal attached to me, to have some stupid political thing," Mr. Sutton said. "The real problem is a misunderstanding on how television syndication works."
During a lengthy interview yesterday, Mr. Sutton said that the show, now in its 10th year, began to make a profit only two years ago. He brought documents to back up his assertions.
The show's combined revenues over the last five years have been about $26 million, according to Mr. Sutton's records. But the first time it showed a profit, $174,222, was in the 1995-1996 season, the records show. The following year, the profit was about $1 million. Mr. Sutton said the profits are split between his company and a syndicator in Los Angeles.
The definition of what constitutes a profit appears to be at the core of the dispute. Page 12 of the contract says that Mr. Sutton's company was required to pay $2,000 per taping or 25 percent of "annual net profits." But on the following page, net profit is defined in a sweeping and highly unusual way, essentially as gross revenues. Profits are usually defined as what is left after expenditures are subtracted from revenues.
Executives of the Apollo Theater Foundation, who would not discuss the contract with reporters, apparently relied on the unusual definition to conclude that Mr. Sutton owed them millions of dollars.
Despite the wording, Mr. Sutton contends that the contract's definition of net profits misstates both industry practice for television and the real intent of the agreement. It was meant to apply only to records, compact disks and other recordings from the Apollo, he said, not to the television show.
"This, sir, is about politics and power," he said. "There is a lady up there who is a good Republican, who they've hired as the executive director. This lady who was to have done so very much, what she has done is to identify with the Republicans who have taken over."
Mr. Sutton was referring to Grace Blake, a veteran film executive who is the Apollo Theater Foundation's executive director. Late last year, as the five-year contract with Mr. Sutton was expiring, Ms. Blake hired a law firm to review the contract and to recommend whether the Apollo's licensing agreement should be put out to bid to other companies. It was apparently in that context that questions about Mr. Sutton's payments were first raised.
Ms. Blake declined to discuss the dispute. "I'm very fond of Mr. Sutton, but I will only respond after publication of the story," she said. "I feel like I'm in the middle of a political struggle. I don't know who is doing what to whom, and I am not interested."
It will likely require teams of auditors to resolve the matter. The Empire State Development Corporation told the Apollo foundation to submit complete financial records by May 19. Dennis C. Vacco, the State Attorney General, has begun a preliminary investigation of the theater's finances. Mr. Rangel and the foundation's board voted last week to hire an accounting firm to comb through their books. Mr. Sutton said he planned to hire a major accounting firm to audit his company's records.
The sudden attention to the Apollo's finances is in sharp contrast to a lack of government oversight over the years. Neither the state development agency nor the State Comptroller's office has audited Mr. Sutton's management of the Apollo's renovation or his operation of the theater. An analysis of the Apollo in 1991 by the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand found that the theater's expenses were within industry norms, but that the operation could not expect to be profitable: the Apollo was too small and its debt too high.
The theater has fewer than 1,500 seats, and since it reopened in the mid-1980's it has seldom managed to attract major stars. Despite various attempts to book the theater creatively, from blues revivals to 1960's singing groups to boxing, the Apollo is in use only sporadically.
The Apollo was in some ways a victim of racial integration. In the 1940's and 1950's, many black entertainers could appear only at the Apollo when they came to New York. Now, they are more likely to be featured at Radio City Music Hall or Madison Square Garden -- and for considerably higher fees.
"The civil rights movement that I went to jail in was the same civil rights movement that killed the Apollo," Mr. Sutton said. "We thought all the people who had started there and gone on to success would come back. But they didn't."
Mr. Sutton was well aware of the Apollo's limitations when he decided to bring it back to life in the early 1980's. His dream was to create a network of cable franchises in major American cities and to broadcast concerts from the Apollo over his cable systems. But he was able to buy only one cable franchise.
"The Apollo was a miscalculation for me," he said. "I really thought that people would use it, that people would come back. I was stupid. I thought I could do that."

HEADLINE: Governor's Budget Vetoes Imperil Legal Aid Programs

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 7

 BODY:
A legal aid office in Buffalo opens its doors at 9 A.M. and closes by 9:45, overwhelmed by requests for free advice. A similar program in Elmira cut its employees' pay last year to avoid curtailing services. And in New York City, legal aid programs can serve fewer than half of the tens of thousands of people who seek their help.
Lawyers for the poor say the situation is about to get substantially worse, because Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed about $12 million in financing for legal aid programs around the state last month as part of $1.6 billion in budget cuts. The cuts will force legal aid programs to close offices, eliminate jobs and reduce services in almost every county at a time when poor people need more help than ever navigating welfare, housing, health care and immigration laws, lawyers for the poor say. 
 "We are the last place people go when they have nowhere else to turn to avoid eviction, escape domestic violence or receive the health benefits they are entitled to," said Anne Erickson, legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project, which oversees most of the state's legal aid programs and lost $343,000 as a result of Mr. Pataki's vetoes. "The Governor is creating a system of unequal justice if he takes these services away."
The cuts will also make it more difficult for private lawyers to take on pro bono cases, because many of those lawyers depend on legal aid programs for help understanding complicated laws affecting the poor, Ms. Erickson said.
The Pataki administration has repeatedly pointed out that even after the vetoes, the budget is 6.9 percent higher than last year's, with substantial increases for education in particular. And Mr. Pataki, a Republican who is running for re-election, has indicated he might restore some of the 1,000 spending items he vetoed. But legislative leaders have said they may not pressure the Governor to do so, so they can blame him during his upcoming campaign for the impact of the cuts.
Even if Mr. Pataki does restore certain cuts, some legislators say, the legal aid money is not likely to be among them because poor people are not nearly as vocal a constituency as teachers, environmental groups and others hurt by the vetoes.
State law requires lawyers to turn over the interest earned on escrow accounts they hold for clients to the state, which must spend most of it on civil legal services for the poor. Mr. Pataki included about $15 million from the fund in his original budget proposal, but the Legislature added another $12 million in its own proposal. The Legislature has added money every year since 1993, when interest rates dropped and the fund was not providing nearly enough money for legal services.
The fund still does not provide as much as it did in the early 1990's because of higher banking fees, said Steven Banks, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society of New York City, which handles 30,000 civil cases a year and is losing almost $1.9 million under the vetoes. Federal aid to legal services has dropped, too, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to cut New York City's contribution to the Legal Aid Society and another program, Legal Services for New York City.
"We've already been hit pretty hard," Mr. Banks said. "The state money is literally the lifeline to keep our offices running and our clients served."
Of the $12 million Mr. Pataki vetoed for legal aid programs, $4.8 million was for Prisoners' Legal Services, a nonprofit group that provides free legal help to inmates at state prisons. David C. Leven, the group's executive director, said the program depends almost entirely on state aid and will have to shut down if the veto stands. The veto comes as Mr. Pataki is also reducing state aid for prison education programs, he added.
"We cannot survive without this funding," Mr. Leven said. "And without any other outlet for inmates to channel their legitimate complaints, there could be some serious problems in the prison system."
Mr. Leven said that Prisoners' Legal Services actually saves the state money by weeding out hundreds of frivolous lawsuits each year. Most of the cases that go to court involve abuse of prisoners by guards, inadequate medical care for prisoners and questionable disciplinary practices, he said.
But State Senator Michael F. Nozzolio, a Republican from Seneca Falls who heads the Senate Crime and Corrections Committee, said taxpayers should not be paying prisoners' legal fees. Inmates should depend on the law libraries in prisons, or on law students who volunteer to help them, Mr. Nozzolio said.
"Prisoners' Legal Services is a law firm funded by the taxpayers, designed to sue the taxpayers," he said. "I went to law school and frankly, the law library at Auburn Correctional Facility is just as good as the one I had at my law school. Let the prisoners use that."
As for other legal aid programs, Mr. Nozzolio said the state should collect fees from bar associations and corporate law firms to pay for the services. "They are important, but taxpayers shouldn't have to support them," he said. "I represent a lot of working poor in my district, and those folks don't qualify for legal aid. But in effect, they're paying for these law firms with their tax dollars."
Lawyers for the poor say corporate law firms, which have powerful lobbyists in Albany, would thwart any legislative attempt to impose a fee. Instead, they say, New York should pay for legal aid programs through court filing fees, as New Jersey and several other states do. The state collects about $215 million a year in court filing fees, most of which goes into its general operating fund, Ms. Erickson of the Greater Upstate Law Project said.
While Prisoners' Legal Services is the only program in danger of shutting down as a result of Mr. Pataki's vetoes, many other programs are planning reductions of staff and services that even in the least populous counties, will affect hundreds of clients, Ms. Erickson said. Legal Aid of Mid New York, which serves nine upstate counties, is planning to close one of its offices, she said. Chemung County Legal Services, which has offices in Elmira and Ithaca, will eliminate 2 of 10 staff positions, increasing caseloads to well over 300 per lawyer per year.
"The people who will be hurt by these cuts have enormous needs affecting the fundamentals of their lives: shelter, food, family," said Joseph Genova, chairman of the Committee on Access to Justice for the New York State Bar Association. "We would hope any restorations to the budget would be based on who has the gravest need, not who has the loudest voice and the best lobbyist in Albany."

HEADLINE: Dominican Drug Traffickers Tighten Grip on the Northeast

SERIES: LETHAL PARTNERS: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
Ricardo is a foot soldier in New York City's drug wars. He has sold thousands of bags of heroin, worn out countless beepers and become a familiar figure on the streets of Washington Heights and Harlem. Now, he and his Dominican-led gang have dramatically expanded their sales operations, moving well beyond upper Manhattan to deliver Colombian drugs in a territory from Maryland to Massachusetts.
In a recent interview on a park bench in Harlem, Ricardo took a break from his routine to describe the new vistas opening to New York's Dominican gangs. 
 "Not long ago Dominicans went no farther than Queens," said Ricardo, who spoke on condition that his surname not be used. "Now Dominicans go everywhere."
For two decades, Colombia's drug lords fiercely guarded almost every stage of their business, from the processing of coca base to the wholesale distribution of cocaine in the United States.
But over the last several years, they have found a new partner in the delivery and distribution of drugs to the East Coast.
While there are no hard statistics on the illegal trade, American law enforcement officials now estimate that Dominican drug traffickers transport as much as one-third of the approximately 300 metric tons of cocaine that enter the United States each year. Officials believe that the Dominicans' share has more than doubled since the early 1990's, and that the Dominicans' involvement in large-scale distribution has also grown sharply.
The emerging leaders of these organizations -- women as well as men -- speak English and Spanish interchangeably and may be as comfortable in a New York nightclub as in a Caribbean village.
Officials say they have camouflaged their operations beneath the legitimate businesses of thriving Dominican immigrants in the United States, taking advantage of the growing trade and financial dealings between the two coun
tries.
This shift in the multibillion-dollar drug trade has complicated American antidrug efforts, which for more than two decades have focused on dismantling highly sophisticated drug distribution networks run from Colombia.
Authorities from Maryland to Vermont find themselves struggling to locate their new adversaries in a sea of hard-working immigrants who have spread across the Northeast in search of a better future for their families.
"The Dominicans are our biggest threat," said George Festa, regional director of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New England. "We've seen things we've never seen before, one group dealing crack, cocaine and heroin. We see them making alliances across the board with everyone, including Chinese and Vietnamese groups. They are versatile."
Many Dominican-Americans have expressed concern that the well-publicized drug dealing by a tiny minority casts a shadow on a much larger group. More than a million Dominicans are estimated to live in the New York City metropolitan area.
"The largest drug operations cracked by the police involve, at most, a hundred people," said Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a Washington Heights social services agency. "These are small operations when you compare it to the size of the community."
Still, drug seizures around the Caribbean illustrate the changing international pattern of smuggling. In fiscal year 1997, the United States Customs Service in Florida, the main point of entry for drugs from the Caribbean, confiscated 14,000 pounds of cocaine, a 100 percent increase over fiscal year 1996.
In testimony before a Senate committee earlier this year, Thomas A. Constantine, the Drug Enforcement Administration administrator, said: "Criminals from the Dominican Republic have emerged as the dominant force in the wholesale cocaine and heroin trade on the East Coast. Their influence is now spreading beyond the big-city landscape into the smaller cities and towns."
Law enforcement officials say Dominican drug rings have appeared in every major city in New England, from Lowell, Mass., to Manchester, N.H. Documents seized from one ring recently broken up in Worcester, Mass., and wiretaps of phone conversations indicated that it had sent couriers to New York City an average of twice a week for more than two years with cash shipments as large as $80,000 for eventual wire transfers to the Dominican Republic.
In November, 14 members of another Dominican ring were caught establishing bases in apartments in Portland and Old Orchard Beach, Me.
Investigators who arrested them on trafficking charges expressed amazement at the breadth of their operation, noting that through a beeper operated by the suspects, 814 calls had been detected over a 30-day period from possible purchasers around Maine and wholesale suppliers in New York City.
Ricardo's northern Manhattan gang is typical. It once sold cocaine and heroin only to local buyers and small-time dealers who drove to New York City from upstate New York. But over time, Ricardo said, the head of his organization realized that he could increase profits by putting his people on buses and sending them as far north as Boston and as far south as Baltimore with drugs packed inside stuffed animals and resealed coffee cans. (Ricardo is of Puerto Rican origin; the leadership of the gang is reserved for Dominicans.)
As a recent classified Justice Department intelligence report put it: "The expansion of the Dominican distribution threat outward from New York City is especially noteworthy because most state and local authorities are not prepared to handle it. Over half of U.S. states have reported Dominican criminal activity, an indicator that the Dominican drug problem is beginning to assume a national perspective."
 
A Partnership Begins
Plenty of Drug Jobs For Needy Immigrants
 The drug trade involvement of Dominican immigrants, especially those in the United States illegally, goes back more than two decades.
The Dominican migration to New York City began to explode just as a broader range of Americans began to acquire a taste for cocaine in the early 1970's. As the drug flowed in ever-greater amounts from Colombia and as Dominican immigration waves to the United States far outstripped Colombian migrations, law enforcement officials say, Colombian cartel bosses hired the Dominicans, numerous and eager for work, as their couriers, street sellers and hit men.
When the crack epidemic boomed in the mid-1980's, Dominican street organizations based in Washington Heights took advantage of the expanding sales volumes and gradually began to do some wholesaling of their own. Like previous generations of ethnic organized-crime syndicates, they were flamboyant and violent and competed for turf, sometimes by shooting at one another out the windows of souped-up sports cars speeding up and down Broadway and the Grand Concourse in the South Bronx.
But the new generation of Dominican dealers has acquired stealth and sophistication in recent years, law enforcement officials say. They have learned to avoid police attention by tempering their violence and concealing their wealth.
Dominicans have also benefited by offering the Colombian drug lords a cheaper alternative to business partnerships with Mexican gangs. A Mexican-Colombian rivalry was created in the early 1990's when the Colombian cartels began paying Mexican drug gangs in cocaine, in part to avoid having to launder cash, and gave them as much as half of each load transported into the United States. The Mexican gangs began selling it directly themselves.
The Colombians have struck a less generous deal with their Dominican partners, paying in cash or with no more than 25 percent of the cocaine shipments, officials say. The Dominican gangs are much smaller than the Mexican cartels, and for the moment, the officials add, they are no threat to their Colombian partners.
Rene Antonio Aquino, a Dominican who is awaiting trial on drug charges in Hartford, was one of the pioneers in expanding the territory of Dominican gangs, according to Federal drug agents and Connecticut law enforcement officials.
Mr. Aquino, 34, fits the profile of the typical Dominican immigrant to New York City. He arrived as a teen-ager with his parents, learned English reasonably well and became an ardent Yankees fan. Although he never finished high school, he managed to buy a bodega named Diana's on Wilson Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and enjoyed a middle-class life complete with sports cars and a couple of rental houses in Queens.
But there was another side to Mr. Aquino. He was arrested on minor drug charges in 1989 and 1990, and Federal drug agency officials say he continued as a minor dealer, dodging the law by jumping bail and carrying false identification papers.
By the mid-1990's, the officials said, Mr. Aquino and a series of partners had considerably expanded their operations. They carved out a niche as heroin wholesalers, transporting the drug across upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to the officials.
The Connecticut Deputy Chief State's Attorney, Christopher L. Morano, said Mr. Aquino and his partners dispatched runners to Colombia to buy heroin, which was ferried by plane and car to Caracas, Venezuela.
The drugs were carried into the United States by Dominican and Puerto Rican women who traveled to Caracas posing as tourists. After sunning themselves on the Venezuelan beaches at the organization's expense, the women would sew the heroin into the linings of their jackets and shoes for the trip back to New York.
From Kennedy International Airport, Mr. Morano said, the heroin was loaded into a fleet of cars honeycombed with secret compartments. It was bound for distribution not only in Hartford but in cities in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Massachusetts. According to informers recruited from its ranks, the organization would from time to time ship the cars back to the Dominican Republic, with the cash proceeds of drug sales hidden behind trapdoors, investigators said.
"Tony decided he could cut out the Colombian middlemen in New York and put more money in his pocket," said Michael Edelwich, a Hartford police detective who worked on the case.
Mr. Aquino is awaiting trial in Hartford on charges of racketeering, drug trafficking, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder. His indictment is sealed. John Tauger, his lawyer, denied that his client was involved in the case.
But Mr. Morano and Hartford police detectives say that in public housing projects there, Mr. Aquino's ring distributed bags of heroin stamped with several brand names, including "Gunfire" and "High Power." They said street dealers sold as many as 3,000 bags a day, sweeping through the projects four times weekly.
It took the Hartford police nearly two years to trace the origins of the heroin. As they began arresting the organization's runners in 1995, detectives said, they noticed an unusual pattern: Every suspect placed a call from the jail to Diana's bodega in Bushwick and asked to speak with a man called Uncle.
Using their informers, the detectives eventually identified Uncle as Mr. Aquino.
Today Mr. Aquino's bodega is shut tight, showing nothing more than a metal gate that serves as a canvas for graffiti.
At a recent bail hearing, he stood emotionless in an orange jumpsuit and spotless white sneakers. His short beard was neatly trimmed, and he held his hands loosely behind his back.
Hartford detectives said he had shown more emotion when they transported him to Connecticut after his arrest on Oct. 9 in Jackson Heights, Queens. In the police car then, he showed off pictures of his family and asked how the police had penetrated his organization.
"He'd squint, as if wondering, 'How did you do that?' " recalled Detective Robert Lawlor. "At the end of it all, he shook our hands."
 
A Network Spreads
Drug Trade Corrupts Legitimate Commerce
The expanding trade between the Dominican Republic and the United States has given rise to a host of new businesses. Moving goods routinely between the two countries, these companies offer drug traffickers a ready network to exploit, provided that the businesspeople involved can be coerced or persuaded to move a different type of product.
The experiences of Jose Rafael Knipping, a failed Dominican fruit canner, show how legitimate commerce can give way to illicit trade, Dominican law enforcement officials say.
Mr. Knipping had long hoped to penetrate the American market with fruit canned in his factory, Haina Agro-Industrial, outside Santo Domingo. But by late 1996 his debts were growing. So he placed an advertisement in the Spanish-language edition of The Miami Herald, offering to sell the company for $1.6 million, and waited for a response.
Dominican officials say they believe that the advertisement caught the eye of powerful Colombian traffickers who made Mr. Knipping an offer: Join the drug trade and save your business.
Mr. Knipping has denied that he was approached by Colombians. But he has told Dominican investigators that his partner was contacted by a Dominican living in New York who offered to buy the factory for about $1 million, on one condition. The prospective buyer asked Mr. Knipping's partner to ship several hundred pounds of jellies, sweets and juices to warehouses in upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
Soon after the request was made, the Colombians shipped cocaine by high-speed motorboats to the Dominican Republic, where it was repackaged at Mr. Knipping's factory into cans of guava pulp, Dominican investigators say. Mr. Knipping has denied any knowledge of this operation.
Then, in March 1997, United States Customs Service agents working in the Port of Newark inspected a shipment of 950 cans of guava pulp. Twenty-six of the cans were suspiciously separated from the others by string and bore serial numbers that ended in 2222.
When the agents opened the cans, they found 253 pounds of cocaine worth more than $2 million, according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. They replaced the cocaine-filled cans with others bearing identical markings, and New York City police detectives followed the shipment when it left the dock. They watched with hidden cameras as the cans were unloaded at a Dominican-owned food distribution warehouse on West 220th Street.
Four Dominicans -- three city residents and one businessman from the island who had learned his English as an exchange university sociologist years ago -- picked up the cans and were arrested as they drove with the illegal shipment down Broadway in a black Ford van. All have been convicted on drug charges and are awaiting sentencing.
Mr. Knipping, who was in New York at the time of the shipment, fled the United States but was arrested in Santo Domingo. He has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges and is awaiting trial there.
The criminal complaint against him alleges that the cocaine shipment was arranged by Orsi Tineo, the prospective purchaser of the factory. Mr. Tineo, one of those arrested in New York transporting the guava pulp, has pleaded guilty to trafficking charges. But Dominican investigators say this small-time drug dealer, who works as a Manhattan apartment painter, did not have the $1 million to buy Mr. Knipping's factory.
Adm. Julio Cesar Ventura Bayonet, inspector general of the Dominican armed forces, supervised the investigation of Haina Agro-Industrial. He said it is likely that Mr. Tineo or one of his associates was actually an agent of bigger Colombian traffickers, who "just love to snap up failing factories and companies" in the Dominican Republic.
Mr. Tineo's lawyer, David Wickstrom, denied that his client was a front for the Colombians but acknowledged that Mr. Tineo did not have the means to buy a factory.
 
A Market Develops
Money Transfer Outfits Help Launder Profits
 All drug traders face the same difficulty. Sales of illicit substances produce mountains of cash, which must be laundered, some way or another, into the legitimate economy. Dominican drug dealers have several means of moving money back to their homeland. Many Dominican residents of the United States and Dominican-Americans return home several times a year, offering a perfect camouflage if they agree to tape wads of cash onto their bodies. They also mail home millions of dollars in checks and money orders, which could be used as a cover.
The money is just as likely to move through one of the scores of money transfer establishments that have cropped up across the East Coast in recent years, law enforcement officials say.
One of these companies, Remesas America Oriental, was one of the fastest-growing Dominican businesses in the country -- until the arrests and convictions last year of more than 20 of its employees in New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Florida and Puerto Rico. They were convicted of laundering more than $800,000 in a series of transactions orchestrated by Customs agents in a sting operation. In 1996 alone, the Treasury Department said, the company handled most of the transfers from New York to the Dominican Republic, $130 million, or almost 24 percent of the total.
A Federal complaint filed in Manhattan last year offered a road map of how Dominican drug gangs laundered their proceeds.
In one August 1994 transaction, for example, an informer went to a Remesas branch on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx and met with Ramon Corporan and Giselle Moya, both managers, to transmit $40,000 to the Dominican Republic.
To make clear that he was in the drug business, the informer, according to the complaint, "advised Corporan that Hartford was a good city to open a money-transmitting business because there was a substantial quantity of Dominicans selling drugs in the vicinity of Main Street."
The employees agreed to handle the transaction, the complaint charges, and a week later two undercover Customs agents posing as recipients of cash went to an office of Consorcio Oriental, Remesas' parent company, in Santo Domingo, where they received the $40,000.
According to the complaint, "The Customs agents were given receipts, which reflected that the cash had been transmitted over a period of six days in eight transactions, each under $10,000." This is important because American law requires banks and other institutions to report all transfers of more than $10,000. "The sender and recipient names on each of the eight receipts were fictitious," the document read.
Back in Santo Domingo, Roberto Lopez, an owner of Consorcio Oriental, was recently doing some paperwork in his office off the parking lot of a hotel. His secretary offered a guest coffee or juice, adding tartly, "We don't poison."
In an interview, Mr. Lopez expressed shock about the bad fortune that had befallen his American operations and blamed his top manager in the United States for the criminal case. "Corporan had worked seven years for Banco de Ponce," Mr. Lopez said. "He's an American citizen. He speaks perfect English. Who could have guessed that he would do such a thing?"
The Customs Service estimates that New York City transfer establishments sent at least $500 million to the Dominican Republic in 1996 and again in 1997, double the amount sent in 1993. Senior agents in New York estimate that one-fifth of the wire transfers come from the proceeds of drug transactions, "and that's very conservative," said John F. Forbes, a Customs investigator.
For the last six months, the Treasury Department required 15 of the largest companies transferring money to the Dominican Republic to report all transactions larger than $750, well below the $10,000 threshold set by Federal law. The move had an immediate effect. In the last four months of 1997, the total value of transfers of $749 or less rose by more than $24 million, to $104.6 million, Treasury Department officials said. Transactions of $750 to $3,000 -- which were now being reported to Federal authorities -- fell by nearly two-thirds, the officials said.
As Mr. Forbes said: "The money laundering is definitely going up as Dominican immigration goes up and the interaction between the Colombians and Dominicans goes up. And New York is ground zero."

HEADLINE: Marjorie Lansing, 82, Scholar On Men's and Women's Votes

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Marjorie Lansing, a political scientist and sometime politician whose scholarly delineation of a gender gap in American voting patterns helped change the shape of political campaigns and spurred women into politics in the 1980's, died on May 1 at a hospital near her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. She was 82 and had been a professor of political science at Eastern Michigan University.
Her family said the cause was cancer. 
 Though Dr. Lansing was not the first to investigate women's voting patterns, the issue received little serious attention until she published the first persuasive statistical evidence that women form a distinctive voting bloc.
The dominant view had been that if women did not mimic their husbands' voting patterns, their attitudes at least reflected the same mix of socioeconomic and ethnic factors, among others.
If it seems surprising that those quaint views survived into the 1970's, it must be at least partly because Dr. Lansing came late to scholarship.
A native of Geneva, Fla., Dr. Lansing, who was born Marjorie Tillis, graduated from the old Florida State College for Women in Gainesville, taught high school in Sanford, Fla., and made a life-changing trip to Europe.
Attracted to the political left since college, she raised money for the Spanish loyalist cause from fellow passengers on the voyage over, and after a heady tour of the continent returned to the United States eager to attend graduate school.
After receiving a master's in sociology from Columbia in 1940, she worked as a Government researcher in Washington and met and married a young economist named John Lansing. She set up housekeeping in Cambridge, Mass., while he completed his doctorate at Harvard and she plunged into the local leftist political scene, campaigning for Henry Wallace in the 1948 Presidential race.
A high-spirited woman with an engaging manner, Dr. Lansing made a powerful impact on at least one political associate. According to family legend, after a single political meeting in Boston, the actor Zero Mostel was so taken with Dr. Lansing that he followed her to a bus stop, pretended he was her abandoned husband and in an impromptu performance worthy of the Broadway stage made an impassioned plea that she return to him and their babies.
In 1949 the Lansings moved to Ann Arbor, where he became a professor of economics at the University of Michigan and she became active in the Democratic Party while rearing three children, studying for a Ph.D. in political science at Michigan and teaching at Eastern Michigan.
She is survived by two sons, Steve, of Ann Arbor, and Philip, of Boise, Idaho; a daughter, Carol, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and six grandchildren.
By the time she obtained her doctorate in 1970, Dr. Lansing had come up with the findings that would make her reputation in feminist political circles. But it had taken some doing. When she proposed as a doctoral dissertation a study that she expected would establish that women's voting patterns were significantly different from men's, her professors were so convinced there was no difference that they tried to discourage her.
She persisted, and the dissertation she turned in was essentially the same book she and a statistician, Sandra Baxter, published in 1980.
One reason for the delay between the dissertation and the book was that after her husband died in 1970, she concentrated on her teaching at Eastern Michigan while stepping up her political activities, unsuccessfully running for several offices, including a House seat.
She fared better as a scholar, analyzing a variety of political opinion and exit polls to establish that women's voting patterns were different from men's and that the differences were statistically significant.
To those who had assumed that women followed men's voting patterns, her most surprising finding was that the greatest sex difference was not on home-and-hearth issues like the economy and education but in foreign affairs, particularly military issues, with women being distinctly less hawkish than men.
Although dozens of similar studies have since been published, Dr. Lansing's work is still cited by scholars.
It is a measure of Dr. Lansing's prescience, if not of her influence, that three years after her landmark study, "Women in Politics: The Invisible Majority," was published by the University of Michigan Press, a revised edition carried the subtitle, "The Visible Majority."

HEADLINE: A Cold Fact: High Stress Can Make You Sick

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
EXPLANATIONS of why people catch colds are almost as numerous as the viruses that cause colds. They range from the environmental -- living with small children, riding the subway at rush hour, getting chilled to the bone -- to the personal -- smoking too much, exercising too little, sleeping poorly, eating erratically, working too hard.
But studies under way at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh suggest that psychological stress is also a very important factor in determining who gets sick when nasal passages are invaded by a cold-causing virus. Just any old stress will not do. It has to be long-term stress, lasting at least a month and stemming from a significant problem like being fired from a job after years of service or being left financially or emotionally bereft by a divorce. The researchers point out that stress is not the cause of all colds. Rather, people under severe stress are more likely to catch cold when exposed to a virus than people under milder stress. 
 Dr. Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at the university, has spent years trying to discover why some people frequently catch colds, while others rarely get a sniffle. In 1991, he directed a study of 394 men and women that identified psychological stress as an important factor in colds.
He and co-workers in Britain showed that the higher a person's stress score on a standard test, the more likely the person was to develop a cold when exposed to a cold virus. Stress was an important risk factor even when smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet, disturbed sleep and alcohol consumption were taken into account.
In the current studies, financed by the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr. Cohen and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center subjected 276 healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55 to physical, social and psychological examinations before placing them in quarantine and depositing cold viruses in their nasal passages. On each of the next five days, volunteers, paid $800 each, were examined to determine who became infected by the virus and who then developed symptoms of a cold.
Last June in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the team reported that the volunteers with the most ties to relatives, friends and community were the least likely to catch a cold. The relationship between having many social connections and being relatively immune to colds held even though cold viruses spread easily among people.
Although this finding would seem counterintuitive, Dr. Cohen said that other researchers also have found that "having many different kinds of social relationships helps to protect against disease." The message from this study: "Be involved and participate in your community" to increase your chances of staying healthy, Dr. Cohen said.
The newest findings, published in the May issue of Health Psychology, a journal of the American Psychological Association, confirmed the earlier study showing a strong link between susceptibility to colds and stress. But this time Dr. Cohen sought to determine the kinds of stress involved and how they might affect resistance to colds. The study showed that only chronic stress, lasting a month or more, affected the risk of catching a cold and that two causes of stress -- being unemployed or underemployed, or having interpersonal difficulties with relatives or friends -- had the greatest influence on risk.
Being under severe stress for more than one month but less than six months doubled a person's risk of a cold, compared with people experiencing only routine stress. Stress lasting more than two years nearly quadrupled the risk. Likewise, the stress of interpersonal difficulties doubled the risk of a cold, and being under work-related stress raised the risk 3 1/2 times. However, less common stresses had no effect on participants' chances of developing a cold.
Even being socially well-connected, which could provide emotional support during hard times, could not overcome the harmful effects of chronic severe stress, the researchers reported.
But when Dr. Cohen and colleagues looked for a biological explanation, they were surprised to find that increases in the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine could not account for the strong relationship between stress and colds. Similarly, blood levels of natural killer cells, which constantly search the body for abnormal cells and wipe them out, were affected very little.
So now, Dr. Cohen and researchers are looking at substances called cytokines that have an indirect effect on tissues that are being invaded. Cytokines are messenger chemicals of the immune system that travel through the blood and send out an inflammatory alarm when cellular abnormalities are discovered. The alarm marshals macrophages and other reinforcements to battle the invader. This response of the body to a viral infection, not the virus itself, causes the sneezes, congestion, runny nose and other cold symptoms.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Graph: "Stress and the Cold"
Chronic stress lasting a month or more affects the risk of catching a cold, researchers reported. In addition, stress based on being unemployed or underemployed or having problems with family or friends has the greatest influence in determining which people catch colds.
The baseline of 1.0 is the factor assigned to colds contracted by those who experience routine but not chronic stress.

HEADLINE: Scientist at Work: Edward O. Wilson;
From Ants to Ethics: A Biologist Dreams Of Unity of Knowledge

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
LAID out on a desk in Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology is a neat array of white-sided boxes, each with pinned specimens of ants belonging to the genus Pheidole. Dr. Edward O. Wilson is writing a monograph on the genus, which is the world's largest. There are 326 new species, many of which he discovered himself, and each is in need of a precise description and a scientific name. The work is pure taxonomy, "scientific knitting," he calls it. The ants, little black specks mounted on white triangles of cardboard, seem perfectly indistinguishable. But under the microscope each species looks as different as a bear does from a tiger, Dr. Wilson assures a visitor.
The "knitting" is no doubt mental relaxation from the soaring works of synthesis that are Dr. Wilson's other passion. Or maybe both are the products, on different scales, of a mind that loves to classify and discover patterns in the world's unruly substance. 
 In an alternative fate, Dr. Wilson might have been an obscure expert on the ants of Alabama, his home state. But at each stage of his career he has looked outward, trying to see how the scholarly patch he had cultivated might fit into some larger scheme of things. And because so few scholars dare to explore beyond the boundaries of their own narrow fields, Dr. Wilson has produced an original work of synthesis time after time.
His first foray outside the ant microcosm was "The Insect Societies," published in 1971, which surveyed the evolution of sociality among wasps, ants, bees and termites. It seemed only logical to extend the synthesis to vertebrates, humans included, though no one else had attempted so obvious a task. "Sociobiology" appeared in 1975, immediately falling under political attack from left-wing colleagues who objected to the idea that certain human behaviors might have genetic determinants.
"He was taken to task in an unfair way," says Thomas Eisner, a Cornell University biologist and longtime friend, "but his ideas are not arrived at lightly." The ideas of sociobiology were many years in the making, Dr. Eisner says.
Dr. Wilson was blindsided and bruised by the attack but undeterred. He expanded his ideas about the mind's genetic history in "On Human Nature," which appeared in 1978. Then he turned to other matters, like writing a comprehensive survey of ants with his colleague Bert Holldobler and becoming a champion for the world's disappearing rain forests.
Twenty years later, Dr. Wilson has returned to the theme of genes and human nature. His new work of synthesis is called, a little forbiddingly, "Consilience," a word coined by the 19th century philosopher of science William Whewell to mean the melding of inferences drawn from separate subjects. Dr. Wilson has resurrected it as the slogan for a program of unrivaled ambition: to unify all the major branches of knowledge -- sociology, economics, the arts and religion -- under the banner of science and in particular of the biology that has shaped the human mind.
The kind of unification he proposes is the outright intellectual annexation that occurs when one field of knowledge becomes explainable in terms of a more fundamental discipline, as when thermodynamics (heat processes) was explained in terms of statistical mechanics (equations describing the movement of molecules). These putsches, which always constitute major advances yet are usually not much welcomed by scholars in the discipline being taken over, are termed "reductions" by philosophers of science.
How can economics, not to mention religion and esthetics, be reduced to molecular biology? Dr. Wilson believes this will come about as biologists work out the behavioral rules that evolution has built into the brain. These rules, the sum of which is human nature, define the framework in which economic, religious and esthetic decisions are made and so should, he says, be made fundamental to those branches of study.
Dr. Wilson is well aware that people do not always warm to the idea of having their higher cognitive functions explained in terms of genetic programming. But he can see the revolution coming, the vanguard being led by the new approach to the brain called evolutionary psychology (another name for sociobiology, in his view).
Karl Marx, Dr. Wilson once joked when talking about ants, was correct: he just applied his theory to the wrong species. Ant societies, of course, are very different from the biped variety, but one common feature is the inherited nature of social behavior. Like any other feature of an organism, behavior can be shaped by evolution. Ants have evolved quite elaborate behaviors, but most are rigidly determined. Human behaviors have also evolved for the purpose of survival. But unlike the programmed instincts of ants, these behaviors, Dr. Wilson believes, are governed by what he calls epigenetic rules, genetically based neural wiring that merely predisposes the brain to favor certain types of action.
In the case of the universal taboo against incest, for instance, Dr. Wilson suggests there is an epigenetic rule that makes people instinctively averse to marrying those whom they knew intimately in childhood.
There are doubtless many other "instinctual algorithms" that guide humans, like other animals, through their life cycle, he says. Altruism, patriotism, status-seeking, territorial expansion and contract formation are among the many behaviors that Dr. Wilson believes are guided by epigenetic rules. "The search for human nature," he writes, "can be viewed as the archeology of the epigenetic rules."
If the essence of human nature is sketched out by the genes, it follows that the major branches of knowledge -- sociology, economics, ethics and theology -- are shaped by the mind's genetic framework and rest on a foundation of epigenetic rules. The unified tree of knowledge, as envisaged in "Consilience," has physics at its root, leading to a trunk of chemistry, molecular biology and genetics, and everything else as its branches.
Dr. Wilson criticizes anthropologists and social scientists for having boxed themselves into ideological positions that deny any role for biologically based human nature. He faults economists for "closing off their theory from serious biology and psychology." Hence economics is "still mostly irrelevant" and the esteem that economists enjoy "arises not so much from their record of success as from the fact that business and government have nowhere else to turn."
Ethicists, too, he says, have slipped into the fallacy of ignoring biological origins, in their case the origins of the moral instincts that govern human behavior. Religion, in Dr. Wilson's view, also has epigenetic roots; it evolved from the human equivalent of animals' submissive behavior, and because belief in the supernatural conferred a survival value. Dr. Wilson realizes that he would not now win many votes for this proposition. "The human mind evolved to believe in the gods," he writes. "It did not evolve to believe in biology."
Darwinism is still an affront to many established ways of thought, and "Consilience," published by Knopf, is not a conciliatory book. It contains enough to disconcert almost everyone. The vigor and aggressiveness of its judgments contrast with the elegance of the writing and the mild and courteous nature of its author. Edward O. Wilson, who is 68, grew up imbued with a respect for social order and civility, but in the course of overcoming personal handicaps and a difficult childhood he acquired an independent mind. "Ed, don't stay on trails when you collect insects," an adviser told him at the outset of his career: "You should walk in a straight line through the forest. Try to go over any barrier you meet. It's hard, but that's the best way to collect."
A straight line to faraway peaks has been Dr. Wilson's path ever since. "I set goals which are usually rather distant and hard to get to, like pointing toward higher mountains," he says. "And I organize my life around that goal."
Much of his life has been devoted to self-imposed endurance tests. At the private school he attended, the Gulf Coast Military Academy, he was drilled in the virtues of hard work and punishingly high standards. In street fights as a boy, he would never quit, obedient to the Academy's ethos, and still bears the scars of his opponents' fists. He learned to turn handicaps to advantage. In his autobiography, "Naturalist," he describes how the loss of vision in his right eye, stuck by a fish spine, and the loss of hearing for high notes made it hard for him to spot birds. He took up study of insects, which he could still see clearly.
The loss of sight also caused him to be turned down by the Army, a bitter rejection given the respect for military institutions in Southern life. As a boy he was highly religious, reading the Bible twice from cover to cover and being born again as a Southern Baptist. "At my core I am a social conservative, a loyalist," he writes. "I cherish traditional institutions, the more venerable and ritual-laden the better."
A workaholic nature gave Dr. Wilson the impetus to push his quest for scientific truth from one frontier to another. And from some source, perhaps his strong roots in the South and in the cadences of the sermon or the Scripture, he acquired a talent that set him apart from most other scientists -- an outstanding gift for language. Two of his books, "On Human Nature" and "The Ants," a specialist monograph written with Holldobler, have won Pulitzer Prizes.
Drawn to Harvard by its magnificent ant collection, Dr. Wilson found his outlook and his respect for civility at odds with the "often hard-edged, badly socialized scientists with whom I associate." The Harvard biology department was a battlefield during the 1960's and 1970's between the new breed of molecular biologists and traditionalists who studied whole animals. The molecular biologists, in Dr. Wilson's view, included some of the least socialized of the breed.
Of course it is the molecular biologists' annexationist credo, that nothing in biology makes sense until explained in terms of molecular biology, that Dr. Wilson is seeking to apply to the rest of knowledge. Social scientists and anthropologists are likely to resist the takeover proposed in "Consilience" as strongly as Dr. Wilson and his colleagues asserted their own discipline's integrity against the molecular biologists.
Dr. Wilson has few expectations of instant victory. Noting that defenders of an orthodoxy rarely accept a new idea on its merits, he quotes a remark by the economist Paul Samuelson that knowledge advances "funeral by funeral."
"I don't want to sound Marxist and say it is inevitable," Dr. Wilson says, but he believes that the unification of knowledge will be achieved by a younger generation of scientists who see the opportunities. "By assistant professors, I'm not talking about full professors at Harvard," he says, laughing at the thought of any ray of enlightenment from such a source.
If human nature is shaped by genetic history, then the same techniques now being developed to cure genetic diseases will later be used to change the genes that legislate the contours of the human mind. That capability will raise the question of human purpose in a practical sense: do we wish to change it or leave it as shaped by evolution? Dr. Wilson terms this impending quandary the phase of "volitional evolution."
The prospect, he writes in "Consilience," will present "the most profound intellectual and ethical choices humanity has ever faced . . . Our childhood having ended, we will hear the true voice of Mephistopheles." His answer is that human nature should be left as it is: "Neutralize the elements of human nature in favor of pure rationality, and the result would be badly constructed, protein-based computers."
The apparent imperfections in human nature, like adolescent violence, may spring from the same epigenetic rule that guides explorers and mountain-climbers, he suggests. Any attempt to change the apparent imperfections in human nature "would lead to the domestication of the human species -- we would turn ourselves into lapdogs," he says.
Does he have a new work of synthesis in mind? Dr. Wilson parries the question. He is working full time on his knitting, the monograph about the Pheidole genus of ants. "There is a very special pleasure in looking in a microscope and saying I am the first person to see a species that may be millions of years old," he says. "And there you see, somehow I am going to get out of this the answer to the question of why are some species so inordinately successful." Another synthesis seems to be brewing already.

HEADLINE: Punishing the Jobless

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Mickey Kaus's analogy (Op-Ed, May 5) between New York City's workfare and the Works Progress Administration is an ingenious maneuver, but it won't stand much scrutiny. The W.P.A. was premised on providing jobs with dignity. New York City insists that workfare recipients are not employees, lest they imagine they have any job-related rights. 
 The W.P.A. grew out of a vision of social solidarity and compassion; workfare is motivated primarily by a desire to trim the welfare rolls. The W.P.A. assumed that people wanted to work, while workfare assumes that welfare recipients don't want to work.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
G-7 Draft Picks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Well, it's that time again. This weekend the Group of Seven major industrial democracies, and Russia, gather in Britain for their annual gabfest about the world economy. And once again I offer my annual alternative G-7 -- the ones you would really invite if you were organizing a summit meeting of the world's seven most important economic actors today and you weren't stuck with Canada, France, Italy, Britain, Japan, Germany and the U.S.
Chair #1 this year would go to the world's leading expert for fixing the millennium computer bug -- whoever he or she is. After all, the G-7 was founded in 1975 to deal with the OPEC oil shock, and there is a high probability that the millennium bug -- a programming failure built into older microchips that renders them unable to recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999, and therefore susceptible to shutdown after that day -- will administer a similar economic shock. 
 "With the millennium bug, you may get your own computers adjusted in time, but what about the person or the company or the country your computers are connected with?" asked Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs. "The 1973 oil shock was produced by just a 5 percent cut in Arab oil output. If just 5 percent of the computers operating Russian nuclear plants or central banks in Latin America or airlines in Asia were to shut down, it could jolt the world economy just like the 1973 oil shock."
Chair #2 would be fought over by the billionaire oligarchs who dominate Russia's economy today, because they represent not only enormous wealth and power but the real alternative to democratic globalization. That is, the world is slowly dividing between free-market democracies and free-market kleptocracies (robber-baron states). Russia's robber barons have already ripped off many of Russia's assets and could take over the state. The Russian Mafia has used its gains to drive up real estate prices from Paris to Tel Aviv -- just one sign of the impact it could have on world affairs if its kleptocratic model triumphs in Moscow.
Chair #3 would be shared by China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji; Iran's President, Mohammed Khatami, and Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni. All three are potential Mikhail Gorbachevs. If they succeed in taking their respective economic liberalizations and turning them into political liberalizations -- moving their nations from rogues to rule-abiders -- it will have a huge impact on stability in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and East Africa.
Chair #4 would be occupied by a television set with a black box on the top. It's Web TV, recently bought by Microsoft, which, once it gets running, will popularize the Internet as never before. Because for the first time anyone with just a TV and a telephone line will be able to buy that black box for $99 and connect to the World Wide Web -- without needing a personal computer or learning Windows. From the remotest villages on earth, people will be able to send E-mail, participate in chat rooms or read great books. Web TV is the next wave of technology, which will be cheap information appliances that give you enormous connectivity. It will do for the Internet what the PC did for computing.
In chair #5 the Japanese Government would be officially disinvited and replaced by the "Keizai Doyukai," Japan's Association of Corporate Executives, which represents the younger, more outspoken, less Establishment, more entrepreneurial Japanese business types. To the extent that there is a corporate lobby in Japan for cleaning up its banks and really deregulating the economy to lift it from its malaise, it's the Keizai Doyukai, so let's give it a boost.
Chair #6 will feature an arm-wrestling match between the governors of the German and French central banks. The winner gets to explain to the G-7 how the euro is going to work and whether Europe will be run on the tight-fisted model of the German central bank, which means bankers will rule Europe, or the more socially sensitive French model, which means politicians will rule.
Chair #7 will be shared by Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, who is considering busting President Clinton, and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Joel Klein, who is considering busting up Microsoft. Few things could have more impact on global economics in 1998 than if Mr. Starr were to bring down Bill Clinton and Mr. Klein brought down Bill Gates.

Treasuries Slip With a Big Supply of Debt Coming to Market

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower in light trading, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury above 6 percent, as the market braced for about $33 billion in new debt this week.
Treasury yields are rising "in anticipation of the sales," said Robert Alley, who manages $2.5 billion at AIM Advisors Inc. in Houston. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32, to 101 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.03 percent from 5.97 percent.
The Treasury will sell $10 billion of three-year notes today -- its last scheduled sale of the securities -- and $12 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading yes terday, the three-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.63 percent.
At its regular weekly auction yesterday, the Treasury sold $12.1 billion in three-month and six-month bills.
Wall Street firms that buy Treasury debt at auction and then resell it to investors often drive up yields before a Government debt sale to help drum up demand. Still, expectations for reduced Government borrowing and the first budget surplus in almost 30 years may make it easier for the Government to find buyers for the new securities, traders said.
In addition to the new Treasury securities, corporate borrowers including the Long Island Power Authority, Asia Development Bank and Owens-Illinois Inc. are gearing up to sell more than $10 billion of debt soon.
"When there's not a lot going on, and we've got heavy supply coming, the market goes down," said Vincent Verterano, head of government bond trading at Nomura Securities International.
The Long Island Power Authority is selling $3.05 billion of bonds, in what will be the largest long-term municipal bond issue ever.
Traders and investors will also turn their attention this week to Government reports tomorrow on April producer prices and retail sales, and consumer prices on Thursday. On Friday, Treasury prices held fairly steady for most of the day despite a strong April jobs report before ending lower. Still, many in the market are concerned that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to keep inflation at bay.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills:

Concern About Rate Rise Cuts the Size of a Dow Rally

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
News of a huge telephone deal pushed stock prices higher early yesterday, but concern about rising interest rates overshadowed the merger euphoria, leaving stocks mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 135 points at one point, buoyed by SBC Communications' proposed acquisition of Ameritech, before falling back to close up 36.37 points at 9,091.52. 
 The retreat in stocks came as bond prices fell, lifting the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.03 percent -- the first time it has been above 6 percent since April 29. (Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.)
Rising interest rates can dampen corporate profits by increasing corporations' borrowing costs. They also make fixed-income securities more attractive compared with equities.
The rise in bonds yields above 6 percent could hamper further stock price advances as stocks become too expensive, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company.
"I've turned somewhat cautious intermediate term," he said.
Investors were also awaiting a new round of economic reports due this week. Government reports on April producer prices and retail sales, due tomorrow, and Thursday's report on consumer prices will give more information which may help gauge whether the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates soon to stave off inflation .
While the planned SBC-Ameritech deal increased speculation that other regional telephone companies may have to consolidate, telephone company shares ended mixed.
Shares of Bell Atlantic, U S West, the GTE Corporation and Sprint rose, while BellSouth and the AT&T Corporation ended lower.
Still, the deal could prompt further industry consolidation, said Tim Horan, telecommunications analyst for Banc America Robertson Stephens.
Once the current deal is completed, SBC is likely to remain independent. But other companies, even the second-largest local telephone company, Bell Atlantic, could be acquired, Mr. Horan said.
Others, like U S West and GTE, for example, could be purchased by companies seeking to expand their local services, including AT&T, he said.
Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York, said, "We can't believe that AT&T is going to watch this industry change before its eyes without taking part."
Mr. Bond, who sold some consumer-services stocks yesterday to raise cash for new investments, believes Sprint and U S West are possible acquisition candidates.
So far, this has been a stellar year for mergers and acquisitions. In 1998, 3,722 deals totaling $626.3 billion have been announced in which American companies are targets, according to Securities Data Company.
There have been $927.6 billion worldwide to date this year. Those compares with 3,538 deals totaling $260.6 billion as of May 11, 1997. This year's tally puts the market on pace to outdistance the total for all of 1997. Last year, 11,086 deals in which American companies were targets, totaling $917 billion, were announced. Worldwide, more than $1.63 trillion were announced.
The early rise in stocks yesterday did prompt the New York Stock Exchange to enact its 50-point collar, which curtails certain types of program trading when the Dow either rises or falls 50 points.
So far this year, the exchange has used the collar 103 times in 75 of this year's 89 trading days.
Last week, officials from the Department of the Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the exchange chairman, Richard Grasso, to change the trigger from a 50-point move in the Dow Jones industrial average to a wider margin.
New York Stock Exchange officials declined to comment on the letter.
The S.& P. 500 fell 1.50 points, to 1,106.64, and the Nasdaq took the hardest hit, falling 16.30 points, to 1,848.07.
While the Dow remains below its record high of 9,192.66, reached May 4, some analysts and investors believe a pullback is warranted.
"I think we're on a roller coaster and overdue for a consolidation," said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates.
"I think lots of market pundits would like to see this market take a break."

HEADLINE: Demand Is Still High for Impotence Pill

 BODY:
Americans are still rushing to get Viagra, Pfizer's new impotence pill, but the market has already begun to change, according to I.M.S. Health, a health care information company.
New prescriptions for Viagra totaled 269,842 for the week that ended on May 1, the latest statistics that are available, up 29.8 percent from a week earlier. Renewals, crucial to any drug's financial success, totaled a huge 16,429, according to I.M.S., more than double the previous week. 
 "The refills are really strong," said David Saks, managing director at Gruntal & Company. "That could really make Viagra one of the most popular drugs of all time. The demand for it is just phenomenal."
Yet, the market already shows signs of change. When Viagra was released a month ago, urologists were writing 47.5 percent of the new prescriptions and primary-care physicians, 34 percent, ac cording to I.M.S. The new figures show the trend reversing, with primary-care physicians writing 49 percent and urologists 33 percent.
Urologists have long worried that Viagra might tempt some patients who would otherwise see a specialist to phone their primary-care physicians instead.
The men who are getting Viagra are receiving fewer pills than previously. According to I.M.S., the average prescription dropped from 15 pills a month ago to 8.5 in the week that ended May 1.
"I don't think there is any major underlying cause with this," Mr. Saks said. "A lot of people and their doctors are just figuring out what the right amount of pills is for them."

HEADLINE: Board Suggests Penny Increase In Stamp Price

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The independent Postal Rate Commission granted much of the post office's request for higher prices today, meaning that stamps are likely to go up a penny, to 33 cents, for the millions of letters Americans send daily.
Under the commission's recommendations, packages will cost more, too, but post cards will stay at 20 cents. 
 The rate commission said there was no need to make the changes until 1999 because the Postal Service has been making profits of more than $1 billion a year since the last increase, in 1995. The date of the increase will be set by the Postal Service's governing board, which next meets in early June. The board can overrule the commission's recommendations, but that is rare.
Although it agreed to the increase in the basic first-class rate, the independent commission recommended cutting the cost of each extra ounce from 23 cents to 22 cents. That means the price of sending a 1-ounce letter would rise to 33 cents, a 2-ounce missive would remain 55 cents and anything heavier would cost less than it does now.
On other rates, the commission recommended a 12.3 percent increase for parcel post, somewhat more than the 9.2 percent asked by the post office. The rate varies with package size and distance.
Over all, the commission cut the post office's request for $2.4 billion in increases by about a third because of lower-than-expected inflation.
The action today did not involve rates for international mail, which are set by the postal governing board itself. The board has often changed international rates to reflect adjustments in the domestic rates.
The penny increase for first class mail will bring in about $1 billion a year. The Postal Service plans to spend $5.6 billion on equipment and service improvements this year.
"To leave the first-class stamp price unchanged would have triggered unjustifiably large rate increases for all other types of mail, with potentially serious economic consequences for mailers and the Postal Service," said Ed Gleiman, the commission chairman.
But Mr. Gleiman said the commission was making its recommendation reluctantly, in part because of what it deemed unreliable predictions 10 months ago that the Postal Service would "hemorrhage in red ink" by early this year unless the full increase was granted.
Instead, the Postal Service has rolled up a net operating surplus of more than $1.3 billion in the first half of fiscal 1998 after achieving surpluses of nearly $1.8 billion in 1995, about $1.5 billion in 1996 and about $1.2 billion in 1997, the commission said.

Jammin' for France: The Reggae Boyz on Tour

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
On the way to its first World Cup, Jamaica has literally decided to see the world. What began as a buildup to soccer's world championship has become a travelogue that may be great for frequent-flyer miles but might ultimately prove as exhausting to the players' legs as it is disruptive to their body clocks.
Three weeks ago, the Reggae Boyz looked tired in a tournament in Iran, struggling to score one goal in two games. Last week, they played in England. On Sunday, they were home for a match in Jamaica, before stopping briefly in New York yesterday for a sendoff ceremony. By 5 P.M., they were back in the air, heading for two more exhibition matches, in Seoul, South Korea. 
 "We were supposed to stay in France for 15 days before Korea, but we didn't have the money," said Rene Simoes, the team's Brazilian coach. "But we will have time to rest before the World Cup. This is a time when the coach must be clever."
By the time Jamaica plays its first match in the World Cup finals, on June 14 against Croatia in Lens, France, the Reggae Boyz will have played 25 games this year. The frenetic schedule is necessary, Simoes feels, to blend his native Jamaican players with English-born players of Jamaican descent. Seven of the 22 players on the World Cup roster figure to be Britons whose parents were born in Jamaica.
The use of mercenaries is common in soccer. But the citizenship issue has become a sensitive matter in Jamaica, which is the only Caribbean nation other than Haiti in 1974 and Cuba in 1938 to participate in soccer's world championship.
It is clear, however, that Jamaica would never have qualified for France if not for such imports as forwards Deon Burton and Paul Hall and midfielders Fitzroy Simpson and Robbie Earle. Without the Brits, the Reggae Boyz managed only two goals in their first five qualifying matches. Then Burton, whose shaved-head brilliance has led to comparisons with the Brazilian star Ronaldo, proceeded to score four goals in the next five matches and Jamaica secured its place in the 32-team World Cup field.
"I don't have any British players," Simoes said yesterday. "I have Jamaicans born in England. They are professional, more experienced. The British players have learned how to play relaxed and enjoy themselves without losing their responsibilities, and the Jamaicans have learned how to be professional."
The British players were indispensable last October in earning a crucial 1-1 draw during the final regional qualifying round against the Americans in Washington as Hall deflected an awkward pass from defender Jeff Agoos and Burton put the ball in the net for the equalizing goal.
When training in Jamaica, the British players live with the native Jamaicans in the same house, and this communal style has brought everyone closer, Simpson said. "They were like a rough diamond that needed to be polished," Simpson, who plays with Hall for Portsmouth in the English First Division, said of the native Jamaicans. "We happened to furnish the cloth."
Jamaica is not likely to be one of two teams advancing from a group that includes Argentina, Croatia and Japan. But success in the World Cup is irrelevant. Simply qualifying has made the players national heroes. When the team finally earned its way to France last November, a national holiday was declared.
"I was at the Miss World contest in the Seychelle Islands, and I got a call saying the Reggae Boyz had qualified for the World Cup," said Michell Moodie, who is Miss Jamaica. "I didn't realize it was so big until I found out there was a national holiday. People driving around with flags on their cars. It has created national unity for us."
After Brazil won the 1994 World Cup, the president of the Jamaican Football Federation, Horace Burrell, flew to Rio de Janiero determined to take home a Brazilian coach.
"I had no money, no connections, only determination," Burrell said. "I knew with the right technical expertise, we could do well."
Simoes picked him up at the airport, and because he was so quiet, Burrell thought he was just a hired driver. "Then I realized I was talking to one of the most experienced coaches in Brazil," Burrell said.
Simoes is a deeply religious man who signs autographs with the inscription "Jesus Loves You." One of his star players, Walter Boyd, quit the squad, claiming that Simoes was trying to "play God" with his life. But the Brazilian coach has become enormously popular, having brought discipline and motivation to a team whose individual flair had never translated into cohesive teamwork.
"I had to get them to believe in themselves," Simoes said. "Dreams are the oxygen of life."
Yesterday, more than 900 people, most of them Jamaicans living in New York, showed up at Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan to sign their good wishes on what was called the world's largest soccer ball, which stood five stories high and was 50 feet in diameter.
"This has been a great unifying source," said Patricia Durrant, Jamaica's ambassador to the United Nations. "It shows youngsters that even though they come from a small country, with a limited economic background, that will not stop them from great achievements."

HEADLINE: A New Measure Of Disparities: Poor Sanitation In Internet Era

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Around the world, more people are getting telephones and access to the Internet while at the same time an increasing number are without basic household sanitation -- toilets, or even simple latrines -- according to a new report.
The report, "Vital Signs 1998," was published on Saturday by the independent Worldwatch Institute, a Washington environmental group. 
 It is the latest in a series of annual surveys pulling together a wide range of disparate indicators -- crop yields, climate changes, medical advances and retreats, military expenditures or the production figures for bicycles compared with cars -- to spot new trends.
"There are a lot of important trends that never get reported," said Lester Brown, who originated the survey in 1992. It is now published in 21 languages.
Looking at sanitation, an important factor in health crises in poor nations, the 1998 "Vital Signs" concluded that the "sanitation gap" has become the greatest risk to public health in some countries. Using the latest available World Health Organization figures, the report says the number without facilities in the developing world increased by 274 million in the first half of the 1990's.
"In some countries," the report reads, "less than half the population is adequately covered." These include Afghanistan, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Congo, Egypt, Haiti, India and Senegal. The report notes, however, that some countries, like Brazil, have more exacting definitions of basic sanitation than others, so the statistics are not completely comparable.
On telecommunications the numbers are firmer and more recent. They indicate "tumultuous changes," the report said. International Telecommunications Union statistics show that more than 200 million telephone lines were installed worldwide from 1990 to 1996, bringing total telephone lines to 741 million. In 1960 there were 89 million.
Some countries have leapfrogged over the use of traditional telephones into the wireless era, the report found. In Cambodia, one of the world's poorest nations, where a national network of telephone cables is considered a long way away, 60 percent of telephone subscribers use cellular phones.
Worldwide, cellular phone users have increased an average of 52 percent a year since 1991, with 135 million users by 1996. This trend accentuates the differences between the rich and the poor in many under developed nations with poor communications networks.
As for the Internet, its use has grown "exponentially," the report shows. Most of the users are still in industrial countries. Of the estimated 107 million people on line, about 62 million are in the United States and 20 million in Europe.
But the Internet has been harnessed to public services in a number of small, poor countries, the report found. It mentions human rights work by the Kuna indigenous people in Panama, agricultural marketing by cooperatives in Peru and shared medical expertise for countries like Uganda and Bhutan.
"With 500 million people -- 8 percent of humanity -- projected to be on line by 2001," the report reads, "we can barely guess how the Internet phenomenon will shape the 21st century."

HEADLINE: TELEPHONE GIANT: THE INDUSTRY -- Giving Old Ma Bell New Lease on Life;
More New Math: Promoting Competition by Addition, Not Division

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Fourteen years after the Government forced the breakup of the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company -- a policy step taken to promote competition and consumer choice -- much of the old Bell System is being put together again.
The biggest move yet came yesterday when SBC Communications announced plans to buy Ameritech for $62 billion. The combination would reduce to four the remaining Baby Bell regional phone companies, down from the original seven spun off from AT&T in 1984. If regulators bless the merger, SBC would own nearly one-third of the nation's phone lines, controlling the local phone service in 12 states including Texas, California and Illinois. 
 The SBC deal may seem at odds with the Government-propelled push for greater competition in telecommunications, accelerated by the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, but it is partly a byproduct of Washington's policy. At its heart, the telecommunications act was a simple bargain with the industry: in return for opening their markets to new rivals, the companies would be given new freedoms.
Greater freedom to buy other companies was one. So the Government did not stop Bell Atlantic from acquiring Nynex, the Bell company based in New York, for $25.6 billion last year; or SBC when it bought Pacific Telesis Group, the California-Nevada Bell company, for $16.7 billion last year.
"The size of these deals alone is not horrifying, if we see an increase in competition as well as increased concentration in the industry," said Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's Institute for Tele-Information. "The issue to watch is whether a deal like SBC is tied to targets and timetables to increase competition for local phone service."
SBC's planned purchase of Ameritech may well provide an important test of that principle. Industry analysts and consumer advocates generally share the view, expressed by Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, that "the forces of concentration are clearly running far faster than the forces of competition" so far as the process of telecommunications deregulation unfolds.
Formerly called Southwestern Bell, SBC is known as the most aggressive of the regional Bells in defending its local bailiwick from competition even as it demands entry into the long-distance business. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the implementation of the telecommunications act, has been prodding the regional Bells to demonstrate that their networks are wide open to competitors before the Bells can offer long-distance service.
Last year, SBC filed a suit in Federal court challenging major sections of the telecommunications act, declaring that the law unfairly kept the regional Bell companies out of the long-distance market. In January, a Federal judge ruled in favor of SBC, a ruling that is being appealed.
Its proposed merger with Ameritech would give SBC far greater size and stature, but it would also insure that the company faced renewed pressure to open up its local business. To win approval, the SBC-Ameritech combination will undergo a lengthy review from the F.C.C. and state public utility commissions. The Justice Department will scrutinize the deal on antitrust grounds.
"A deal resulting in this level of concentration, giving SBC more than 30 percent of the phone lines in America, will be given a very hard look by the Government," said Philip Verveer, a former Justice Department official who is a partner at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher.
Indeed, when SBC and AT&T were discussing a merger last year, the F.C.C. said that deal would encounter resistance in Washington.
At the least, industry analysts expect the Federal and state authorities to extract market-opening concessions from SBC in exchange for approving the merger. "This becomes a new opportunity to get SBC to open up," said Mr. Noam, the Columbia professor.
The impulse of the major telecommunications companies to merge in the wake of deregulation follows the pattern seen in other industries freed from Government restraints, like airlines and financial services.
Along with entrepreneurial start-ups come a wave of mergers, as the old-line companies seek greater efficiency through becoming larger and melding operations. These so-called economies of scale increase the companies' abilities to command lower prices from suppliers and, in theory, invest the profits in new technology to make them competitive with entrepreneurial newcomers.
In the telecommunications arena, the new forces of competition include low-cost local carriers, wireless services and the Internet. The major long-distance and regional Bells are competing with the newcomers and jumping into these new arenas themselves.
The surviving majors -- SBC, AT&T, Worldcom, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Sprint, GTE and US West -- are trying to provide local service, long-distance, wireless and Internet access to their customers. "They're all trying to become supercarriers," said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston.
Like many industry analysts, Mr. Anderson is a long-term optimist on the benefits of telecommunications deregulation. The path toward lower costs and new services may be bumpy, somewhat delayed and come to the lucrative business market before it reaches into America's households. But, he says, the benefits of competition are beginning to become evident.
The Yankee Group estimates that the typical American household's monthly bill for basic phone service -- roughly $25 for long distance, and just under $30 for local -- will decline 13 percent a year over the next three years.
"Businesses are already enjoying the benefits of deregulation in terms of lower costs and new services, and consumers are just starting to see the benefits," Mr. Anderson said. "In broad strokes, the deregulation of telecommunications is working as it was intended, even if not quite as well as some people had hoped."
 
Charts: "Back to the Future"
Fifteen years ago, a Government antitrust suit forced AT&T to divest its local telephone companies, known as the Baby Bells. Since then, even the worst performing regional company, Bell Atlantic, has done better than its parent. Part of the reason is that the Baby Bells have retained their monopolies and been able to raise local rates, even as competition has forced down prices of long-distance calls. Now, deregulation is accelerating and promises to reshape the telecommunications landscape further.
 Graph tracks the cumulative change in the cost of local and long-distance telephone services, from 1986 through 1997. It also tracks the percentage change in stock prices of SBC Communications, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, and AT&T, since the Baby Bells began trading on Nov. 21, 1983.

HEADLINE: Chastened by Loss, Jeb Bush Looks Unbeatable in Florida

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 11

 BODY:
Leaning into the microphone before a rapt audience of about 125 people, Jeb Bush related how he went through a midlife crisis after losing the Florida governor's race in 1994 and emerged a better man.
"I have been changed in the last four years," he told the group. "I started listening more." 
 Mr. Bush had come to Temple Israel here to address a gathering of Jewish Democrats, not exactly a support group for a Republican baring his soul. But in his second bid for governor, Mr. Bush, a Miami businessman and a son of former President George Bush, seems to have undergone a transformation. He is reaching "outside my comfort zone," as he puts it, to groups he might have ignored in the past, toning down conservative talk and staying away from divisive issues.
So while in 1994 Mr. Bush flaunted a hard-edge conservative stance by advocating cuts in welfare, locking up criminals for longer periods and dismantling the Department of Education, this year he visits schools and shelters for abused women to talk about raising public school standards, restoring "compassion" to child welfare services and extending a state land-acquisition program for environmental protection.
After losing in 1994 by the narrowest margin in a governor's race in Florida's history, to Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat who is retiring, John Ellis Bush, 45, is determined to do it right this time and extend his family's political dynasty. He has a formidable lead in the polls, no primary opposition so far and three times the campaign money raised by his closest Democratic rival.
He is, in short, well on his way to completing a Republican takeover of state government in the fourth most populous state, solidifying his party's pre-eminence in the South. With his brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, considered a likely contender for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000, Jeb Bush could also be setting the stage for one of the more extraordinary family acts in American political history.
Florida is a rich prize in the Republican primary season, and the support of its Governor is a great advantage for those who seek it. And as Jeb Bush put it, with a small smile, "It would be a shock if a brother didn't support a brother."
Few expect his current, 18-point lead in the polls to hold for the six months to Election Day, and Mr. Bush himself, perhaps remembering the lead he lost in 1994, says he is campaigning as if he were 10 points down. "I really don't feel comfortable," he said in an interview. Still, in the words of former State Senator Rick Dantzler, one of three Democrats vying to challenge him, Mr. Bush at the moment is "as strong as 20 acres of onion."
Despite the high stakes, 1998 finds the Democrats in Florida with a faltering front-runner for the party's nomination, a serious rift with black political leaders and with what some experts say appears to be a defeatist attitude. Last week, the head of the Florida Democratic Party resigned in a move seen by political experts as a way to appease those who blamed her for the party's troubles.
The leader among the three Democratic candidates in the September primary, Lieut. Gov. Kenneth H. MacKay, is on a continuing slide in early polls, trailing Mr. Bush 35 percent to 53 percent in the latest poll.
As of March, Mr. MacKay had raised $2.1 million, less than half the $6.3 million in Mr. Bush's campaign coffers.
More significantly for Mr. MacKay, who is known throughout the state as Buddy, many Democratic leaders are openly questioning his ability to win.
"They're running scared," said Richard Scher, a political scientist at the University of Florida. "At this point it's really Mr. Bush's campaign to lose."
But a bigger problem for the Democrats has been a revolt in their own ranks. It erupted after Democratic state legislators last January kept State Representative Willie F. Logan from being in line to become the first black Speaker of the Florida House. To many black political leaders, the incident showed that the party took one of its most loyal constituencies for granted.
Since then, a wide group of black political and civic leaders has made Mr. Bush, who received only 6 percent of the black vote in 1994, a regular at their dinners and receptions.
"The window of opportunity is now open for Jeb Bush," said Mary B. Hooks, a West Palm Beach City Commissioner and black Democrat who is a vice chairwoman in Mr. Bush's campaign.
But Mr. Bush has a delicate line to tread in trying to reconcile the interests of such diverse constituencies as blacks, economic conservatives who are also social liberals, like Cubans, and Christian conservatives, who are a powerhouse in Florida's Republican Party.
So far, Mr. Bush's strategy, in a state where Democrats still barely lead Republicans in voter registration, and where many women of both parties object to his stance against abortion, has been to try to broaden his appeal, much as his brother did in Texas, and stay away from issues "that are a lot of heat and not enough light," like affirmative action.
And while four years ago Mr. Bush chose as running mate an Orlando state legislator and staunch conservative, Tom Feeney, this time he initially picked a woman, Secretary of State Sandra B. Mortham, who has solid government credentials and a pro-choice stance on abortion. (She later withdrew from the ticket because of publicity about ethical lapses by her and her office.)
Mr. Bush still defines himself as a conservative, but plays down such labels.
"The ideological battle is not as important as it once was," he said in an interview at his offices here, where he is president of a real estate development firm, Codina Group.
At least his opponents have noticed the change.
At the recent Jewish gathering, many self-described lifelong Democrats who did not vote for Mr. Bush in 1994 said they would this time, won over as much by his words as by what many described as his charisma and star power. Mr. Bush's eager demeanor, tall good looks and family pedigree, in fact, can make his opponents come across as dull. Mr. Bush, who has three children ages 14, 20 and 22 with his wife of 23 years, made a fortune on real estate ventures in South Florida.
"He sounds and looks like a leader," Jose Smith, a Miami Beach city commissioner, said of Mr. Bush, complaining that he could not find among the Democratic candidates "someone who should be leading our state into the 21st century."
At 65, Mr. MacKay, Florida's lieutenant governor for the last eight years, and a former state legislator and Congressman, surpasses Mr. Bush in both age and experience, and hopes that both will ultimately help him move up one notch to governor. An able public official by most accounts, who has often served as troubleshooter in the Chiles administration, he is a lawyer and citrus farmer who is married with four children and six grandchildren.
In an interview, Mr. MacKay, who is known as a tough campaigner, cast doubt on Mr. Bush's new image ("He's certainly put on his smiling face") and insisted that when the race comes into focus by fall voters will evaluate the differences between candidates "in a very level-headed way," highlighting such distinctions as his support for abortion rights and opposition to school vouchers, which Mr. Bush endorses.
"This is May," he said. "There's time."
Recently, when Mr. MacKay appeared before the United Century Village Democratic Club in West Palm Beach to unveil his "patient's bill of rights," a campaign pledge to hold health plans legally responsible for denying recommended care if a patient becomes ill, a woman in the group of about 100 elderly people shouted: "Not enough! Not enough!"
But the group was firmly on the Democratic side, many equating Republicans with big business and the religious right and unconvinced that Mr. Bush was anything more than an act.
"He's a lot of talk," said Elna Laun, the club's president. "This man knows nothing, has done nothing. He has the right father and has raised money, but what else has he done with himself?"
Mr. Bush, whose only experience in government was an appointment as Florida Secretary of Commerce from 1987 to 1988, has tried to make up for his lack of government service by creating a conservative organization, the Foundation for Florida's Future. Among the foundation's projects was the Liberty City Charter School, a privately run school partly financed with public money that Mr. Bush helped establish two years ago in a poor black neighborhood in Miami with the Urban League of Greater Miami.
Mr. Bush, however, attributes his 1994 loss not to his own shortcomings but to attacks by his opponent, that for example, questioned his judgment if not his ethics for several business dealings that went awry.
Mindful of the potential mudslinging in store, Mr. Bush said he has aimed his early campaigning at introducing himself to constituents who do not know him.
"I failed to give people a sense of who I was, why I was doing it," he said of the last campaign. "Had I known that, no amount of negative campaigning would have mattered."
But Mr. Bush's own personal attacks also hurt him, particularly an advertisement featuring the case of a murdered 10-year-old girl that he used to assail Governor Chiles for not signing death warrants fast enough. As it turned out, the case of the Florida murderer was still on appeal and there was little Governor Chiles could do about it before it reached his desk.
These spring days, the political trash talk has already started, with Mr. MacKay attacking Mr. Bush for taking contributions from Texas oil interests. Mr. Bush has responded that he stands against off-shore oil drilling off of Florida and that he is raising money aggressively because he is not accepting public matching campaign money.
But on a recent Saturday night in Fort Lauderdale, at a dinner to raise money for a social service organization for teen-agers, Mr. Bush talked only of the need to educate all children and close the gap between the haves and the have-nots.
It was a speech Mr. Bush will repeat again and again before November as he also strives to close the one percent vote deficit that kept him from the governor's mansion.
"I'm here to tell you that unless we figure out a way to transfer the power of knowledge not just to a third of our children but to every child who has the God-given ability to learn, then we will move to a thing that I believe will be defined as economic apartheid," he told the crowd. "Now, that's not the America that I want. That's not the Florida that we want."

HEADLINE: INDIA SETS 3 NUCLEAR BLASTS, DEFYING A WORLDWIDE BAN; TESTS BRING A SHARP OUTCRY

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 11

 BODY:
Nearly 24 years after it detonated its only nuclear explosion, India conducted three underground nuclear tests today at a site in the country's northwestern desert. The move appeared to signal India's determination to abandon decades of ambiguity in favor of openly declaring that it has nuclear weapons.
After less than two months in office, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of a Hindu nationalist party that has been an advocate of India's embracing nuclear weapons as a step toward great-power status, emerged on the lawn of his residence here and read a statement. Speaking in the late afternoon, he said the tests had been carried out barely an hour earlier at the Pokharan testing range in Rajasthan state, 350 miles southwest of New Delhi, where India's first nuclear test was conducted on May 18, 1974. 
 With the tests, the Government cast aside a generation of caution and opted instead for a course that brought immediate international condemnation from a world that has officially scorned nuclear testing since 1996. The tests also open the possibility of a costly and dangerous nuclear arms race with India's arch-rival Pakistan.
The tests, and the next step that they appeared to imply -- arming Indian missiles with nuclear warheads -- were almost certain to provoke economic sanctions under United States law, and to raise tensions with China, a nuclear power that has been described as a greater long-term threat to India than Pakistan is. China had no immediate official reaction to the news from India.
But after waiting 50 years to gain power, the Hindu nationalists appeared to have found all this less compelling than the urge to stake a claim for India as a great power, eager to equate its vast population with a matching military and political muscle. The nationalists may also have gambled on the tests' boosting their popularity, propelling them toward an outright parliamentary majority in the future.
Still, Mr. Vajpayee seemed to reflect the heavy stakes in the somber tone of his announcement. The 72-year-old Prime Minister restricted himself to a sparse, technical account of the tests, barely looking up from his text as he did so, then walked back into his residence without taking any questions.
"I have a brief announcement to make," he said. "Today, at 1545 hours, India conducted three underground nuclear tests in the Pokharan range. The tests conducted were with a fission device, a low-yield device, and a thermonuclear device."
"The measured yields are in line with expected values," he said. "Measurements have confirmed that there was no release of radioactivity into the atmosphere. These were contained explosions like in the experiment conducted in May 1974. I warmly congratulate the scientists and engineers who have carried out the successful tests. Thank you very much indeed."
Mr. Vajpayee's principal secretary, Brajesh Mishra, said afterward that the tests had established "that India has a proven capability for a weaponized nuclear program."
Mr. Mishra said the tests would help scientists design "nuclear weapons of different yields for different applications and for different delivery systems" -- meaning, Indian experts said, that the explosions were meant to test different types of nuclear warheads for India's fast-developing missile program, which has a mix of delivery vehicles to reach targets as close as Pakistan and as distant as China.
The tests were widely welcomed in India, with hardly any immediate dissent from opposition political parties and little sign of the Gandhian pacifism that was a strong element in Indian policy in the early years after independence in 1947.
Even Mr. Vajpayee's predecessor as Prime Minister, I. K. Gujral, a moderate who blocked the tests during his year in office, said: "It was always known that India had the capability to do this. The tests only confirm what was always known."
But the outcry from outside India was almost universal, with dozens of governments expressing anger that India had broken an informal moratorium on nuclear testing that went into effect in 1996, when India and Pakistan stood aside as scores of other nations met at the United Nations to endorse the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits all nuclear tests. The treaty is widely regarded as a key step toward halting the spread of nuclear weapons.
The Indian tests drew immediate condemnation from the Clinton Administration, which said the United States was "deeply disappointed" and was reviewing trade and financial sanctions against India under American nonproliferation laws; from other Western nations, including Britain, which voiced its "dismay" and Germany, which called the tests "a slap in the face" for 149 countries that have signed the treaty, and from Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, who issued a statement expressing his "deep regret."
But perhaps the most significant reaction came from Pakistan, which raised fears that years of effort by the United States to prevent an unrestrained nuclear arms race on the subcontinent were on the verge of collapse. In the absence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was visiting Central Asia, Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan hinted that Pakistan, which has had a covert nuclear weapons program since the early 1970's, would consider conducting a nuclear test of its own, its first.
"Pakistan reserves the right to take all appropriate measures for its security," Mr. Ayub Khan said in a statement to the Senate in Islamabad, the capital, that came amid demands from right-wing politicians and hard-line Islamic groups for an immediate nuclear test.
He laid the blame for the Indian tests on Western nations, mainly the United States, for not moving to head them off after Pakistan raised an alarm in Washington last month about the nuclear plans of the Vajpayee Government. When it took office in March after an election, the Government led pledged that it would review India's policy with a view to "inducting" nuclear weapons into its armed forces.
"We are surprised at the naivete of the Western world, and also of the United States, that they did not take the cautionary signals that we were flashing to them," the Pakistani Foreign Minister said in an interview with the BBC. He added: "I think they could have restrained India. Now India has thumbed its nose to the Western world and the entire international community."
Pakistan demanded that the United States impose harsh sanctions against India. Benazir Bhutto, a former Prime Minister, said in a BBC interview in London that her Government had a contingency plan in 1996 to carry out a nuclear test if India did. She said the ability still existed, and should be used. "If we don't, India will go ahead and adopt aggressive designs on us," she said.
The Vajpayee Government's decision to conduct the tests so soon after taking office appeared to catch the world's other established nuclear weapons states -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia -- by surprise. Although the test site lies in flat desert terrain, under cloudless skies at this time of the year, India seems to have succeeded in keeping preparations secret, even from American spy satellites.
The surprise was all the greater because the Clinton Administration succeeded in heading off an earlier plan by India to stage nuclear tests in December 1995.
This time, the Vajpayee Government appeared keen to heighten the symbolism of the tests, staging them on the same Buddhist festival day as the first Indian test in 1974. According to nuclear scientists who oversaw the first test, the code message flashed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi confirming the test's success was, "The Buddha is smiling."
But Indian commentators noted that Mr. Vajpayee's statement differed in one important respect from Mrs. Gandhi's announcement nearly a quarter of a century ago. Mrs. Gandhi had described the test at Pokharan as a "peaceful" explosion, setting the theme for all subsequent Indian policy statements on the country's nuclear program until today.
By avoiding the word "peaceful" in his announcement today, Mr. Vajpayee appeared to signal that the days of artful ambiguity about India's plans are at an end. For years, the Hindu nationalists, led by Mr. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, have called for India to take a more assertive role in its dealings with the world, one that the nationalists believe is more appropriate for a nation with a 5,000-year history and a population, now nearing 980 million, that means nearly one in every five human beings is an Indian.
In statements issued after Mr. Vajpayee's announcement, the Indian Government sought to take some of the political sting out of the tests, saying that it held to the long-established Indian position of favoring "a total, global elimination of nuclear weapons," and that it had not closed the door to some form of Indian participation in the test ban treaty if established nuclear powers committed themselves to this goal. But diplomats said this appeared to be mainly aimed at dissuading the United States from imposing sanctions.
The core of the new Government's thinking seemed to be represented by Kushabhau Thakre, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who said the tests showed that the Vajpayee Government "unlike previous regimes, will not give in to international pressure."
Strategists who have the ear of the Hindu nationalists have argued that India's deference to American pressures put the country at risk of being permanently stunted as a nuclear power. According to one recent estimate, by the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based research group, India has stockpiled enough weapons-grade plutonium to make 74 nuclear warheads, while Pakistan has enough for about 10 weapons. A parallel race to develop missiles that could carry nuclear warheads accelerated last month when Pakistan test-fired a missile it says has a range of nearly 1,000 miles.
But many Indians believe that the message of today's tests was intended more for China than for Pakistan. Although Pakistan has fought three wars with India since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 and is engaged in a long-running proxy conflict with New Delhi in the contested territory of Kashmir, Indian political and military strategists have concluded that even a nuclear-armed Pakistan, with 130 million people and an economy ravaged by corruption, does not pose as great a long-term threat to India as China does.
China is even more populous than India, has long-running border disputes that cover tens of thousands of square miles of Indian-held territory, and has an expanding arsenal of nuclear missiles that it has been developing since the 1960's, with none of the pressures from Western powers to desist that India has faced. Today's tests came barely a week after India's Defense Minister, George Fernandes, warned that China, not Pakistan, is India's "potential enemy No. 1.'

HEADLINE: Indians Risk Invoking U.S. Law Imposing Big Economic Penalties

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
India's nuclear tests today brought into play an American law that could block billions of dollars of aid to India, and it prompted American officials to plead with Pakistan not to intensify a regional arms race by conducting its own atomic tests.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said he and other top officials were scrutinizing the never-used 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, a Federal law which orders President Clinton to impose severe penalties on nations conducting nuclear tests or selling nuclear weapons. The law on nuclear tests covers nations that are developing nuclear weapons but excludes the declared nuclear powers, Russia, China, Great Britain and France. 
 The law requires Mr. Clinton to cut off almost all Government aid to India, bar American banks from making loans to its Government, stop exports of American products with military uses such as machine tools and computers -- and, most importantly, oppose aid to India by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. India is the world's largest borrower from the World Bank, with more than $40 billion in loans; it is expecting about $3 billion in loans and credits this year. Last year, of $19.1 billion the World Bank committed to developing nations, India received more than 1.5 billion. The International Monetary Fund has no programs under way with India, a spokesman for the fund said.
Direct United States assistance to India has not exceeded several hundred million dollars annually in recent years. This year, it included $41 million in licenses to buy military equipment and $51 million in development aid.
The tests "came as a complete shock, a bolt out of the blue," one senior Administration official said. "It's a fork in the road," the official said. "Will India and Pakistan be locked in a nuclear arms race? Will the Chinese resume nuclear testing now?"
Although American officials expressed shock, India's governing Hindu nationalist party announced that it would review the country's nuclear policy the day before it took power in March. Soon after it won the election, the party said it intended to "induct" nuclear weapons into India's arsenal. "Induct" is a technical term meaning formally placing such weapons in military stockpiles, and American officials said today that they had not foreseen that India would take the provocative step of resuming testing.
Nor did United States intelligence agencies pick up any signs that the tests were imminent.
United States officials strongly rebuked India while urging its neighbor, Pakistan, not to conduct its own test. Mr. Berger warned against "a new round of escalation."
President Clinton was "deeply distressed by the announcement of three nuclear tests," his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said today, and "has authorized formal presentation of our displeasure to be made to the Government in New Delhi."
The nuclear tests pose a challenge for Mr. Clinton, whose policy toward India and his scheduled trip there this fall both now require rethinking, Administration officials said.
"Sanctions are mandatory," said Senator John Glenn, the law's author and an Ohio Democrat. The only way to delay them is if the President tells Congress that immediate imposition would harm national security, and that delay can only last 30 days.
"It would be hard to avoid the possibility of sanctions," a State Department official said. "There is no wiggle room in the law."
If the World Bank loans to India are cut off as a result of United States pressure, that "would have serious implications for their budget, serious detrimental effects," a World Bank official said today.
While the United States cannot tell the World Bank what to do, "we have a fairly heavy vote," a senior State Department official said.
Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, urged the Administration to punish India under the law. "It's an enormous negative blow to our relationship with India," he said. "It'll destabilize the region."
The British Government does not have a similar law mandating sanctions, but India is the largest recipient of British foreign aid.
Henry Sokolski, a former senior Pentagon official involved in limiting the spread of nuclear arms, said: "India has just dug a big hole for itself by doing this test, a military, political and economic hole. Its banking system's in a world of hurt now. It's about to get a death blow.
The shock of the tests was amplified by the fact that the nation's top experts on the spread of nuclear arms only learned about them this morning from news agencies and television networks, not from the Central Intelligence Agency. Several of those Government experts expressed fury at the United States intelligence community and the Indian Government for failing to provide advance notice of the event.
Government experts said tonight they were still trying to come to grips with the meaning of the tests.
"There are two scenarios," a senior Administration official said. The optimists at the White House believe "the Indians will say that now that they've secured confidence in their nuclear weapons stockpile, they are prepared to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
The pessimists think the Indians "now have decided they're going to be an open nuclear power," he said. "They will endure international sanctions. They accept that they and the Pakistanis will be locked in a nuclear arms race."

What's New in Concert Halls? A Taste for the Old

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, May 8

 BODY:
If the Bauhaus and the modernist architecture that ensued had never happened, Edward P. Bass said as he gestured out from the mezzanine over an entrance foyer graced with pilasters, fluted columns and a frescoed dome, "This is what you would get."
What you get, with today's opening of the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall here, is by far the most traditional concert hall built in the United States in more than 65 years. The movement to repeal modernism, having spread from homes to baseball parks, has now penetrated the world of high culture. 
 Bass Hall aims to be an updated Carnegie Hall, a marble and Texas limestone embodiment of the 18th- and 19th-century masterpieces to be performed there. It also crowns the revival of a downtown that became a victim of the car culture two decades ago. Count the two 48-foot-tall herald angels on the building's facade as the city's largest civic boosters.
While the concert hall refuses to be bound by formulas, the downtown area's recovery, under Mr. Bass's primary guidance, closely follows the precepts of two prophets of urban design, Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte.
Urban planners hail Fort Worth as proof that no downtown is beyond rescue. "Among people who are looking for new ways to bring life to existing cities," said Fred Koetter, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, "it could stand as a model." Fort Worth's success has inspired open envy especially in Dallas, a city long used to regarding its smaller neighbor (population not even half a million) as laughably mired in stockyard muck.
Working in Fort Worth's favor were an ample stock of turn-of-the-century rehab-ready brick buildings and the ability of the Bass family, one of the nation's wealthiest, to buy about 40 blocks. The Bass brothers -- Sid, Edward, Robert and Lee -- turned a family oil fortune worth tens of millions into a diversified empire worth billions.
In Fort Worth, the earlier Bass projects were the sort of modernist designs, including two 38-story office towers of mirrored glass, that could have been anywhere. But the Basses also began renovating old brick buildings and adding harmonious newer ones. They included housing, shopping and night life as well as offices. They remembered the Jacobs and Whyte injunctions to respect human scale and encourage pedestrians. For added downtown security, they financed what has been called the "Basstopo" to patrol on bicycle and horse.
The Basses named the district Sundance Square because it once provided hideouts and illicit pleasures for outlaws like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Even on weeknights, the brick sidewalks here are crowded with office workers hanging around for dinner or a movie and tourists hopping between nightclubs and stores. Some Fort Worth residents, however, say their downtown has become a bland, sanitary amusement park, brought to them by the family that, as investors, helped turn around the Walt Disney Company.
The local symphony, opera and ballet, as well as the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition finals, have been using a convention center auditorium, since it has taken three of the four Bass brothers more than two decades to develop the alternative. Sid R. Bass's plans for a complex that was dubbed Lincoln Center Southwest fell victim to the collapse of the state's oil and real estate economy in the 1980's. A rival plan by Robert M. Bass, a past chairman of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, for renovating a coliseum used for livestock shows was rejected by voters in 1990.
Ed Bass, by then a pioneer resident of downtown, began considering what private money alone, and not only his family's, could do. To design Bass Hall -- named for the Bass brothers' parents, who donated the land -- he chose David M. Schwarz of Washington and Fort Worth, already the prime architect for the Basses' historically minded projects downtown. His best-known design, completed in 1994, has been the Ballpark, the brick and stone Arlington home of the Texas Rangers. Like Camden Yards in Baltimore two years before, Arlington evoked the era before ball parks became concrete fortresses.
Ed Bass wanted an architect who could recapture the era before performing arts centers became aloof outdoor sculptures. That era ended in the early 1930's with the completion of Severance Hall in Cleveland, which Mr. Schwarz is now expanding, and the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco.
Bass Hall "is designed to fit into the urban fabric as much as Carnegie," Mr. Bass said as he began his tour.
Befitting a practical-minded town that grew up as a cattle-kingdom capital, the hall abounds with refreshment counters, donor plaques and restrooms. For 2,056 seats, the Bass Hall men's rooms have 38 stalls; the women's, 64. Carnegie Hall, with 2,804 seats, has 40 and 47. Mr. Bass boasts of keeping to a $67 million budget. Some economies are evident in the blank side and rear facades and the Erector-set loudspeaker towers at the corners of the stage.
Mr. Bass, best known for his $150 million Biosphere II experiment in ecological self-sufficiency, sounds more like the architect than the fund- raiser. Having studied architecture at Yale, he likes to elaborate on how the hall and its simple, direct decoration have bypassed modernism. "It really has its roots in the Secessionist architecture of Vienna, 1900 to 1910, Josef Hoffmann, Otto Wagner, the Wiener Werkstatte," he said.
Mr. Schwarz, on the other hand, sounds more like the building's owner than its designer. "The question is how the people who are going to use the building feel about being here," he said on his own tour. "If it makes them happy and they want to come, the building is a success. The intellectual justifications for what we've done are relatively boring."
The justification for the hall's most extravagant features, those angels with their brass trumpets projecting far from the facade, was initially practical. As at Carnegie, architects had a shallow lot. Ductwork here had to go in front, creating two tall blanks on the facade that cried out to be filled.
Inside, features borrowed from Carnegie Hall include tiers shaped like horseshoes and boxes with anterooms, which have been sold to Fort Worth's wealthy like sports-arena luxury suites.
But Bass Hall is not slavishly imitative or backward looking. Polished and brushed aluminum and steel, even some cables more commonly used in airplanes, are featured in the lighting and railings. A spotlight booth is all glass and exposed steel beams.
Unlike Carnegie, Bass Hall has to present opera, ballet, rock concerts and Broadway shows as well as classical music. The solution, courtesy of Mr. Schwarz and Jaffe Holden Scarbrough Acoustics of Norwalk, Conn., is a hall eager to adapt. The push of a few buttons, for example, drapes the walls in heavy velour to absorb amplified sound.
The hall's Disneyesque opening today managed to pack Carol Burnett, Frederica von Stade, Fort Worth's own Van Cliburn and all the city's major performing arts groups into a program ranging from Verdi and Puccini to "Deep in the Heart of Texas."
The week before, at a party inside, Sid Bass, who has homes here and in New York, recalled the renovation project that initiated the redevelopment of 42d Street near Times Square. "There, it started out with the theater -- the Amsterdam," he said. "Here, we ended it with the theater."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 1998, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An Arts in America article on Tuesday, about the opening of the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, misstated a rival plan to develop a performance site. Robert M. Bass, a son of the couple, proposed the renovation of the Will Rogers Auditorium, not of a coliseum used for livestock shows.

HEADLINE: Good For Them And Us

BYLINE: By Rosabeth Moss Kanter; Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School, is the author of "World Class: Thriving Locally in the Global Economy." She is a consultant to many international companies.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Remember when many Americans saw foreign mergers with United States companies as a sign of failure? Today the opposite is true, the latest example being the reaction to last week's proposed Daimler-Benz deal with Chrysler. In a recent survey of 2,600 managers, I found that people working for companies that served only local markets felt threatened by foreign owners. But the managers for companies with international markets -- those with the most experience with globalization -- believed there was nothing to fear from foreign conglomerates.
Our own businesses have been the villains in the job-destroying downsizing disasters of the past decade. Foreigners generally don't buy American plants to close them. The people of Worcester, Mass., fought a foreign takeover of the Norton Company, a maker of abrasives and the town's largest employer, because they were afraid that a non-American owner wouldn't feel any strong community ties. Norton was eventually bought by the French Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, which, contrary to expectations, increased its job training and philanthropic gifts in the town. 
 The secret of the South's impressive growth has been foreign capital. Interstate 85, the highway between Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, is called "the autobahn" because hundreds of German companies opened factories or bought ailing American companies there in the last decade.
Lockwood Greene Engineers, a venerable engineering services company based in Spartanburg, S.C., was reinvigorated by a German owner. L.G.E. workers identified only one drawback to foreign ownership: difficulty obtaining government contracts.
Foreign companies sent over cosmopolitan managers who sought better schools and encouraged the cities to develop more museums and other cultural institutions.
Just because a foreign business has money to acquire an American business does not guarantee that it can run it -- hence the fumbles by Matsushita Electric Industrial Company after buying MCA Inc. International companies may have superior technologies or methods, but they find greater success when they blend these ingredients with American creativity and entrepreneurship. Honda brought great Japanese management to its plant in Marysville, Ohio, but the American workers eventually outperformed their assembly-line counterparts in Japan.
Like the Japanese, German companies have their strengths, including technical precision and logistical savvy. But these skills are becoming less important in global competition than innovation and marketing.
German companies need multi-skilled general managers -- which the United States produces in large quantity. Many German auto suppliers in South Carolina used to run their American operations by the German book. But the companies discovered that the managers were learning useful American leadership skills, and they now send hundreds of managers to train in the American way.
 American business was never in danger of being overwhelmed by foreign owners because the United States is the world's common-denominator culture -- a microcosm of the global economy, with the largest common market of economic regions and an amalgam of different ethnic groups. American culture is considered superficial, but that allows it to make deals across vast social divides. And American management tools are being embraced quietly even where American values are decried loudly, as in Malaysia or France.
Daimler-Benz will own most of the stock in the new DaimlerChrysler conglomerate, but the merger could turn out to be an American takeover. When Daimler-Benz opened a Mercedes plant in Alabama, Americans went to Germany to learn how to manage the German way. But the new DaimlerChrysler will be smart to bring its future managers to the United States to learn how to work in an international business. Americans shouldn't worry that Chrysler will leave Detroit. The Germans should worry that Daimler-Benz will move from Stuttgart.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An anti-award ceremony that seeks to bury Madison Avenue, not praise it.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
CRITICS who contend that advertising fosters an unfortunate consumerist culture among Americans had a field day last night, presenting counter-awards meant to dishonor Madison Avenue.
The critics include the Institute for Alternative Journalism; Zillions, a children's magazine published by Consumers Union; the New Mexico Media Literacy Project; California Newsreel, a nonprofit distributor of educational videos; the Film and Media Studies Department at Hunter College, and the Center for Analysis of Commercialism and Education. A dozen of the disparaging awards they sponsored for the second consecutive year were given to television commercials, print advertisements, billboards, Web sites, promotional campaigns and products from well-known corporations like the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Coca-Cola Company, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and Sears, Roebuck & Company. 
 The attacks cloaked as awards are called the Schmios. They were timed to precede the presentations tonight and tomorrow night of the 39th Clio Awards for creativity in advertising.
The critics' efforts to mock marketers through anti-awards are indicative of an increasing interest among activist organizations in deconstructing and critiquing sales pitches -- the better to persuade consumers that commercialism is becoming an increasingly prevalent threat to their ability to recognize misleading puffery.
"The basic point is that we want you to be critical when you experience media," said Neil Postman, the chairman of the Culture and Communication Department at New York University, which is another sponsor of the Schmios.
"It's part of a growing movement, especially among educators, that all this has to be taken seriously," said Mr. Postman, who was the host of the Schmio ceremony, held at Hunter College in Manhattan.
Attention must be paid to advertising, he added, because what many Americans "think is good, true and beautiful is largely in the hands of the people who give out the Clios."
Other examples of advertising criticism include the Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards, presented annually by a coalition of national consumer, environmental and health advocacy organizations; a yearly event known as TV Turnoff Week, and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly Awards, sponsored by Advertising Women of New York.
Among the most active activists is the Media Foundation in Vancouver, British Columbia, which publishes the magazine Adbusters, offering witty spoofs of big-budget campaigns; sponsors an annual Buy Nothing Day, and plans to run commercials complaining that "economic progress is killing the planet" during a conference of leaders of industrial nations to be held in Birmingham, England, beginning on Friday.
The critics "want to encourage a public discussion about advertising," said Viveca Greene, a co-director of the Schmios with Larry Adelman, who co-founded California Newsreel, because "we have to find a place to draw the line and determine how much is too much."
The Schmios last night were primarily focused on advertising aimed at children, under the theme "Kids for sale."
The reason, Mr. Postman asserted, is that "the advertising industry seems to think of children as simply a consumer market to use in attempting to fuel the economy."
One youth-oriented Schmio, dubbed the Possessions Are Everything Award, went to Sears for a scholarship contest, advertised in Seventeen magazine, featuring an actress, Maia Campbell, from the UPN sitcom "In the House." The ads carried such headlines as "You gotta stand up for yourself" and "You gotta believe in your dreams" before concluding: "But hey, you gotta have something to wear. Gotta have the clothes."
Another children-related Schmio, called the A Marketing Opportunity Is a Terrible Thing to Waste Award, was given to Coca-Cola and a high school in Georgia "for turning schools into sales promotions." The make-believe award was centered on a well-publicized incident in which a student at the school was suspended for wearing a Pepsi-Cola T-shirt on "Coke in Education Day."
Other Schmios about marketing to children included one given to the MTV cable network owned by Viacom Inc., for a commercial featuring the actor Keanu Reeves that the critics charged presented the "coolest vision of teen-age despair," and one given to Anheuser-Busch for "using cartoon characters" like dogs, frogs, ants and lizards "to recruit future customers -- kids."
Some of the counter-awards were about ads for adults. They included one for De Beers "for turning a marketing strategy into a tradition," with campaigns "to ritualize the giving of diamond rings in every ceremony, not just marriage," and one for several outdoor advertising companies for concentrating billboards for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in residential neighborhoods.
For those wondering why the anti-awards are called Schmios, Ms. Greene provided the explanation: It's a device derived from Yiddish, intended to derogate and diminish by repeating a word and substituting "sch" or "sh" at the beginning of the first syllable.
Last year, Ms. Greene and Mr. Adelman called their mock awards the Counter-Clios, but met with complaints of trademark infringement from James M. Smyth, owner of what was then Clio Awards Inc.
Mr. Smyth sold the company in September to the BPI Communications division of VNU N.V., which owns trade publications like Adweek and Billboard.
The new owner of the Clios, however, seems as happy about Schmios as the old owner was about Counter-Clios.
"If people are getting together to warn consumers that some ads are fraudulent, boring, unintelligent, hurtful or uncreative, I'm all for it," said Andrew Jaffe, executive director at the Clio Awards unit of BPI in New York.
"But we're proud of our trademarks and brands," he added, "and we're concerned when we think people try to use them for their own ends."
Mr. Jaffe said he agreed with the critics that "people should pay attention to advertising," adding, "The Clios are a positive force in trying to make ads better."
Besides, Mr. Jaffe said, the Schmio statue looks too much like the Clio statue. The main difference: the Schmio shows someone, presumably a consumer, with his or her hands in chains.

HEADLINE: About New York;
CUNY Cure That Lacks A Disease

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THERE have been times in Peter Sylver's life when he would be puzzled by his fate. It happened in the late 1980's when, after graduating from high school, he was breaking his back in highway construction, sweating and smarting alongside rivers of hot tar.
"You look at yourself and ask, 'What the hell am I doing here?' " he recalled. He asked himself the same question in the summer of 1990 when he became a father. He was then working at a home for disturbed children, stuck in Manhattan traffic on 10th Avenue as he went to pick up a runaway. He sat behind the wheel, watching scores of students crossing the street to John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He wondered, what was this? 
 "It's like this huge migration when they change classes," he said. "Then I thought, I got a daughter. I got to go to college."
Such a decision was not easy for someone raising a family and working. Nor was it seen as an option by young people in working-class neighborhoods like his in South Ozone Park, Queens, where graduating from high school with an academic diploma and without a criminal record was a big enough deal.
The migration Mr. Sylver, 29, witnessed that summer day led to his own journey when he enrolled himself in John Jay, where several professors mentored him and nudged him to go on and attend law school. Today, he is an associate at a midtown law firm, right across the street from a post office where his father works as a mechanic. At a time when the City University of New York is under constant attack for few standards and many failures, Mr. Sylver credits it with giving him a new perspective on the future.
"It's that example of upward mobility," he said. "It's not a big deal if you can go to a school when your parents are well-to-do and you bring them the tuition bill and they pay it. Your only concern is if a girl in your dorm likes you. At CUNY, you have people raising children, working full-time jobs just trying to improve themselves. That was the position I was in. You're juggling all these issues and in the meantime, you're trying to get an education."
A recent overview of CUNY's impact on the city and state economy showed that its graduates' earnings from 1970 to 1997 accounted for an additional $700 million in taxes. In Yankee-mania money, that's enough for a stadium and a few overpriced hot dogs. The report also said that graduates who would not have qualified for college before open admissions earned $67 million more in one year during the 1980's than they would have without a degree.
Jane Bowers, who taught Mr. Sylver college English, said that while he was a remarkable young man, there were many others she taught who had also accomplished much. They validated her faith in the system, she said, adding that their successes seemed to be lost on the critics of public colleges.
"What do they know about what education can do to a person and transform a life?" she said. "It's frustrating. They pull away resources because they have these mistaken notions and our ability to run a good ship is compromised. Then their prophecies become self-fulfilling."
ONE of Mr. Sylver's early jobs was delivering boxes of computer paper to offices. The only papers he hauls now are in his briefcase. In buildings where he once used the service entrance, he now shares the elevators with executives on his way to boardrooms.
"A school like CUNY where you can walk in the door, start classes and have low tuition, that's an amazing thing," Mr. Sylver said. "It says a lot about our country that you can do that."
His father, who had to drop out of Queens College decades ago to raise a family, now visits him for lunch. On the weekends, his children sometimes come over to romp in his office.
"My daughter says that when she goes to college she wants to be a doctor or a lawyer," he said. "My son says things like he wants to be a cabdriver. That bothers the hell out of me, but he likes cars."
Give him time, it's just a phase. It took him a while to jump income brackets, too. Still, he sometimes has that nagging thought familiar to anyone who crossed the line from working stiff to professional. He only has to look out his window and see the post office where his father works on trucks. It's quite a view.
"I wonder if someone is going to come back and take it all away," he said. "How am I here? It really does make you catch your breath, you're so overwhelmed."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reportedly Backed British Mercenary Group in Africa

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12

 BODY:
A British mercenary force that helped carry out military operations in Sierra Leone this year kept the Clinton Administration fully informed of its activities and had its tacit support, the military group and a senior Administration official said.
The operation was successful from the perspective of Washington and London, helping restore to power an elected President of Sierra Leone, Ahmed Kabbah, who had been ousted by a brutal group of army officers in a coup a year earlier. 
 But in accomplishing its mission, the private army, Sandline International, which was paid $10 million on behalf of Mr. Kabbah to arm and train a force to return him to power, reportedly brought in planeloads of assault rifles, mortars and ammunition, more than 100 tons altogether, all in violation of a United Nations arms embargo on Sierra Leone.
In Britain, the disclosures about Sandline, which first came to light in March in Africa Confidential, a newsletter here, have become front-page news, creating a political maelstrom. Foreign Minister Robin Cook, under attack by the press and the political opposition, has said he will resign if the arms embargo was knowingly violated.
On Monday, Prime Minister Tony Blair dismissed the allegations as a lot of "hoo ha," and praised the British Ambassador in Sierra Leone, Peter Penfold, who reportedly coordinated the Sandline operation, for helping restore the elected President. Today, Mr. Blair's office released a "unprompted" letter from Mr. Kabbah, who said he neither had sought nor was offered arms supported by the British Government.
Mr. Kabbah was restored in March with the help of a Nigerian-led African force that ousted the junta. Sandline said it had been asked by Mr. Penfold to assist the effort.
Last month, the British customs authorities opened an investigation into whether Sandline broke the embargo with the approval of Mr. Cook's ministry. In Parliament today, Mr. Cook vehemently denied that his office had ever received notice that the embargo would be broken. "I can flatly and firmly make it clear that no papers suggesting the breach of the arms embargo by Sandline or anybody else ever went to my office in March or anytime before that," he said.
Washington has also sought to play down the affair.
In his briefing on Monday, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, described Sandline as merely a "private security firm that protected mining and construction interests in Sierra Leone."
A few Sandline "employees" remained in Sierra Leone after the coup last year, and they "periodically contacted State Department officials and commented on the situation in Sierra Leone," Mr. Rubin said. "But we are not aware -- at least I am not aware -- of any information provided on possible arms shipments."
But Sandline, and a senior American official, tell a different story.
In a confidential letter sent to Foreign Minister Cook on April 24, Sandline's lawyers wrote that Sandline had kept the State Department informed "at the highest level." Among those briefed, the lawyers said, were the American Ambassador in Sierra Leone, John Hirsch, and senior State Department officers. The letter also says the operation, which included "both personnel and military equipment," had the support of the Defense Department.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the senior Administration official generally confirmed this. "We were fully aware of what was going on," he said. He said Washington was pleased that Britain took the lead among Western nations in helping oust the junta, and described American support for Sandline's operation as "passive," rather than active.
After the coup last May, as the generals turned more brutal and the killing mounted, Washington and other governments were despairing of what to do. "The only people willing to do something was Sandline," the official said.
As for the State Department's assertion that it knew nothing about the arms shipments, the official said, "If you believe that, well, I've got some other information to sell you."
In October, when all diplomatic attempts to oust the mutinous generals had failed, the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Sierra Leone.
Press accounts said weapons for the Sandline operation were purchased in Bulgaria and flown in from the airport at Burgas, Bulgaria.
President Kabbah agreed to pay Sandline $10 million for weapons and training, Sierra Leone's Information Minister, Julius Spencer, said in Freetown on Monday.
Sandline was also awarded diamond concessions in the country.
In this regard, Sandline was acting on behalf of a mineral trader, Rakesh Saxena, who underwrote the Sandline operation in Sierra Leone, according to published reports here. The reports include faxes between the head of Sandline, Lieut. Col. Tim Spicer, and Mr. Saxena.
Mr. Saxena is alleged to have embezzled more than $100 million as an adviser to the Bangkok Bank of Commerce. He fled to Canada, where he was arrested and released on $1 million bail. He is now back in jail, but while on bail made the arrangements to hire Colonel Spicer, according to press accounts in Canada.
Sandline was founded in 1995 by Colonel Spicer, a Briton who fought in the Falklands and was the spokesman for Gen. Michael Rose, the United Nations commander in Bosnia.
This is not the first time that Sandline has been at the center of a controversy. Last year, the Prime Minister in Papua New Guinea signed a $36 million contract with Sandline for its services in putting down a rebellion in Bougainville. When news of the hiring of mercenaries became public in Papua New Guinea, rioting broke out, army officers mutinied and the Prime Minister was forced to resign.

HEADLINE: Nassau Police Lead a Drive to Stem Growing Gang Violence

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., May 12

 BODY:
Six weeks after a 21-year-old immigrant from El Salvador was shot and killed here in a confrontation with a rival Salvadoran street gang, Nassau County officials announced today that they were forming a rare partnership with Federal and local agencies to stem the growing problem of gang crime.
The County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said that Nassau County would coordinate the activities of agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the New York City and Suffolk County Police Departments. He said Assistant Chief Herbert R. Faust of the Nassau police, a graduate of the F.B.I. National Police Academy who has been studying the growing problem, would direct the new effort. 
 Police Commissioner Donald F. Kane said the Nassau Police Special Investigations Squad would centralize the collection and dissemination of gang-related intelligence and information.
The murder of the Salvadoran immigrant, Rogoberto Reyes, a warehouse worker, was the most serious crime in a growing pattern of gang violence in Nassau, said Commissioner Kane, and it prompted county officials to move aggressively. He said Mr. Reyes, whom he identified as a member of a gang called Salvadorans With Pride, died on March 29 of gunshot wounds during a gang confrontation with members of a rival gang in front of the Church of the Nativity on Willis Avenue here.
Within hours of the Sunday morning shooting, the police arrested Miguel Guardado, 21, of Glen Cove, a member of a gang called Mara Salvatrucha, or Salvadoran Club. The gang is known on the street as MS-13.
Both groups fought several hours earlier outside a Hempstead night club. Mr. Guardado, a former friend of Mr. Reyes before he joined MS-13, was charged with murder and is being held without bail in the Nassau County Jail.
Chief Faust said MS-13, the largest street gang in Nassau, has been active on Long Island for about four years and is known for its violence.
He said the gang was born in El Salvador, spread to Los Angeles, then across the country. The number 13, he said, stands for an initiation ritual, the 13 seconds during which new members must undergo a beating inflicted by other members.
"The problem of gang violence was not taken seriously when it first started to emerge on the West Coast," Commissioner Kane said, "and we don't want to make the same mistake. We want to act now before it becomes a major problem here."
He said gang-related arrests in 1996 accounted for less then one-half of one percent of all arrests in the county. He said they grew to a full one percent last year and were continuing at a similar pace this year.
Mr. Gulotta said that in 1996, there were 110 arrests related to gang activities in the county. In 1997, that number grew to 227. So far this year, there have been 60 arrests, he said.
"When you look at the entire picture, it's a small number," Mr. Gulotta said. "But we want to nip the problem in the early stages. Recent statistics indicate that our crime rate is at its lowest level in 27 years, and we want to continue to drive that rate down."
Commissioner Kane said that in addition to the murder of Mr. Reyes, there have been numerous gang-related assaults, drug and gun offenses and many misdemeanors.
"The Villages of Hempstead and Freeport have had more of a serious problem with this than other villages around the county," Commissioner Kane said.
Chief Faust noted that many of the crimes were against Salvadorans or members of other Hispanic groups.
"We can go through a whole sociological, economic explanation of why gangs exist," he said. "But basically, the gang activity that we've seen preys upon people in their own ethnic group. They are their own victims."

HEADLINE: In Phoneland, It Gets Lonely At the Middle

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
When is huge not big enough?
In the telecommunications industry, it is when your company serves more than 20 million customers, has a market value of $50 billion, reaps revenue of $16 billion and has net earnings of $2.3 billion. 
 Richard C. Notebaert, chairman of the Ameritech Corporation, took a hard look at his company, took a hard look at the future and felt small, too small to be one of the world's communications giants.
So he decided to sell the company to SBC Communications Inc. for $62 billion.
"What's ironic is that they were one of the few holdouts, saying they were going to go it alone," Stephanie Comfort, head telecommunications analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said of Ameritech's management.
Only in the telecommunications industry could a deal worth twice the gross domestic product of Kuwait be considered essentially a capitulation -- albeit a highly opportunistic and profitable one -- to a global trend too powerful for any company to ignore.
Ameritech is a strong company, and Mr. Notebaert has an excellent reputation as a manager and as a producer of value for his shareholders. But those things are not enough in today's telecommunications industry, where the motto seems to be: Go global or go home.
In the communications industry these days, going home means eschewing huge ambitions and focusing on niche markets. Hundreds of small long-distance companies and dozens of small competitive local phone companies are doing just fine with that strategy.
But for a big company like Ameritech, with institutional shareholders who demand a long-term plan for strong earnings growth, going home is not an option.
In Washington and among consumer advocates, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and its implementation take a lot of the credit, or blame, for the wave of consolidation sweeping the industry. The seven regional Bells are poised to become four. The MCI Communications Corporation is in the process of being acquired for $37 billion by Worldcom Inc., a company few people who work somewhere other than Wall Street had even heard of a few years ago. When the AT&T Corporation agreed to acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc. for $11.3 billion in January, the deal was fairly described as "medium sized."
The act made it much easier for such deals to go through. But Mr. Notebaert knows what he is talking about when he says the force behind the merger binge is bigger than one law.
"I don't think the telecom act caused consolidation," he said in an interview. Referring to the dominant Japanese telephone company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Europe's biggest carriers, Mr. Notebaert added: "Whether we had the telecom act or not, consolidation was going to occur because American companies need to be competitive with the N.T.T.'s, the Deutsche Telekoms and the British Telecoms of the world."
And Ameritech, much like MCI, seemed to realize that it could not meet that challenge alone.
"Ameritech has been very profitable, and they have been very careful about how they spend their money," said Jack M. Clarke, a lawyer at the firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts who, as the Nynex Corporation's vice president for law, helped guide the company's acquisition by the Bell Atlantic Corporation. "But they are in a very small area, a five-state area. They came to realize they needed scale."
Much of that scale is financial. SBC predicts that by 2003, it will be able to squeeze $1.2 billion in annual expenses out of the combined company and reduce annual spending on capital improvements by $250 million.
The companies say that the deal will result in no net drop in employment, but it seems clear to most analysts that jobs will be lost in the combined company's core operations, only to be replaced by new jobs in future growth areas, including wireless communications and, potentially, long-distance service.
The combined company would also have an overseas presence worth about $16 billion in 19 countries, giving it a potential beachhead from which to take on foreign carriers.
"There will evolve only a handful of global players, and we want to be one of them," James D. Ellis, SBC's general counsel, said in an interview yesterday.
Mark R. Bruneau, president of the communications and computing unit at Renaissance Worldwide, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., said: "This rebuilds the natural scale of this industry, anyway. Like airlines should be big and global to work, so should phone companies."
But one very important person disagrees. He is William E. Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, which will review the deal.
"It's hard to survey the telcommunications landscape in this country and decide that a company is too small," he said yesterday in an interview. "We have many examples of companies that are very small that are competing very effectively in niche markets across the country."
But to companies like Ameritech, that sounds like staying at home, and the world is too big for that.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Free Fall Not Seen for the Pound Despite Soros Rumblings

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
George Soros, the man who broke the Bank of England six years ago, is said to be betting against pound sterling once again. Does that mean it's deja vu for currency investors?
In September 1992, Soros Fund Management sold huge amounts of sterling in the belief that its value, then artificially pegged to other European currencies, was wildly excessive. Mr. Soros wound up right and turned an estimated $1 billion profit in a matter of weeks. 
 Is history repeating itself? Will the pound once again get crushed under Mr. Soros's selling pressure?
No and no, currency experts say. "It is not 1992 all over again," said John McCarthy, senior vice president of ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. "The economic conditions today are different, and the structure of foreign exchange is different. Sterling is not going to collapse."
That does not mean the currency will not weaken. Sterling has had a solid run recently. In the last year, it is up 20 percent against most of the major European currencies; it has risen 40 percent against the mark since 1995 and settled yesterday at 2.9009 against the mark, about 7 percent off its March 31 high.
Mr. Soros never discusses his trades. But if he has a bet against sterling, it is almost certainly a response to its recent strength.
The pound is nowhere near its 1992 levels. Sterling had just joined the European exchange rate mechanism, an agreement that kept European currencies relatively stable versus one another. But its value was unsustainably high. After Mr. Soros's sales hit, "Nobody knew where it could fall to," Mr. McCarthy recalled, and the currency plummeted.
That is not the case today. Significant gains made by hedge funds in sterling this year make the currency vulnerable to some profit taking but not a rout.
The fundamentals that have made sterling popular are beginning to change. Its strength has partly resulted from relatively high yields in Britain. A one-year sterling deposit yields 7.25 percent compared with a 1.75 percent yield on the same investment denominated in Swiss francs. While other yields in Europe have fallen recently -- Italy's rates have fallen to 5 percent from 12 percent -- Britain's remain high.
While some investors thought Britain's central bank might raise rates, a weakening British economy makes that less likely. A sharp slowdown in gross domestic product growth to 1.9 percent this year suggests there will be no tightening in monetary policy anytime soon. That means less fresh money going into sterling.
Another favorable influence on sterling had been uncertainty about the euro, which will replace the currencies of 11 countries in the European Union next January. As long as the euro was on the drawing board, fund managers preferred the relative safety of sterling or Swiss francs, whose countries will not immediately participate in the euro. Now that details of the euro have been resolved, participating countries look much more stable, which has caused some selling in sterling.
Even so, a 1992-style free fall seems unlikely.
Mr. McCarthy said, "Somebody's simply coming in and saying this currency is overvalued."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Mirrors Rally in Bonds To Close 70.25 Points Higher

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks maintained their ties to the bond market yesterday, falling early in the day as bond prices fell, then gaining as bonds reversed course and rallied.
The turnabout came as the Treasury saw stronger-than-expected demand for its three-year note in yesterday's auction. Expectations that today's report on the Producer Price Index for April may show little sign of inflation also helped. 
 The markets' continued volatile price swings -- prices tumbled on Monday -- indicate investors are skittish and wary. In contrast, just a few weeks earlier, analysts noted, investor euphoria continually pushed broad market indexes to new highs.
After falling as much as 31.64 points early yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average mirrored the bond market rally to close up 70.25 points at 9,161.77. As bond prices climbed, the yield on the 30-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to Friday's level of 5.97 percent from Monday's 6.03 percent.
Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 9.15 points, to 1,115.79, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 12.09 points, to 1,860.16. Technology shares, which have taken hits in the last week, were among the leading gainers in each of the major indexes.
Despite the comeback, analysts and many investors expect stocks to log few gains in coming weeks. In fact, the Dow is now trading just about where it was in mid-April.
"I don't see what the catalyst is that makes the market go much higher from here," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc. "Complacency has given way to higher anxiety and the belief that the market has lost its momentum," he added.
Still, Mr. Cripps sees certain buying opportunites. For example, Cambridge Technology has fallen about 13 percent from its recent high of 57 7/32 reached April 22. Similar information technology shares including Electronic Data Systems and Complete Business Solutions have also fallen from recent highs, he added."At these prices, you like them because of the earnings growth," he said. Mr. Cripps also likes energy stocks, health care services and biotechnology companies. Despite recent price rises in this sector, some of these shares are trading at prices similar to levels several years ago, when they were out of favor.
But he says that financial services stocks, cyclicals and drug stocks could be hurt if the market stumbles.
Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan., said, "This is a good time to think about your industry concentration bets."
The recent surge in Internet-related shares aided Verio, an Internet services provider. In its first day of trading, Verio rose almost 18 percent, or 4 1/16, to 27 1/16.

Treasury Prices Show Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday after a $10 billion auction of new three-year notes -- the Treasury's final sale of the securities -- was met with ample demand.
"When an auction's over, it's almost a cathartic effect," said Tracy Eccles, who helps oversee $50 billion at the Hartford Investment Management Company in Hartford.
Helping fuel a late rally was concern that recent declines in Asia's stock markets and currencies may intensify, increasing the appeal of Treasury securities as a refuge.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 27/32, to 102 4/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.97 percent from 6.03 percent. Demand at yesterday's sale of three-year notes was better than average. The Treasury announced last week that it would stop selling three-year notes after yesterday's auction because surging tax revenue was decreasing its need to borrow. Following are the results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.978
Average Yield . . . 5.633%
Low Price . . . 99.962
High Yield . . . 5.639%

Air fares between the United States and Japan are falling, partly because of an aviation accord.

BYLINE: By Janet Piorko 

 BODY:
AIR fares between the United States and Japan have dropped dramatically in the last week, as most carriers have joined in a sale begun by UAL's United Airlines.
Nonrefundable round-trip fares for travel through July are as low as $960 between New York and Tokyo, a saving of 36 percent over the previous lowest fare of $1,500, according to Bob Gano, a spokesman for Japan Airlines. 
 Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, AMR's American Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Korean Airlines and Singapore Airlines are among the other major carriers that have cut fares.
Flights from Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego to Tokyo are as low as $675 round trip, compared with $1,150 previously, a saving of about 41 percent.
The new fares generally require a Saturday night stay; tickets must be purchased by May 22 and travel completed by July 31. Most of the airlines do not have advance-purchase requirements.
The sale, the first of its kind on flights between the two countries, is partly the result of an aviation agreement reached earlier this year between Japan and the United States, according to Richard Martin, a spokesman for United. Previously, "we didn't really have the freedom that we have now" to lower fares, he said.
Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the discounted fares "reflect market forces," but agreed the accord had "helped."
"It has also brought in more capacity, perhaps at a time when it has not been needed," he said. Several airlines have added new routes and frequencies on existing routes following the agreement.
According to Doug Killian, a spokesman for Northwest, the low fares reflect the fact that travel from Japan to the United States is "very sluggish."
In the other direction, however, it seems to be holding its own. According to the Japan National Tourist Organization, more than 621,700 United States travelers visited Japan in 1997, an increase of 5.9 percent over the previous year.
 
Topping the Charts
Trans World Airlines ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction for long domestic flights and America West for short hauls in the sixth annual study of frequent fliers conducted by J. D. Power & Associates with Frequent Flyer magazine.
Continental Airlines, which had taken the top spot for long flights (500 miles and more) in both 1997 and 1996, ranked second in that category this year, followed by United, America West and American. America West, which topped the short-flight category for the second consecutive year, was followed by Continental, T.W.A., Southwest Airlines and U S Airways. Nine major airlines were included in the questionnaire, including Delta and Northwest.
As in the past, on-time performance was the most important factor, contributing 22 percent to the respondents' satisfaction with a flight.
The study, which was released yesterday, is based on 5,938 flight evaluations by a national sample of 2,263 frequent fliers who average 27 round-trip flights a year in the United States.
 
Crown Class
Royal Jordanian Airline has upgraded its business class, which it now calls Crown Class. Improvements include a renovated check-in lounge at the airport in Amman; the airline staff there will also take business-class travelers' documents through passport clearance. On board, personal video players have been installed, with a selection of 15 movies.
The airline has five flights a week between New York and Amman (with a sixth starting June 4) and two between Chicago and Amman (with a third starting May 30 and stopping in Detroit), all via Amsterdam. At the same time, the airline is dropping first-class service systemwide; it had been dropped on trans-Atlantic routes two years ago.
 
Taking Off From Islip
Comair, a Delta regional partner, will begin jet service on June 1 between Islip, N.Y., and its home base of Cincinnati, with three nonstop flights daily. Introductory nonrefundable round-trip fares for travel during June range from $278 to $398 for flights on Comair and Delta to more than 50 destinations nationwide through the Cincinnati hub. Delta flights require a 14-day advance purchase and Saturday stay; the Comair flights do not.
 
Counting the Hours
Guests paying full published rate can get 24 hours for their money at Ritz-Carlton's seven hotels in Asia. Under the company's new 24-hour stay program, travelers who check in at, say, 11 P.M. can occupy the room until 11 o'clock the next night. Requests must be made at the time of reservation, and the offer does not apply to discounted rates. The hotels are in Osaka, Japan; Shanghai; Hong Kong, Seoul, South Korea; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Singapore, and Bali, Indonesia. Ritz-Carlton is controlled by Marriott International.
 
Loosening Up at LAX
Mini-massages to take the kinks out of a traveler's neck and upper back are now available at Los Angeles International Airport. The 15-minute massages, which cost $20, are offered by a company called Body Charge at Images of California, a news and gift store in Terminal 7 (the United terminal). Customers sit in a specially designed chair for the massage by licensed practitioners. Body Charge is run by Paul Guditis, a former pilot for American Eagle, who presumably knows something about stress.

HEADLINE: Experts Take a 2d Look At Virtue of Student Jobs

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Shane Jones sometimes catches a nap in class at Morgan Park High School, where he is an honor roll student. The reason is not boredom, he explains, but his job -- "the best job I ever had."
Every day after school, 17-year-old Shane heads for the DiCola fish market in southwest Chicago, where he works until closing time selling fresh fish. He gets home at 10 P.M., has a snack and does his homework. 
 "I don't go to bed until 1," he said, "and I get up at 6."
Shane is one of four million students around the country who work one or more jobs while going to high school, a practice that appears to be particularly American. The Third International Math and Science Study observed earlier this year that no other country had so many high school seniors working so many hours a day. Among American seniors surveyed, 61 percent reported working, for an average of 3.1 hours daily, as against only 28 percent of seniors abroad, who worked a daily average of just 1.2 hours.
Youth employment, all but unheard of in the 1950's, when only some 5 percent of students worked after school, is booming in the 1990's: roughly 1 in 4 American high school students has a job at any given time, and the United States Department of Labor estimates that 80 percent of them will have held at least one job before graduation.
The trend is driven by a plentiful supply of jobs in a service economy dependent on low-skill work perfectly suited for many young people, and by demand for employment from media-savvy teen-agers hungry for designer clothes and cellular phones, or saving for the rising costs of college.
But it has raised concern among educators, safety experts and legislators, who cite not only health and safety risks but also the potential toll on the working student's education. A panel convened by the Board on Children, Youth and Families of the National Research Council and the National Institute of Medicine is expected to issue a report and recommendations this summer. And some states, including New York, Washington, North Carolina and Maine, have already tightened laws governing youth employment, while others, like Massachusetts, are considering doing so.
"A heavy commitment to a part-time job during the school year -- say, working 20 hours per week or more -- significantly interferes with youngsters' school achievement and scholastic commitment," said one member of the youth panel, Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple University.
For 10 years starting in 1985, Mr. Steinberg surveyed 20,000 high school students in California and Wisconsin, and found that nearly a third of those who had jobs were frequently too tired as a result to do their homework. And those who worked more than 20 hours a week received lower grades and cut classes more often than their schoolmates.
The longtime prevailing view was that valuable occupational, social and developmental lessons that schools did not provide could be taught to teen-agers through after-school work. Among those who believe in the argument is Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.
"The debate has raged on a bit," said Mr. Hurst, who sat on the State Attorney General's child labor task force in 1996. "There's no doubt that a teen's No. 1 job is education, but there are many benefits to jobs: interpersonal communication working in a retail store, food safety skills, mathematical skills."
In one new report, however, educators working with the University of North Carolina's Injury Prevention Research Center recommend that adults re-examine the assumptions.
Jobs most often filled by teen-agers -- cashier, sales clerk, food service worker -- "lack challenge while imposing significant time pressure and stress," the study concludes. At this stage in life, the researchers say, more important lessons may be learned by taking part in school activities or simply reading.
Why do students work?
Most often, research shows, simply to have spending money rather than to help support their families or save for college.
Candice Landi, 18, a senior at John Muir High School in Pasadena, Calif., works 35 hours a week fitting shoes on customers and handling the cash register at the Athlete's Foot in the Pasadena Plaza Mall. She would have liked to play high school basketball, but there has simply been no time.
"My life is school and work," Candice said. "There's barely any homework. I have it, but I just get it done at school. If not, I do it really quick at night. I don't like school anyway."
Her salary has paid for a cellular telephone, a tongue piercing and clothes. She saves about $100 from her monthly paycheck of $700 but intends to spend the savings on her prom.
"I spend it all," she said. "I'm not good with money."
Glenda Kelly, 17, a C student at Newfield High School in Selden, N.Y., says her job at Sports Plus, a family entertainment center, does not interfere with her schoolwork. She earns the minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, and works 20 hours a week, until 7 or 8 at night; she needs to match money that her parents are giving her for a car. She says the long day does not make her tired.
"No, I don't sleep that much anyway," she said. "I wanted a job. Otherwise I'd just be at home watching TV, doing nothing."
Federal law limits 14- and 15-year-olds to no more than 18 hours of work a week during the school year, none of it after 7 P.M. on school nights; 16- and 17-year-olds can work as many as 48 hours and until 10 P.M., until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays if their jobs are in restaurants. (With the exception of a few kinds of jobs like newspaper carrier, the law bars children under 14 from nonagricultural employment.)
A few states have laws that are more restrictive. New York limits 16- and 17-year-olds to 28 hours a week during the school year, Washington State to 20.
Massachusetts, which now allows 16- and 17-year-olds to work 48 hours, is considering a tightening of its law.
"There are some who want 20 hours," said Mr. Hurst, of the Massachusetts retail trade group. "We want low 30's, which doesn't mean that's right for everyone. Families need to have a good discussion. It's an issue between student and parents. Some have to support their families."
The new law in Washington State also bars teen-agers from most job sites hazardous enough that adults wear protective gear there, and requires that an adult be in any store where a minor is working after 8 P.M.
"These are risky situations for robberies," said Mary Miller, chairwoman of the Occupational Health and Safety Section of the American Public Health Association. "I've had a 16-year-old say they were held up at knifepoint at Baskin-Robbins at 7 P.M., and the manager thought he should finish his shift. And no one told his parents it had happened."
Robberies are hardly the only danger, however. While Federal law bars anyone under 18 from a variety of hazardous jobs -- roofing, excavating, even operating power-driven bakery tools -- teen-agers are injured on the job at the same rate as adults. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimates that 70 youths are killed each year while working, and more than 210,000 hurt.
Many of the injured, researchers say, had received no safety instruction or were working without adult supervision.
It is not horseplay or recklessness that gets many teen-agers injured at work, experts say, but instead their desire to seem adult, their reluctance to ask questions or complain, their eagerness to please the boss.
The sense of work's value is so deeply ingrained that too often no one asks the right questions, said Letitia Davis, director of the Occupational Health Surveillance Program of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. "Parents want kids to work," she said. "Kids want to work. Employers want work. No one asks, 'What kind of work is good?' "
"I'm not opposed to work," Ms. Davis said, "but the challenge is how to provide meaningful, safe work."
Dave Bell, 18, a senior at Ward Melville High School in Setauket, N.Y., has just such a job. He works afternoons for eShareTechnologies, a software company, earning $8 an hour testing programs with three adults.
"I'm going to use the money for college," said Dave, who scored a perfect 800 on the math part of his S.A.T. He thinks a letter of recommendation from his employer helped him win admission to Cornell, where he hopes to study applied math.
"It gets a little tiring," he said of his job. "I go to school at 8 o'clock, and then don't get home till 6:30, 7 at night. But I definitely know a lot more than I knew when I started."
Rachel Frazier, 17, is also saving for college. She works about 20 hours a week at the Village Video in Chicago, where she checks out tapes and runs the cash register. It was nearly 10 o'clock, almost the end of her shift, when she was interviewed the other night. She does not worry about being robbed, she said.
"My father doesn't like it," Rachel said, "but he knows I need to save for the things I want."
At home she has chores, "mainly wash the dishes."
"It's the only thing my mom requires on the weekdays," she said. "Most of the time when I go home, I want to sleep."

Every day after school, Shane Jones works at a fish market until late in the evening, arrives home around 10 and then does his homework. Getting five hours of sleep a night, he sometimes finds himself napping in class. (Photographs by Lloyd DeGrane for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: In the Words of Albright: A Crisis of Partnership

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's address today to the National Press Club, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House:
The past year has been the most disappointing since the Oslo accords were signed in 1993. It was 16 months ago that active U.S. mediation helped to produce an agreement on Hebron. Since then, a crisis of confidence has arisen between Israelis and Palestinians that has stalled progress at the bargaining table and put at risk both historic accomplishments and future hopes. 
 In only two years we have gone from a situation where Israel had some form of peace negotiation, relationship or promising contact with every Arab state except Iraq and Libya to a stalemate which has eroded regional cooperation on issues such as water, economic integration, the environment and refugees; stalled Arab-Israeli contacts, and caused optimism to be replaced by a sense of fatalism and helplessness about the future.
At the root of the stalemate is a crisis of partnership between Israelis and Palestinians wherein short-term tactical considerations have too often trumped broader understandings of common interest and cooperation. Indeed, we have gone from a situation where no problem was too big to solve to a situation where every issue is argued about.
We have seen tragic incidents of terror, unilateral actions and provocative rhetoric undermine the historic accomplishments of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
For more than a year now the United States has been working hard to revive the missing spirit of partnership. We've been trying literally to restore the ability of the parties to talk constructively with each other, to overcome mistrust, to solve problems, to arrive at agreements and to implement obligations.
Early last year we were approached by Prime Minister Netanyahu with an idea for reorienting the process. He argued that the confidence-building period provided for under the Oslo accords had begun instead to destroy confidence. And he was right.
The Prime Minister argued that it therefore made sense to move directly into final status negotiations and to do so on an accelerated timetable. He asked President Clinton to help achieve this purpose. And as Israel's ally and friend, the President decided to try to do so. . . .
During this period, there was some narrowing in the differences between the parties. But very substantial gaps remained.
Despite our efforts we could not get the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to an accord. Both urged us nevertheless to persist and to help them find a way to bridge their differences.
By early this year we had come to the conclusion that even if the parties could not be responsive to each other's ideas, they might respond to ours. Working closely and quietly with both sides, we began to share our views on how the parties might resolve their differences over the four-part agenda.
In January here in Washington, President Clinton met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat, and I met with them when I traveled to the region in February and then again in Europe in March. Ambassador Ross and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been in almost constant contact. Throughout, we continued to urge the parties to sort out the issues directly with each. Unfortunately none of these discussions produced sufficient results. It was clear that tough decisions were required if Israelis and Palestinians were to reach an agreement that neither side was prepared to make.
Having worked since January to share our thoughts informally with the parties at the highest level, it was logical that we should at some point share a more fully integrated set of ideas in an effort to facilitate decisions. We took this step not because we wanted to, but because there seemed no other way to break the dangerous logjam that had developed.
Our ideas stem from intensive consultations with both sides and take into account both the obligations each side has accepted and the vital interests each must protect.
They are balanced, flexible, practical and reasonable. They are based on the principle of reciprocity, another concept stressed by Prime Minister Netanyahu and embraced by us, because of our belief that parallel implementation of each side's obligation is the only way to restore the partnership between Israelis and Palestinians.
In presenting our ideas, we made it clear that we were offering them as suggestions, not as an ultimatum or an effort to impose a settlement. Both parties have their own decision-making processes and interests, which we respect. Our purpose was only in response to the parties' request to help them find the way forward.
. . .
We're not giving any ultimatums, and we're not threatening any country's security. We're not trying to make any party suffer at the expense of another. All we're trying to do is find the path to peace, as the parties have repeatedly urged us to do.
And what we have especially been trying to do in the recent weeks is to issue a wakeup call.
The leaders of the region have reached a crossroads. Act before it's too late. Decide before the peace process collapses, and understand that in a neighborhood as tough as the Middle East there is no security from hard choices and no lasting security without hard choices.
The parties must understand, as well, that there is urgency to this task, for time is no longer an ally of this process. It has become an adversary.
The historic accomplishments that flowed from the Oslo process represent a strategic opportunity for peace that is now being put at risk. . . .
For the peoples of the region who have suffered too long the path out the wilderness is uphill, but clearly marked.
The time has come now before the dusk obscures the guideposts to move up that road, and by so doing, to answer the too-long-denied prayers of the children, all the children of the Middle East.
Thank you very much.

Nike Pledges to End Child Labor And Apply U.S. Rules Abroad

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from critics who have tried to turn its famous shoe brand into a synonym for exploitation, Nike Inc. promised today to root out underage workers and require overseas manufacturers of its wares to meet strict United States health and safety standards.
Philip H. Knight, Nike's chairman and chief executive, also agreed to a demand that the company has long resisted, pledging to allow outsiders from labor and human rights groups to join the independent auditors who inspect the factories in Asia, interviewing workers and assessing working conditions. 
 "We believe that these are practices which the conscientious, good companies will follow in the 21st century," he said in a speech here at the National Press Club. "These moves do more than just set industry standards. They reflect who we are as a company."
Nike said it would raise the minimum age for hiring new workers at shoe factories to 18 and the minimum for new workers at other plants to 16, in countries where it is common for 14-year-olds to hold such jobs. It will not require the dismissal of underage workers already in place.
Footwear factories have heavier machinery and use more dangerous raw material, including solvents that cause toxic air pollution. At overseas factories that produce Nike shoes, the company said, it would tighten air-quality controls to insure that the air breathed by workers meets the same standards enforced by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration at home.
Mr. Knight's pledges did not include increased wage, a major complaint of critics who say that Nike and other American companies pay workers in China and Vietnam less than $2 a day and workers in Indonesia less than $1 a day. (A 1996 World Bank report concluded that more than one-fifth of the world's population lives on less than $1 a day.) Still, even with much lower prices in these countries, critics say workers need to make at least $3 a day to achieve adequate living standards.
Nike, in a statement today, cited a report it commissioned in 1997, which said that its factories in Indonesia and Vietnam pay legal minimum wages and more.
In his speech today, Mr. Knight defended Nike's record of creating jobs and improving factory conditions abroad, but seemed to acknowledge that it was time for drastic action. "The Nike product has become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse," he said. "I truly believe that the American consumer does not want to buy products made in abusive conditions."
The initiatives announced today address the types of issues, like air quality, that were raised by an inspection report prepared for the company by Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm. The report, which found many unsafe conditions at a plant in Vietnam, gained force when it was made public by the Transnational Resource and Action Center, a nonprofit group that often criticizes conditions at American factories overseas.
Critics of Nike responded favorably to many elements of the plan released today, while noting that Mr. Knight had not promised to increase pay. They cautioned that he had not detailed which groups would be allowed to take part in the monitoring of factories or provided other details on that part of his commitment.
"Independent monitoring is a critical element of an overall system of improving labor practices," Mr. Knight said. "Nike's goal is to reach a point where labor practices can be tested and verified in much the same manner that financial audits determine a company's compliance with generally accepted accounting principles."
Monitoring labor standards abroad has divided industry members of a committee established by the White House to consider such standards of American corporations, preventing it for the past year from coming up with recommendations.
Jeffrey D. Ballinger, director of Press for Change, a group that has been critical of Nike, called the company's plan a major retreat and a sign of the critics' growing strength.
"I think on the health and safety question, it is a very significant statement," he said. "There is not a lot of wiggle room. They either fix it or they don't. I really, really believe they are going to get after that problem."
The company has been hurt by falling stock prices and weak sales even as it has been pummeled in the public relations arena, including ridicule in the comic strip Doonesbury and an encounter between Mr. Knight and the gadfly film maker Michael Moore in his new documentary, "The Big One."
Mr. Knight said the main causes of the company's falling sales were the financial crisis in Asia, where the company had been expanding sales aggressively, and its failure to recognize a shifting consumer preference for hiking shoes.
"I truthfully don't think that there has been a material impact on Nike sales by the human rights attacks," he said, citing the company's marketing studies.
But for months, the company, which spends huge sums for advertising and endorsements by big-name athletes, has responded increasingly forcefully to complaints about its employment practices, as student groups have demanded that universities doing business with Nike hold it to higher standards. In January, it hired a former Microsoft executive to be vice president for corporate and social responsibility.
Other critics, such as Thuyen Nguyen, director of Vietnam Labor Watch, were critical when the civil rights figure Andrew Young reported favorably last year on the company's efforts to improve conditions in its Asian factories, saying that he had glossed over problems.
Mr. Knight emphasized today that using objective observers to monitor working conditions would serve not just Nike, but eventually American industry in general, by "giving the American consumer an assurance that those products are made under good conditions."
Some critics, though, stressed that the company could not reassure consumers without improving wages in its factories.
"We see one big gap," said Medea Benjamin, director of the San Francisco-based human rights group Global Exchange. "A sweatshop is a sweatshop is a sweatshop unless you start paying a living wage. That would be $3 a day."

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Threat From India

 BODY:
India's explosion of three nuclear devices in the Rajasthan desert makes the world a more dangerous place. By arrogantly challenging international efforts to control the spread of the most lethal weapons, the new Hindu nationalist Government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee may win applause at home from those who confuse military might with self-esteem. But for a paltry and short-lived domestic gain, India now faces a ruinous cutoff in foreign aid, a self-defeating arms race with Pakistan and isolation even from friends.
With an economy that is slowing down, India needs help to ease its crushing poverty and overcome its many ethnic divisions. Yet President Clinton has no choice, legally or morally, but to impose broad economic sanctions, as he said yesterday he would do. Such an action properly is to include a ban on military sales and assistance, foreign aid and bank loans to the Government. Federal law also compels the United States to oppose loans and technical assistance from the World Bank and other financial institutions, which supply billions of dollars in credits vital to India's solvency. 
 Mr. Clinton has sought to improve relations with India and was planning to make the first Presidential visit there in 20 years this fall. But he should now reconsider. India might still clear the way for a useful visit if it stopped testing and signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It could justify such a step by citing China and France, which tested nuclear weapons a few years ago, provoking an international outcry, and then declared they would sign the treaty. It was India's founding Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who first proposed such a treaty a generation ago, and it is not too late for India to redeem his vision. Pakistan has said it would sign if India goes along.
India has much to be proud of as the world's most populous democracy. But its bitter colonial legacy has made Indian leaders distrustful of outside powers, especially those with nuclear weapons that lecture others about nuclear restraint. India justifies its latest tests by citing the military threat from its neighbors to the north and west. But beyond minor border disputes, China has no hostile designs on India. It is deplorable that China has aided Pakistan with its military program, but Pakistan, with or without nuclear weapons, is more than matched by India's conventional and nuclear capacity. By testing a weapon now, India is likely to provoke Pakistan and plunge both sides into more arms programs that neither can afford.
Less than a decade after the end of the cold war, the gravest threat of nuclear war is now shaping up in South Asia. As if to show sensitivity to global opinion, Prime Minister Vajpayee indicated that India had not yet moved to convert its capability into actual weapons. Mr. Clinton should seek India's pledge to exercise restraint in developing nuclear warheads and in testing missiles capable of delivering them. He can also press China to stop the flow of technology to Pakistan and thus reassure India about its security concerns.
It is fashionable in some circles to say that India and Pakistan are capable of managing their nuclear relationship, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did throughout the cold war. But the superpowers were lucky to avoid a war in 1962, and they built up an elaborate regimen of safeguards to preserve the peace, which India and Pakistan lack. In the end, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its efforts to keep up militarily. For India to avoid that fate, it must seek safety in arms control and restraint, not a nuclear buildup.

HEADLINE: Home Loans Discriminate, Study Shows

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 12

 BODY:
Racial discrimination and abuse by lenders of a Federal mortgage program are helping to create pockets of blight in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, according to a study of lending in the Chicago area.
The study, by the Chicago Fair Housing Alliance, an advocacy group, contends that lenders and real estate agents direct a disproportionate number of minority buyers to Federal Housing Administration loans. Since the loans are especially profitable for lenders, unqualified home buyers are given the loans and minority neighborhoods are pockmarked with the foreclosed homes of buyers who should never have been approved for the mortgage, the study concluded. 
 "Were any private mortgage lending or mortgage insurance institutions engaged in activities with such clearly differential impacts for white and minority communities, HUD and the Department of Justice would surely file suit for discrimination under the Fair Housing Act," said Calvin Bradford, a fair-housing researcher who wrote the study, which was financed by the MacArthur Foundation. The study is to be released on Wednesday at a hearing of a House housing subcommittee, where the study's author and others will testify.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which enforces fair housing laws and oversees the F.H.A., said that the study's portrayal of the agency was "rather extreme," but agreed that elements of the program "require additional improvement and reform."
The F.H.A. was created in the Great Depression to assist homebuyers who could not qualify for conventional mortgages. While F.H.A. loans allow buyers with less money for a downpayment to buy a home, the interest rates are usually higher than those for conventional loans.
Nationally, African-American and Hispanic homebuyers received F.H.A. loans more than twice as often as white homebuyers, which might be expected because minority home buyers have, on average, lower incomes and worse credit ratings.
But the researchers found a surprising pattern: As they looked at middle-income and upper-income minority neighborhoods, the percentage of F.H.A. loans did not decline, as it did for whites, but increased. Even high-income black neighborhoods had higher rates of F.H.A. lending -- 67 percent -- than low-income white neighborhoods -- 32 percent.
Steering by real estate agents explains part of this pattern. In tests of more than 50 real estate firms, agents steered minority buyers to minority neighborhoods, when the buyers had expressed no preference. Many agents also steered minority buyers to lenders that specialized in F.H.A. loans.
This occurred although, in every case, the minority "testers" had higher incomes and were more credit-worthy than the white testers.
The study found that Housing Department policies discouraged lenders from caring whether they were making sound loans. The fees that F.H.A. pays to lenders are twice as high as those for conventional loans. And by guaranteeing full repayment of mortgages, F.H.A. reduces a lender's incentive to make sound loans, the fair housing group contends.
"You have people being steered to F.H.A. who don't need it," Mr. Bradford said, "and at the low end of that market, people are being given F.H.A. loans who don't qualify, who shouldn't really have gotten any loan. We all want more minorities to receive loans. But HUD has never faced the side effects of its programs."
A HUD spokeswoman, Karen Hinton, said that Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo has toughened enforcement since he took office in 1997 and that the department has tightened its standards. Ms. Hinton also said that the high fees for lenders and the loan guarantees are necessary to induce lenders to make the loans. But she denied that they induced lenders to overuse F.H.A.
She agreed with one contention of the Chicago group: that the department could do more to push conventional lenders to lend to minorities.
In general, Ms. Hinton agreed that steering is a problem. "But it's not a problem with F.H.A.'s policy," she said. "That's lenders breaking the law. They see a minority person walk in the door and say, 'I'm not going to make a conventional loan to them.' We're doing everything possible to send a message to the lending committee that they're not going to get away with it."

HEADLINE: Bond Bonanza Amid Lilco Takeover

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: SYOSSET, N.Y., May 12

 BODY:
When the largest municipal bond issue in the nation's history went on sale this week, the telephones at the David Lerner Associates brokerage headquarters here began lighting up.
The Long Island Lighting Company, which many Long Islanders have resented for years for its high bills, was being broken up, and some were eager to get a piece of it. 
 At least one buyer said he had been waiting for the opportunity for more than a decade. "I've been overpaying Lilco for 40 years," said the buyer, who would give only his first name, Phil. Maybe, he said, the interest on the bonds being sold by the Long Island Power Authority would help make up for that.
All 150 brokers at the David Lerner offices were doing virtually nothing else but fielding telephone orders for the bonds. In just a day and a half, the brokerage concern had taken orders for about $25 million of the bonds. The gray and burgundy cubicles were still abuzz about the eager client who had come in the week before and ordered $2 million.
Such scenes were duplicated at brokerages around the region and the country as the Power Authority began marketing its first batch of tax-free bonds to pay for a $7 billion takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity service.
With savings from lower interest costs, Gov. George E. Pataki has promised to cut local electricity bills by 20 percent by summer. Islanders now pay the highest electricity rates in North America.
"A lot of my clients are calling me because they heard about it and are interested," said one Lerner broker, Ralph G. Haebich. "I had one walk-in client last night who drove all the way from Queens in the rain. The yields are very attractive, based on this market. Most people are yield-hungry, looking for the best interest rate."
The preliminary rates, subject to change when they are formally set on Wednesday, ranged from 3.9 to 5.6 percent, depending on a bond's maturity, whether it is insured and whether it is a variable or fixed rate. The final rate changes are not expected to be more than 0.15 percent.
The orders on Monday and today were limited to individual buyers, with $5,000 being the smallest denomination. Typical sales at Lerner were in the $25,000 to $50,000 range. On Wednesday the sale opens up to large institutional investors like mutual funds, property and casualty insurance companies and banks. Underwriters will market any remaining amount.
Anticipation had been building among the brokers as well as the buyers. On one computer, a sales assistant had designed a spinning LIPABONDS logo in vivid red, orange and green as her screen-saver.
Most brokers were busy until the sale ended at 1 P.M. today, when the office here cleared out a bit for lunch. "At 1, everybody finally took a breather," said Lerner's managing director of trading, William Mason. And when the nationwide sales by all brokerage companies were totaled later in the day, the figure was nearly $807 million -- well over the $500 million to $700 million range predicted by the Power Authority.
If all goes according to plan, by the end of the week the authority will have sold more than $3 billion of bonds. An additional $2 billion or so will be sold within a few months, and the rest will be sold this year or next.
The total of $7 billion would dwarf the largest previous municipal bond issues, $2.8 billion for a New Jersey state pension fund last year and $2 billion for the New Jersey Turnpike several years ago.
The investors who stand to gain the most are New York and Puerto Rico residents, for whom the bonds are exempt from local, state and Federal income taxes -- a triple exemption for New York City residents. Typical customers tend to be older, conservative investors or those in high income brackets avoiding taxes. But the interest rates are high enough to draw some out-of-state buyers as well.
To promote the sale, the Power Authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel, went on a tour pitching the bonds to investment analysts and mutual funds and other potential buyers. Cities on his trips included New Orleans, San Francisco, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, Hartford and Philadelphia.
"Richie Kessel did a good job in his road show," said William Mason, Lerner's managing director of trading. In staff meetings, the 150 brokers here and at Lerner's branch offices were all briefed on the sale. The company's 35,000 clients received a brochure enclosed with their monthly account statements last week, and the Power Authority promoted the bonds in radio commercials.
"There is a certain pizazz to these bonds," said Lerner's founder and president, David Lerner. Long Islanders, he said, are especially aware of the background, making for easier sales here.
"I am confident there will be a lot of happy investors, that it will deliver exactly as promised," Mr. Lerner said. He added he had followed his own advice. "I've taken a sizable position on the bonds myself," he said.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE BLUNDERS;
U.S. Blundered On Intelligence, Officials Admit

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The United States' inability to foresee or forestall India's nuclear tests, despite ample warnings, was a failure of both the Central Intelligence Agency and American foreign policymakers, Government officials said today.
After the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee called it "the intelligence failure of the decade," the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, asked retired Adm. David E. Jeremiah, a former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to lead a 10-day investigation into the intelligence community's failure to detect preparations at the test site in the Indian desert. 
 The site has been under periodic surveillance by photo reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping satellites, which recorded increasing activity. But the images and activities they recorded in recent days were not interpreted clearly or quickly by the C.I.A., officials said.
That oversight constituted "a colossal failure on the part of our intelligence agencies," said the chairman, Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. "Something went wrong. Somebody failed to do their job. To let this slip up on our policy makers, the President, the Secretary of State, without a chance to intervene in some way diplomatically with India was a huge intelligence failure. If we had an inkling that they were going to detonate one or more nuclear weapons, perhaps we could have intervened. We certainly would have tried."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, former Ambassador to India and former vice chairman of the intelligence panel, said the fault was not just with the intelligence gatherers.
"Why didn't the C.I.A. find this out?" he asked. "The question is why don't we learn to read? What's the State Department for? The political leadership in India as much as said they were going to begin testing. There's a tendency at the State Department to say, 'Gee, the C.I.A. never told us.' "
Administration officials defended their lack of knowledge and action by saying the Indian Government had fooled them into thinking that it would not conduct nuclear testing.
"They didn't just fool the C.I.A., they fooled the entire U.S. Government, and I'm the first to admit they fooled me, too," a senior Administration official said. "We were all just lulled into thinking they wouldn't do anything regarding nuclear weapons. They led us to believe they were not going to do anything precipitous. We made the mistake of assuming they would act rationally."
He added, "We had no clue."
Others said warning signs were everywhere, to be read by diplomats, as well as spies: the announced intentions of the new Hindu nationalist Government to make nuclear weapons part of its arsenal; the published pronouncements of India's Atomic Weapons Commissioner, who said two months ago that he was ready to test if political leaders gave the go-ahead, and recent missile tests by Pakistan that all but dared New Dehli to respond.
A result, Administration officials said, was the biggest breach in the arms-control net in years. United States policy on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons failed to prevent the test, and that could set off a chain reaction.
It is now far more likely that Pakistan, whose arms programs have immeasurably been aided by China, to the bitter resentment of India, will test a nuclear weapon, officials said. They said tonight that they were seeing signs that Pakistan was preparing to conduct a test.
The Indian test also increases the chances, they said, that Pakistan will retest its new medium-range missile, the Ghauri, named after a Muslim warrior who defeated a 12th-century Hindu emperor, Prithvi, which happens to be the name of India's most advanced missile.
George Perkovich, an expert on the Indian nuclear program and director of the Secure World program at the W. Alton Jones Foundation, said: "The Indians have been out there for months at the site. There was activity, but nobody in the United States said, 'Uh-oh, this means something.' "
Diplomatic silence played a role. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was appalled, her spokesman said, that Foreign Secretary Krishnan Raghunath of India met on May 1 with the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering, but gave no hint of tests.
But in hindsight, the evidence was nearly as clear as it was in December 1995. Then United States spy satellites saw thick electric cables being installed at a hole in the Rajasthan desert, evidence that India was preparing its first nuclear test since 1974. Word went out that Washington was watching, and India backed down. The test never took place.
The test site in Pokaran was buzzing again this month. But the spy satellites missed the clues. They were looking, but not closely enough to see clearly. The Indians disguised the activities. Sandstorms obscured the site, and in any case, neither the machines nor the people who analyze their output are infallible.
It takes decisions by policy makers and millions of dollars a day to adjust the satellites' orbits, so that they can focus intently 24 hours a day on a target. It is unclear whether the United States had round-the-clock coverage of the site. The satellites take pictures with high-resolution cameras and eavesdrop on telecommunications. But they do what their human masters tell them, and they failed to focus on what was really occurring in the Indian desert.
The focus was lacking for American policy as well, said Francine Frankel, director of the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania.
"This crisis has been in the works for a long time," Ms. Frankel said. "We assumed that we could separate our common economic interests and our differences on the nuclear issue. That was never realistic. There were many warning signs that it was impossible to bridge that gap. We are now faced with a question of whether we want to have a hostile relationship with India."
She said, and Mr. Moynihan agreed, that India saw itself as destined to be a global power and that United States policy makers had never understood that vision.
Nor did the Clinton Administration see that its failure to accomplish big cuts in nuclear arms gave India little reason to hold off becoming a nuclear power, Clinton and Bush Administration officials said.
When Pakistan held missile tests last month, the United States completely misread India's fury, Mr. Perkovich said, adding: "The U.S. mistook the silence for calm. They took it to believe the Indians were O.K. But they were coldly angered at the U.S. for, in their view, not constraining Pakistan." On Monday, unnoticed by Washington, that anger reached critical mass.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE POLICY;
CLINTON TO IMPOSE PENALTIES ON INDIA OVER ATOMIC TESTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
President Clinton decided tonight to impose a raft of economic sanctions on India's Government on Wednesday for detonating three underground nuclear explosions, senior Administration officials said.
The President's decision -- made aboard Air Force One as Mr. Clinton traveled to Germany -- came after a hectic day in which the Administration had offered India a way to avoid the sanctions if it would disavow any future testing or deployment of nuclear weapons, other Administration officials said. 
 But even as nations around the world condemned the tests conducted on Monday, New Delhi signaled no willingness to consider the Administration's demands, the officials said. By day's end, India's intransigence cleared the way for the harsh punishments called for in the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, which Congress passed and Mr. Clinton signed in 1994, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Behind that intransigence is the overwhelming popularity of the tests among Indians. Page A12.
The nuclear sanctions law, never before used, will cut off virtually all aid to India, bar American banks from making loans to its Government and restrict exports of computers and other equipment that might have military uses. It will also require the United States to oppose loans to India by the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
"There are no indications from the Indians that they are prepared to take any significant steps," a senior Administration official said tonight. Another official said India responded this evening by merely pleading for more time, without directly addressing the Administration's concerns.
The President's decision to impose sanctions swiftly came as other American Government officials said there were already indications that Pakistan appeared to be preparing a nuclear test in response.
Appearing at the White House this afternoon before he left the country for a meeting with other world leaders, Mr. Clinton said he was "deeply disturbed" by India's tests, although he stopped short of announcing the sanctions. Instead he called on India to conduct no further tests and to sign "now and without conditions" the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits all experiments with nuclear explosions.
The President's remarks largely echoed what Administration officials had conveyed to the Indians in private in a late appeal to persuade them to step back from their widely denounced decision to conduct India's first nuclear tests since 1974.
In a letter to Mr. Clinton that was dated Monday but disclosed today, India's new Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, did not address the proposals but simply offered an unrepentant justification for the tests. Although Pakistan has long been India's chief rival, Mr. Vajpayee cited its fears of China, stemming from border disputes, as well as China's support to Pakistan.
"Although our relations with that country have improved in the last decade or so, an atmosphere of distrust persists mainly due to the unresolved border problem," he wrote, referring to China. "To add to that distrust, that country has materially helped another neighbor of ours to become a covert nuclear weapons state."
The Administration's warnings were delivered to Mr. Vajpayee's Government this afternoon by Thomas R. Pickering, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. Senior State Department officials said Mr. Pickering had not explicitly offered the Indians anything, but simply outlined the sanctions India faced and sought to clarify its statement on Monday signaling a willingness to adhere to some terms of a ban on nuclear testing.
The other officials, however, said the National Security Council had resisted the State Department's recommendation to impose sanctions immediately today to allow the Indians time to respond to the appeals. The Administration's efforts underscored the scramble to find an effective way to respond to the tests, which re-ignited fears of an arms race in South Asia.
Senator John Glenn, the Democrat from Ohio who sponsored the sanctions law, said today that it was meant to impose punishment, swiftly and harshly. He said India's tests, in defiance of the international ban on testing, were an enormous setback to efforts to reduce nuclear weapons after the end of the cold war.
American aid and trade with India is relatively small, with about $7.7 billion in American exports and $7.3 billion in Indian imports. And compared with more freewheeling neighbors like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, India has relied less on borrowing from international commercial banks.
Still, the sanctions could have enormous political effect that could ripple through India's economy.
"I don't see a huge direct impact on American companies," said Marshall Bouton, executive vice president of the Asia Society, a nonprofit public education organization in New York. "But it's obviously deeply unsettling to U.S.-Indo relations, and there would be a chilling effect on trade in the short and mid terms."
The United States gave $142.5 million in direct aid in the last fiscal year, including developmental and food assistance, and such aid would end in the future. The Pentagon also announced today that sanctions would halt the modest military sales and training programs the United States has begun with India.
More significantly, India is the largest borrower from the World Bank, having borrowed $44 billion to date, including $1.5 billion this year. While the United States cannot unilaterally dictate how the World Bank lends money, it wields enormous influence that can be used to block consideration of India's programs.
At the White House today, Mr. Clinton said the testing "not only threatens the stability of the region, it directly challenges the firm international consensus to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
He called on "India's neighbors" -- without naming Pakistan and China -- "not to follow down the path of a dangerous arms race." He then warned that he would impose the sanctions called for by the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act.
Joining several other nations. the United States recalled its Ambassador to India, Richard Celeste. The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, also suggested that the tests might force Mr. Clinton to cancel his plans to visit India this year.

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: The Price for India"
India's recent nuclear tests have brought the U.S. to the brink of imposing sanctions as required under the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Act. Here are what the sanctions would affect.
 
WORLD BANK LOANS
There are 84 projects in India worth $14.5 billion financed by loans from the World Bank. Commitments in the 1997 fiscal year total $1.5 billion. The United States would oppose all loans.
 
I.M.F. LOANS
The United States would oppose all loans from the International Monetary Fund.
 
UNITED STATES AID
Most military and economic aid would be cut off. Aid totaled $142.5 million last year and is estimated at $141.9 million in 1998.
 
EXPORTS TO INDIA
1997 exports to India were $3.6 billion. Sanctions would affect products with military uses.
 
BANK LOANS
American bank loans to the Indian Government would be barred.

PACKARD BELL NEC TO CLOSE 2 PLANTS AND CUT 400 JOBS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Packard Bell NEC will close two plants and slash 400 jobs, or 5 percent of the work force, in an effort to cut costs and turn around the falling market share at the personal computer maker. Packard Bell said its plants in Fife, Wash., and Boxborough, Mass., would close and the notebook computer and sales and service groups and most of the engineering group that were based at those sites would move to the company's 400-acre headquarters in Sacramento, Calif. Last year, unit shipments for Packard Bell, the fifth-largest personal computer maker, fell 8.3 percent, and its market share slipped to 4.8 percent, from 6 percent, according to Dataquest Inc.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE SUBCONTINENT;
India Glows With Pride As Outrage Rises Abroad

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 12

 BODY:
The Indian Government won overwhelming support at home today for three nuclear tests it conducted in the desert on Monday, but senior officials hinted that they might try to soften the international outcry against them by considering signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
Murli Manohar Joshi, one official who hinted at a more amenable Indian position on the test ban treaty, also suggested that the Government was considering moving beyond the tests to the actual deployment of nuclear weapons, a step likely to generate an even stronger international response. 
 "Indian scientists will put a nuclear warhead on missiles as soon as the situation requires," said Mr. Joshi, a nuclear physicist who is the Minister of Science and Technology. He added: "India will not attack any state. The new capability will only deter an arms race."
The test ban treaty, adopted in 1996 and endorsed by 149 nations, has been shunned so far by India and Pakistan. But Indian officials in the Government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee attached conditions to any offer to sign the treaty. Mr. Joshi said New Delhi would abandon its opposition to the treaty if it were revised to set a deadline for all nations to eliminate nuclear weapons and to ban computer-simulated tests -- conditions already rejected by the United States and other established nuclear powers.
Endorsement of the tests came from most of India's most influential newspapers, from leading opposition politicians, from student groups, and even from Tushar Gandhi, a great-grandson of Mohandas K. Gandhi, India's apostle of nonviolence, who told the Associated Press that he was "proud it was done in India and by Indians." A leading Hindu nationalist who is the most powerful politician in Bombay, Balasaheb K. Thackeray, was thrilled. "We have to prove that we are not eunuchs," he said.
More cautious Indian commentators saw such reactions as premature, especially since the tests' full consequences could not be reckoned without knowing the reaction of India's arch-rival, Pakistan. Despite hawkish statements by some top Pakistani officials pledging "a matching response," reports from Islamabad indicated that the Government was weighing carefully what many there saw as one of the most critical decisions in the nation's history.
Islamabad's choice appeared to lie between responding with a nuclear test of its own, thereby risking the same economic sanctions that threaten India, or showing restraint, which would earn Western goodwill but risk the wrath of hardline Muslim groups, the armed forces and other powerful factions. Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former Prime Minister, has said the country has been ready to test for at least two years.
A measure of the pressures on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who returned to Islamabad today from Central Asia, came from Pakistan's top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan. "We are like a cook waiting for the orders," Mr. Khan said in a Pakistani newspaper.
Another pointer came from the politically powerful army chief, Gen. Jehangir Karamat. "So far we have not disappointed our nation in respect of our security capability and we will never disappoint our people now," he told reporters.
Prime Minister Sharif said Pakistan would not bow to Western pressures in determining whether to stage a nuclear test. "I will not accept dictation from outside in safeguarding the security of the country," the 48-year-old Mr. Sharif said.
Since a landslide election victory in February 1997, he has been widely criticized in Pakistan for heavy-handed pursuit of enhanced political power, which commentators have said might incline him to reach for the popular acclaim a nuclear test might bring.
But pressures on Mr. Sharif appeared to be finely balanced. As the meetings in Islamabad continued, President Clinton's announcement in Washington that he intended to implement economic sanctions against India set a high price for any nuclear test by Pakistan.
Some financial experts believe that Pakistan's tottering economy makes Islamabad especially vulnerable to one of Washington's economic weapons -- pressure on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to suspend credits. For years, Pakistan has escaped default on more than $60 billion of debt by taking emergency I.M.F. loans. Indian officials noted pointedly today that India currently has $26 billion in foreign exchange reserves and has no need for I.M.F. assistance.
Such was the support in India for the tests that even church groups seemed reluctant to condemn them outright. An ecumenical group representing India's leading Roman Catholic and Protestant bishops issued a statement noting that poverty in the Indian subcontinent made it "imperative" that the region's resources be devoted to helping people, but it supported one of the Government's rationales for the test. "The infirmities of the test ban treaty have contributed to the arms race among the poorer nations," the bishops said.
Crucially for the Hindu nationalists who lead a fragile 14-party coalition, the explosions seemed also to have been enormously popular with ordinary Indians. Informal interviews in New Delhi found no dissenters. "I was thrilled," said Daksha Rajan, a 27-year-old engineer.
Jaya Srivastava, a 36-year-old history lecturer at Delhi University, said: "It's a good step. Now we can talk as equals with other nuclear powers."
Marendra Haryani, a 52-year-old department store owner, said, "China has nuclear weapons, so why should we not have them?"
Some of the strongest cautions in India came from the financial sector, which has been depressed for 18 months by a sluggish economy and now faces the possibility of further setbacks from sanctions. One measure came on Bombay's stock market, where two leading indexes were down more than 5 percent today before recovering slightly.
But India's Finance Minister, Yashwant Sinha, told reporters that "India is not worried at all" about sanctions, and a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist group, was still more dismissive. "Let them go ahead with their sanctions," said K. R. Malkani. "They cannot blackmail us in this manner. We have to think of our national security first."

Doctors Accuse Insurers Of Bias Against Women

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A doctors' group has accused insurance companies of sex discrimination for covering the impotence pill Viagra but not birth control for women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists yesterday urged Congress to require insurers that pay for prescription drugs to cover contraception as well.
Contraception is a medical necessity, said Dr. Anita Nelson, a spokeswoman for the doctors' group meeting this week in New Orleans. 
 Insurers said that birth-control coverage was available but that many employers did not offer such benefits because of the cost.
While 9 of 10 employer-based health insurance plans cover prescription drugs, most did not cover prescription contraceptives, the doctors' group said. By contrast, nearly half of the almost 300,000 men who take Viagra each week are reimbursed at least in part, according to IMS Health, a consulting group.

HEADLINE: Buyout Funds Exploring Bid For Polygram

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Forstmann Little & Company and the Thomas H. Lee Company, two of the nation's largest leveraged buyout funds, are weighing a bid for Polygram N.V., the giant music company, several people close to the discussions said yesterday.
The team's investment banker, Allen & Company, has sent letters to both the supervisory board of Polygram and its parent company, Royal Philips Electronics N.V., the giant Dutch electronics company that owns 75 percent of Polygram, saying that they are interested in exploring a bid. So far, there has been no response to the letters, which were sent on Monday, one person close to the discussions said. 
 The Seagram Company, which owns MCA and Universal Studios, had already been in talks with Philips over a possible acquisition of Polygram. Seagram and Philips are believed to have set a deadline of Sunday to reach a deal. The possibility of a rival bid, however, may complicate matters since Philips would be obliged to consider it for the sake of its shareholders.
Officials from both Seagram and Philips declined to comment. The chairman of Philips, Cornelis Boonstra, was in New York yesterday.
Although the price being considered by either Seagram or the buyout firms is not known, Polygram, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, has a market value of $9 billion.
The letters from Forstmann, which is based in New York, and Thomas H. Lee, in Boston, do not mention a powerful Hollywood figure who could well play a role in a possible deal: Michael Ovitz, the former talent agency chief who was ousted in 1996 as president of the Walt Disney Company. Mr. Ovitz was instrumental in bringing the two firms together, people close to the discussions said.
Mr. Ovitz is a friend of Theodore J. Forstmann, the chairman of Forstmann Little, and is on the board of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, which is controlled by the firm. In addition, in a deal announced last month, Mr. Ovitz invested $20 million in and took control of Livent Inc., the troubled theatrical production company based in Toronto. As part of the deal, he and Mr. Lee, whose firm owns 8.5 percent of Livent, agreed to support each other's nominees for the board.
The possibility that buyout firms would bid for Polygram had some record industry experts scratching their heads yesterday. Seagram, which has a successful record company of its own, can offer economies of scale that are not available to the firms. Seagram could cut marketing, distribution and other costs, for example, that might save it as much as $200 million to $350 million a year, the industry experts said.
A leveraged buyout group, on the other hand, would probably have to put up $2 billion to $3 billion and borrow the balance to buy Polygram, whose artists include Elton John, U2 and Janet Jackson.
Though the numbers are not public, each firm is estimated to have a fund of about $4 billion. In general, leveraged buyout funds by policy do not put more than 25 percent to 40 percent of their funds into a single deal. But in some cases, to raise additional equity financing, they ask investors if they want to invest alongside the fund.
An offer from two buyout firms might appeal to the president of Polygram, Alain Levy, and his management team. They would presumably have a better chance of staying in place under a financial buyer with no management team of its own, than if Seagram bought the company. Both Forstmann and Thomas H. Lee are known to expand companies and then either sell them or take them public.
One reason that the two firms may be attracted to Polygram is that the record industry in general has a relatively predictable cash flow. For 1997, Polygram had revenue of $5.7 billion and cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $750 million. If not for losses in the film division, the figure would have been $55 million higher.
Mr. Lee, however, was quoted in Forbes magazine earlier this year as saying: "I'm willing to spend 8 to 10 times cash flow in any market for a company with strong growth characteristics." In the case of Polygram, the buyer would be paying at the higher end of that range.
Still, a financial buyer could sell off Polygram's money-losing film operation with its library of 1,500 films. And as one Wall Street investment expert put it, "The leveraged buyout funds are so bloated with capital that they have to look around for deals and they end up expressing interest in more mature companies than they would have bought two years ago."
If there is an offer for Polygram, it would mark the first time that Forstmann Little had joined with another firm to make an offer.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about a possible bid for Polygram, the giant music company, included an artist erroneously among those who record for it. Janet Jackson is on Virgin Records, which is owned by EMI Group P.L.C.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN RUSSIA;
Kremlin Soft-Pedals Its Rebuke to India, and Opposes Sanctions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 13

 BODY:
Russia today reaffirmed its refusal to join other countries in punishing India for resuming nuclear tests, and has so far failed to register an especially strong diplomatic protest.
President Boris N. Yeltsin still plans to visit India later this year. And some top officials at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy want to go ahead with plans to sell India two nuclear power plants. 
 "Sanctions are an extreme measure, which is not always productive," Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov said. "Therefore, I don't think we shall support any sanctions against India."
None of this means that Moscow is eager to see a nuclear arms race in Southern Asia. Russian diplomats have publicly deplored the blasts and say they hope Pakistan will not respond in kind.
Having decided to stop nuclear testing, the Russian military is not happy to see other nations flout the call for a worldwide ban on nuclear explosions.
"We deeply regret this action," Vladimir Rakhmanin, the chief spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said. "We believe we may influence India through political and diplomatic means."
But Russia's complaints have been muted and reflect its close commercial ties with India. Rosvooruzheniye, Russia's Government-owned arms export company, said last week that India was one of its largest buyers, no small consideration for military factories that have fallen on hard times.
The muffled criticism is also a matter of foreign policy. India's rivalry with China makes it a potential counterweight to Beijing in the Russian strategic calculus -- just as it was in Soviet times.
India's strained relations with Washington also make New Delhi a sympathetic partner for the Russian Foreign Ministry, whose influence has shrunk since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"In Russia's corridors of power they don't allow for the possibility of economic sanctions or the recalling of ambassadors," the newspaper Izvestia observed today. "Moscow seems ready to close its eyes to the violations of international norms."
Moscow's modulated reaction has undercut Washington's effort to teach the Indians a lesson.
The United States' sharp riposte after the blasts almost certainly came as little surprise to India. A tough response by India's friends, however, might have persuaded the Indian Government that its nuclear ambitions meant diplomatic isolation.
President Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin discussed India's tests and other security issues in a long telephone conversation on Tuesday, according to Sergei Prikhodko, an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin. But there has been no indication that Russia is prepared to harden its position.
"Frankly, India is a very good friend of ours and we have very good relations," Mr. Yeltsin said on Tuesday. "During my visit to India this year I shall make every effort to somehow overcome the problem."
India's tests have confronted Russia with a difficult decision: whether to sell nuclear power plants to India in a deal that is worth $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The contract was to be made final this year.
Moscow has argued that the nuclear plants are intended for civilian use and would be subject to international monitoring to prevent them from contributing to India's military potential.
But Washington has protested the sale, saying it violates a 1992 agreement among nuclear suppliers not to sell nuclear technology to aspiring nuclear powers.
The American objections were lodged long before India's latest tests, but the blasts have raised the stakes.
Viktor Mikhailov, the hard-line first deputy minister at Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, insists the sale should go through.
"Our contacts have deep roots," Mr. Mikhailov said, referring to Russia's relations with India. "And the competition on the global market for construction of atomic stations is very tough. So I hope that the leadership of our country will help safeguard this market for us."
Other Russian aides, however, suggested the sale might only go ahead if India assured the world it would abandon nuclear testing.
But while Russian officials defended their quiet diplomacy, Moscow seems to have no success in persuading India to curtail its nuclear program.
For all the close cooperation, Moscow insisted it had no advance warning of recent explosions.
"This nuclear test came as a big surprise," Mr. Yeltsin said on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Appeal to Indonesia Military to Stop Crackdown

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, concluding that it has almost no remaining diplomatic leverage with the Government of Indonesia to stem the growing violence there, has decided to dispatch a high-level military delegation to demand that the security forces end their attacks on civilian demonstrators, officials said.
They said the delegation of military officers, which is being led by Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, the commander of all American military forces in the Pacific, is scheduled to travel to Indonesia on Thursday to warn their Indonesian counterparts in blunt terms that the country could face collapse without restraint by the armed forces. 
The officials said that Admiral Prueher would make what one described as a "soldier-to-soldier" appeal for restraint to Gen. Wiranto, the chief of the 400,000-strong Indonesian armed forces.
The Indonesian security forces killed at least six students at an elite private college in Jakarta on Tuesday, and there were reports of looting and setting of fires today in the Indonesian capital. At least one person was killed this afternoon, when a runaway truck plunged into a crowd. The looting continued into the night, when crowds turned their anger on the familiar target of ethnic Chinese shopkeepers, with reports of people being trapped in burning buildings.
Administration officials said that the Pentagon hoped that Admiral Prueher's trip not be seen as an effort by the United States to side with the military against President Suharto, or with the military against anti-Government demonstrators.
"Our concern -- plain and simple -- is to do what we can to prevent the violence from spilling out of control," one said. "There is no other agenda. There is certainly no political agenda."
The Indonesian leader, who is facing the gravest challenge to his rule in the 32 years since he came to power, cut short an official visit to Egypt today to return home to deal with the turmoil, which began last summer with the collapse of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, and has since expanded into a large political uprising against the Government.
While General Wiranto -- like many Indonesians, he has only one name -- is seen as a reliable supporter of President Suharto, he is also described by associates as a thoughtful soldier who would ultimately put the interests of the nation and the military ahead of the interests of the Indonesian President.
The Pentagon's decision to dispatch Admiral Prueher's delegation, which has not been announced publicly, came as Defense Secretary William S. Cohen released a memorandum to his colleagues in the Pentagon in which he barred all routine travel to Indonesia without special approval.
Mr. Cohen said the order was made necessary by "the unsettled political situation in Indonesia and the related prospects for violence and instability."
Administration officials, speaking on condition that they not be named, stressed that the United States military would have no role on the ground in Indonesia unless American troops were needed in the evacuation of the nearly 10,000 Americans who live and work across that vast archipelago nation.
They said that no evacuation order was imminent, and that there appeared to be no special danger to Americans or other Westerners in the country. About half of the American residents of Indonesia live in Jakarta an its suburbs.
One reason for sending a military delegation, officials said, was that there seemed little hope that direct appeals to President Suharto for calm would have much impact given that he has dismissed appeals made in recent months by a series of foreign leaders and high-level American emissaries, including former Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
Mr. Mondale visited Indonesia in March at the request of President Clinton to ask that President Suharto abide by the terms of a $43 billion Western bailout for the Indonesian economy.
Admiral Prueher, the commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Command and the senior American military officer in the Pacific and Indian oceans, has been warning for months in his public comments of the possibility that Indonesia's economic crisis could undermine its political stability.
"It's the primary discussion point everywhere we go," he said in a meeting with reporters several weeks ago, warning that "the potential for instability has been high on our list for a while."
He is expected to meet both with General Wiranto, who took the post of armed services chief earlier this year, and Lieut. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, President Suharto's son-in-law and the commander of a 27,000-member elite Army unit that is responsible for security around Jakarta.
General Prabowo is widely seen as General Wiranto's chief rival within the Indonesia military, which has a direct political role in Indonesia through its control of a large share of the seats in the national Parliament.
General Wiranto drew cautious praise from many diplomats in Jakarta earlier this month when he announced the formation of a team of serving and retired military officers to study the need for basic political reform in Indonesia. "We agree all these demands should be channeled into the national agenda," he said. At the same time, however, he said that "criminals" were responsible for some of the recent demonstrations against the Suharto Government.

HEADLINE: 4 California Rivals Brawl in First Debate

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 13

 BODY:
The four major candidates for governor of California squared off today in the first face-to-face encounter of a primary campaign marked mostly by the cut-and-thrust of television advertising -- and promptly fell to squabbling over the cut-and-thrust of television advertising.
The 80-minute forum, sponsored by The Los Angeles Times, had no sooner begun than the two Democratic rivals of Al Checchi, a multimillionaire businessman making his first run for elective office, sharply attacked him for breaking his pledge not to run negative advertisements. 
 Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis and Representative Jane Harman both accused Mr. Checchi, who has spent some $30 million of his own money on the race, of lowering the standards of the campaign. Mr. Checchi later dismissed them as professional politicians seeking to further their careers and said he had simply drawn factual comparisons between his record and theirs.
Only State Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican whose name will be on the same ballot with the Democrats in the state's new "blanket" primary on June 2, emerged largely unscathed, styling himself as a relaxed California conservative in the Ronald Reagan mold and pre-emptively blunting Democratic efforts to paint him as extremist. The top vote getters from each party will face each other in November.
In an encounter carried live on local and cable television, radio and the Internet, the candidates fielded questions on substantive topics from bilingual education (all agree the current system has failed, but all oppose a proposed ballot initiative that would end it) to a projected state budget surplus (Mr. Lungren wants to cut the state's vehicle licensing tax; the Democrats would invest in education).
But there was no shortage of posturing, even when the posturing took the form of denouncing posturing.
"Too many macho politicians say 'Do it my way or not at all, and if you disagree with me, I'll tell the press something naughty you did when you were 12,' " Ms. Harman said in her opening remarks, summing up what would become a theme of the encounter. If a candidate breaks his promises in the campaign, she added, "you can be sure he's going to break his promises when he's elected."
But the telegenic Ms. Harman, who has veered from front-runner to third-place underdog in the polls since she announced her candidacy this winter, clearly saw the debate as perhaps her last best chance to turn her candidacy around. In her own closing statements she unleashed lacerating critiques of her rivals.
Ms. Harman accused Mr. Checchi of "attempting a corporate takeover of California," branded Mr. Lungren, who opposes abortion, as "out of California's mainstream," and turned Mr. Davis's own words against him, mocking his modest admission that it had taken him 23 years in state government to try to move the 15 feet from the chief of staff's office in the Statehouse, where he served former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., to the governor's suite. She countered, "I think we need bolder leadership."
Mr. Davis, whose grave mien is mocked by his colleagues, appeared relaxed, several times mentioning his service as an Army captain in Vietnam and his work for Mr. Brown, still a major figure but a lightning rod in California politics. He drew laughter at one point by arguing that the state needed to make teaching attractive economically "and, as my former boss used to say, psychically." Asked afterward if he thought associating with Mr. Brown was an asset among Democratic voters, Mr. Davis, who leads his Democratic rivals in the polls, drew laughter again by saying simply, "Jerry Brown is -- Jerry Brown exists."
Mr. Checchi, the former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, who has struggled to rise above 20 percent support in the polls, sometimes appeared nervous and his voice quavered a bit as he read from prepared notes to defend himself against his rivals' attacks and dogged questioning by one of the moderators, George Skelton, a veteran political columnist for The Los Angeles Times.
At one point, Mr. Skelton asked about Mr. Checchi's claim in a television advertisement that he had "marched with Martin Luther King for civil rights" -- which the Checchi campaign earlier acknowledged was a reference to how Mr. Checchi, as a teen-ager, attended the 1963 march on Washington with his father.
"We were looking for a verb," Mr. Checchi said. "I think everybody there thought they were marching." He said he had not meant to equate his participation with the heroic struggles of civil rights workers.
He also said his advertisements about his rivals were "factual" and "comparative" and "a response to the guff I've gotten for a year and a half now," from his rivals and their handlers, who have harshly criticized his record at Northwest.
Mr. Lungren had the easiest job, because his Democratic rivals were busy attacking each other, but he made the most of it. Many political experts in the state say he may have trouble winning the governorship as an opponent of abortion. But he sought to stake out narrow grounds on which he would act on the issue as governor, favoring parental consent for abortions by minors, opposing late-term abortions and favoring tough restrictions on taxpayer-financed abortions, positions that he said put him "in the mainstream."
Mr. Lungren also extended a major olive branch to the state's growing Hispanic electorate, announcing for the first time his formal opposition to the initiative that would end bilingual education, even while praising as worthy its supporters' goal of teaching immigrant children English as quickly as possible.
A recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 85 percent of likely voters in the state said the candidates' performances in debates would influence their votes. At least one other joint forum is scheduled, a bilingual session to be sponsored on May 23 by La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper, and by KMEX-TV, a Spanish-language television station.

HEADLINE: Panel to Vote on Measure To Tighten Bankruptcy Law

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
With the number of personal bankruptcies soaring, the House Judiciary Committee considered a controversial bill today, promoted by the banking and credit-card industries to make it more difficult for people to declare themselves legally broke.
By defeating several changes proposed by Democrats, the Republicans in control of the committee signaled that they would pass the bill, probably on Thursday. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to consider a somewhat less strict version as early as Thursday, and both houses could vote next week. 
 The bill, which the Clinton Administration has threatened to veto, would require an income test of those filing for bankruptcy and would constitute the first major change to bankruptcy law in two decades.
Banks and credit card companies argue that the measure is needed to allow them to recoup money from people who use the bankruptcy system to walk away from payments they are able to make. They estimate that of the 1.37 million people who filed for bankruptcy last year, 15 percent had the means to pay their debts. They said this amounted to about $4 billion in forgiven debt, which is passed on to consumers in higher prices and interest rates.
Critics of the bill -- most Democrats and various advocacy groups for consumers, victims, women and children -- complained that it gives credit card companies equal legal footing with single parents who are trying to recover alimony and child-support payments from someone who has filed for bankruptcy.
They contended that the collection agencies hired by banks, department stores and other creditors would be far more aggressive in recouping money than would, say, a single mother. Battling the credit industry in court for priority would leave the single mother even more destitute, they said.
Democrats cast the bill as "Mom versus Chemical Bank," in the words of Representative Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan.
Since 1903, Congress has required that anyone in bankruptcy still provide child-support and alimony payments, regardless of other debts. It has since expanded that requirement to include taxes and student loans.
The committee today rejected a sheaf of Democratic proposals to state in iron-clad language that the bill would not put women and children at a disadvantage. Republicans said the final language, as they amended it, offered such protection; Democrats insisted that it was open to interpretation, but they could not rally enough support for their view.
The 177-page bill would require those filing for bankruptcy to undergo a means test. If they had enough money, they would be funneled into Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy law, where they would be put under a court-ordered repayment plan, instead of being able to file under the more lax Chapter 7, where debt is often simply forgiven.
Debtors would be subject to Chapter 13 if they earned at least 75 percent of the nation's median income (now about $39,000) and had the ability to repay at least 20 percent of their debt over five years. Their child-rearing expenses, including support payments, would be subtracted before calculating the ability to repay 20 percent of their debt.
The Senate version would also take into consideration a person's income when he or she files for bankruptcy, but it would not require judges to send debtors into Chapter 13.
Representative George W. Gekas, the Pennsylvania Republican who authored the bill, argued that bankruptcy has become too easy, its stigma vanishing to the point where some people use it as a financial planning tool. The number of bankruptcies increased by 23 percent from 1996 to 1997, despite the booming economy, and is expected to increase again this year.
The bill has been a sleeper on Capitol Hill for months. But Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded the alarm in her newspaper column last week, writing: "I do quarrel with aspects of the bill that would force single parents to compete for their child-support payments with big banks trying to collect credit-card debt."
The Justice Department has recommended that President Clinton veto the measure, and the President chimed in Saturday with his wife's theme in his weekly radio address.
"If that competition starts," he said, "we all know who will lose the contest -- the children."

HEADLINE: Newest Data Ease Concerns About Rate Increase by Fed

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Retail sales rose for the fifth time in six months in April, while producer prices were hardly changed for nearly everyone except smokers, suggesting little reason for concern about the economy.
The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose half a percent in April after a flat performance a month earlier. Excluding sales of autos, the increase in retail sales was still half a percent. 
 In another report, the Labor Department said producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the first increase in seven months. The core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, also rose two-tenths of 1 percent. Higher tobacco costs accounted for about half of that increase.
Taken together, "it's a Fed policy maker's dream world," said Ken Mayland, chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland. "We've got strong growth and low inflation."
The Fed's policy committee meets next Tuesday to decide whether the economy's strength means that an interest rate increase is needed to prevent inflation from accelerating. Today's reports offered little reason for concern, analysts said. They described the increase in retail sales as moderate and noted that special factors had driven the increase in producer prices.
"From the Fed's point of view, this makes it easy for them to do nothing," said Robert T. McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York.
Today's producer price report showed that tobacco prices rose 3.4 percent in April, the biggest gain since September.
The Philip Morris Companies and RJR Nabisco Holdings raised wholesale cigarette prices by about 5 cents a pack in early April, as they sought to build up cash to pay settlements of health-related suits. The cigarette industry has raised prices more than 20 percent since September.
Colder, wetter weather in March helped push up food prices four-tenths of 1 percent; vegetable costs rose 6.9 percent.
Prices for intermediate goods and raw materials indicated that there was little inflationary pressure. Prices for crude goods fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in April, and the trend is likely to continue.
In the year's first four months, producer prices fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, as they did in the first four months of 1997. The core rate rose at a rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent, up from four-tenths of 1 percent in the 1997 period.
The rise in retail sales in April was broad, with gains in sales of building materials, autos, apparel and general merchandise. Still, April's increase of half a percent was a bit below the six-tenths of 1 percent that analysts had expected.
"We're starting the second quarter on a positive note, but it's not as robust as we saw during the first couple months of the year," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Sales of durable goods rose half a percent, and sales of nondurable goods were up six-tenths of 1 percent.
A booming housing market raised demand for building materials, hardware and garden supplies. Dealer incentives helped vehicle sales grow seven-tenths of 1 percent in contrast to February's decline of one-tenth of 1 percent.
Last week, retailers reported higher-than-expected April sales at stores open at least a year.

HEADLINE: For Wall Street, Big Fees In Bond Sale for Takeover

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The denizens of Wall Street may have been even happier than the residents of Long Island yesterday as the Long Island Power Authority sold $3.5 billion in bonds -- the biggest municipal bond issue ever -- to finance its takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company.
The takeover, which is supposed to cut utility rates by 20 percent, will put millions of dollars into the coffers of securities concerns and law firms involved in the deal. And it comes at a time when Wall Street is reaping record fees from mergers, takeovers and the sale of stocks and bonds. 
 In yesterday's installment of the complex Long Island utility takeover, the brokerage firms and banks that sold the bonds to investors were paid roughly $21 million, according to the Power Authority.
The money will be divided among the more than 50 firms that sold the bonds to investors, though the biggest share will go to Bear, Stearns & Company, the manager of the sale. Bear, Stearns, which served as the authority's financial adviser until last December, will also receive $4 million for its earlier work when the takeover occurs at the end of this month.
For some on Wall Street, the fees will be significant. "They'll make a good month's worth in a day or two," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. But he added that "it's not a real fee fest," given the size of the deal and the very low interest rates that the authority will pay. The interest rates will range from 3.9 percent to 5.57 percent.
Over all, Wall Street is likely to make about $72.5 million as a result of yesterday's sale and a $1.5 billion sale scheduled for the end of this month, said a spokesman for the Power Authority, who added that the final costs could well be lower.
The firms that underwrite the bond issues would receive about $25 million, according to the authority's estimate; the financial advisers, Bear, Stearns and Goldman, Sachs, would get about $8 million; various technical advisers would get $4.5 million, and lawyers, about $3 million.
But the biggest sum, about $28 million, will go to the insurance companies that guarantee $1.95 billion of the bonds, according to the Power Authority.
The authority is buying only part of Lilco, primarily its transmission system and its share of the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant, and is assuming the $4.2 billion of costs of the Shoreham nuclear power plant, which never went into operation.
The rest of Lilco will merge with Keyspan, which owns Brooklyn Union Gas. Merrill Lynch, which advised Keyspan, will receive $9 million when that transaction occurs, according to the offering documents; the firm is also a manager of the Power Authority's next bond issue.
Brooklyn Union and Lilco expect to spend almost $32 million on investment bankers, and more than $15 million in legal fees associated with their merger, according to documents they filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That is just a drop in the bucket for Wall Street, which has been doing a booming business in mergers and acquisitions. So far this year, about $655 billion of deals have been announced, more than in all of 1996, according to the Securities Data Company, which compiles statistics on Wall Street. About $917 billion worth of mergers were announced for all of last year.
Stock and bond sales have been booming as well; if the current pace keeps up, sales this year will easily surpass last year's record of $1.3 billion. Things have been a little quieter in the municipal bond business, but nevertheless, almost $97 billion of bonds have hit the market so far this year, before the Power Authority's deal.
"Things have been going gangbusters," said Richard Peterson, a spokesman for Securities Data. "We're 50 percent ahead of where we were last year."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE SANCTIONS;
Officials Are Uncertain as to How Punishing India Is Likely to Affect U.S. Businesses

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The sanctions that President Clinton imposed against India yesterday are likely to hurt a wide swath of American industry, but for most of those companies the impact will be small, executives and Government officials said. That is because India, while potentially a huge future market for American companies, is a small market today.
Indeed, the impact on American business is likely to be significantly less than that of the financial collapse in parts of eastern Asia. 
 Exports from the United States to India totaled only $3.6 billion last year, less than half the $8.61 billion to Thailand, one of those countries hit by the East Asian turmoil. Overall, two-way trade between the United States and India totaled $11 billion, a minute part of the overall United States total of $1.2 trillion. And despite the fact that India has more than a billion people, it accounts for only 0.8 percent of Coca-Cola's worldwide sales by volume.
Still, with Southeast Asia facing problems, India has increasingly been looked upon as a promising market and manufacturing site, especially since it has been opened to more trade and investment after a long period of virtual economic isolation.
"The number of companies here at the chamber that have an interest in India has tripled in the last year and a half," said Willard Workman, vice president, international, for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Given the breadth and immediacy of the sanctions the impact will be significant."
President Clinton announced the sanctions yesterday to punish India for detonating underground nuclear explosions. The sanctions would stop all foreign aid except for humanitarian purposes, ban military sales to India and the export of certain types of technology that could have military uses, prohibit American banks from lending to India's Government and also stop loans and loan guarantees from Federal agencies like the Export-Import Bank.
Companies scrambled to determine how they would be affected. Virtually all the companies contacted said it was too early to tell and declined further comment.
The biggest impact could be postponement or even cancellation of some contracts, like sales of jets by Boeing or the construction of power plants, telecommunications systems and other major projects that a developing country needs. Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters in Washington yesterday that his department has been promoting about $10 billion worth of projects in India on behalf of American companies.
"That shows a fairly large amount of projects, and I imagine a majority of them in one way or another would be affected by the sanctions," he was quoted as saying by the Bloomberg news service.
Boeing was given an order for 10 737's by Jet Airways Ltd., India's largest private airline, which officials in Washington say depends on financing from the Export-Import Bank and could now be cut off. Mark Hooper, a Boeing spokesman, said the company did not yet know how the sanctions would affect that sale, which was valued at $486 million when it was announced late in 1996. Three planes have been delivered.
Boeing has far more at stake in a potential sale of about 18 planes to state-owned Air India, which could be worth around $2 billion. It is possible the sanctions could tip the order in favor of a Boeing rival, Airbus.
The sanctions would stop new commitments being made to finance projects and exports to India by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, two Government agencies. But spokesmen for both those agencies said they believed that commitments already made would be honored.
The Export-Import Bank has about $500 million in pending loans or loan guarantees, which are likely to be suspended. It appears that most of that financing is for just two projects -- the Boeing sale to Jet Airways and a contract, valued at more than $500 million, to build a wireless telephone system, which was awarded last month to Hughes Network Systems, part of General Motors Corporation's Hughes Electronics subsidiary.
In addition, companies have shown interest, but have not yet gotten commitments, for projects that would require another $1 billion in loans or loan guarantees, a spokesman for the bank said.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides financing and political risk insurance, said about 80 American companies have expressed interest in getting help for projects there, making India one of the top five countries in terms of interest. The agency already provides $750 million in loans or insurance related to India to such companies as Enron, Motorola, US West and Bechtel.
Military sales to India, which will be stopped by the sanctions, are tiny because India has generally bought its weapons from Russia. In addition, there have been various restrictions on transferring technology to India, defense industry executives said. A State Department official said licenses were granted last year for about $40 million in military-related sales to India.
Lockheed Martin, the big military contractor, has only two small contracts in India. But it also has a $600 million contract to develop a commercial satellite communications system for a private Indian company. A Lockheed spokesman said the company did not know how it would be affected.
Enron Corporation of Houston is involved in a $2.5 billion power project, which became a political issue some time ago when the Indian Government temporarily canceled it.
Kelly Kimberly, a spokeswoman for Enron, said the company was assessing the situation but added, "We're optimistic about the project." The first phase is already more than 90 percent completed, but financing is still being arranged for the larger second stage.
Mr. Workman of the Chamber of Commerce said it appears that imports from India will not be affected. But companies that have operations in India could be affected if they cannot bring in parts.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
For 'Seinfeld' Viewers, a Super Bowl Party

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
According to the calendar, it's the second Thursday in May. But according to Madison Avenue, it looks a lot like the last Sunday in January -- Super Bowl Sunday.
Tonight's send-off for "Seinfeld" marks the first time that the final episode of a television series has taken on the trappings of a Super Bowl, the annual festival of commercialism that has become as much a day for marketers as for football fans. 
 The characteristics of the Super Bowl being displayed by the "Seinfeld" Bowl include a record commercial price being charged by NBC, expectations of a giant audience and efforts to present spots that viewers will judge to be special.
"I thought it would be pretty big, which is why we got involved," Liz Silver, vice president for advertising at Visa U.S.A. Inc. in Foster City, Calif., said yesterday, referring to a decision to become one of the sponsors of the "Seinfeld" sign-off.
"But it has turned out to be quite an event," she added, "comparable in many ways to a Super Bowl."
Visa and its rival, Mastercard International, rarely agree. But Mastercard will also run a commercial.
"The media interest has been 50 percent greater than during the Super Bowl," said Larry Flanagan, vice president for advertising at Mastercard in Purchase, N.Y., which also advertised during Super Bowl XXXII on Jan. 25.
"There's a Super Bowl every year," he added. "There's only one 'Seinfeld' finale."
The raging debate over whether all the attention being paid to the end of "Seinfeld" is hoopla, hyperbole or hysteria is irrelevant to a blue-chip list of advertisers that in addition to Visa and Mastercard includes the Anheuser-Busch Companies, Apple Computer Inc., the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, the General Motors Corporation, the Hershey Foods Corporation and Sony Pictures Entertainment. They have decided that the 169th and final episode of the series supposedly about nothing is actually worth something.
"We thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could get on the finale?' " said Lori Moskowitz Lepler, president at Intuition Group in New York, a unit of WPP Group P.L.C. that is participating with a commercial for the Clairol Nice 'n Easy hair coloring sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
"The show has an event-like status," she added, "and the characters -- crazy as they are -- have been embraced by most of America, becoming part of the fabric of our culture in the 90's."
So how does the "Seinfeld" farewell resemble a Super Sunday? Let's count the ways.
SUPER PRICES. Marketers are paying record rates to run commercials during the show just as they do for Super Bowl spots. NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, is charging an estimated $1.5 million to $1.7 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time. That surpasses the $1.3 million that the network charged for such spots during Super Bowl XXXII.
"Everyone's saying, 'Omigod,' " said Paul Benjou, associate media director at ABP Draft Worldwide in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. "But it's not so high if you look at what CBS charged for commercials in the last 'M*A*S*H' in 1983 and add 9 percent inflation a year."
The price for a commercial during "Seinfeld" tonight is more than twice the $650,000 that NBC charged only five years ago for the farewell episode of "Cheers."
"It's a helluva lot of money to pay, no question about it," Steve Sternberg, senior partner at TN Media in New York, a media services agency owned by True North Communications, said of the "Seinfeld" price tag.
"But the 80 million or 90 million viewers are a helluva lot more than you can get anyplace other than a Super Bowl," he added.
SUPER AUDIENCE. As noted by Mr. Sternberg, the estimates of viewers who will watch Mr. Seinfeld say shalom are huge. The biggest audience the series has ever drawn was for the penultimate episode last Thursday, which attracted almost 38.8 million viewers. NBC is projecting that up to 79 million viewers will tune in tonight.
Eisner & Associates, a Baltimore agency that traditionally conducts surveys about Super Bowl advertising, conducted one about "Seinfeld," too. Based on interviews with 1,000 adults from May 2 through May 4, Eisner predicts the audience could reach 110 million viewers.
"We think we're going to reach lots and lots of people, maybe as many as 90 million," said John Payne, vice president at the Animal Health Group of the Bayer Corporation in Shawnee Mission, Kan. His company will run a commercial by Bernstein-Rein Advertising Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., showing pets singing (literally) the praises of Advantage, a flea-control product.
"Our target audience is women 25 to 54," Mr. Payne said, "and it seems to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reach them in such numbers."
That is especially true given the radical remaking of broadcast TV.
"It's so fragmented now," Ms. Moskowitz Lepler said, because of viewer defections to alternatives like cable networks and the Internet. "Events that can garner large audiences are less frequent." That scarcity, of course, makes such events more desirable to mass marketers.
In fact, Ms. Silver of Visa said, just as the Super Bowl attracts an audience that "doesn't normally watch football, or even television very often," the "Seinfeld" exit is likely "to get a broader, deeper, more diverse audience" than a typical episode, expanding beyond the 18- to 34-year-olds who have been "the core 'Seinfeld' audience."
SUPER SURPRISES. Like a Super Sunday, many sponsors are offering spots they hope will be deemed better than conventional commercials. Some spots are appearing for the first time. Some are introducing products or services. Some are meant to surprise jaded viewers.
Visa, for instance, will present the premiere of a fast-paced spot by BBDO New York, part of Omnicom Group, centered on the Attic, a vintage clothing store in Las Vegas, Nev., where "the only thing that's out of style," an announcer declares, "is using American Express."
Intuition Group will run a spot for Nice 'n Easy with that brand's new spokeswoman, Kristen Johnston of another NBC sitcom, "Third Rock from the Sun."
And offices of McCann-Erickson Worldwide -- part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic -- will introduce a spot for Mastercard, announcing a shopping alliance with the Web site operated by Excite Inc., and a spot for the Buick division of G.M., introducing a campaign for the Buick Century carrying the theme "A luxury car for everyone."
In a departure from most Super Bowls, "Seinfeld"-mania is spilling over from television into print, as some advertisers sponsor singular ads with "Seinfeld" themes for magazines like Entertainment Weekly, People, Rolling Stone and TV Guide.
"So much of the 'Seinfeld' humor is about language, words," said David H. Steward, president and chief executive at TV Guide, a unit of the News Corporation in New York. "The creative directors at the agencies totally identify with it."
One product saluting "Seinfeld" in print is the Pond's Clear Pore Strips brand sold by Unilever Home and Personal Care. An ad created by the Ogilvy & Mather New York unit of WPP changes the product's usual message, "Bye-bye blackheads!" to "Bye-bye 'Seinfeld!' "
Another customized ad was produced by the Arnold Communications unit of Snyder Communications in Boston for the New Beetle sold by Volkswagen of America. The ad shows a yellow Bug above the headline "Never rule out a comeback."
Never say never, indeed. According to the supermarket tabloid The Star, Mr. Seinfeld is talking to NBC about a "Seinfeld" reunion show next year.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Super Bowl in May?"
The unprecedented advertiser interest in the final episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld has created a marketing event similar to a Super Bowl. Many of the commercials during the series finale will emulate Super Bowl spots in that they will be new to viewers, introduce products or try in some fashion to be out of the ordinary. Here is a list of advertisers scheduled as sponsors, in alphabetical order, and their plans for the Seinfeld farewell.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE CRISIS;
Pakistan Looks Ready to Test Its Own Bomb

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Pakistan is preparing for an underground nuclear test that could take place as early as Sunday, American officials said today, citing clear signs from spy satellites, foreign agents and Pakistan's political leaders.
Diplomatic, military and intelligence officials said Pakistan could test a nuclear warhead sometime next week in response to five tests that its regional rival, India, has conducted since Monday. It would be Pakistan's first test of a nuclear device and would add one more country to the list of nations that openly possess a nuclear weapons ability. 
 Despite the certain and severe economic and political consequences for Pakistan, and the effect such a step is bound to have on the already soaring tensions in the region, "no one expects them to not have a test," an Administration official said.
President Clinton hastily sent a high-level diplomatic team to Pakistan today after a discouraging telephone conversation this morning with Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The President said he asked the Prime Minister "to resist the temptation to respond to an irresponsible act."
But "Sharif was not able to give that reassurance," said Karl F. Inderfurth, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs. "He told the President that he was under tremendous pressure to respond."
At that point, Mr. Inderfurth said, President Clinton offered to send his envoys to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. The President then assembled a delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, who commands United States forces in the Middle East and southwest Asia. The group left Washington tonight.
The delegation intends to paint a grim picture of the consequences of a test, especially the severe economic penalties for Pakistan, Administration officials said, and to use political persuasion, diplomatic tact and economic pressure to try and stop a test.
Pakistan would suffer the same financial sanctions as India did today -- a prohibition on private American bank loans, as well as the threat of the loss of World Bank and International Monetary Fund assistance.
The World Bank has $4.4 billion worth of programs under way in Pakistan, and the I.M.F. has offered Pakistan a new $1.56 billion, three-year loan program, only about $208 million of which has been disbursed. The money not already in the pipeline would be barred.
India also lost American military and economic aid, which totaled $145 million this year. The United States already ended all military and economic aid to Pakistan in 1990, after it declared Pakistan capable of making nuclear weapons.
Pakistan has been capable of conducting a nuclear test since the early 1990's, American officials say, and has produced enough fissile material to build about a dozen warheads. The warheads, apparently based on a Chinese design, can be mounted on missiles.
The test would be conducted in the Chagai Hills, a remote site in the Baluchistan desert, near Pakistan's western border with Iran. One of the warheads would be lowered down a deep shaft, attached to cables and sensors, and exploded.
Pakistan's political leaders have made it plain that they intend to respond to India in kind. India's tests "will not go unanswered," Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan told the nation's senate today.
In addition to these kinds of public pronouncements, American spy satellites have detected military equipment and technical personnel making preparations for a test at the Chagai Hills site.
Foreign intelligence agents in Pakistan have also reported that the test could be conducted immediately, for maximum political effect, or later next week, for a greater yield of technological data, officials said.
Few American officials were confident that the delegation sent by President Clinton tonight could stop the test without offering something concrete in return.
The best hope, they said, was for the United States to convince the other seven large industrialized nations who will attend an economic summit this week in Birmingham, England, to place economic penalties on India so severe that they would deter Pakistan from a test.
"We need to bring to bear all of the political will, not only of this country but certainly of all of our allies, to come down very hard on India and to discourage Pakistan from following suit," said the Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen.
Gary Milhollin, a leading expert on the spread of nuclear weapons, said: "If I were Pakistan's Prime Minister. I would wait two weeks to see what the world does to India. If the world builds such an uncomfortable box that I don't want to live in it, I would hold off. If the world doesn't react, I would go full speed ahead."
But the American delegation intends to offer no economic or military incentives to bargain with Pakistan, officials said -- only warnings of the dangers of a test.

HEADLINE: Software and Hardball

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
For all the attention Microsoft's antitrust confrontation with the Justice Department has received, for all the headlines and all the commentary on the subject, it often seems that the Government is stepping into what is essentially an intramural spat within the software industry.
To most people, the debate quickly becomes a baffling excursion into the arcane language of computing -- Web browsers, operating systems and Internet programming languages. And it is, after all, a dispute that pits the very rich software mavens from the Netscape Communica tions Corporation against the incomprehensibly rich ones from the Microsoft Corporation. 
 At a time when the nation's economy is surging and its high-technology industries are the envy of the world, many people wonder if this a fight Washington should join. And why, they ask, should anyone outside the software business really care about the Government's escalating battle with Microsoft?
The Government and the Attorneys General of more than a dozen states are expected to announce that they are filing broad antitrust suits against Microsoft soon, probably today, on the eve of the company's plan to ship its next-generation operating system, Windows 98. It will then be up to the courts to determine whether the cases amount to an economically wise and legally innovative application of antitrust policy to the information age or unnecessary meddling.
But it is already clear that the impact of the Government's policy toward Microsoft could extend well beyond the software business, potentially to all manner of industries from autos and banking to travel and entertainment.
"Virtually every discussion we have with companies about their strategy begins with one word: Microsoft -- how do you compete against Microsoft in the future?" said David Nadler, chairman of the Delta Consulting Group, which advises corporations in many fields. In industry after industry, executives share a sentiment expressed last year by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation: "Everybody in the communications business is paranoid of Microsoft, including me."
Such worries about Microsoft have little to do with intricacies of computer programming. They center on the perception that Microsoft, through its near-monopoly in personal computer operating systems, has a chokehold on the PC desktop, as the main Windows screen is known.
What is more worrisome to many people -- and of great concern to the Justice Department -- is that when the Windows desktop is fused with browser software for viewing sites on the World Wide Web, the operating system becomes a portal to the Internet. This makes the desktop extremely valuable real estate. By determining which icons appear by default on its desktop, Microsoft can steer users of Windows computers to its own sites on the Internet or to the sites of companies that pay Microsoft for a desktop position.
The Government, in its suit, is expected to try to break Microsoft's grip on the desktop by allowing PC makers to personalize customers' requests for Internet services and to load those services before shipping the machines. The Government is expected to argue that unless Microsoft's contracts with PC makers are pried open, there is a danger that the company will be able to extend its operating system monopoly into the emerging new markets of Internet commerce and entertainment.
In addition, the Government's suit is expected to ask that Microsoft be prohibited from requiring computer makers to install its browser, Internet Explorer, as a condition of licensing Windows. This would enable PC makers, if they chose, to instead install browsing software from rivals, like Netscape.
It would also calm nerves in a number of other industries, since Microsoft has its own Web sites for travel reservations, car retailing, city guides and personal finance. Its on-line bill-paying service will start later this year.
In Windows 98, the operating system and Internet browsing software are seamlessly integrated with a "channel bar" of featured Web sites, including Microsoft's.
"The broad issue is: Does Microsoft control a bottleneck, and what are the limits to that control?" said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "How much of Internet commerce will Microsoft manipulate, if not capture? The answer is we don't know. But Microsoft's potential control of the Internet bottleneck is at least scary to anyone trying to set up commerce on the Web."
The business of Internet commerce, information and entertainment is small today but growing rapidly. Forrester Research Inc. projects that it will increase tenfold, to $350 billion, in the United States by 2001. Increasingly, it is expected, people will venture onto the Internet to shop, find information and be entertained -- especially as televisions shift to the digital technology of PC's. Windows 98 includes software to enable users to view its television-and-Internet service, Web TV, on their PC screens.
What businesses from car companies to banks fear is that Microsoft, by controlling the gateway to the Internet, will become an indispensable intermediary between them and their customers. And while the Government suit will also focus on other issues, Microsoft's control of the desktop to direct Internet traffic "was the real trip wire that created this sense of alarm in Washington and in other industries," said David Readerman, a software analyst for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
Even so, widespread fears about Microsoft's market power do not make an antitrust case. To win, Microsoft's lawyers contend, the Government would have to show not only that Windows is an indispensable gateway to the Internet but also that its only reason for including certain Internet services or links to featured Web sites was to harm competitors.
If Microsoft could show a benefit to consumers or business justification for its practices -- even though those practices harm rivals -- the company insists that the courts should rule in its favor.
"The antitrust laws do not dictate a level playing field," said Charles F. Rule, a former director of the Justice Department's antitrust division and a consultant to Microsoft. "The fact is, many PC users and software developers want the Internet features Microsoft has included in its operating system, both in Windows 95 and now in Windows 98. There is a business justification for what Microsoft has done."
Besides, some analysts say, worries about Microsoft ruling the Internet are probably wildly exaggerated. Mr. Readerman of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities estimated that Microsoft lost $500 million last year on its Internet commerce and programming ventures.
George F. Colony, president of Forrester Research, asserted: "So far, Microsoft has shown itself to be pretty inept at Internet commerce. I think the idea that Microsoft is going to kill General Motors or Disney someday is nonsense."

GRAPHIC: Photo/Chart: "Windows 98: Microsoft's Internet Dashboard"
Antitrust allegations against Microsoft could delay the shipment of Windows 98. Here is a look at some of the features of Windows 98 and the antitrust questions they raise.
 
The Channel Bar -- The Government says it enables Microsoft to steer PC users toward its Internet services and those of preferred partners. This power, the Government believes, could give the company an unfair edge in new markets for Internet commerce, news and entertainment. Microsoft says the channel bar benefits consumers by making it easier to find things on the Net.
 
Internet Explorer -- The Government is expected to ask a Federal court to stop Microsoft from requiring PC makers to include it as a condition of licensing the Windows operating system. Microsoft says its Web browsing software is an integrated feature of Windows, not a separate product that can be easily lopped off.
 
Web TV -- Microsoft's Internet-and-television service is not much of an issue yet since PC makers have been reluctant to install TV tuner cards needed to receive and display TV programming on a PC. (pg. D3)

HEADLINE: Retreat on Times Square Subway Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has allowed the developer of one of four office towers in Times Square to scale back the size of a new entrance to the busiest subway station in the country, at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue.
In return for eliminating a requirement to build two escalators, the developer, Rudin Management, agreed to pay the authority $1.3 million. But transit advocates and leaders of civic groups say that the deal shortchanges the city and is only the latest example of how a $160 million subway renovation that was once a centerpiece of the redevelopment of Times Square has been greatly reduced. 
 Under a 1994 agreement governing development of the Times Square tower, the developer is required to build a stairwell at least 12 feet wide with two escalators, as well as the escalator pits and machinery room, and to maintain the escalators for 25 years. But on April 29, the M.T.A. board approved an amendment allowing Mr. Rudin to delete the escalators in return for a $1.3 million payment. According to a report by the authority, the Rudin group, which is in partnership with its main tenant, Reuters America, offered to build an "upgraded marquee and canopy over the entrance" for $250,000 at the authority's expense.
The advocates said they fear the deal would encourage the other Times Square developers to expand their valuable retail space by cutting back subway entrances at the other new buildings, which together would house about 18,000 workers and add to the millions of tourists and New Yorkers who jam the streets and subways of Times Square. Street-level retail space in Times Square now rents for $250 a square foot and more, real estate brokers say.
"The developer got off cheap," Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the New York City Transit Riders Council. "It was very shortsighted to cut the escalators. People who need an escalator now have to cross Seventh Avenue, not the easiest street to maneuver."
More than 250,000 people a day pour through the Times Square subway stations, which are badly in need of capital improvements, even as the old theaters on 42d Street are being revived and as Disney, Warner Brothers and Virgin music store are revitalizing Times Square. Under a plan scrapped in 1994, the developers of the four office towers would have put $90 million into a $160 million renovation of the Times Square stations. Since then, New York City Transit has spent years designing a more modest, $85 million renovation program that is to be put out to bid next winter, without any direct contribution from the developers.
"The original promises are fading rapidly," said Joseph Rappaport, coordinator of the Straphangers Campaign, a subway riders' advocacy group. "In Times Square right now, you've got Disneyland above and Hades below."
William Rudin, who is building a 32-story office tower for Reuters, the giant British information services company, with more than $62 million in tax breaks, contends that the city is getting a good deal. The developer will build a 15-foot-wide subway staircase inside the new building to replace the existing stairwell at 42d and Seventh. Mr. Rudin, and the transportation authority, said that the escalators were not not needed because of the relatively short drop from the street to the subway mezzanine below. Instead, Mr. Rudin said, New York City Transit gets $1.3 million that can be invested in more worthwhile projects.
"You're getting a stairs, a new design for the canopy and a million-plus dollars to do something the M.T.A. thought was more important than putting in an escalator," Mr. Rudin said. "We think it's more bang for the buck for the public."
But Ms. Dolinsky, the local community board and the Municipal Art Society said that the transportation authority got the short end of the deal. Lola Finkelstein, the chairwoman of Community Board 5, which includes the Times Square, added that the deal was approved by the agency without any public comment.
"The M.T.A. has never maximized the potential of what they could get from developers," Ms. Dolinsky said.
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority, was unable to answer specific questions about the deal. But, speaking of Rudin Management's $1.3 million payment to eliminate the escalators, he said, "We felt it was proper compensation."
Mr. Rudin said that the $1.3 million payment exceeds the cost of building and maintaining the escalators. But some experts questioned that estimate. Stuart Lerner, a senior associate at Vollmer Associates and a transportation consultant, said that the escalators alone would cost from $600,000 to $1 million, not including maintenance.
The transit and civic advocates now expect Mortimer B. Zuckerman's Boston Properties, which is buying the rights to develop two other office sites in Times Square, to reduce the size of four subway entrances it is required to incorporate into the two towers.
Robert Selsam, a vice president with Boston Properties, said that he was unaware of Mr. Rudin's new deal with the M.T.A.
"I'm sure there'll be some negotiations with the M.T.A.," Mr. Selsam said. "I don't know what they'll involve at this point."
Conceived in the early 1980's, the Times Square redevelopment plan granted extensive tax breaks to the developers of four proposed office towers in Times Square, who would in turn, renovate nine old theaters and provide $90 million for the $160 million renovation of the Times Square subway stations that state officials at the time said would feature an open subway mezzanine with a two-story rotunda and "access for the elderly and handicapped."
But after a recession and years of delays, the state and the city scrapped that plan in 1994, relieving the developer of the obligation to directly finance the subway renovation, much to the chagrin of the Municipal Art Society and other civic advocates. A new agreement stipulated that a portion of tax revenues from the four office towers would be used to reimburse the authority for some of the subway project's cost.

House Narrowly Approves Financial Services Changes
By just one vote, the House has approved far-reaching banking legislation that could eliminate Depression-era restrictions on the financial services industry.
The legislation, approved by a vote of 214 to 213, allows for the merging of banks, securities firms and insurance companies into financial conglomerates able to operate globally with far fewer regulatory restrictions than they now face. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation later this year, but its chances for passage there remained unclear, and it could face a veto from President Clinton. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Sale of Bonds For Lilco Deal Is a Success

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., May 13

 BODY:
The Long Island Power Authority's first bond sale was a hit on Wall Street. Although the offering was the nation's biggest municipal bond issue ever, demand far outstripped the supply. When the sale ended today on the initial $3.5 billion offering, it had attracted $18 billion in orders.
"It's like nothing the municipal bond market has ever seen," said Daniel Keating, the senior managing director for the lead underwriter, Bear Stearns & Company. "It was a fabulous success. There's tremendous buying support for this deal." A complex priority system will be used to allocate the bonds among the buyers. 
 The sale provided Gov. George E. Pataki with the cash needed to fulfill his promise to lower Long Island's soaring electricity bills, a goal that has long eluded other public officials. Under the Governor's plan, the target date for cutting the bills is just a month away. Mr. Pataki's appointees on the Power Authority plan to use the bond money to buy the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity service on May 28 and lower rates almost immediately.
Lilco's bills, the highest in the continental United States, average $100 a month for a typical homeowner. The planned cuts, 19.1 percent in Suffolk County and 20.9 percent in Nassau and the Rockaways in Queens, would save the average customer about $240 a year.
In addition, Mr. Pataki has promised to send, in the fall, refund checks of $101 per customer in Suffolk and $232 in Nassau and the Rockaways. The checks would be part of the settlement of a $1.2 billion court judgment that Lilco won for excess property taxes levied on its never-opened nuclear plant in Shoreham. Lilco has paid those property taxes by raising rates on consumers, who would now receive refunds.
The Power Authority, meeting here tonight, unanimously approved the bond sale, which was the first round of $7 billion in bonds that the agency plans to sell over the coming months for the Lilco takeover, the refinancing of the Shoreham debt and its own operations. The agency also set the final interest rates on bonds sold this week. They range from 3.9 percent for bonds maturing next year, to 5.57 percent for those maturing in 2029. The interest is exempt from local, state and Federal income taxes, making the bonds especially attractive to higher-income residents of New York City and state. The key to cutting the electricity bills is the authority's refinancing of Lilco's debt, most of it for the Shoreham plant, with the lower-cost municipal bonds. As a state agency, the authority would also save money by avoiding corporate taxes and not paying stock dividends.
Opponents of the Lilco takeover said they were preparing new litigation in an effort to stop the deal. Their past challenges have yet to succeed, although some lawsuits are still pending and the Suffolk County Legislature is planning a nonbinding referendum on the deal in November. The opponents contend that the takeover would unduly enrich Lilco, saddle Long Islanders with a huge debt and fail to maintain the lower rates.
Gordian Raacke , the director of a court-appointed watchdog group called the Citizen's Advisory Panel, said at tonight's Power Authority meeting: "A 33-year sentence is being imposed on the ratepayers for a crime we didn't commit." He was referring to the bond repayment and the cost of the never-used Shoreham plant.
The critics also cited the latest of several news reports on political ties to the Lilco deal, an article today in The Wall Street Journal. It detailed "a suspicious pattern" of political donations, political hirings and other connections involving the major underwriters of the bond issue, especially the lead firm, Bear Stearns, which is receiving millions of dollars in fees for handling the sale. The article suggested that political favoritism played a role in choosing the underwriters.
One group opposed to the deal, the New York Public Interest Research Group, sent a letter to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District, Zachary W. Carter, calling on him to conduct an investigation into the allegations.
The Power Authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel, denied that there was any political favoritism in designating the underwriters. "The selection of underwriters was based strictly on their qualifications in a highly competitive process, and had nothing to do with politics," he said.
Bear Stearns issued a statement today that did not directly discuss its political activities but said: "Every meeting, every decision, every selection by Lipa has been part of an open process that has been designed to meet the mandate of reducing the crushing cost of electricity on Long Island.
"Based on merit, expertise and past performance, Bear Stearns will successfully bring our portion of the bond issue to market," the statement continued.
Governor Pataki declined to comment on the issue, but said he was delighted with the deal's progress. "Investors clearly recognize this as a great deal," he said in a statement issued in Albany. "But it's even a better deal for the ratepayers who save 20 percent on their electric bills, get significant rebates and avoid massive property tax hikes."
Without the settlement of the Shoreham tax case, Suffolk property owners would have faced higher taxes to refund Lilco's excess property tax payments. Under the Pataki plan, the Power Authority would buy Lilco's transmission and distribution lines, its customer service and billing divisions and its 18 percent share in the Nine Mile Point 2 power plant upstate. Lilco's stockholders have agreed to the deal. The remainder of Lilco -- its top administration, generating plants and natural gas business -- would merge with Brooklyn Union Gas and its holding company, Keyspan.
For the first several years after the takeover is implemented, the Power Authority would hire the merged company to supply the power and run the system. Within five years, all customers would be offered a choice of competing electricity suppliers, but they would have to pay fees for using the Power Authority's grid system.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
U.S. Markets Are Bolstered as Investors Flee Rout in Asia

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market advanced yesterday, but apparently without any real zeal.
The Dow Jones industrial average limped to a new high. Other major indexes, while moving higher, remained below their recent highs. 
 The move came even as Asian markets were falling with riots spreading in Indonesia, worsening the outlook for the country's already troubled economy. While early today the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down slightly, 3.7 points, to 9,465.59. it fell 8 percent yesterday. The main Indonesian stock market index fell 6.6 percent yesterday, and the currency, the rupiah, dropped almost 12 percent in value. The Nikkei index in Toyko was up slightly this morning at 15,381.22, and it rose slightly yesterday.
India's stock market dropped 4 percent yesterday after the Government announced that it had completed a second round of nuclear tests.
Jitters in emerging markets tend to spread quickly, and there were some signs of that yesterday in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru.
On the New York Stock Exchange, some of the emerging country funds were among the biggest losers in percentage terms. The Templeton Russia Fund was down 2 1/16, to 29 11/16, the Morgan Stanley India Investment Fund, fell 1/2, to 8 1/8, the India Fund finished down 3/8, at 7 5/8, and the Morgan Stanley Russia and New Europe Fund dropped 7/16, to 20 15/16.
Investors have tended to dismiss the Asian economic turmoil recently, so a revival of their focus on the problem could add to volatility.
"I don't know if this tips the scale" into a new round of concern about Asia," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "The reality of the matter is that the investors should never have stopped being concerned."
Mr. Cliggott said that the strong openings of the stock market over the last several sessions may indicate a new wave of capital reallocated from Asia to the United States. He said foreign investors have a tendency to buy in the morning in New York, and there were similar sharp jumps at the market's opening last fall, when many investors worried about the Asian economic crisis.
With the policy makers at the Federal Reserve scheduled to meet next Tuesday to discuss the economy and the direction of interest rates, there is likely to be some restraint in trading, leaving the way open for a stronger rally if the Fed, as many analysts expect, decides to leave interest rates unchanged.
Traders and analysts said yesterday's reports on producer prices and retail sales were unlikely to give the policy makers a reason to move interest rates higher because they neither indicated a resumption in inflationary price pressures or cleared up the question of how strong the pace of economic growth is in the beginning of the second quarter.
Fed policy makers are likely to wait until they have more information on growth in the second quarter before they act because inflation appears under control. They did signal recently, however, that they were likely to raise interest rates if the economy did not soon show signs of slowing from the 4.2 percent pace of growth in the first three months of the year.
The Dow industrial average rose 50.07 points, to 9,211.84, surpassing the previous high of 9,192.66 reached on May 4. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 3.07, to 1,118.86, up only half as much as the Dow in percentage terms. Its high was 1,130.54 on April 22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index finished at 1,866.18, up 6.02. Its high was 1,917.61, also on April 22. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks rose 1.35, to 477.48. Its high of 491.91 was on April 21. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing issues by a small margin.
General Motors, American Express, and Hewlett-Packard, led the Dow higher. Microsoft helped push both the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq higher despite the threat of antitrust suits against the company from the Federal Government and 12 states.

Treasury Prices Advance
By Bloomberg News
The price of Treasury securities rose yesterday for a second consecutive day after retail sales and producer price reports soothed concern that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates soon. Investors snapped up $12 billion of new 10-year Treasury notes.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 102 20/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.94 percent, from 5.97 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A $1 Billion Development Is Proposed For Hartford

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 13

 BODY:
Three major Hartford companies that have seen the value of their property plummet with the city's fortunes unveiled an ambitious $1 billion downtown development plan today that features a convention center and sports stadium.
Still, no private money has been committed to the project, the largest proposed in Hartford in decades. The fact that it was conceived by the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, the Travelers Insurance Group and Connecticut Natural Gas, whose headquarters are all on or near the site of the proposed project, has given the plan more credence than past proposals here. 
 The proposed project, to be built on 35 acres near the Connecticut River, features shops and housing in addition to the convention center, which would be attached to the stadium. Project leaders said they hoped it would make Hartford more than a rest stop between New York and Boston.
"It really doesn't do us any good to bemoan the fact that we're neither New York nor Boston," said Robert W. Fiondella, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Phoenix, as he released the plans today at a Hartford Common Council meeting.
With 75 million people traveling on highways through the city each year, he said, "We need to find a way to give a reason for those people to stop a while and enjoy Hartford."
In the past, insurance companies have helped develop the downtown area, including Aetna Life and Casualty, which helped create the Hartford Civic Center Mall, which the company still owns.
Yet so far, none of the three companies involved with today's announcement has committed any significant money to the project. They are paying for feasibility studies and said they would help seek developers. Connecticut Natural Gas has agreed to move its headquarters and steam plant, located in the midst of the site for planned complex, to make room for it.
Despite this, the state last week approved $300 million in funds for development in Hartford, and a good chunk of that money could go toward the waterfront complex. Pending results of a final feasibility study, project leaders said the city could break ground in as soon as a year.
The president of the State Senate, Kevin B. Sullivan, said that he hoped Hartford could have the success that Providence, Baltimore and other cities have had in using their waterfront to revitalize downtown.
"This is the first project of magnitude that has decided to capture the best resource that Hartford has and that we have traditionally pushed away from, and that is the river," Mr. Sullivan said. "It gives an ambiance. It gives a reason to be."
The plan is the largest of several development projects now being proposed for Hartford. Other ideas include building a higher education center downtown to house two community colleges and university graduate programs and renovating the Hartford Civic Center, which contains shopping and a 15,000-seat arena.
Called Adriaen's Landing for the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, who in 1614 became the first European to reach Hartford, the project aims to make Hartford lively seven days a week, both during the day and at night. Hartford is now often deserted on weekends and at night, unless special events are going on.
The largest piece of Adriaen's Landing, to which the state has dedicated $155 million of the $300 million in bond money, is the convention center, with 893,000 square feet of meeting space, exhibition area and ballroom, as well as the 35,000-seat sports arena, where University of Connecticut teams, among others, might play. Nearby, the plan calls for a 700-room convention hotel.
About a block or so away, the plan provides for an entertainment and shopping complex.
The project also calls for 200 one- and two-bedroom apartments, which are key to bringing life to Hartford outside working hours, said Michael P. Meotti, president of the nonpartisan Connecticut Policy and Economic Council Inc. "What good about it is it's not a real estate project based on building buildings," Mr. Meotti said. "It's based on human activities. Buildings don't make a city. Human activity makes a city."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
INDIA CARRIES OUT 2 MORE ATOM TESTS DESPITE SANCTIONS

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 13

 BODY:
Less than 12 hours after President Clinton appealed for a halt to all nuclear testing by India, the country's Government carried out two underground tests today to add to the three blasts it conducted at the same testing range in the northwestern desert on Monday.
In the defiant spirit it showed with the earlier explosions, the Government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee approved the new tests knowing that the United States, Japan and other nations were preparing to impose economic sanctions for the first series of explosions. 
 At a news conference in Berlin less than two hours after the new blasts were announced, Mr. Clinton announced wide-ranging American sanctions, including an end to most American aid to India and a pledge to use the United States vote to deny India loans and other help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
In other reaction, Japan announced that it had frozen new grants to India and would consider cutting some of its much bigger loan programs. Similar measures halting, reducing or deferring aid were announced by a number of other nations, including Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Page A13.
Appearing before Hindu nationalist supporters who showered him with rose petals in the garden of his New Delhi residence, Mr. Vajpayee said the punishment being exacted by the United States and other nations was part of the price India had to pay for assuring its own defense. He spoke shortly before Mr. Clinton announced the sanctions, but after news reports from Washington that Mr. Clinton had taken the decision to impose the measures during his overnight flight to Germany.
"We have come to understand that we will be denied aid, credit and other assistance, and that we will face problems," Mr. Vajpayee said. "But in the event of such steps, the country will have to face them squarely. If the path ahead is a difficult one, we will not shy away from it."
The new tests were carried out close to the site of the original blasts, near the village of Khetlai in the Thar desert of Rajasthan state, at 12:21 P.M. New Delhi time (2.21 A.M. Eastern Standard Time), less than 48 hours after the first tests.
A statement by India's Ministry of Science and Technology described the latest explosions as having been in the "sub-kiloton range," indicating that they had only a fraction of the combined force of the blasts on Monday. The earlier explosions were measured by an Indian seismic institute at 55 kilotons, more than 50 times as powerful as the American atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The statement said the new blasts completed "the planned series of tests" that Indian nuclear experts have said were aimed at developing nuclear warheads for a variety of Indian weapons systems developed in recent years. Among these is a ballistic missile with a range of about 1,500 miles, known as the Agni. The missile is thought to have been the intended delivery vehicle for the largest of the devices tested on Monday, identified in Government statements as a "thermonuclear" or hydrogen bomb.
The latest blasts were accompanied by the same olive branch that the Vajpayee Government held out after Monday's blasts -- an offer to "consider adhering to some of the undertakings" in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty concluded in 1994, which has been signed by 149 nations, but not by India or its archrival Pakistan.
The Vajpayee Government has not said what parts of the treaty it might accept, but it has repeatedly said that it would not give up nuclear weapons unless the five established nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- agree to the eventual elimination of their own arsenals. This is a condition that all the five powers have repeatedly rejected.
The steps announced by Mr. Clinton appeared likely to hit hard at an Indian economy that has just begun to accelerate under market-driven reforms. In addition to the aid restrictions and the vow to block India's access to funds controlled by the I.M.F. and the World Bank, these included a ban on American banks making loans to Indian state institutions and tight restrictions on the sale of computers and other equipment with possible military uses.
Indian officials vowed not to be pushed off course by the sanctions, but Indian financial markets appeared less confident.
After steep falls on Tuesday in the wake of the first round of tests, the country's three most important stock exchanges registered further sharp declines, with a drop of more than 4 percent in the key Sensex index in Bombay, most of it in the first 30 minutes after the latest round of blasts was announced.
Stock exchanges in New Delhi and Madras each registered a fall of about 3 percent, and the Indian rupee came under heavy selling pressure in the currency markets.
Indian financial analysts said the economic effects appeared to have been more severe than expected by the Government, which said on Monday that it had weighed the possible impact on the economy when it approved the tests. Indian commentators said the country's Hindu nationalist leaders also appeared to have been jolted by the almost universal condemnation of the tests by other nations, which have placed India in an isolation unknown in the country's 50 years as an independent nation.
Indian economists have disagreed on the impact that aid cutbacks will have on the economy, but most have agreed that the most severe penalty would be a cutoff of loans by the World Bank, which has lent more than $44 billion to India. The bank had also planned to lend another $3 billion this year for a wide variety of projects, from programs to fight AIDS to projects for building bridges, dams, highways and power plants. Official statistics put the size of India's economy, measured in terms of the value of all goods and services, at about $270 billion a year.
Some Indian economists have said that all foreign aid amounts to less than 1 percent of this total, and is thus insignificant in the overall economy; others have said that the real risk lies in a collapse of investor confidence that could tip the economy into a downward spiral.
In any case, Mr. Vajpayee, 72, vowed to ride out the sanctions when he appeared before a jubilant crowd that gathered at his official residence in a show of support.
The display by his supporters, who garlanded him with a huge bouquet and waved banners, was symptomatic of the nationalist euphoria that has swept the country in the wake of the nuclear tests. Similar demonstrations have been reported all over India, including one in Bombay at which youthful Hindu nationalists pierced their fingers and signed their names in blood on a charter approving the tests.
An opinion poll published in today's editions of The Times of India said 91 percent of more than 1,000 adults questioned in six of the country's largest cities, including Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi, had approved the first series of tests. The poll showed that 82 percent favored the deployment of nuclear weapons, a step the Vajpayee Government has said it would take "as soon as the situation requires."
Perhaps most startling, while 52 percent of those polled said they did not think India would fight a nuclear war with Pakistan in the next 10 years, 32 percent said they thought a nuclear conflict was possible.
Sounding more wistful than triumphant, Mr. Vajpayee said the tests were not simply a matter of muscle-flexing by the Hindu nationalists, who ended 50 years as India's political pariahs when they emerged from an election two months ago with the largest parliament bloc, then formed a 14-party coalition Government.
"This was not a political gimmick," he said. "For us, the country's security was paramount. These tests were above politics. Approving them was our right, and our duty."
The Indian leader said he hoped that the United States and other nations that have condemned the tests would rethink their positions and realize that the nuclear treaties that India has been urged to sign, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, were discriminatory since they did nothing to force established nuclear powers to give up their own arsenals.
"Our hope is that those nations that want to continue their nuclear monopoly will accept that the same rules should apply to all," he said.
Aides to Mr. Vajpayee spoke more bluntly, accusing President Clinton of double standards.
"The American position is hypocritical," said K. R. Malkani, a spokesmen for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist group Mr. Vajpayee leads. "They are sitting on a mountain of nuclear arms, and they are pontificating to India and the world."
Brajesh Mishra, principal secretary to the Indian leader, said that the United States relied on nuclear arms for its own safety, and extended its nuclear umbrella to cover many of the countries that are now condemning India. "Canada enjoys nuclear protection; Australia does; New Zealand does; Japan does; Germany does; Italy does", he said. "They haven't given up their protection, but they want to deny similar protection to us."
Mr. Vajpayee noted that the tests have been broadly supported, or at least not condemned, by most of India's political parties. The opposition Congress Party, which led India to independence and was in power when the only previous Indian nuclear test was detonated, in May 1974, has demanded that the Vajpayee Government spell out the threat that prompted the tests, but has stopped short of criticizing them. "The Government should let us know the seriousness of the threat, and from which quarter it comes," said Natwar Singh, a spokesman for the Congress party leader, Sonia Gandhi.
For some opposition politicians, the tests have posed a bind. Even among those who worry about the destablizing effect of the tests, there has been a reluctance to hand the Hindu nationalists a populist issue that could carry them to a parliamentary majority in the next election from their current position with 170 of the 545 seats.
At the same time, many of these politicians suspect that the tests were part of a strategy by hard-line Hindu nationalists to create a wave of popular support, then maneuver to force a new election the nationalists might win in a landslide.
These suspicions hardened today when Indian newspapers reported that an extreme right-wing nationalist group had published a weekly journal shortly before the tests that strongly suggested that the group knew beforehand that the blasts were imminent. The journal, Organizer, is the mouthpiece of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or National Volunteer Force, a shadowy nationalist group that has been described by its Indian critics as neo-fascist. Many of the new Government's top leaders, including Mr. Vajpayee, have been members of the group, known as the R.S.S., since they were teen-agers.
The journal devoted its entire issue to a commemoration of the 1974 test, saying that the earlier blast had put the world on notice that India was not a nation to be trifled with. At least two of the articles urging a resumption of nuclear testing were written by top nuclear scientists, including one by Rajendra Singh, the R.S.S. leader, who has made no secret of his wide-ranging influence over the new Government.
"We cannot afford to forego our nuclear option when everyone around is arming himself to the teeth," Mr. Singh wrote.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Calls Tests a 'Terrible Mistake' And Announces Sanctions Against India

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 13

 BODY:
President Clinton sharpened his criticism of the Indian Government today, calling its decision to detonate five nuclear explosions underground a "terrible mistake" as he announced a raft of economic sanctions in reprisal.
On a two-day visit to Germany, the President disclosed the sanctions this afternoon after meeting in Potsdam with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr. Clinton decided to impose sanctions while flying here on Tuesday night, before India surprised the Administration with two additional tests this morning. Although they had not expected the tests today, Administration officials had feared that they might take place eventually, because Indian officials had refused to rule them out. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich attacked Mr. Clinton for punishing India while overlooking China's sale of missile technology to Pakistan and Iran.
"Look how angry he is at a democracy and how tolerant he is of a dictatorship." Mr. Gingrich said.
Although Mr. Clinton repeatedly expressed sadness and even bitterness over the nuclear tests, he also sounded a note of understanding, suggesting that India, which he called "a perfectly wonderful country," may have been motivated by a lack of self-esteem because it believes it is "underappreciated" as a world power.
"And they think one reason may be that they're not an out-front out-of-the-closet open nuclear power," Mr. Clinton continued. "Well, I think they've been underappreciated in the world and in the United States myself."
But, as Mr. Kohl chuckled at his side, Mr. Clinton added that to try to "manifest your greatness" by detonating thermonuclear devices and atomic bombs "when everybody else is trying to leave the nuclear age behind, is just wrong."
"It is just wrong," he added.
The Administration had anticipated further tests because Indian officials were evasive when asked about their plans on Tuesday by Thomas R. Pickering, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. "There was a lot of hemming and hawing," a senior Administration official said today.
American intelligence detected activity at the bomb site after the tests on Monday, one official said, but it was not clear whether the Indians were cleaning up from the first tests or preparing for more.
A Federal law mandates that the President impose sanctions against a nation that conducts such tests, although it permits him to delay acting for 30 days. Mr. Clinton decided against such a delay after learning that Mr. Pickering had not received a straight answer, officials said.
Mr. Clinton said that the Indian tests "clearly create a dangerous new instability in their region." He said that in a telephone conversation this morning he had urged Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan not to respond to India with tests of its own.
But although the Administration continues to press Pakistan not to act, officials said privately that they expected the pleas to go unheeded.
The President did not sound optimistic, saying of Mr. Sharif, "The pressures on him at home are probably enormous."
Even so, Mr. Clinton did not go as far as Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms said at a hearing today, "India's actions clearly constitute an emerging nuclear threat to the territory of the United States."
On Capitol Hill, there was widespread criticism of India and, despite Mr. Gingrich, general support for the President's action. But that was combined with widespread criticism of the failure to anticipate the tests.
"Why didn't anyone in the Administration or in this Congress notice that the Hindu national party had campaigned on a promise to make India a nuclear power?" asked Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who is on the Intelligence Committee.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl made statements and responded to six questions today on the terrace of the yellow San Souci Palace in Potsdam in what was once East Germany. It was while at the Potsdam conference after the defeat of Nazi Germany that Harry S. Truman, the last American President to visit there, learned of the first successful nuclear test in history, by the United States at Trinity site in New Mexico.
Mr. Kohl did not join Mr. Clinton in immediately announcing sanctions. But he said that Germany would "make it very clear that this was the wrong decision for them to take."
Later in the day Germany called off talks set for next week in Bonn.
Mr. Clinton is planning to attend the annual international economic summit known as the group of seven beginning on Friday in England. The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said he hoped that the participants would "issue a very strong and clear statement condemning the action of India."
Mr. Berger called the sanctions "fairly substantial and powerful" and said that the Administration would wait to gauge their effects before taking further steps against India over its tests today.
The sanctions shut off not only direct aid from the Federal Government to India, worth $142.3 million this year, but they also cancel an assortment of Federal loans and loan guarantees worth billions. Further, they compel the Administration to oppose any loans or loan guarantees from international financial institutions to India, which had expected to receive $3.8 billion from pending loan approvals.
The sanctions also affect companies that do business in India, and they cancel licenses of American arms companies to export munitions to India and block pending licenses. The sanctions prohibit loans by American banks to the Indian Government, except to buy food or agricultural supplies.
After his meetings in Potsdam, Mr. Clinton returned here to address German officials in the Schauspielhaus concert hall. Calling the end of the cold war "the opportunity of generations," the President surveyed American-German and American-European relations and laid out new missions for NATO, which was formed to contain the Soviet Union.
Mr. Clinton called for NATO to defend against threats like weapons proliferation and ethnic violence; to promote economic growth; to strengthen democracy, particularly in Russia, and to enhance global cooperation to protect the environment and combat terrorism.
"In a world grown smaller, what happens beyond our borders touches our daily lives at home," Mr. Clinton said. "America and Europe must work together to shape this world."

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.
 
Opera
 
NEW YORK GRAND OPERA. For years, Vincent La Selva has been earning the gratitude of budget-conscious opera buffs for his free summer performances in Central Park of complete operas, completely staged, in a budget-conscious sort of way. Mr. La Selva is halfway through a seven-year effort to perform the entire canon of Verdi operas, in order, during his summer series, which is either a bold stroke or insanity. This weekend, the indefatigable and musically knowledgeable conductor will present excerpts from "Puccini's "Boheme" for a benefit concert in Flushing, Queens, to support the Verdi project, which needs all the support it can get. Sunday at 2 P.M., the garden adjacent to Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, (718) 463-7700. Tickets: $125, which includes a champagne dinner with a French menu (Anthony Tommasini). 

Classical Music
 
ANONYMOUS 4 AND LIONHEART. These two outstanding vocal groups get together for a program devoted to the two outstanding composers of half a millennium ago. Johannes Ockeghem's music is generally magnificent and somber, unable or unwilling to deliver the secrets of the contrapuntal logic its long lines follow. Josquin Desprez's, by contrast, is full of High Renaissance light. Tonight at 8, St. Michael's Church, Amsterdam Avenue at 99th Street, Manhattan, (212) 678-5432. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and the elderly (Paul Griffiths).
BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC CHORUS. Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms" is one of the most deservedly respected sacred works of the 20th century. Rossini's "Petite Messe Solennelle," which will be performed with the Stravinsky on a program by the Brooklyn Philharmonic Chorus, may not seem to be in remotely the same class. But Rossini's seldom-heard work is remarkable: a tender, reverent, skillful and elegant mass setting composed in 1863, almost 35 years after Rossini had retired from opera. Douglas March conducts. Tomorrow at 7:30 P.M., St. Augustine's Church, Sixth Avenue at Park Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 633-2479. Tickets: $10 (Tommasini).
CANTICUM NOVUM SINGERS. Finally, the big day. Here, divided between afternoon and evening concerts, are no fewer than 11 of the 25 Bach cantatas the chorus is presenting this season to celebrate its 25th anniversary, including the great "Jesu, der du meine Seele" at night. Harold Rosenbaum conducts with an expert hand, and if the band of period instrumentalists plays as well as the chorus sings, this should be all any Bach lover could want in a day, maybe more. Sunday at 3 P.M. and 8 P.M., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. Information: (212) 501-3330. Tickets: $20 for each concert (James R. Oestreich).
CITY OF BIRMINGHAM SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. Simon Rattle leads his orchestra on their farewell tour together, in what should be one of the best concerts of the season. The program includes dances by Rameau, from "Les Boreades," Haydn's Symphony No. 86 and Beethoven's "Eroica." If you think you know the Beethoven, think again. Sunday at 3 P.M. and Monday at 7:30 P.M. Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $45 (Griffiths).
DESSOFF CHOIRS. For some listeners, the subtle and profound expression of Rachmaninoff's liturgical music is more impressive than all the grandeur, glitter and occasional bombast of the famous instrumental works. The Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, though perhaps slightly less imposing than Rachmaninoff's other great a cappella creation, the Vespers, is well worth knowing, and the excellent choral conductor Kent Tritle is sure to do it justice here. Tonight at 8, Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Ninth Avenue at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 935-2551. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and the elderly; $10 for children under 14 (Oestreich).
"ESTHER," Millennial Arts Productions. The ambitions of this production, "a lavish entertainment with singers, actors and dancers," as it calls itself, are laudable. Sometimes deftly, sometimes in ungainly fashion, it combines the Handel oratorio with the Racine play and any number of touches from left field. The music was strongly sung at a preview last week, though the little orchestra, conducted from the keyboard by Bradley Brookshire, one of the few bright lights on the New York early-music scene, still seemed under rehearsed, a problem perhaps resolved by now. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 P.M., Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $20 (Oestreich).
KUN WOO PAIK. The program of works by Bach, Brahms, Wagner and Beethoven looks to be conventional, but Kun Woo Paik's recital promises the work of an experienced South Korean pianist whose high reputation among a small circle of admirers is very much at odds with his relative obscurity in the wider world of concert music. Tonight at 8:30, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5050. Tickets: $15 to $25 (Bernard Holland).
STEVE MACKEY. Mr. Mackey is one of a few composers who grew up in the rock era and refused to leave their pop roots, or even their rock instruments, behind when they became serious composers. Mr. Mackey's instrument is the electric guitar, and he has written some striking pieces for it, both on its own and in combination with other instruments. As part of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's three-concert "Music of Our Time" series, Mr. Mackey is collaborating with the cellist Fred Sherry and a performance artist, Rinde Eckert, on a program that will include both composed and improvised works. Tomorrow at 9 P.M., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $17; student rush tickets, $5. (Allan Kozinn).
MIAMI STRING QUARTET. They start with one of Beethoven's early quartets but then go off in more unusual directions, to Dvorak, whose quartets ought to appear on programs more often, and to the Latvian euphonist Petris Vasks, whose Third Quartet is heard in its New York premiere. Tomorrow at 7 P.M., Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 333-5200. Tickets: $20 (Griffiths).
OLLI MUSTONEN, JOSHUA BELL AND STEVEN ISSERLIS. Here is the grand finale of the Finnish pianist Olli Mustonen's three-concert exploration of the ties between the seemingly disparate composers Bach and Shostakovich. "Even more interesting than their differences are the things that unite them," Mr. Mustonen rightly said recently. Mr. Isserlis will play Bach's great Suite in C for unaccompanied cello, and Mr. Mustonen will join Mr. Isserlis in the D major Viola da Gamba Sonata and Mr. Bell in the C minor Violin Sonata, before the three players join forces in Shostakovich's Second Piano Trio. Sunday at 2 P.M., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30 (Oestreich).
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. The Alexander Zemlinsky revival continues. This weekend, the New York Philharmonic performs "Die Seejungfrau" ("The Mermaid") a little-known work by the Austrian composer, born in 1871, three years before Schoenberg. Zemlinsky taught his younger colleague counterpoint and introduced him to the music of Wagner. But he did not follow Schoenberg into atonality. Zemlinsky's music, greatly respected in its day, remained in the idiom of Mahler and Strauss. James Conlon conducts the program that includes the youthful Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 1 with the brilliant American pianist Garrick Ohlsson as soloist, and Listz's ruminative tone poem "Les Preludes." Today at 2 P.M., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $13 to $58 (Tommasini).
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. The musicians in the New York Youth Symphony are 12 to 22 and come from schools in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Not all hope to become professional musicians, but they clearly put considerable effort into their work with the orchestra. In recent seasons, several music reviewers have noted the high level of the ensemble's performances in fully professional, fully demanding repertory. The orchestra has also been a training ground for conductors who have gone on to bigger things; Leonard Slatkin and Samuel Wong are among its past directors. Its current director is Mischa Santora, and his current program includes Rimsky-Korsakov's flashy "Russian Easter Overture," Strauss's "Death and Transfiguration" and Horn Concerto No. 1 (David Jolley is the soloist) and a world premiere, Peter Boyer's "Phoenix." Sunday at 2 P.M., Carnegie Hall. (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $5 (Kozinn).
 
Dance
 
JUILLIARD YOUNG CHOREOGRAPHERS CONCERT. One of the worst-kept secrets in New York dance is the vitality and professionalism displayed these days by the young performers of the Juilliard Dance Division, who will be seen in a free graduation performance on Tuesday night, featuring Jiri Kylian's "Stoolgame." But the spotlight will be on the school's choreographers in a free Young Choreographers Concert tomorrow night. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406 (Jennifer Dunning).
STEPHAN KOPLOWITZ AND COMPANY. A cast of dancers, actors and singers, both high school students and adults, brings a great satiric fantasy to life: Karel Capek's "War With the Newts," a Czech novel of 1936 about the attempts of a race of newts to take over the world. As the story unfolds, it becomes a sharp commentary on politics, economics, oppression and the arms race. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets $15 (Jack Anderson).
NEW YORK CITY BALLET. This is a good weekend to revisit some old friends in the New York City Ballet repertory. George Balanchine's luminous, mannerly "Tombeau de Couperin" will be performed tonight and tomorrow night, a bow to Ravel, who composed the score, to the 18th-century French music Ravel himself was saluting, and to the all-important but seldom celebrated corps de ballet. Tonight, too, Damian Woetzel is scheduled to dance the lead role in Balanchine's "Prodigal Son" with Helene Alexopoulos as the Siren, on the bill with Jerome Robbins's serenely pretty "Glass Pieces." Kyra Nichols will sweep through Balanchine's "Serenade" on Sunday afternoon, and Peter Boal will make a role debut tomorrow night in "Bournonville Divertissements," whose first-rate cast also boasts Miranda Weese and Jennie Somoygi, two of the company's most interesting dancers. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M., New York State Theater. Information: (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $15 to $68 (Dunning).
AMY PIVAR PROJECTS. Amy Pivar's dances give new meaning to the expression "in your face." Ms. Pivar is a thin, wiry and fierce dancer, and her pieces, created with Freda Rosen, have something of her kamikaze emotional and physical attack. They also tend to be cluttered, unlike Ms. Pivar's performing, but her new work, "These Women," has a promising theme. The multimedia piece, which fuses musical theater and modern dance, looks at a career woman who is motivated by the death of a friend to re-examine her relationships with the women who have influenced her life. Through May 23. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M. and Sundays at 3 P.M., Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 647-0202. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).
OLGA RORIZ DANCE COMPANY. A leading Portuguese choreographer, who has worked with both classical and modern-dance groups, emphasizes lyric beauty in one of her most recent creations, "Our Lady." Tomorrow at 8 P.M., New Jersey Performing Arts Society, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $20 (Anderson).
MORGAN SCOTT BALLET COMPANY. The warmhearted new Morgan Scott Ballet Company, founded by Daniel Scott and Edward Morgan, a charismatic former Joffrey Ballet dancer, is just the antidote for all our recent grey rainy weather. Forget about vitamin C. The joyous, intelligent dancers and repertory, a mix of classical ballet, and modern and jazz dance, are the psychic equivalent. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park (free shuttle from the Willets Point-Shea Stadium stop on the No. 7 subway line), (718) 760-0064. Tickets: $21 (Dunning).

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Shout From India

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The decision was made by India, and India will pay the economic price. But Americans should understand that it was the West, particularly the U.S., that built the policy road leading to the Indian underground explosions.
 The utter shock in Washington shows more than an intelligence failure. It shows attitudes about India are the same Western mush of arrogance, ignorance and condescension that they have been for the half-century since Indian independence.
 
 Just as plainly it shows the danger of the new ingredient President Clinton added -- the drive to make China the partner of America in the last years of this century and all the next, partner in trade, technology, honing the capabilities of Chinese armed forces, and in security strategy that will affect all Asia and the Pacific.
Think of yourself as Indian for a few paragraphs -- not a Gandhi Indian, few of those left, but just Indian, one of the millions who delightedly approve of the nuclear tests that put such a startled face on Washington.
Look around. Pakistan on the border, created by the 1947 partition, is almost entirely Muslim, about 132 million. India has about 850 million Hindus and 120 million Muslims. India has been basically democratic since independence, and Pakistan basically authoritarian.
Since partition, three wars have been fought between them. Another is possible any time -- over India's possession of Muslim Kashmir, or religious massacres in either country, or suspicion so deep they bleed for it.
Both have nuclear-weapon capacity and never submitted to no-testing demands from nuclear powers finished with all the tests they needed.
Washington lectures us: Parity should exist between India and Pakistan. Are we fools? Parity between our billion and their 132 million, our huge scientific establishment and their puny one, our democracy and their authoritarianism?
We have a larger army, but these Pakistanis fight like hell. We can defeat them in conventional war -- if only their ally China does not charge in to help them.
And this is the nerve-racking part -- China sells nuclear technology and missile know-how to Pakistan. The U.S. does not penalize China. We like that as Americans would like Mexico getting military parity with the U.S. plus nuclear stuff from Russia.
China sliced up our army in 1962 and took a chunk of our Himalayan border land. China won't give it back. Indian intelligence takes fewer daily naps than American, but are we sure China can never surprise us again and that if it were losing it would never ever use nukes? Our Socialist Defense Minister says China is our most dangerous opponent.
But listen to Mr. Clinton talk of his priority -- American democracy and Chinese dictatorship knitting together in trade and security strategy. What strategy? Was India consulted, even thought about?
I lived four years in India as a correspondent. Washington's policy was a little pat on the head, or a scolding finger -- and still is.
I wish the tests had not been made. They will burden India's economy -- more arms, few foreign loans, less investment, much denunciation.
The nationalist party heading the coalition Government runs counter to my hopes for India. It is xenophobic about foreign investment, has a history of Muslim-baiting and maintains extremist Hindu branches, including one headed by a Bombay nasty who admires Hitler.
Indians say that as a member of a shaky coalition that depends on centrists, the party is more moderate. We shall see.
Certainly, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has domestic political motives -- strengthening his party so that he does not wake up thrown out by Parliament. But I think he had more objectives for the tests. Gaining prestige among third-world powers was one. Another was to shout into the American ear: "Look at us, speak to us, we are India."
Is Mr. Clinton wise or brave enough to reconsider his frantic pursuit of China and the money U.S. businesses hope Beijing will pour over them? Well, at least he can get the shock off his face about Indian independence of action, the murk out of his mind; it's about time.
Ordinary Indians do have hopes and fears about their country, just as if they were ordinary Americans. They are not in a silence mood. Head-patting decades are over.

HEADLINE: Fighting the Drug Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re your May 10 and 11 front-page articles on the Dominican Republic, the Dominican community in the United States and the drug issue:
Less than 2 percent of people of Dominican origin living in the United States have been involved in drug-related crimes. Unfortunately, Dominican migration to the United States has, since 1965, coincided with the growing consumption of drugs in the United States. Thus, unemployed youth found illegal income opportunities in drug distribution.
As you note, two months ago the United States Government said the Dominican Republic was cooperating closely on drug investigation matters with the United States. While you quote a State Department official as saying that under President Leonel Fernandez "not a single drug-related case has been prosecuted," drug-related arrests in 1997 exceeded 1,400, according to the State Department. 
 A United States Embassy survey estimates that only 35,000 Dominicans are users of cocaine and marijuana in my country -- less than 1 percent of our population over 12 years of age, as compared with a 6 percent equivalent figure for the United States.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE SUBCONTINENT;
Pakistan Is Under Growing Pressure Not to Respond to India With Atom Test

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 14

 BODY:
Pakistan came under increasing pressure from foreign governments today to refrain from answering India's recent nuclear tests with tests of its own. Many Pakistanis continued to insist, however, that joining India in the nuclear club is vital to their country's security.
The United States Embassy in Islamabad, the capital, announced that Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and the American commander for the region, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni of the Marines, would arrive here on Friday for urgent talks with Pakistani leaders. They are expected to bring assurances that Western powers will severely punish India for its tests and will reward Pakistan if it does not conduct nuclear tests. 
 During his visit to Berlin today, President Clinton urged Pakistan to "resist the temptation" to begin nuclear testing.
A spokesman for the Japanese Government, which froze hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to India this week, said Japan had sent a message to Pakistan saying "that we would hate to find ourselves in a position where we would have to do the same to Pakistan."
Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, who announced a suspension of military contacts and an end to all non-relief aid for India, urged Pakistan not to try to match India "tit for tat."
 Jim Steinberg, the United States' deputy national security adviser, said in a briefing in the eastern German town of Eisenach during Mr. Clinton's visit there that a nuclear test would destabilize South Asia. He signaled a willingness to address issues that Pakistan may bring up, but indicated that legislative restrictions might limit what the United States can offer.
There was no indication, however, that these appeals were changing the position of Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India since 1947 and fears another one.
"India's actions, which pose an immediate and grave threat to Pakistan's security, will not go unanswered," a senior Pakistani diplomat, Munir Akram, said today at a United Nations disarmament conference in Geneva.
Domestic pressure on the Government to begin nuclear testing increased as it became clear that India's two detonations on Wednesday were to test weapons that could be used on the battlefield against tank formations or infantry units. Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan called these weapons "Pakistan specific."
The Pakistani Cabinet met today but made no decision on how to proceed. Foreign diplomats in Islamabad said the decision would probably be made by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his army commander, Gen. Jehangir Karamat.
India and Pakistan have been bitter political, religious and territorial rivals since both states came into being half a century ago. India considers itself a great power and is frustrated by what it perceives as the world's failure to treat it as such. Since countries with nuclear weapons have automatically been treated as great powers, India sees a nuclear arsenal as a psychological and political weapon as well as a military one.
India and Pakistan have long had competitive nuclear programs, but both had refrained from tests that were openly for military purposes. For Pakistan to avoid responding now would be a retreat from its longstanding policy of seeking to match India in every way.
In making their case that Pakistan should not begin nuclear testing, foreign leaders have sought to persuade their Pakistani counterparts that Pakistan's long-term security would be better served if it refrains from becoming a nuclear power.
"The Pakistanis have an opportunity to de-link themselves from India in this area and use the distaste generated by the tests to Pakistan's advantage," said a diplomat in Islamabad who is closely monitoring the debate here.
To many nations -- including the United States, long used to thinking of India as a plucky democracy and Pakistan as a country ruled by unsavory militarists -- India's nuclear tests came as a great shock. For Pakistanis, they were proof that what they have been telling the West for years is true.
India's tests present Pakistan with a remarkable opportunity to be viewed as mature and responsible while India is perceived as a dangerous rogue.
Pakistan has been fighting for years to achieve this status. But Pakistan will be able to seize this moment only if it refrains from conducting a nuclear test, diplomats here said this week.
Domestic political pressures make it exceedingly difficult for Mr. Sharif to choose that course. Emotion-charged demonstrators have taken to the streets in several cities to demand that the Government reply to India's nuclear tests with tests of its own.
Opposition political leaders are demanding quick nuclear detonations. Among them is former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who told a television interviewer in London that without such tests, India "will resort to aggression against Pakistan at its own sweet will."
Beyond these political pressures lie cold strategic calculations. Foreign leaders are able to promise Pakistan the respect and gratitude of the world and to point to sanctions imposed on India as an example of what it will suffer if it proceeds. But in the end, they cannot guarantee Pakistan's security. Many Pakistanis believe that only a nuclear arsenal can now do that.
Some voices are being raised here against the evident surge in favor of Pakistan's entry into the nuclear club. More than a few newspaper columnists and editorial writers have urged restraint.
"Given the fact that the Pakistani economy is entirely dependent on foreign loans these days, an explosion seems a remote possibility," the Peshawar newspaper Frontier Post said in an editorial.
At midday today about 100 demonstrators marched through the streets of Islamabad carrying signs reading, "Schools Not Bombs" and "Pakistan: Respond With Restraint."
"We have a very poor population with a crying need for basic services like health care, housing and clean water," said Nasreen Sultana, one of the demonstrators. "Why not spend our money on those things instead of on bombs?"
A coalition of 12 peace and human rights groups issued a statement condemning India's tests but urging Pakistan to "respond responsibly to the Indian provocation and renounce the path of nuclearization."
"The real strength and honor of a nation lies not in the arsenal of murder and destruction it possesses," the statement said, "but in the prosperity and welfare of its people."

HEADLINE: Fastest Rise In Six Months For Price Index

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices in the United States rose in April at the fastest pace in six months, the Government said today in a report that suggested inflation might accelerate from the 30-year lows reached earlier this year.
Led by higher costs for housing and health care, the Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month after remaining unchanged in two of the prior three months, the Labor Department said. 
 "The best news on inflation is behind us," said John Williams, chief economist at the Bankers Trust Company in New York.
In another economic report, the Commerce Department said inventories of goods at American businesses rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March after rising seven-tenths of 1 percent in February. That is an indication companies were building their stocks in anticipation demand would not slow.
A further sign of growth was seen in the Labor Department's weekly report on state unemployment benefits claims, which fell by 2,000 in the week ended Saturday to 307,000. The four-week average for initial claims, closely watched for insights into labor market trends, remained below 315,000 for the 14th consecutive week.
Federal Reserve officials have shown their patience with the economy's strong growth and low inflation, holding the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at 5.50 percent for more than a year. Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet Tuesday, but even with the strong economic data released today it remains unclear whether they will raise rates.
For the first four months of the year, the index rose at an annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent, down from a 1.5 percent annualized rate during the first four months of 1997.

Treasury Securities Prices Fall on Fears of Higher Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after a report on consumer prices kept alive concern the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates, though few expect a move when central bankers meet Tuesday.
The Government's Consumer Price Index rose more than expected in April when food and energy prices were excluded. "It's the first bad C.P.I. number we've had for a long time," said Charles Parkhurst, head of government bond trading at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. "People are a little concerned that this could be the beginning of a trend." 
 Even so, there is little expectation Fed officials will increase interest rates next week, according to a survey of economists, bond strategists and traders at the 36 primary dealers, the only firms that deal directly with the Fed's securities trading desk. Only one of the firms predicted a rate increase.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 , to 1021/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.98 percent, from 5.94 percent on Wednesday.
 "I don't think inflation's running away, but it would be wrong to get overly optimistic," said Todd Barre, who helps manage $10 billion at Harris Bank in Chicago. "I lean toward being a touch nervous."
Signs of faster inflation might lead the Fed to raise its target for overnight lending between banks in the months ahead, after holding it steady for more than a year, traders said.
Some investors also said bonds might benefit from any further turmoil in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia, because that would increase the attractiveness of fixed-income securities and make it harder for the Fed to raise rates.
"A big piece of recent gains is the flight to quality vis-a-vis the unrest overseas," said Patricia Larkin, who oversees $35 billion of money market securities at the Dreyfus Corporation. "That's going to continue."
Federal Reserve officials meet Tuesday, and again at a two-day meeting that ends July 1. While few expect any rate move next week, "there will be a lot more pressure going into the July meeting," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio,l adding, "The policy discussion will intensify."
In the corporate market, Owens-Illinois Inc. led today's borrowers, selling $1.1 billion of bonds. A dozen companies crowded into the market yesterday to sell $6.4 billion of bonds.

HEADLINE: Sneaking U.S. Jets to Iran: The Canadian Route

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA with LOWELL BERGMAN; Lowell Bergman is the senior investigative producer for CBS News.

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Colombia, May 14

 BODY:
Several times over the past few years, Reza Akrami, an Iranian, left his home in the Vancouver area and flew to San Francisco to see a mysterious man who spoke in Persian and called himself Dr. Afshar.
They met at a swank hotel or an expensive restaurant. A few times they lunched on a private yacht docked in the bay. There were thick steaks and fine wines. 
 Eventually, a shadowy deal was put on the table. Dr. Afshar would arrange delivery of American-made jets and military parts, including electronics to guide antiaircraft missiles. The destination for the parts was Iran, and the suggested payment was a large shipment of heroin, according to a fax sent from Iran to Mr. Akrami that outlined the arrangement.
The deal never came off. "Dr. Afshar" was an undercover agent for the United States Government posing as an arms dealer bent on evading the American embargo against Iran.
Mr. Akrami and an associate were arrested in Vancouver this week and are being held pending extradition to the United States. They face charges of conspiring to smuggle sophisticated military parts to Iran in violation of the United States embargo.
A joint investigation by The New York Times and CBS News has found that this is not an isolated case. A significant portion of the American-made weapons and parts that Iran buys illicitly move through Canada, taking advantage of regulatory loopholes and the Canadian Government's decision not to support the American embargo.
The result, say American officials and the Iranians involved, is a steady flow of American-made military parts across the border into Canada and on to Iran. "Sanctions against Iran make no sense because they get everything they want through other countries," Mr. Akrami said in an interview here before his arrest.
According to an indictment returned this week by a grand jury in San Francisco, Mr. Akrami, 60, told undercover agents the Iranian Government wanted to buy as many klystron tubes -- the heart of missile guidance systems -- as he could find.
"There is a significant amount of circumvention of our sanctions through Canada," said Raymond W. Kelly, an Under Secretary of the Treasury, who is awaiting confirmation as the new head of the Customs Service. "Because of the relaxed border situation that we have with Canada, the potential for abuse there is greater than perhaps with other allies."
Among the Iranian arms deals involving Canada are these:
*A Long Island man was arrested in February by United States Customs agents as he tried to deliver engines and parts for F-14 Tomcat fighters to Iran; some of the items were to be routed through Canada. He is awaiting trial.
*A Canadian businessman was indicted in Washington, D.C., last year on 27 counts of shipping embargoed aviation parts to Iran by way of Canada and then Germany. He is currently a fugitive.
*In Miami in 1994, an Irish businessman pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to send military night-vision goggles to Iran by way of Canada.
And Iran is not the only destination for embargoed American military equipment from Canada.
Several Americans and Canadians were arrested last August and charged with attempting to sell to Iraq 35 American-made military helicopters that Canada had declared surplus. The buyers had asked that some helicopters be outfitted with chemical-spraying equipment. Two Canadians have already pleaded guilty; the other defendants are awaiting trial.
Last fall a Toronto businessman pleaded guilty to selling $6 million worth of jet parts to Libya, including some that could have military uses.
"I'll be honest with you: Canada does not pretend that it is enforcing a U.S. embargo," said Lynda E. Watson, director of the export controls division in the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. While Canada tries to make sure it is not used as a decoy to get around American export restrictions, she explained, its efforts are limited.
"It's not our embargo," she said, "and it's not our job to enforce a U.S. embargo."
 
The Middleman
From Army Doctor To Refugee
There are many unanswered questions about Mr. Akrami: Precisely on whose behalf was he shopping for parts? What did the Iranian Government knew about his activities?
And while American agents were luring him into their sting, Canadian intelligence agents were using him as their informant.
Mr. Akrami said in an interview before his arrest that he was merely a purchasing agent for Iran. "I cannot stop them to fax me what they want," he said, "but it doesn't mean I can do something or I want to do something."
Mr. Akrami's lawyer, Irvine E. Epstein, said his client had exaggerated the importance of his contacts in Iran and expected Dr. Afshar to arrange the necessary export permits if the deals went through.
"He's absolutely adamant that he has not committed any crimes in Canada or the United States," Mr. Epstein said of his client. "If anything, what we have is perhaps some overzealous undercover agents trying to make something out of nothing."
Before coming to Canada, Mr. Akrami said, he was a colonel in the Iranian Army and a cardiac surgeon in contact with many of Iran's most powerful people. He boasted to friends that he had once treated the Ayatollah Khomeini.
Mr. Akrami said he had received his medical degrees in Germany and returned to Iran just a year before the 1979 revolution. His foreign training made him suspect in the turmoil of fundamentalist, post-revolution Iran. He was imprisoned but was allowed to see patients, he said.
Soon after being freed from prison, Mr. Akrami married an Iranian woman with family in Vancouver. In 1991 he emigrated to Canada, where he quickly fit into Vancouver's substantial Iranian refugee community.
"I'm connected to everybody," he said during the interview at his office.
He does not practice medicine in Canada but gained notoriety when his mother-in-law won a divorce settlement that was the equivalent of $12 million, one of the largest in Canadian history. He helped her invest the money in various ventures, and made no secret of his intention to do business with Iran.
In the interviews, he said he helped arrange for the delivery of two shiploads of American chemicals to Iran about four years ago, which he believed did not violate terms of the embargo. He also said he regularly received faxed messages from Iran requesting help in purchasing everything from Braille typewriters and spare parts for jumbo jets to a fleet of used civilian aircraft.
People close to the investigation said he once told undercover agents, "Canada is Iran's free-trade zone."
The United States first imposed economic sanctions on Iran after the hostage crisis in 1979. In 1995, after Iran was linked to terrorist attacks, a total ban was imposed on all American trade with the country. Before then, certain items, including some chemicals, could be exported from the United States.
 
The Introductions
Linking Heroin To Fighter Jets
Mr. Akrami might not have come to the attention of American authorities if not for another Iranian immigrant to Canada who was arrested by drug agents in San Francisco in 1994 and charged with a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of heroin.
Prosecutors in San Francisco had substantial evidence against the man, Abrahim Hamidi. But after he developed medical problems, they let him return to his home in Langley, a Vancouver suburb where he lived in a modest house and grew Iranian sour plums in the backyard.
Shortly after his return to Canada, Mr. Hamidi held a dinner at his home and invited a young Iranian friend, Mohsen Lessan, and Mr. Akrami, who said he was looking for new business opportunities.
But this was apparently more than a social engagement. According to officials familiar with the investigation, Mr. Hamidi was cooperating with American agents who wanted to broaden their investigation into the Iranian heroin connection. The charges against Mr. Hamidi in California were dismissed in April 1996, but within a few days he was arrested on a similar drug charge in Canada. In an unusual move, the records in that case were sealed, and it is not possible to learn its outcome.
Mr. Lessan, now a 30-year-old real estate salesman in Vancouver, said in an interview that he and Mr. Akrami had flown to San Francisco and met the man they knew as Dr. Afshar. They lunched in grand style on a yacht they believed was his. They discussed the purchase of up to 30 used jets for Iran, as well as parts and other items.
Mr. Lessan said he felt he was in over his head. While Mr. Akrami returned to San Francisco at least twice, Mr. Lessan never again met Dr. Afshar. He was arrested this week along with Mr. Akrami and is being held pending extradition to San Francisco, where a United States Attorney, Michael J. Yamaguchi, plans to prosecute him and Mr. Akrami on the smuggling conspiracy charges.
Mr. Lessan's lawyer, Jamie Paez, has refused to comment.
 
The End of the Deal
A Disputed Fax, An Angry Ex-Wife
In his first interview with The New York Times and CBS, Mr. Akrami denied knowing Mr. Hamidi. But at a subsequent talk in his high-rise apartment, he admitted that he had gone to Mr. Hamidi's house, but only because his wife liked the sour plums that Mr. Hamidi grew.
Mr. Hamidi did not respond to several phone calls or visits to his home.
Mr. Akrami eventually admitted he had discussed several deals with "Dr. Afshar," adding, "Ninety-nine percent of the discussion was about planes."
But he said one fax he received from his contact in Iran -- a man known as Sultanipour whom American officials have linked to the Iranian Government -- requested sophisticated military parts, including the American-made klystron tubes used in missile guidance systems.
At the meetings in San Francisco, which were monitored by United States agents, Mr. Akrami openly discussed military parts and displayed a detailed knowledge of how they worked. Once, he even commented that the suitcase-sized klystron tube the agents had brought was a slightly different color than those he had seen before.
During this period, officials said, Mr. Akrami also met regularly with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada's spy agency, which sometimes uses recent immigrants to gather information. He insists he never told them about the San Francisco meetings.
Mr. Akrami acknowledged there were other faxes as well, including one that mentioned paying for the parts with a "shipload of heroin." But he insisted that although he presented the faxed letter to Dr. Afshar, he never had any intention of actually going through with the deal.
"This was nonsense," said Mr. Akrami. "How can I have drugs to offer to someone for something like that?"
After repeated contact and telephone conversations with the undercover agents, Mr. Akrami abruptly backed away from the deal last summer. He said things had changed because of the tightened American embargo and because of the more moderate Government that had come to power in Iran's elections. But there appeared to be another reason: his recently divorced wife, who had some of the faxes from Iran, was threatening to expose him.
He said his former wife had shown the faxes to authorities in an attempt to discredit him. People close to the investigation confirmed that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, a local prosecutor and a member of Parliament had talked to the woman.
 
The Loophole
An 'Exception' For a Neighbor
Although Mr. Akrami is not charged with actually shipping any embargoed parts to Iran, recent incidents indicate that plenty of American military goods leave Canada's shores, largely because of "the Canada exemption."
For decades it has been policy of both Canada and the United States that Canada would purchase major arms systems from the United States instead of developing its own military industry. For this reason, such goods being shipped to Canada are exempt from the licensing requirements that apply to every other country.
"Since we don't issue a license here, there's no trail to follow," said John Hensley, the former head of enforcement for the United States Customs Service. "Therefore we can't tell how much is leaving Canada en route to other countries."
Canada does $1 billion a year in legitimate trade with Iran. While Canada has regulations to keep Canada from being used to hide shipments to Iran, officials here make it clear that the embargo is America's fight, not Canada's.
"We feel that we are taking very responsible and strong steps to deal with this," said Ms. Watson, the Canadian customs official, "but we're not 100 percent effective."

HEADLINE: In Germany, Clinton Voices Hope for Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: EISENACH, Germany, May 14

 BODY:
President Clinton, speaking to a group of auto workers here, said today that his most urgent foreign policy goal before leaving office was to secure "a peace agreement in the Middle East that will last for a long time."
Foreign travel -- which usually, as it did today, produces adoring crowds and splendid backdrops -- often puts Mr. Clinton in an expansive and even philosophical mood, as it frees him from sticky legal and political travails at home. 
 On the second of two cloudless days in Germany in the company of his friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr. Clinton spent today reflecting on American accomplishments in Europe and reaping the gratitude of Germans. This morning, he celebrated the American role in the Berlin airlift at the start of the Cold War, then came here this afternoon to tour a General Motors plant and celebrate the American role in rebuilding Germany after the cold war .
Asked by one German auto worker at a forum beside the plant about his aspirations and achievements, Mr. Clinton reeled off a list of each.
He named "turning the American economy around in ways that benefit ordinary Americans" as his top domestic accomplishment. Abroad, he said, "I hope that putting America in the center of the future after the cold war will be a lasting achievement." He also described that achievement as "not letting America withdraw from the world."
As his top domestic goals, the President named helping the inner cities and protecting retirement and health-care programs.
Later, before a crowd of thousands packed into the cobbled square here, in the former East Germany, Mr. Clinton seemed to revel in his role as a spokesman for democracy. "On this beautiful Thuringian day in the spring," the President said, "we are bathed in the light and the warmth of freedom."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that Germany was still struggling to rebuild, but said: "Do not underestimate what you can do with your dreams as free people." To Mr. Clinton's slow, stately wave, the crowd responded with whistles and a blur of thousands of waving hands.
Mr. Clinton then toured the city with Mr. Kohl, despite sharp lower back pain he has felt since he injured himself stretching on Monday. "Motrin was the order of the day," said Michael D. McCurry, the press secretary. Next on Mr. Clinton's itinerary is England, where he will attend an economic summit meeting.
Mr. Kohl, who is campaigning for his own re-election and basking in Mr. Clinton's popularity, told the auto workers that he thought German taxes were too high and were discouraging foreign investment. But, with words that might not sound so inspiring to American workers, Mr. Clinton assured the audience that "most manufacturers in America are prepared to go anywhere there is a work force that can be trained," and will work hard in teams.
Before flying here, President Clinton appeared at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin to commemorate the eleven-month Western air campaign that kept West Berlin supplied with coal and food after Stalin cut off overland supply routes on June 24, 1948.
Mr. Clinton received thunderous applause from the thousands of invited German guests as he recalled President Truman's words in a White House meeting on June 28 of that year: "There is no discussion on that point. We stay in Berlin, period."
The crowd was gathered in a giant amphitheater formed by a semicircular hangar that was open to the runway. Mr. Clinton and Chancellor Kohl faced the audience from a podium on the tarmac, standing before a new American C-17 cargo jet christened The Spirit of Berlin today that was parked nose-to-nose with a gray C-54 transport plane.
It was the C-54 that flew most of the American missions into Tempelhof Airport. French and British planes operated from other airports. Flying no higher than 10,000 feet in every kind of weather, with windows open to thin the dust emitted by the cargo of coal and flour, crews made two round trips to Berlin every 16 hours from bases in Europe. They stayed on the ground in Germany for just half an hour.
"A plane every 90 seconds, at its height," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Kohl said that the airlift taught Germans "what it meant not to be alone in our hour of need," declaring that Berlin owed its survival and freedom to the United States and its allies.
In his speech this morning, Mr. Clinton committed a rare gaffe. He singled out an American pilot from the airlift, Gail Halvorsen, but mistakenly assumed that Mr. Halvorsen was a woman. "She is here with us today," Mr. Clinton said, "and I'd like to ask her to stand." Once Mr. Halvorsen stood, Mr. Clinton realized his error. "Thank you sir," he said. "Thank you. He's here."
Mr. Halvorsen, 77, flew 126 flights in the airlift and became known as the "Rosinenbomber," or raisin bomber, because he dropped dried fruit and candy for children. Before Mr. Clinton spoke, Mr. Halvorsen said of his experience: "It was a hard time, but a good time."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Profit Warning by Hewlett Helps Push Dow Down by 39.61

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended lower yesterday after a profit warning by Hewlett-Packard pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down from Wednesday's record high, but failed to rattle the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 39.61 points, to 9,172.23, a day after closing at a record high of 9,211.84. 
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks was down 1.49 points at 1,117.37. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.82, to 1,865.36.
"Considering the news background, the market took it all with a big yawn," said Michael Metz, a managing director at the CIBC Oppenheimer Corporation.
Investors faced a shock in an earnings warning from Hewlett-Packard, Indonesia's worst riots in three decades and a rise in United States core inflation.
"It's still a market that is looking for opportunities rather than exits," Mr. Metz said. "The perverseness is that people are saying there is no market except the U.S. market, and that's where they want to be."
Arthur Cashin, a New York Stock Exchange floor trader for Paine Webber, said many investors were taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, and Indonesia's problems.
"There is a buyers' boycott today, with people waiting for a little better definition of what the Fed's posture will be, and what the influence of whatever is happening in Asia is going to be," Mr. Cashin said.
Wall Street is still betting that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged.
Asian markets were battered as the worst rioting in three decades ravaged the Indonesia capital of Jakarta.
The technology stocks were the big story. International Business Machines jumped 3 15/16, to 125 13/16, in New York Stock Exchange trading, a day after its chief executive forecast double-digit revenue growth in the coming years.
Several brokerage houses also upgraded their ratings and price targets on I.B.M.
Hewlett-Packard plunged 1 15/16, to 70 5/16, after the printer and PC personal computer maker said late Wednesday that its second-quarter profits would fall short of Wall Street's expectations.
Hewlett-Packard had been viewed as one of the latest success stories in the personal computer market, posting strong market share gains this year.
Microsoft rose 2, to 88 15/16, buoyed by news that it was in negotiations to head off threatened state and federal antitrust action.
In return, Microsoft agreed to delay until Monday the shipment of its Windows 98 operating system to computer makers.
"What you're seeing is the Street is hopeful there can be some resolution that doesn't compromise the Microsoft business model and at the same time minimizes any government intervention," said David Readerman, an analyst for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
Other technology stocks managed to avoid posting the same kind of declines as Hewlett.
The Intel Corporation was off 1/4, to 84 9/16. Applied Materials Inc. fell 15/16, to 38 9/16.

HEADLINE: A Chip Maker Says It Expects More Bad News

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 14

 BODY:
The National Semiconductor Corporation delivered bad news to Wall Street today for the fourth time in four months, warning that revenues will fall below analysts' estimates and that it expects a loss for the current quarter and possibly the next.
The chip maker's announcement also marked the latest sobering setback for Silicon Valley's high-technology industry, coming one day after the Hewlett-Packard Company warned of an earnings shortfall because of price cutting in personal computers. 
 As it has in the three earlier announcements, National attributed the weakness to a number of problems, including production difficulties at its Cyrix subsidiary, the slowdown in PC sales because of bloated inventories at some manufacturers, and the effect of the Asian economic crisis on sales of chips used in cellular telephones.
But National executives said the company also suffered from the shift to sub-$1,000 PC's, which hurt sales of components for midpriced machines, and from technology changes in network adapters, in which it has fallen behind rivals.
In February, National announced it would report a shortfall in earnings for its third fiscal quarter, which ended Feb. 28. In March, it said fourth-quarter results would be weak. Last month, it said it would cut 1,400 jobs worldwide, or about 10 percent of its employees, through a combination of layoffs and attrition. The cuts will result in a one-time charge of between $60 million and $70 million in the current quarter.
National made its latest announcement after the close of the market yesterday. National shares closed at $18.875, down $1.9375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Problems with Cyrix, which National acquired in July for about $550 million, arose late last year. But at least at that time, National reported healthy sales in its core business, specialized chips for networking cards, cell phones and other devices mixing analog and digital functions. Now those businesses are weak as well, casting into doubt National's whole strategy of moving away from high-volume, low-cost chips to microprocessors and other higher-value products.
National began its new strategy in 1996, after Brian Halla took over as chairman, president and chief executive from Gilbert Amelio, who left to head Apple Computer Inc. Mr. Halla, a former executive of the LSI Logic Corporation, spun off the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, its low-cost chip business, and acquired Cyrix, which designed microprocessor clones of the Intel Corporation's market-dominant products. But analysts who once praised the moves now question them.
"They have a troika of difficulties," said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, referring to Cyrix, the networking business and the Asian economic crisis. "The question is how much of this is National's problem and how much is an industry problem. I have to say a lot of it is National's problem. These guys are going to continue to lose money."
National said it expects sales for the fourth quarter to decline by as much as 20 percent compared with a year earlier, when it reported sales of $599.2 million. The sales decline will result in an operating loss, and National said that with uncertain first-quarter demand there is also the likelihood of an operating loss in that quarter.
National said shipments in the current quarter have been slowed by inventory adjustments in the personal computer market, as manufacturers slowed their production rates.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Housing Units Will Replace Armory

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The 14th Street Armory has stood like a fortress for the last 27 years between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. But in 1995 the state-owned building closed, leaving its fate in doubt.
Now the state is selling the four-story hulk to a group of investors. By summer, the group intends to bulldoze the armory and under a redevelopment plan supported by community groups, build a 275,000-square-foot mixed-use complex of 7 and 12 stories on the site, which extends to 15th Street. 
 The new complex will have 119,000 square feet of retail space, with a movie theater and stores, in its basement and on its first and second stories. On the 15th Street side, the complex will have 7 stories and contain 40 luxury condominiums. On the 14th Street side, it will have 12 stories and 140 apartments for the elderly. These units will offer tenants hotel-style services, including meals, transportation, housekeeping and social activities.
The $85 million project will be developed by a joint venture between the Orda Management Corporation, the Plaza Construction Corporation, both of Manhattan, and the Care Matrix Corporation of Needham, Mass. The architect is Costas Kondylis of Manhattan.
The partners, who expect to close on the sale by summer, were selected to redevelop the property over three other competitors last month by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency. The purchase price, $15 million, was the highest of the four bids.
The armory, built in 1971, has not had a permanent tenant since the National Guard marched out three years ago. In late 1995, the city opened a job placement center for welfare recipients at the building, but neighborhood groups protested, fearing crime would increase. The center operated at the armory until 1996, and since then the building has been leased to organizations and movie production companies. Films, including "The Object of My Affection," have been shot in the old drill hall.
In April 1997, the state development agency sought proposals from developers. Though the American Institute of Architects guide to New York called the building "gross and overbearing," developers have said the site is well located. It borders a newly resurgent Chelsea neighborhood to the north and the lively commercial strip on the south side of West 14th Street.
To insure that the redevelopment will be compatible with the neighborhood, the state development agency, working with community groups, established use and design guidelines. For example, an interior courtyard will be built over the base of the complex to allow light and air to enter the residences. Also, the entrance to the commercial space will be on 14th Street to lessen the impact of noise and crowds on the neighborhood. The entrances to the housing will be on 15th Street to maintain that street's residential character.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state development agency, said the process allowed the state to get the best value for the property, put it back on the tax rolls and help stimulate the redevelopment of the area. But most important, he added, the result is a project "that will fit in with its surroundings and the community will like."
Edward Kirkland, chairman of the Chelsea Preservation and Planning Committee of Community Board 4, which helps guide growth in the area, said, "If the developers live up to their commitments, we can live with it."
Explaining why the partners became involved with the project, Morton F. Silver, president of Orda Management, said: "This area is flourishing, but somehow 14th Street has been excluded. So when the armory site came up for redevelopment, it represented a great opportunity."
Care Matrix, a national developer of housing for the elderly, is making its first foray into the Manhattan housing market. Michael Zaccaro, the company's executive vice president, said, "Our approach here is to become part of a larger project that includes straight residential, which is in demand, allowing the senior housing component to be more competitive."
New York City also needs such housing, he said, noting that about 36,000 people age 65 or older live in neighborhoods surrounding the project.
The studio, one- and two-bedroom units for the elderly will range from 400 to 1,000 square feet. Mr. Zaccaro said rents are expected to be $3,200 to $5,200 a month, including meals and services. Common areas, like a dining hall, fitness center and health education center, are planned. He said plans also include working with a local hospital to make health care available to tenants at an extra cost.
The condominiums are expected to average 1,500 square feet, large enough to appeal to families, Mr. Silver said. He said most would be two- or three-bedroom units, which are in demand in the area. Although prices have not been set, he said that if the units were on the market today, they would sell for $400 to $550 a square foot, or $600,000 to $825,000 for the average size condominiums.
Financing is to come from the partners' equity and private lenders. The project is expected to be completed by spring 2000.

HEADLINE: Farmers Suing Government to Restore Legal Production of Hemp

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., May 14

 BODY:
More than 25 years after hemp was last grown legally in America, a group of farmers and trade organizations will file suit against the Federal Government on Friday to make hemp a lawful crop again.
The plaintiffs intend to argue in Federal District Court here that the illegal status of hemp, by definition of the Controlled Substances Act of 1972, violates a 1937 determination by Congress that the plant causes none of the psychoactive effects that its cousin, marijuana, does. 
 The plaintiffs will say in their lawsuit, the first of its kind, that Congress had stipulated hemp, which has many commercial uses, was different from marijuana and that hemp's prohibition by the Drug Enforcement Administration violates the Constitutional doctrine of separation of powers of government.
But the central thrust of the legal action is economics, with thousands of farmers throughout the South and Midwest looking at hemp as another crop to include in their annual rotations that now involve grains, vegetables and tobacco.
For many farmers, particularly those here in eastern Kentucky who are almost wholly dependent on tobacco for their income, hemp would provide a viable hedge as a disease-resistant plant -- especially when the future of tobacco is so uncertain.
As the region's most valuable crop, tobacco can generate as much as $5,000 an acre in gross sales. Most food crops like corn, soybeans and wheat do not have anywhere near that kind of return. But farmers like Jim Barton, whose family raised hemp when it was legal during a "Hemp for Victory" drive in World War II, predicted that an acre of hemp could gross as much as $1,200.
"Hemp is no more controversial today than tobacco is," said Andrew R. Graves, who will be a plaintiff in the suit as president of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Council, a group of 60 would-be hemp farmers. "You go into any store and you can buy hemp products. But he and I as farmers" -- he pointed to Mr. Barton -- "get no portion of that money. That makes no sense to me."
Terry Parham, a spokesman for the drug administration, said the agency had not seen the lawsuit and, as a result, would have no comment.
The frustration of would-be hemp farmers and marketers in the United States -- and the basis of the lawsuit -- centers on the long-standing policy of the Department of Justice and the D.E.A. to make no distinction between hemp and marijuana because they contain the same psychoactive chemical -- delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC. Government officials fear that hemp would provide camouflage for growing marijuana.
But the lawsuit will argue that Congress in 1937 recognized the differences when it passed the Marijuana Tax Act and excluded hemp from any prohibition. And scientists have determined that THC constitutes less than 1 percent of hemp's weight, not enough to cause any psychoactive effects.
Despite the 1937 law that made a distinction between hemp and marijuana, hemp farming virtually died out over three decades that followed, except for the wartime program.
The farmers' lawsuit will ask that the court rule that it was illegal for the executive branch of government to ban hemp, that chemical distinctions between marijuana and hemp should be recognized and that states should have the right to regulate hemp production.

HEADLINE: A Pregnant Candidate Discovers She's an Issue

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 12

 BODY:
As she ordered a morning latte in Boston's Faneuil Hall Marketplace today, Jane Swift made a point of making the point that it was only a decaf.
"For some people, I can't do anything right these days," she said, only half-joking. 
 Ms. Swift is running to be the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. She is also 17 weeks pregnant.
That makes her the first expectant mother to run for statewide office in Massachusetts. And -- to her outraged surprise -- the focus of a swirl of local debate about pregnant women in politics and in the workplace.
Experts on women in politics say Ms. Swift, 33, is not the very first statewide candidate in the country to alternate stumping from a podium with racing against morning sickness to the ladies' room. Judi Dutcher was pregnant when she was elected Minnesota's state auditor in 1994. And that is not to mention Federal officeholders who became pregnant as incumbents, like former Representatives Susan Molinari of Staten Island and Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas.
But judging by the fuss created over Ms. Swift's condition since she announced it two weeks ago, she is still breaking very new ground, says Ms. Swift, a Republican who is the running mate of A. Paul Cellucci, the state's acting Governor, and faces a possibly tough primary in September.
"I knew it would be a story," she said. "I knew people would be interested. I did not expect we would be getting involved in a debate as to whether or not women should work when they have children."
Then she observed: "Even if we're going to focus on the pregnancy, I wish we could shift the debate to about, 'What, then, do Jane Swift and Paul Cellucci think they can do on day care and creating more opportunities for flextime and meaningful part-time work?' But we really haven't gotten there yet."
Instead, attention has been focused on the very fact that Ms. Swift is due to give birth just two weeks before the November election.
"It's generated a lot of controversy," said Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the McCormack Institute of the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
"On the one hand, a lot of people have been saying, 'This is great, it's as it should be; of course, we have more and more women candidates, naturally we'll inevitably have a woman who's pregnant.' On the other hand, there's been a backlash by the more religious and traditional organizations who've said, 'This is wrong, she shouldn't be doing this.' "
Evelyn Reilly, executive director of the Christian Coalition of Massachusetts, said on Wednesday that she was not telling Ms. Swift how to live, but on hearing the news: "My first reaction was, 'Thank God she's not having an abortion,' and my second reaction is, 'I hope she'll have enough time to spend with the child.' This is a good opportunity for us to discuss the broader issue, which is, does institutional day care compare with a parent caring for the child in the home?"
But the backlash against the backlash began immediately as well.
"I'm so angry, I'm shaking," a Boston Herald reader wrote today, condemning a local conservative women's group leader for daring to "talk about what is in the best interest for someone else's child."
In hard-core political circles, meanwhile, talk has centered on more pragmatic speculation about what a pregnancy does for a ticket. And there, too, is some debate.
One camp includes the likes of Kevin Sowyrda, a Republican political analyst and friend of Ms. Swift, who calls her pregnancy "a political advertiser's dream come true."
Ms. Swift's condition means that if she wins the primary, Democratic opponents will have a harder time portraying the Republican ticket as anti-women or anti-children, Mr. Sowyrda said, and will probably need to treat Ms. Swift gently in debates. "Do you really want to be the candidate who beats up on an eight-month-pregnant woman?" he asked.
The other camp argues that pregnant politicians should be treated like any other politicians, and proceeds to point out that Ms. Swift's candidacy is not exactly immaculate. Although her opponents in the primary have assiduously avoided criticizing her pregnancy, she has drawn fire for adjusting her positions on the death penalty and an assault weapons ban to conform to Mr. Cellucci's tougher stances, as well as for taking large -- though legal -- tax deductions when she was a legislator. Some critics also say she is too young for the job.
In a way, Ms. Swift's youth is the point in all of this. She was the youngest woman ever to serve in the Massachusetts Senate, which she did for six years beginning at the age of 25; and in her current young ambition, students of women in politics say, she represents the new generation who get involved in politics much earlier than the last generation -- and who are thus likelier to get pregnant. Ms. Sherman of the McCormack Institute noted that Massachusetts women on average get into politics 10 years later than men.
Politics is not a field in which it is easy to stop for a few years and have children, then pick right up again, said Debbie Walsh, acting director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. So the desire to have a family, along with exclusion by old-boy political machines, were the main factors keeping women's political involvement low in the past, she said.
Women hold just 25 percent of statewide elective offices nationwide, Ms. Walsh said, but their presence in high-level politics has been expanding noticeably. Even in Massachusetts, which has elected only one woman to a statewide office -- a lieutenant governor in 1986 -- this season is looking up: at least six women are running statewide races this year, more than ever before.
Ms. Dutcher, the Minnesota state auditor, said that toward the end of her campaign, when her pregnancy started showing, "I made it part of my speech -- that I'm not only sensitive to financial issues, I'm sensitive to family issues, obviously."
She accepted with aplomb a comparison to Marge Gunderson, the very pregnant small-town sheriff in the movie "Fargo," and cheerily recalled retching in parking lots before popping a breath mint and entering meetings of potential supporters.
But neither Ms. Dutcher, who found out the day after she announced her candidacy that she was pregnant, nor Ms. Swift makes light of their very personal decisions to continue their campaigns.
Ms. Swift, a moderate Republican who supports gay and abortion rights and plans to emphasize education and economic development in her campaign, had waited four years for a positive pregnancy test, she said, and was thrilled when it came.
"Then reality set in," she said.
Not only of morning sickness, but of the starkness of the choice she faced as a less-than-famous former legislator from remote North Adams, Mass.
"Jane Swift, who lives in the far western corner of the state, is not going to get the opportunity to run with a very popular sitting governor on a ticket a lot of times, and maybe never again," she said. "And that was really the choice. It wasn't, 'Do you do this now or not do this now?' My husband and I looked at it as, 'Do you ever do this?' The one thing I want people to understand is that it was not a decision we made lightly."

HEADLINE: Ever a Pragmatist, Microsoft Compromises

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Microsoft's last-minute gesture toward the Justice Department, a new-found taste for compromise in the hopes of avoiding a major antitrust suit, speaks volumes about the company.
It may have a take-no-prisoners corporate culture and an antagonism toward Washington but, as any accomplished capitalist, the Microsoft Corporation is ultimately guided by the pure logic of business. 
 "Microsoft is extremely tough-minded and willing to act on the edge of brinkmanship, but pragmatic at its core," David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor, said.
Clearly, William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, and his lieutenants have decided that some of the concessions the Government is seeking can be made without posing a real threat to the company's remarkably lucrative business.
On-and-off talks between Microsoft and the Government have taken place over the last several weeks. But it was only in the last day or so that the company showed a willingness to negotiate in earnest with the Justice Department over concerns about anticompetitive practices raised by the Government and several state attorneys general.
The Justice Department canceled a noon news conference yesterday when it had been expected to announce that the Federal Government and several states were filing antitrust suits against Microsoft. The fact that both sides had begun an effort to reach a settlement without going to court should not be interpreted as a sign that an accord will in fact be reached, a person involved with the talks said.
Microsoft's strategy of fiercely resisting an accommodation with the Government and then finally coming to the negotiating table is precisely the approach the company took when it reached an earlier settlement with the Justice Department -- a consent decree signed in 1994 and approved by a Federal court the following year.
"It was unmistakably clear to Microsoft then, just as it is now, that if we didn't get a resolution, we'd sue them," recalled Robert Litan, then a senior Justice Department official who worked on the consent decree.
That round of discussions began with a meeting on June 21, 1994, in the main conference room of the Justice Department's antitrust division, attended by Mr. Litan and others.
Three weeks later, the Government and Microsoft signed a consent decree. It prohibited Microsoft from striking certain deals with personal computer makers for licensing the company's Windows operating system software that were determined to be anticompetitive. But the accord had little effect on Microsoft's business, and more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today are loaded with Windows.
"This time, the stakes are much higher," said Mr. Litan, who is now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "Now, the battle is over who owns the keys to the Internet and not just the operating system."
The Justice Department wants to insure that Microsoft is curbed from using its Windows monopoly unfairly both to maintain that monopoly and to gain an unfair advantage in the emerging markets of Internet commerce and software.
Specifically, the Government wants to protect competition in the market for Internet browsers, the software required to view World Wide Web sites. It also wants to restrict Microsoft's freedom to use its control of the computer desktop -- the main Windows screen that personal computer users see -- to steer consumers toward Internet shopping and entertainment sites owned by Microsoft or its favored business partners.
Microsoft's position has been that it should be free to put anything it wants in its operating system, and that any curbs on that freedom constitute a threat to innovation in the software industry. Giving Government a role, however well intended, would mean "the Justice Department or the courts would become economic regulators who fine-tune product decisions," said Charles F. Rule, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division who is a consultant to Microsoft.
Still, the company is now apparently willing to agree to some restrictions, probably in a new consent decree, if those concessions will persuade the Government not to intervene further. Yet it is the details of any proposed remedies that will be crucial in determining whether there will be a settlement, and what effect, if any, such a settlement might have in the marketplace.
Take the case of the browser. The Government wants to leave the door open for competition in the browser market, where Microsoft's main rival is the Netscape Communications Corporation.
Microsoft insists that its browser, the Internet Explorer, is not a separate product, as Washington contends, but an inseparable feature of the Windows operating system -- especially in Windows 98, its next-generation product. Microsoft thus requires personal computer makers to load Explorer as a condition of licensing Windows.
To encourage browser competition, the Government could order that Microsoft unbundle its browser from Windows, enabling PC makers to load Netscape's Navigator browser, if they choose. But Microsoft charges nothing extra for the browser, so there is no incentive for PC makers to take the unbundled version of Windows.
To insure competition, though, the Government must go further, according to Robert H. Bork, a former Federal judge who is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. One step, he says, would be to insist that Microsoft load another browser, like Netscape's Navigator, on Windows along with Explorer in a "must carry" order.
"Any remedy that does not let the consumer make the ultimate choice will not be effective because of Microsoft's enormous power, often coercive power, in the computer industry," said Mr. Bork, who is also a consultant to Netscape.
But a Government must-carry order for the browser could set a troubling precedent, Mr. Litan of Brookings said. "If you do that for the browser, do you do the same for other software innovations in the future? It's a really tough issue," he said.

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT SEEKS ACCORD WITH U.S. AND DODGES SUIT

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Less than an hour before state and Federal governments were set to file sweeping antitrust suits against the Microsoft Corporation, the company announced today that it would postpone the release of its new operating system, Windows 98, for three days so that settlement talks could proceed.
The Justice Department had scheduled a noon news conference to announce its new suit, and attorneys general from several of the 20 states that were going to file a joint action had flown to Washington to stand with Janet Reno, the United States Attorney General, for the announcement. Politicians' statements had been drafted, and press releases had been printed. 
 It was only then that Microsoft, demonstrating the steel-nerve brinkmanship that has marked its negotiating strategy and spurred its growth over the years, called a cease-fire. Page D1.
As lawyers waited at the court house with the filings in hand, Microsoft offered significant new concessions in its marketing practices, and both sides immediately took steps to allow the talks to continue.
The Justice Department and states agreed to delay their filings, and Microsoft announced that although "all work on Windows 98 has been completed," initial shipments to computer manufacturers, scheduled to begin on Friday, would be delayed until Monday. Plans to begin selling the new operating system in stores on June 25 have not changed, the company said.
Microsoft and Justice Department lawyers had actually been talking for the last week, but as has often been the case in the battle over Microsoft's business practices, the two sides offered drastically different views of those talks.
Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said that many of the concessions offered today had been offered before. But a senior Government official said Microsoft had been unwilling to make significant concessions until the last moments, when lawyers for the two sides spoke by phone.
Shares of Microsoft closed up $2 today, to $88.9375, in heavy trading.
Officials and executives involved with the talks said that Microsoft had suggested a general willingness to modify or abandon several of its marketing and presentation arrangements that prosecutors find objectionable. The company might, for example, drop demands that computer manufacturers feature Microsoft products to the exclusion of competitors' products. It might also modify the terms under which its programs must be displayed.
But, these people said, the company remains steadfast in its refusal to modify the programs -- or to stop adding features to its operating system. Most notably, it insists that its Internet Explorer, the browser software that enables users to view the Internet's World Wide Web, is an essential part of Windows.
The lawsuit prepared by the states -- similar in style and scope to the proposed Federal suit, several officials said -- would have attacked a broad range of Microsoft's business practices.
Among its points, the suit would challenge what it calls "tying," a practice that in recent years allowed Microsoft to dominate the markets for word processing, spreadsheet and other programs by bundling them in software "suites." It would also block the company from forcing manufacturers to incorporate certain features on the Windows main screen, or desktop, when the computer is first turned on.
On these points, Microsoft has suggested some flexibility.
But the suit would also seek to block Microsoft from including WebTV for Windows, its electronic program guide for television and Web sites, and Outlook Express, its E-mail program, with Windows 98.
What is more, it would ask the court to require Microsoft to allow manufacturers to replace the Internet Explorer browser with another browser when installing Windows 98. On these points, Microsoft is unlikely to give in. In fact, Microsoft insists that Internet Explorer is so deeply embedded in Windows 98 that it would be impossible to separate it without completely redesigning the program
Still, Dan Lungren, the Attorney General of California, called this "a moment of encouragement."
"I don't view the prospect of litigation as always a good thing," Mr. Lungren said. "I would hope that we can work things out."
Scott Harshbarger, the Attorney General of Massachusetts, a leader of the group, said that the states were trying to resolve "serious concerns on behalf of consumers and other members of the software industry."
Supporters and opponents of Microsoft in Congress offered opposing views of today's events. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, "The fact that Microsoft is negotiating with the Justice Department and apparently is prepared to make substantial concessions certainly undermines any argument that Justice has no case." Delaying the release of Windows 98, he added, "undermines its prior rhetoric that any such delay would have dramatic consequences for the industry."
But Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, where Microsoft has its headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, said: "I remain concerned that a further delay in the release of Windows 98 will impact our nation's economy. Ultimately the marketplace and its consumers should determine what innovations they want included in software, not the Government."
Mal Ransom, senior vice president for marketing for Packard Bell NEC, the computer maker, said, "We believe any further delays in delivering Windows 98 may cause disruption and confusion for our consumers."
Talks over a proposed settlement are scheduled to begin in Washington on Friday. At the table will be three Justice Department lawyers, three representatives of the state attorneys general and the Microsoft team. Assistant attorneys general from New York, Texas and Wisconsin will represent the states. Tom Miller, the Attorney General of Iowa and the chairman of the Antitrust Task Force for the National Association of Attorneys General, will also be present though not an official member of the negotiating team.
The number of states prepared to file suit has grown to 20. They are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus the District of Columbia.
Both state and Federal officials stressed that their suits could still be filed if the parties did not reach agreement, and both sides predicted that no conclusion would be reached by the Monday deadline.

HEADLINE: Sunset for President Suharto

 BODY:
There are no magical answers to the political and economic troubles engulfing Indonesia. A lethal combination of corruption, irresponsible economic management and autocratic leadership has brought the world's fourth-most-populous nation to the brink of chaos. But it is now clear that recovery cannot begin as long as President Suharto remains in power.
Like the Shah of Iran two decades ago, and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986, Mr. Suharto faces a popular rebellion and can retain power only through the use of military force against his countrymen. Eventually, even the army may turn against him to end the bloodshed. He can spare Indonesia further turmoil by yielding office to a government that quickly sets a date for free and fair elections. 
 Little about President Suharto's 32-year rule would suggest he will act with compassion or in the public interest. Since Indonesia's economic meltdown began last year, he has moved primarily to protect his family's financial interests and to preserve his own power. There was no reservoir of public support to carry him through the price rises produced by the collapse of the currency and the end of expensive subsidies -- a reform demanded by the International Monetary Fund as the price of its bailout. Indonesians are particularly angry because Mr. Suharto has not been as willing to close insolvent banks controlled by his family and business partners.
The only way for Indonesia to make needed reforms is to carry them out under a new government made up of trusted leaders. In South Korea a newly elected President, Kim Dae Jung, has persuaded citizens to accept measures that his predecessor could not. Mr. Suharto's suffocating rule has stunted Indonesian politics and left the country without seasoned opposition leaders. There is a danger that one of his obedient associates will try to hold power if Mr. Suharto steps aside or that the army will try to run the country. The best way to avoid that is to move swiftly to elections.
The military should refuse to repress peaceful protests and turn its attention to stopping looting and mob violence, offering special protection to Chinese shopkeepers, who are a common scapegoat in troubled times. Some army units mingled peacefully with protesters in Jakarta yesterday, a sign that they might resist further orders to shoot demonstrators. The United States, for its part, should immediately end all military training for Indonesian soldiers and freeze all transfers of weapons.
President Clinton has dispatched several delegations to Jakarta in recent months to press Mr. Suharto to reform. The only message left to send is to urge Mr. Suharto to resign and to tell his successors the hour for democracy in Indonesia has come.

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE POLICY;
As Strife Grips Indonesia, U.S. Asks Citizens to Leave and Delays Aid Payment

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The United States today urged most of the nearly 11,000 Americans living in Indonesia to leave the country immediately, citing the worst political violence there in more than three decades.
The warning to American residents of Indonesia's two largest cities -- Jakarta and Surabaya, which are home to about 6,000 Americans -- was one of several moves announced by the Clinton Administration to deal with the fast-deteriorating situation in Indonesia, where thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest against the 32-year rule of President Suharto. 
 The Administration also today joined European nations in delaying a $1.4 billion emergency aid payment and ordered the evacuation of all nonessential employees of the United States Embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesia capital and the scene of the worst violence this week. It also called off a planned mission to Indonesia by a high-ranking American military delegation.
Violent demonstrations have also been reported in recent weeks in Surabaya, which like Jakarta is on the central Indonesian island of Java.
In its warning to Americans living in Jakarta and Surabaya, the State Department said that they "should depart the country as soon as possible" given that "widespread protests have increasingly been accompanied by violent confrontations with security forces."
"Live ammunition has been fired at protesters, and several deaths have occurred," the department statement said. "American citizens in other parts of Indonesia may also wish to consider departure at this time. In the meantime, American citizens should avoid large crowds and demonstrations."
If Americans in the two cities follow the State Department's guidance, it will amount to one of the largest evacuations of American citizens from a foreign nation in recent years.
Today's moves by the Clinton Administration reflected a view now widely held within the United States Government that President Suharto's rule over the world's fourth most populous nation may be coming to a quick, violent end.
The $1.4 billion payment was supposed to be approved today, the latest installment in a $43 billion Western-led rescue package for Indonesia. But European nations urged a delay in the payment by the Asian Development Bank. The United States agreed, despite promises earlier this week that the Western aid package for Indonesia would not be affected by the rioting in Jakarta.
The objective of the aid package was to restore the confidence of the markets and bring investors back into the country. Now, many in Washington are arguing that there is little use in continuing to pump money into an economy that was nearing collapse because of the growing political turmoil.
Clinton Administration officials said the visit to Jakarta by the military delegation led by Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, the commander of all American military forces in the Pacific, was called off at virtually the last minute when it became clear that the roads into Jakarta from the international airport were so insecure that the admiral could not travel on the ground in safety.
"Given the deterioration today in the situation in Jakarta, including the fact that the road to the airport is closed, there was a literal question of getting into the country and then the question of who do you meet with when you get there," said Stanley O. Roth, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
Officials said that Admiral Prueher, the commander in chief of the United States Pacific Command in Honolulu, had been scheduled to meet with his counterparts in the Indonesian military to demand that they end the use of violence against anti-Government demonstrators. More than two dozen people, most of them civilians, have been reported killed in the rioting this week.
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Roth said that the State Department had begun planning for the evacuation of American citizens from Indonesia.
"Given that the situation in Jakarta has become very dicey, with a lot of rioting, we can't guarantee the security of American citizens there, and neither can the Indonesian authorities," he said. "This is not panic, but we all take very seriously our obligations to protect American lives."
The State Department said that it had ordered all "nonessential" employees of the United States Embassy to leave the country immediately and warned American citizens not to travel there.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Threatens Action If Cabbies Fail to Cancel a Protest

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Escalating his showdown with the city's taxi drivers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani threatened yesterday to allow vans and livery cars to pick up passengers off the street beginning on Monday unless yellow cab drivers cancel plans to hold another demonstration next week.
Mr. Giuliani issued the ultimatum a day after most of the city's 44,000 cabbies, upset about new safety rules that the Mayor wants to impose, staged a one-day protest that left many streets clear and horn-free yet forced many people to turn to public transportation to get around. 
 Mr. Giuliani said that even if the drivers call off their plans for a second job action on Thursday, he still planned to use the strike as an opening to try to break the yellow cabs' 61-year monopoly on "street hails" -- the ability to pick up passengers at the curb in the five boroughs.
"They are presenting us with opportunities that I'm more than happy to take advantage of, which the city has not been able to take advantage of for the last 20 to 30 years, to introduce a lot more competition into their industry," the Mayor said at a news conference in midtown Manhattan.
Liberalized cab-hailing rules would be a drastic economic and cultural change for a city where the law limits the number of yellow cabs to 12,187. That has driven the value of a medallion -- the tin plate, bolted to the hood, that makes a taxi official -- to $250,000.
A drivers' group has threatened to continue its protest against the new regulations next Thursday by driving in a caravan from Astoria, Queens to City Hall, causing a heavy jam. In response, Mr. Giuliani said he planned to sign an emergency order, to take effect Monday, that would permit the city's 35,000 livery drivers to accept street hails in Manhattan for the next 60 days, unless the demonstration is called off. Commuter vans would also be allowed to pick up passengers.
"We're going to authorize them to do it until this state of emergency ends," he said. "If they, for example, announce that they're not going to do anything on Thursday, then we won't have to go forward with this. But right now, they are saying that on Thursday they're going to try to close down the city."
In addition, Mr. Giuliani said that drivers who tried to hold up traffic would be arrested and would risk the loss of their licenses and taxi medallions. "You can't let anybody have a stranglehold on your city," the Mayor said. "I think the people of the city are fed up with the way they've been driving. I've heard these complaints for years, and we're finally doing something about it."
The organizer of Thursday's protest, Vijay Bali of the United Yellow Cab Drivers Association, said he had no plans to back down.
"He is just trying to show his muscle because yesterday he lost," Mr. Bali said.
He said that the 2,000 drivers he claims to represent simply want a voice in drafting new regulations on cabdrivers. "We are not questioning the regulations," he said. "We are questioning the fashion."
Under the rule changes Mr. Giuliani had proposed, drivers would be required to take a defensive-driving class, fines for smoking in a cab would increase from $25 to $125, and a hack license could be revoked or suspended if the driver received too many moving violations.
The rules also would mandate additional insurance. The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade and the New York City Committee for Taxi Safety, two industry groups that represent the big fleets and the leasing operations, respectively, released a survey showing that some premiums could double.
The dispute seems tailor-made for the Mayor, who relishes his image as the man who tamed the nation's largest city, cutting the crime rate and cleaning up the streets.
"There is not a great deal of public sympathy for the taxi drivers," Mr. Giuliani acknowledged. "So as a political issue, this is what you call a no-brainer."
Mr. Giuliani said he had the power to make the temporary change in street-hailing rules, but that any long-term changes would have to be approved by the City Council.
Councilman Noach Dear, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he was skeptical of the Mayor's plans, in part because the city gets substantial revenue from medallions. "Obviously, the Mayor is posturing," Mr. Dear said. "Also obviously, the public is on his side."
Mr. Giuliani said that under his emergency order, the Taxi and Limousine Commission would set and enforce the rates for the unmetered drivers. On Wednesday, for example, in response to the one-day strike, the commission allowed 175 vans to operate from the city's two airports into Manhattan for a fare of $10. "They literally organized that in one hour, so I suspect if you give them a couple days to organize, they could do a lot better," he said. "Whatever the inconvenience of yesterday, it'll be even less on Thursday."
Regardless of whether the drivers call off their protest, the Mayor said he planned to look for new ways to promote competition in city transportation.
"I don't know the value of saying that only a certain number of people can pick up people on the street," he said. "I don't know that that doesn't create monopoly. That creates a lot of the problems that we've had for years. If we really believe that competition brings better services, then what we're doing with yellow cabs means we're creating worse service, right?"
The police released figures showing that accidents involving injuries had declined from the previous Wednesday, dropping from 36 to 33, or about 8 percent, for all vehicles and from 6 to 2 for bicycles. Marilyn Mode, the deputy police commissioner for public information, attributed the reduction to the strike. "It was less congested, and the taxi drivers weren't out driving recklessly," she said.
The drivers have said they wanted to meet with the Mayor to discuss the new rules. But Mr. Giuliani said yesterday he had no such plans.
"I don't really care what they're saying," he said. "I don't negotiate with people who want to close the city down -- never have, never will."

HEADLINE: To Spur Economies Upstate, Pataki Revives Campaign to Legalize Casinos

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has revived a controversial campaign to bring casinos to New York State, appealing to legislative leaders in both parties to begin immediately the lengthy process toward a constitutional amendment legalizing casino gambling.
In a letter sent this week, Mr. Pataki told the leaders that casino gambling would allow New York to recapture billions of dollars now flowing into other states, and into Canada, where casinos are legal. 
 He also said that casino gambling would bolster the beleaguered economies of areas like the Catskills and Niagara Falls, where resort owners and local officials have long seen casinos as a potential source of tax dollars, business development and jobs.
"With each passing year, our state forfeits millions of vacationers and billions of dollars to casino resort areas in Connecticut, Atlantic City, Quebec, Las Vegas, and now Niagara Falls, Ontario," Mr. Pataki wrote, adding, "Whatever our feelings about gambling, we can no longer deny that New York sends more gamblers to these resorts than any other state."
This afternoon, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican and the majority leader of the State Senate, issued a statement saying he was willing to take up an amended casino measure this session.
"Personally, I continue to oppose casino gambling but believe the issue should be decided by a statewide public referendum on a constitutional amendment," he said.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver also said he was open to considering casino gambling. But Mr. Silver, a Democrat, questioned the sincerity of Mr. Pataki, who he said had expended little political capital in pushing the previous gambling measure through the Senate, where it faced stiff resistance among his allies. That, he said, is why he believes that the letter is an election-year ploy intended to appease upstate voters who form the core of the Governor's political base.
The State Constitution bans casino gambling. To change that, two consecutively elected Legislatures must pass a resolution calling for a statewide referendum on the issue. If the measure is approved by the current Legislature and again next year by a newly elected Legislature, the issue will go to voters for final approval in November 1999.
Mr. Pataki's push for casino gambling comes a little more than a year after a failed attempt to authorize casinos in the Catskills, Buffalo, Niagara Falls and in the Lake George area. That proposal enjoyed wide support in the Assembly, but Republicans in the Senate overwhelmingly defeated the proposal before it could reach the other chamber.
The Governor's aides said today that Mr. Pataki believed that there was mounting pressure on the Legislature to act now given the rising complaints from communities across the state that are losing visitors to newly opened casinos, most notably a sprawling, three-story casino in Niagara Falls, Canada. But Mr. Silver said that if Mr. Pataki had been genuinely committed to bringing casinos into New York he would not have squandered a chance last year to get the Senate on board.
The Governor's latest move, first reported in The Buffalo News today, is likely to reignite a fierce debate that has pitted a broad range of gambling opponents against local officials and business leaders who see casinos as the only hope for restoring economic vitality to their communities.
Lester Schulklapper, a lobbyist for resort owners in communities stretching from the Catskills to Niagara Falls, praised the Governor's action, saying it had the potential to push the casino issue to the forefront of the legislative agenda this year.
But Mr. Pataki's move drew sharp criticism from antigambling groups, including religious leaders and conservatives who are normally allies of the Governor's. The groups said that pro-casino forces did not take into account the hidden social and financial costs of legalizing casinos, including the need to expand police forces and courts to deal with gambling-related crime.
John M. Kerry, the executive director of the New York State Catholic Conference, said he was surprised and disappointed that the Governor would take such an aggressive stand on behalf of casino gambling barely more than a year after the Senate had rejected the idea.
"One should not seek to enhance the economic well-being of a community through means that are at best marginally productive and at worst immoral," he said. "There have been many studies showing that casino gambling actually has an increased cost for the public sector, to address the social and economic impact on families. It appears that the only ones who really benefit from casino gambling are very wealthy private entrepreneurs and possibly organized crime."
Mr. Pataki did not actually propose legislation outlining where he would like to see casinos established. But his aides said he favored having casinos in traditional tourist spots.
His aides also said he favored including New York City among the places where casinos would be permitted to operate. But the addition of New York City might hurt any chance the measure had of passing in the Assembly because Mr. Silver, who is from Manhattan, has firmly opposed that idea.

HEADLINE: HAILING DANGER: A special report.;
Behind the Wheel: Long Hours and Hard Feelings

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

 BODY:
Like generations of poor immigrants before him, the Bangladeshi Mamun Masud sought to fulfill the sunny promise of America behind the wheel of a yellow taxi. Each day spent amid Manhattan's potholes and gridlock was a gift to his young daughters, whose lives, he said, "should be better than mine."
Mr. Masud and a friend had teamed up in a common arrangement. They leased a taxi medallion from a broker for $685 a week, adding an extra $250 toward the purchase of the cab itself. One man worked a 5 P.M. to 5 A.M. shift, the other 5 A.M. to 5 P.M. Taking but a single day off, they each made about $800 a week, though repair bills for the overburdened vehicle often gnawed into the profit. 
Then, late last year, the friend moved away. Mr. Masud, 40, either had to quickly find another driver for the second shift or default on his car loan. Anxious weeks passed until, one afternoon, someone gave him the address of Naeem Akhter, a Pakistani cabby who lived in the North Bronx.
Mr. Akhter, 27, comes from a reverent Islamic family. Mr. Masud asked him if he had driven for a long time, and Mr. Akhter assured him that he had. More questioning would only have been an embarrassment, Mr. Masud said, so he did not learn of his new partner's 11 license suspensions and 6 moving violations until after the accident.
On Jan. 15, Mr. Akhter was at the wheel when the taxi jumped a curb on the Upper East Side, pinning Sachiko Kiyabu against a light pole and tearing off her right leg. Scattered about were the items she had just purchased at lunch time, among them a pair of sneakers still swathed in white tissue. Nearby, a baby stroller lay crumpled. A little boy with broken legs wailed in pain.
Something has gone wrong with taxi safety, and many New Yorkers, most prominently Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, believe the solution rests with getting tougher on cabbies. His proposals for harsh new penalties against drivers this week caused cabbies to stay home on Wednesday and left the Mayor to counter: who needs you, anyway?
But the gloomy tale of Mr. Masud and Mr. Akhter speaks of deeply embedded problems in a complicated $1.5 billion industry: unforgiving arithmetic in the leasing of taxis and medallions; inadequate scrutiny in the hiring of drivers; grueling 12-hour shifts, and high turnover in what is now largely an entry-level immigrant industry, likened by some to a sweatshop on wheels.
"What the city has created is a system with demeaned, poorly paid drivers who work under conditions of maximum stress," said Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College who has studied the taxi industry.
"There are already so many rules and regulations, that any taxi stopped at any time can be found to have something wrong that can lead to a fine. The long-term solution is not more nit-picking with more rules, but reducing the pressures that cause some drivers to drive like madmen."
The leasing system -- and its underlying economics -- is often thought to be the pathogen for much of what ails the business. Before 1979, when leasing became legal, most cabbies were simply employees, driving for large fleets and sharing a percentage of their day's receipts with the company. Many drivers had health insurance and a retirement plan.
But as powers within the industry favored leasing, most cabbies, out of necessity, became small-business operators bedeviled by big overhead. Typically, they pay lease fees up front, starting each 12-hour shift about $90 to $135 in the hole. What sometimes follows is a frantic quest for fares. "It's a different mind-set," said Mike Snaky, a cabby. "Drivers get a little crazy until they break even."
Whatever the causes of taxi accidents, the numbers have been climbing alarmingly. Between 1990 and 1996, accidents involving "taxis" -- yellow cabs, car services and other liveries -- shot up 41 percent, according to police statistics.
But, oddly, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission does not keep track of accidents. It does not know which of its drivers were involved in the 12,557 accidents that occurred in 1996, how serious each one was or whether a cabby was at fault.
Edward McGettigan Jr., head underwriter for the industry's largest insurer, thinks the T.L.C.'s emphasis has been cockeyed: "If I'm driving 40,000 miles a year, does that mean I'll get a lot of tickets? Probably. Does it mean I'm a bad driver? No. If I get into six accidents a year, does it mean I'm a bad driver? Probably."
To discipline cabbies, the commission has relied on its own judicial system of summonses and hearings. Hack licenses can be taken away after a combination of violations, big and small, such as reckless driving, discourtesy to a passenger or the improper operation of a roof light.
The Mayor's new proposals call for higher fines by the commission, more insurance coverage, mandatory drug testing and other measures. The plan would also make mandatory the reporting of taxi accidents to the T.L.C.
Cabbies approve of some of these measures, though they regard the plan as something out of kilter, a proposed overhaul that involves profound overkill.
For instance, taxi drivers would be suspended for 30 days if they compiled six penalty points on their driver's licenses during an 18-month period, something achievable with only two illegal turns and the obstruction of one intersection.
Would that take good cabbies off the road as well as bad? they ask.
"To pull out a few weeds, they are mowing down everything," said Vijay Bali, a leader of the United Yellow Cab Drivers Association, one of the few cabby groups in an industry that is hard to organize.
"Thousands will lose their licenses, and who will replace them? I ask you: Is this being done because the driver today is basically a minority person? Is this because of bad publicity and politics and a city that has a bull's eye on the driver's back? Has the taxi driver been made an object of hate?"
 
The Accidents
An Injury Unleashes Anger and Blame
Sachiko Kiyabu, 51, a buyer for a cable TV station, was once a nimble woman who easily skipped up the 35 steps to her office. Now, a wrap of bandages covers the stump where her knee ought to be. She mostly stays at home in a wheelchair.
"She's like an injured animal, afraid to go out in the world," her husband, Jim Ward, whispered when his wife was wheeled out of earshot.
The couple had agreed to speak of their personal calamity. Two cabbies were involved in the accident on the Upper East Side, and the police have concluded that both were at fault. To Ms. Kiyabu, these men -- Naeem Akhter and another Pakistani, Jillani Ghulam -- are nothing more than "assailants."
Mr. Ward, an airline pilot, was reserved as his wife talked in their apartment, but then he suddenly detonated with wrath. "Take their money, take their livelihood or, better yet, throw them in jail," he said of the drivers.
"These taxis go careening about the city. Running people down. Killing them. Gaggles of cars careening down the streets, a horde of kamikazes!"
His wife corrected him. "Kamikazes also kill themselves," she said softly. "These people just kill other people."
Given their hurt, it may be understandable for Ms. Kiyabu and Mr. Ward to demonize the two cabbies, to say they never want to meet them or to know of their lives. Their rancor is also a concession to a New York myth: the rude, half-mad cabby darting for openings in a frenzied hopscotch through Manhattan.
The facts of the accident, however, are too ambiguous to reek of malice or recklessness. And the drivers involved, flaws and all, are hardly demons.
Jillani Ghulam came to America 12 years ago from the historic city of Lahore. He was 27, and wanted to go to college. Back home, he had worked in animal husbandry, on livestock farms. That job paid $150 a month, he said. Here, mopping tables was paying $60 a day. He forgot about college.
In the late 80's, Mr. Ghulam, like many Pakistanis, acquired a hack license. But without knowing the city, he found the work too stressful and quit after a few days. When he began again in 1993, he was more comfortable at the wheel, if still unhappy with the wages. The fleets charged $100 a day to lease a car, but he often took home only $70 in profit after a 12-hour shift.
His younger brother was also a cabby, and the two decided to get a stake of their own. With what they could save and borrow, they made a $40,000 down payment on a medallion, that vital piece of tin whose price had already hyper-inflated past $170,000. Their math was sound. What they saved from paying the usual lease fees was enough to get them through the inevitable calamities: the engine breakdowns and the torn upholstery and the occasional summonses.
At the time of the Jan. 15 accident, Mr. Ghulam had a son just starting to walk and a pregnant wife. He lives in a small home in Long Island City, Queens. A polite, earnest man, he seems to have surrendered himself to oncoming doom.
"Fate has seized my neck," Mr. Ghulam said, subduing sobs. "There will be lawsuits, and I will lose the medallion and my life will be a ruin."
He mentioned pity for Ms. Kiyabu, but that concern seemed outweighed by his own lamentations about a livelihood in jeopardy.
"People think all taxi drivers are animals," he said, first angrily, then defensively. "I am always a clean-shaven man in clean clothes."
For four months, the hack licenses of Mr. Ghulam and Mr. Akhter have been under suspension. A hearing was held on April 1, and the two men are awaiting the decision of an administrative law judge. Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the T.L.C. Commissioner, will have final say about whether the two will drive a cab again.
Blame has been hard to apportion. Neither was speeding, investigators say. Mr. Ghulam initiated the tragedy when he improperly strayed from his lane and grazed the other cab, which then veered into the sidewalk. But Mr. Akhter was at fault as well, detectives concluded. Though his side mirror was sheared off, the bumping of his taxi was deemed far too slight for him to lose control.
"I am the latest taxi trophy for someone," Mr. Akhter said bitterly, suggesting that high-profile accidents require a cabby as sacrifice.
He is an affable man with bushy eyebrows that hang like archways above his eyes. He lives among a large extended family in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx. His sister married a lawyer and she was the first to emigrate from the small town of Gujarkhan. One by one, 10 other siblings followed.
Mr. Akhter arrived at age 17. He would become a vendor, selling fruit at 44th Street and the Avenue of the Americas and later hot dogs in Battery Park.
"I am not skillful," he said. "My best skill is driving."
There are managers at taxi garages who assess applicants before leasing them a cab. By their standards, Mr. Akhter would have been considered a high risk.
Some drivers who are in debt take more chances on the road, and Mr. Akhter, divorced, was $2,700 behind in his child support payments. Though licensed since 1993, he was still a novice cabby, having driven for less than six months. In December, 1997, he received two tickets, one for stopping in a bus lane, the other for a hasty dash across four lanes of traffic.
Recently, at home, Mr. Akhter talked about himself as some members of his family listened. When asked if he felt badly for Ms. Kiyabu, he said yes, but added: "I think I am just as much a victim as she is."
Others agreed, though several in the family said Ms. Kiyabu's tragedy was to them an ongoing torment.
"We have been praying for that woman who was hurt," said Mohammad N. Rahim, a taxi driver and Mr. Akhter's brother. "We wanted to visit her and tell her about us and tell her that we are not criminal people. This was an accident.
"We discussed it and then asked the man at the taxi broker's office. He said, 'They'll just be more upset and probably take a swing at you.' "
 
The Drivers
Facing an Exam, And Then Passengers
Most every New Yorker has a cabby horror story, and these usually involve long journeys to short destinations, and the screech and blur of a wild ride.
But life from the front seat, while no less forbidding, has a transposed view of good and bad. Cabbies say this high-strung, thin-skinned city is abundant with riders who malign immigrant drivers, stiff them on fares and leave behind keepsakes of spilled cappuccino, muffin crumbs and masticated gum. At night come the drunks, moodily wading out of their scotch and water.
For every breakneck cabby, there are a dozen behind-schedule big shots who demand to go faster, like cowboys whipping a stallion into a gallop. People like to flag a taxi in a crosswalk, where picking up passengers is illegal. They like to be dropped off exactly at their door, whether this requires double parking or not.
New Yorkers grumble about cabbies who scoot across the avenue to vie for a fare, and yet cabbies complain about people who, without fail, get into those same taxis, seemingly glad to get a bold driver who can out-run the lights.
"It's a disgusting job," said one cabby, Mehmood Khan, 32. "People curse you, don't pay you, call you a damned Paki and tell you to go back home."
To drive a cab, a person must be at least 19, hold a chauffeur's license, possess "good moral character," be a United States citizen or a legal resident and pass two tests, the first of which demands a minimum ability to read -- though not necessarily to speak -- English. Passing that exam leads to 40 to 80 hours of class work in etiquette, map-reading, geography and defensive driving: What is a blind spot? Where is Yankee Stadium?
About 70 percent of the students pass the final exam.
The city-licensed Master Cabbie Taxi Academy is a grim, three-story walk-up in a warehouse district of Queens. Twenty-three men were recently in attendance, almost all of them immigrants who, during break time, spoke of the usual trapdoors into joblessness. To them, a yellow cab seemed a vehicle of financial rescue, though few knew much more about the cars than their color.
At one point, the instructor asked: "How many of you have been -- and I didn't say drive -- I ask, how many of you have been inside a taxi?"
Only 11 raised their hands.
As the lesson went on, only two items dominated students' concerns: fares and tips. This prompted the teacher to ask another revealing question: How much of what you make off the meter is taxable?
"Zero," one man answered as the others nodded agreeably.
 
The Incentives
Pushing the Limits To Make a Profit
Drivers don't like the job. The backaches, the worry, the lip. They are bouncing down city streets, needing to use the bathroom. Some passenger orders them into a traffic jam, then says, "Driver, I'll just get out right here."
Money is the magnet that keeps a cabby in a car, though the earnings of a typical driver are hard to determine. Winters pay more than summers, night shifts more than days. Some cabbies vastly out-hustle others.
These days, most cabbies talk of averaging $70 to $90 a day, and blame lean earnings for the rise in accidents, favoring the theory that unpaid bills can tempt a driver into unsafe turns. Fleet owners put the numbers at $100 to $200 a day, and wonder why there is a shortage in so lucrative an occupation.
A total of 45,266 cabbies have up-to-date hack licenses for the city's 12,187 medallion taxis, but owners always say they are short of drivers.
Most cabbies begin their careers leasing on a daily or weekly basis from one of the larger fleets, which have 100 or so cabs. These operations are self-insured, and, consequently, their owners claim to have a greater stake in safe driving. Managers give applicants a road test before leasing them one of their precious taxis, and, alarmingly, report that 35 to 50 percent are turned away.
Parked cabs earn no money, of course, and some fleet owners report that 15 percent of their shifts are idle in any given week. How often, then, do they let their standards slide and let a greenhorn have a go at it? Brokers have the same economic pressures. Do they let medallions sit unused in a drawer?
"No matter what they say, nobody's that picky when they really need the drivers," said Fidel F. Del Valle, the T.L.C. Commissioner from 1991 to 1995. "It's a balance of the finances against the risk. Some owners couldn't give a damn about who they put on the street."
Joseph C. Hennessy, in the taxi business for 34 years, gives the road tests at the Team System Corporation, one of the bigger fleets. He tests plenty of people who can't even make it off the lot without bending a fender. Still, Mr. Hennessy cannot be too picky. Since leasing took root, a cabby who wants to drive for a fleet is as much a customer as a job applicant. Fleet owners or brokers: they are a lot like Hertz. They need people to lease their cars.
One morning, a tall Albanian immigrant, laid off from a construction job, walked into Team System. Mr. Hennessy entrusted him with a taxi, and the man could handle a car superbly. But he also one-handed the wheel, rolled through stop signs and jackknifed ahead of oncoming traffic to complete left turns.
The derring-do made Mr. Hennessy flunk him.
"But in a taxi, you need to make money, you go fast," the Albanian man said crossly.
He walked off angrily, and as Mr. Hennessy watched him go, he knew some other fleet would lease the man a car.
"Drive for someone else for three or four months," Mr. Hennessy called after him hopefully. "Then come see me again."
 
The Penalties
Cabbies Say Scrutiny Feels Like Persecution
Fines, suspensions, revocations: these always have been the ways to punish rule-breaking drivers. The Giuliani administration turned up the heat.
In 1995, the Police Department was ordered to form a special unit to enforce the host of T.L.C. regulations for medallion taxis. These rules run the gamut: running a red light, giving incorrect change, tampering with a fare meter, refusing to pick up a passenger, not taking the shortest route.
Dozens of uniformed officers focus their attention on yellow cabs. By 1997, the total number of commission summonses against drivers had risen by 115 percent, according to city statistics.
Drivers have taken note. "War has been declared on the taxi driver," said Lesly Princival, 39, a cabby since 1982. "They have taxi inspections where they pull you over and harass you. The car is dirty -- a summons. This light is out -- a summons. There is a receipt hanging from the meter -- a summons."
Capt. Walter Smith, who runs the unit, said these inspections are needed to maintain credibility. "If a driver thought all he had to do was drive safely in order to never be pulled over, then he wouldn't have to take care of his cab, would he? He could put a zapper on the meter or take out the seat belts."
But taxi enforcement, important as it is, may well be having a perverse effect, cabbies say. It begins to seem like persecution.
"They make it too tough to make a living," said Balvinder Singh, a driver. "You pay on the medallion, the car, the repairs, the fines: it's too much."
It would be helpful to know how many summonses are being written for each particular violation. But, during a two-month period, Deputy Commissioner Allan J. Fromberg was unable to produce any such breakdown. He did, however, admit to a serious problem of overcrowding in the Taxi and Limousine Commission's court.
"The system really puts a lot of people through the wringer," Mr. Fromberg said. "I mean that in the context of an emotional situation. It's not a very nice thing to have to go through."
The main taxi court, in Long Island City, Queens, is a shabby old structure with a small elevator that inches its way up the three floors to the commission.
On busier days, lines begin forming at 5:30 A.M. for a 7 A.M. opening of the doors and an 8:30 start of proceedings. The line outside leads to the line to the elevator. Once upstairs, the line for registration then leads to the hours-long wait in a waiting room for a hearing, which is followed by another wait in the waiting room for the judge's decision, and then the line to pay the fines.
Only tempers seem short, as drivers strain to hear their names called in a hivelike atmosphere abuzz with mumbles and cursing. Guilty or not, a cabby is likely to lose a day's pay as he tarries. There are no pay phones -- no way to tell a boss that things are taking longer than expected or to check up on the child care situation at home. The paperwork befits Kafka, with several mind-boggled cabbies reporting only to pay fines for their "failure to appear" at hearings for which they have already appeared and paid earlier fines.
"This is torture, this is anti-human, this is anti to anything decent to humanity," groused Ali G. Darabi, 57, one recent day, well into his 10th hour of waiting. A cabby since 1971, he was wise enough to bring along a large volume of Persian poetry by the great Jalal ad-Din ar-Rumi, but even the spiritual couplets of a sufi mystic could not calm his soul for so long.
"This is fascism to the extreme point," he said, vowing he had finally had enough. He would turn in his hack license as soon as he paid his $80 in fines for a burned-out bulb in his off-duty light, a receipt found hanging in his meter, a trip card that had his name written in pencil, not pen.
In court, he told the judge, "I am sick and tired. I want out. Here, please take my license."
She sympathized, but, obeying protocol, told him: "This is not where you submit your license. You know that. Go to the second floor and wait in line."

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE OVERVIEW;
Indonesian Capital Engulfed by Rioting

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Friday, May 15

 BODY:
Indonesia's capital descended into chaos on Thursday, as rioting and looting broke out in virtually every quarter of the city and the death toll rose. Bands of people swept up and down Jakarta's main streets, setting fire to cars, shattering windows in office buildings, and burning and pillaging stores.
By nightfall, tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled through the center of the city, while 15,000 troops took up positions at the Presidential Palace and elsewhere. Fires continued to burn throughout Jakarta, with plumes of smoke billowing for miles in every direction. 
 Agence France-Presse reported that about 170 people were killed today when fire broke out at a department store in east Jakarta. It said morgue officials had provided the estimate of the death toll.
The United States urged Americans in Indonesia's largest cities to leave the country, and international corporations were advising their employees to stay home from work today. Page A9.
President Suharto returned here this morning, having cut short a visit to Egypt after student protests erupted into a mass uprising when the police killed six students at a demonstration on Tuesday.
Antara news agency reported today that President Suharto had ordered the cancellation of two decrees that had raised prices of fuel and electricity "to alleviate the burden on the people at this time of crisis," according to Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto.
Troops dispatched to trouble spots in the city were greeted with wild applause by the rioters, and the soldiers smiled in return. Army troops generally did not intervene to prevent the looting. Rioters and soldiers mingled easily with each other, and late Thursday, teen-agers were hitching rides on troop transports.
Indonesia's military commanders are still presumed to be loyal to Mr. Suharto. But political analysts note that the military could play a decisive role in tipping the scales against the Suharto Government if it chose to throw its support behind the anti-Government movement.
The chief of Indonesia's armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, said in a news conference this afternoon that order had been restored to the city center. Surprising both diplomats and local analysts, he did not impose a curfew, despite the path of destruction that extended from the central business district to an ethnic Chinese enclave in North Jakarta to the airport highway west of town. Gangs of looters tore up streets signs and lampposts, torched cars, smashed shop windows, emptied supermarkets and carried off merchandise.
Late Thursday, Jakarta's military commander finally ordered his troops to crack down on rampaging mobs. "We must face rioters and looters firmly," said the commander, Syafrie Syamsudin, in televised remarks. "We are soldiers who will support the nation and we will never surrender."
Banks, schools, and businesses closed in the early afternoon, sending a fresh wave of people into the streets to witness and take part in the destruction. By early evening, the airport toll road was closed. Witnesses said mobs were attacking cars headed for the airport.
"We have to change things, even if it is very violent," said Latit, a professor of dentistry at the University of Indonesia, who turned out this morning for a rally of several thousand students on the campus in central Jakarta. Mr. Latit, who as a teen-ager marched in the 1966 demonstrations that led to the overthrow of President Sukarno, said the students of today would not be satisfied by anything short of Mr. Suharto's resignation. Like hundreds of others at the rally, he wore a black band around his neck to honor the six students killed by security forces Tuesday after a demonstration at Trisakti University.
Mr. Suharto hinted on Wednesday that he might step down. At a session with Indonesians in Cairo, where he was attending a meeting of 15 developing nations, Mr. Suharto said, "If I am no longer trusted, I will become a pandito and endeavor to get closer to God." "Pandito" is the Indonesian word for a sage, suggesting that Mr. Suharto might accept an advisory role. Mr. Suharto made a similar remark in March before he was elected to a seventh five-year term.
But Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, played down any suggestion of a resignation. "He didn't say exactly 'step down,' " Mr. Alatas said to reporters in Cairo, offering the rather elliptical explanation that Mr. Suharto would heed the wishes of the people, but only within the bounds of the Constitution.
At the University of Indonesia on Thursday, where banners demanding political change hung from the Dutch colonial administration building, the students were in no mood to debate the semantics of Mr. Suharto's statement. "He should have left months ago," said Meli, a 23-year-old international affairs major who handed out leaflets at the rally. "But it is better late than never."
In a speech to 5,000 cheering students, Hariati Darmawan, the head of the University of Indonesia Alumni Association, warned the students not to be drawn into the mayhem outside the campus. "The burning of the city is not being done by students," he said. "It is being done by outsiders."
But while University of Indonesia students remained on the campus, thousands of others marched through Jakarta carrying banners. When one crowd of students tried to march to the University of Indonesia, they were stopped by riot police, who fired repeatedly in the air to force them back. The crowd set a car ablaze, smashed windows, and tore down street signs and fences.
An even bigger threat came from mobs of young people who flooded out of the city's poorest neighborhoods, which have been hit hard by Indonesia's spiraling unemployment. As in last week's riots in Medan, in North Sumatra, much of the aggression was aimed at ethnic Chinese, who account for less than 5 percent of the population but control much of Indonesia's economy.
Banks and shops owned by Chinese were gutted, sending clouds of smoke over the ethnic Chinese district in North Jakarta. A Reuters report said that six Chinese were burned to death in a bar on Thursday. That follows the death of 12 Chinese trapped in a burning building during riots early Wednesday morning.
The Associated Press reported today that dozens of looters died when they were trapped in a shopping mall in eastern Jakarta that rioters had set on fire.
The violence affected rich and poor Chinese alike. According to reports, rioters trashed the Jakarta home of Liem Sioe Liong, a Chinese billionaire and one of Mr. Suharto's closest friends. Diplomats said ethnic Chinese called the United States Embassy in a panic today, pleading for help. And they flooded highways to the airport, hoping to catch flights to Singapore or Hong Kong. Rioters looted Chinese shops just behind the embassy compound in central Jakarta.
From the roof of a high-rise hotel in central Jakarta, this city of 10 million looked like a vast inferno. Huge columns of smoke rose in every direction, with new fires erupting every few minutes. Police helicopters circled, while down on the streets, ambulances weaved their way through crowds of people chanting and clapping at each intersection. Above all the cacophony, the Muslim call to prayer echoed hauntingly from mosques across the city.
By late afternoon, Jakarta seemed under siege. Shopkeepers boarded up, spray-painting the word "pribumi," which means indigenous Indonesian, on their stores. A hotel in central Jakarta strung a banner expressing support for political reform across its entrance. "I wasn't too keen, but my staff said it would be a good idea," said the Scottish-born general manager, who declined to give his name.
Soldiers and police guarded universities and government buildings. But the two groups reacted very differently to the encroaching mob. Riot police stood warily with their plastic shields covering their faces, while the soldiers strode casually into the crowds of people.
Despite their large numbers, the soldiers and police simply seemed outnumbered by the surging crowds. Rioting and looting came within blocks of the city's most expensive hotels -- an enclave the armed forces are determined to protect. Rioters stormed into a department store next to the Sari Pan Pacific Hotel, smashing windows and hurling clothes to people on the street below. At a McDonald's restaurant, the owners removed the familiar Golden Arches sign to avoid provoking looters.
For all the racial undercurrents in today's violence, there was no doubting the main target for public rage: President Suharto. The headquarters of the Social Affairs Department, run by Mr. Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, was gutted.
As the sun set, about 200 people gathered in front of the Grand Hyatt Jakarta, which is owned by a conglomerate controlled by one of Mr. Suharto's sons, Bambang Trihatmodjo. They ripped bushes out of planters and shouted anti-Suharto slogans.
Soon tanks and troop transports arrived, dispersing the crowd.

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE MULTINATIONALS;
Companies Pull Back To Protect Employees

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
After yesterday's violence in Indonesia, foreign companies began taking precautions to protect their employees there.
Several companies said yesterday that they were closing their operations and evacuating their expatriate staff, but others were sitting tight and said that they did not feel their people were in imminent danger. 
 The State Department announced yesterday that it would evacuate all nonessential personnel from Indonesia and issued a travel warning urging Americans to postpone travel to the country. The moves went beyond Wednesday's decision to evacuate the families of embassy staff and other government employees.
There are nearly 10,000 Americans currently in Indonesia, according to the State Department. But because the country is made up of hundreds of islands spread over thousands of miles, many of the Americans are far away from the capital of Jakarta, where some of the most serious rioting is taking place.
The Atlantic Richfield Company said yesterday that it planned to evacuate about 320 workers in its Jakarta office and their families to Singapore but would keep the remainder of its 2,500 employees in the country.
The evacuees include about 90 American and other non-Indonesian employees plus their families and guests, said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for the company, an oil and gas producer. He said that the company's Jakarta office was closed early on Thursday to allow employees to go home and prepare for the evacuation, which would be by a chartered airplane.
General Motors, which has a small plant assembling Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles about 20 miles east of Jakarta, said that it had begun evacuating its 14 expatriate employees and their families and planned to have all of them out of the country by the end of Friday.
Other American companies, including American Express, Lucent Technologies, Citicorp, as well as ABN Ambro Holding N.V. of the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank of Germany closed their offices in downtown Jakarta indefinitely yesterday as the unrest, which has been swelling for months, reached a new level, witnesses said.
Ascanio Markinotti, managing director of Regent Private Equity, a London-based investment fund, arrived in the capital two days ago to close some property deals.
"We figured the worse it gets, the better the deals," he said yesterday. But Mr. Markinotti got more than he bargained for.
After a negotiating session yesterday, he was trapped with several Indonesian employees near the city center. Riots were raging to the north and south and two buildings outside the office tower the group was in were burning. Mr. Markinotti was forced to rent hotel rooms for himself and the employees, who were afraid to return home.
"We just did not feel comfortable trying to cross town," he said.
David Holloway, director of operations in Asia for the Kroll-O'Geara Company in Hong Kong, a risk management consultant, said that there were reports that rioters were stopping and ransacking cars on the road to Jakarta's airport. He said that he was advising his clients to find a safe refuge and stay put.
Some companies kept their offices open and had no plans to evacuate their foreign staff. Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold, which operates a copper mine on the island of Irian Jaya, 2,000 miles from Jakarta, said that its small office in the capital was not affected.
"No one has been evacuated at this time and our office is open for business," said Garland Robinette, a spokesman for the company, which is based in New Orleans.
The Newmont Mining Corporation, which operates a gold mine on the island of Sulawesi, 1,500 miles Northeast of Jakarta, and is building another mine on the island of Sumbawa, 950 miles east of the capital, said that neither operation was affected. The company has restricted travel to Indonesia from its Denver headquarters but its Jakarta offices remained open and it was not planning to evacuate any of its staff.
"We're keeping a close watch on things but at this point we don't feel that people are in danger," said Doug Hock, a spokesman.
But for foreign business people who do not have the resources of a large company behind them the situation on the ground is a lot more scary. Peter Cochran, who imports golf carts and small utility vehicles, said that he sent his Indonesian employees home an hour after they arrived at work yesterday.
He has seen his share of unrest in Indonesia, he said in a telephone interview, "but this is completely different -- this is very scary."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about precautions being taken by foreign companies in Indonesia misspelled the name of a company that advises corporations on security. It is the Kroll-O'Gara Company, not Kroll-O'Geara.

Target Practice in Geneva on the Global Trade Body

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 15

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization has come under attack recently from critics who say it ignores environmental and social issues in settling trade disputes.
At the center of the issue is a ruling against the United States last month, favoring a challenge from developing countries to the United States law that protects sea turtles from shrimpers' nets. Interest groups are accusing the three-year-old trade organization of being responsible for gutting environmental laws in the name of unfettered trade. 
 "W.T.O. allows companies to try to trump the democratic process in the United States," said Chris McGinn of the Washington-based Public Citizen Trade Watch. "It gives them an additional appeal process once a law is passed to try to undo hard-fought consumer, environmental or health legislation."
In the case of the sea turtles, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand contended that United States law illegally blocked their shrimp imports to American markets, and they won a preliminary decision. The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, chided the organization's panel for reaching "the wrong conclusion." The United States said this week that it would appeal the ruling.
A reversal is unlikely if past practice is any guide. The trade group's 132 member countries have brought more than 100 conflicts over trading practices to the dispute settlement process, although most have not yet completed the lengthy course. Of the rulings that have been appealed, none have been overturned.
That only fuels the anger of those interest groups that insist that environmental good is more important for society than global trade rules, and warn that national safeguards for the environment, food safety and labor standards are threatened by the trade organization's reach.
The W.T.O., a government-to-government entity accustomed to operating in gentlemanly secrecy, is reeling under the onslaught. "I am very sorry" about the criticism, said Renato Ruggiero, head of the organization. "We are not against endangered species."
Mr. Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, won office after the United States, which had favored another candidate and was suspicious Mr. Ruggiero might be a closet protectionist, dropped its opposition.
Trade ministers gathering in Geneva next week are expected to discuss the turtle dispute.
With a budget of about $80 million, of which the United States provides about 15 percent -- its share of world trade -- the organization has been criticized for viewing itself as aloof from concerns other than trade. The headquarters of its 500 employees, in a stately building overlooking Lake Geneva's blue waters and sailing boats, reinforces this impression.
This is the same setting enjoyed by its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Since the W.T.O. superseded GATT in 1995, its principal tasks have been administering trade agreements, providing a forum for trade negotiations and monitoring national trade policies.
Its core activity, though, is settling disputes among its members.
To date, some 126 cases have been subjected to the organization's process, a tightly choreographed set of consultations, hearings, panels and rulings. This is far more than its predecessor handled, mostly because losers then could stonewall unfavorable rulings without facing sanctions.
Dispute settlement at the W.T.O. is binding, with losing governments encouraged to fix offending trade regulations, or, if not, to agree mutually on compensation, like tariff reductions in other areas. If that fails, trade sanctions can be put on the loser. That has not been tested because, so far, losing countries have complied with rulings. The United States has used the system, modeled on American trade law, more than any other country, winning highly publicized challenges to European Union restrictions on hormone-treated meat and to the European plan for importing and selling bananas, as well as to Japan's taxes on imported spirits and Argentina's duties on footwear and textile items.
American trade negotiators have racked up a notable scorecard -- 19 victories and one loss in cases they initiated. They have also lost four cases brought by other nations. While Rita Derrick Hayes, the United States Ambassador to the World Trade Organization, praises the "rules based" system as bringing stability and predictability to world trade, governmental organizations increasingly see the organization's settlement of disputes quite differently.
"All the pressure tactics that are effective in the United States don't work with W.T.O. because it's an autocratic institution," Mr. McGinn of Public Citizen Trade Watch said.
The sea turtle case was not the first to rouse the ire of environmentalists. In 1996, Venezuela and Brazil won a challenge to the United States regulations on gasoline cleanliness that required Americans to lower overall standards, environmentalists maintain. But the criticism that followed was mild compared with the firestorm generated by the turtles case, and the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan agreed earlier this month that there was a need to bolster the public's trust in their trade club.
Even its fans acknowledge that the organization's secrecy has extracted a price in public confidence. Governments frequently leak interim rulings, supposedly confidential, to put the best face on a defeat. Mr. Ruggiero warns that such leaks undermine the organization's credibility by allowing it to be painted as the "enemy of developing countries, consumers and the environment."
The greening of the organization, pressure groups argue, should include releasing confidential documents on disputes, opening closed sessions to observers and allowing filing of outside views.
Environmentalists are also lobbying to have trade-dispute panelists vetted for possible conflicts of interest. Panelists are trade experts, usually lawyers or negotiators.
Nations involved in a dispute choose the panelists. If they cannot agree, Mr. Ruggiero steps in and makes the selection himself.
While the environmentalists will not get everything they want, governments are definitely listening. There will be a lot of talk starting Monday among trade ministers about how widely various closed doors should be opened. American environmentalists have been urging President Clinton to speak out on forging trade and environmental links at W.T.O. A variety of environmental and labor groups have promised demonstrations against the organization on Geneva's streets.
"There can be accommodation; it's just a matter of political will," said Mark Halle, chairman of the Geneva-based International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development. "The environment is now seen as an obstacle to free trade." Mr. Halle's group is an umbrella organization for interest groups that follow trade issues.
But if developing countries stick to their aims, not much will change.
"This will lead only to disruption of international trade," maintained Munir Akram, Pakistan's Ambassador to the trade organization. "The W.T.O. operates on agreements member states make with each other. If you inject questions of morality, human rights, environmental rights, where do we stop?" But, Mr. Ruggiero said, "Alone, the W.T.O. will never be able to answer all these problems."
Noting that "there must be an agreed way on the environment," Mr. Ruggiero is calling for a gathering of trade and environment ministers, by early next year, to "face the realities and see how we can make an alliance."

U.S. Steps Up Its Pressure On Japanese

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 15

 BODY:
President Clinton stepped up the pressure on Japan today to deal with its ailing economy, urging Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to quickly resolve the Japanese banking system's festering problems.
As the leaders of the seven leading industrial democracies and Russia gathered here for their annual meeting, the United States also released a report saying Japan had made modest progress over the last year in meeting promises to remove or modify regulations that hamper American companies from competing in Japan. 
 American officials pointed in particular to an agreement reached with Japan early today to make it easier for American telephone companies to compete in Japan by reducing the charges they pay to connect with the local Japanese phone system.
During a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Hashimoto, Mr. Clinton praised Japan's efforts so far to stimulate its anemic economy by increasing Government spending and cutting taxes.
But he stressed to Mr. Hashimoto that in the Administration's view Japan must do more, starting with a commitment to address the huge overhang of bad loans carried on the books of Japan's banks. American officials said that debt remained a threat to financial stability in Japan and throughout Asia.
"I believe that the economic package the Prime Minister has announced is significant and will have a positive impact," Mr. Clinton told reporters just before his session with Mr. Hashimoto. "We believe that some steps will still have to be taken on the banking reform front."
Mr. Hashimoto did not provide any direct public response to Mr. Clinton's call for him to address the banking problem. But in a statement tonight after their first gathering here as a group, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations issued a statement saying Japan had "explained its intention to strengthen the financial system, including by resolving decisively nonperforming asset problems, and stressed the importance of promoting structural reforms."
Japanese banks carry hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad loans on their books, a result of the collapse in property and stock markets in the early 1990's. Many banks are also at risk of further losses from their loans to borrowers throughout Asia, where once-vibrant economies have been struggling in the aftermath of last year's financial crisis.
Critics inside and outside the country have long said that Japan has been far too tentative in dealing with its banking problems by taking a series of small measures rather than more far-reaching steps such as forcing banks to take big write-offs, packaging bad loans into securities and selling them and liquidating banks beyond redemption.
Citing the United States' experience with the savings and loan crisis, when early attempts at a fix proved halfhearted and insufficient, Mr. Clinton advised the Japanese leader not to delay any further, American officials said after the meeting.
"The President shared our views on the situation and the lessons that we had learned on the need for prompt and decisive steps," said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy adviser. White House officials did not say whether Mr. Clinton had advocated any particular steps.
The report on Japan's efforts at deregulation, called for as part of an agreement reached last year, noted Japan's steps to open up its financial markets and to reduce barriers to foreign competition in industries including construction, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and retailing.
During negotiations over the last few days, Japanese officials detailed how they intended to carry out some of the promised changes. But the agreement contained no numerical targets by which to measure progress toward market opening. American officials acknowledged that to a large degree they were relying on the good faith of the Japanese to make real progress on the issues, many of which have been sources of friction between the nations for a decade or more.
Japan has agreed, for example, to abolish a law that made it difficult for large-scale retailers like Toys "R" Us to open stores. The agreement puts the decision in the hands of local governments, and allows them to block new stores on the basis of environmental factors including traffic and noise. But it remains unclear how expansively local governments will use their powers to block such construction, which would provide more competition to local retailers.
"As you know, some people have said that in the Japanese lexicon the word deregulation translated just means reregulation," said Richard Fisher, the deputy United States trade representative. "We're well aware of that. However, we have the good faith of our fellow negotiators. And secondly, we will continue with a very watchful eye to supervise the implementation of these programs."

HEADLINE: An Exclusive Economic Summit

 BODY:
This weekend's meeting in Britain of leaders from industrialized countries is dealing with the crisis in Indonesia and the economic tribulations of other Asian nations. But only one Asian country, Japan, is represented. Fighting international crime and increasing the jobs that globalization creates are also on the agenda. But the countries most affected by these issues are absent. It is useful to have an annual summit where leaders can talk about solving global problems. But that gathering can no longer exclude the developing world.
The G-7, which since the addition of Russia is also known as the G-8, has changed since its creation in the early 1970's. It was initiated by the finance ministers of France and Germany to talk about world economic problems like the oil crisis and the collapse of the fixed-rate monetary system created after World War II. Presidents and prime ministers started attending in 1975. Until last year the group included the United States, Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, France and Germany. But then Russia was added, a concession designed to soften the blow of NATO expansion. The forum has gradually become more choreographed and the retinue of aides grows each year. It has also broadened its focus to political problems. This weekend, India and Kosovo are on the agenda. The meetings end with announcements about the consensus reached -- often cosmetic -- and all the leaders get their picture taken, last time in cowboy gear. In short, not much is done. 
 The G-8 would be more useful if, as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has suggested, it were less formal, leaving more time for discussion about the trade-offs necessary to achieve common goals. But the main problem with the forum today is that the issues it deals with reach far beyond its members. Crime, drugs, the environment and trade are all issues where the policies of China, Uganda, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico or India can be as important as those of most G-8 members.
Limiting the G-8 also leaves important new problems without a flexible forum for informal discussion. The United Nations is too ritualized to deal effectively with problems like disease, migration and extending the benefits of the global economy to nations now excluded. The Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based think tank, usefully suggests a global economic summit, with a small group of leaders of developed and developing nations, to discuss these issues. The G-8 would be more useful if it could replace a few hundred aides with a few more leaders, and let them talk without a script.

HEADLINE: Godzilla, Present And Past

BYLINE: By Michael Schaller; Michael Schaller, a professor of history at the University of Arizona, is the author of "Altered States: The U.S. and Japan Since the Occupation."

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
A new, high-tech "Godzilla" makes its cinematic debut in a few days, a reincarnation of the cult movie classic of the 1950's. This Godzilla vents its wrath on New Year's revelers in Times Square, but the monster's trail stretches back to a time of fear and mistrust in Japan.
On March 1, 1954, the United States tested its new hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific. Spotter planes failed to detect a small Japanese fishing boat, the Fukuryu Maru, or Lucky Dragon, trawling for tuna just outside the security cordon. 
 A shift in wind direction spread fallout from the 15-megaton blast beyond the predicted safety zone. Radioactive ash and rain fell on the boat.
By the time the boat returned to Japan on March 14, several crewmen showed symptoms of radiation sickness. Japan's press said the ship had been "dusted by the ashes of death," accounts that unleashed a long-suppressed anguish among the Japanese.
For seven years after the end of World War II, the American occupation authorities barred public discussion of the atomic bombs or firebombs that had been dropped on Japan. When sovereignty was restored in 1952, Japanese officials continued to discourage any dialogue, probably fearful of upsetting the treaty ending the occupation. The Lucky Dragon incident pierced the veil of silence.
The United States Atomic Energy Commission, focused on maintaining secrecy about the H-bomb's composition, transformed an unfortunate incident into a crisis between the countries. The commission chairman told President Dwight D. Eisenhower that the Lucky Dragon was probably a "Red spy outfit" sent to gather samples. Eisenhower was dissuaded from offering a serious apology or compensation to the crew. Many Japanese saw this as calculated indifference.
Anger increased when one crew member, Kuboyama Aikichi, died on Sept. 23. Large demonstrations in Tokyo called for an end to American nuclear tests in the Pacific.
Against this backdrop, "Godzilla: King of the Monsters" was released in late 1954, the first of more than 20 Godzilla features from Japan. The horror genre gave the filmmakers the cover they needed to skirt the Government's policy of silence. Appearing only a few months after the Lucky Dragon incident, "Godzilla" opens with an ominous explosion and series of flashes that sink Japanese fishing boats. Moving along an island-hopping route like that of both America's wartime aerial attacks and the Lucky Dragon, Godzilla inflicts burns and carnage that are described in the same terms used by the Japanese press for the war's bombing victims.
A generation of Americans screamed in wonder as Godzilla incinerated Tokyo, but Japanese audiences saw the film differently. The Lucky Dragon incident and the film kindled anti-nuclear activism among the previously pliant Japanese. These protests merged with others against American bases in Japan. In June 1960, mass demonstrations almost toppled the Japanese Government.
In later movies, Godzilla evolved in step with Japan's global interests. In 1963, as trade with the United States flourished and the Soviets seemed more ominous to Japan, the Toho Studio released "King Kong vs. Godzilla." This time, Godzilla sprang from the Arctic Ocean and attacked the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido -- just as the Soviets might. King Kong, a South Pacific monster integrally linked to the United States, helped the Japanese repulse the attack.
The growing trade imbalance starting in the 1970's altered America's benign view of its chief Asian ally. The new "Godzilla," produced by Americans for the Japanese-owned Sony Studio, is set to devastate New York. When the story was conceived in the early 1990's, the idea of a rampaging Japan as No. 1 and a victimized America in decline had some logic.
Now, however, Japan is in a prolonged period of economic weakness and the American economy is surging. Meanwhile, a new nuclear threat looms in India. It will be interesting to see how the identities of the villain and victim play out in this latest, but surely not last, Godzilla film.

HEADLINE: Dominicans Mourn Death Of Candidate

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 15

 BODY:
In politics here, personalities have always mattered more than parties. So it should surprise no one that the death earlier this week of Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, one of the country's most popular and charismatic figures, has replaced the debate over any single issue as the focal point of elections scheduled for Saturday.
The main leader of the left-center Dominican Revolutionary Party for the last 25 years and three times a candidate for president of this Caribbean nation, most recently in 1996, Mr. Pena Gomez, 61, was leading comfortably in the race for mayor of the capital when he died on Sunday night of cancer. 
 Three days of official mourning appear merely to have intensified doubts about the outcome of the balloting.
The results of the congressional and municipal vote are regarded as crucial to the fortunes of President Leonel Fernandez Reyna, who is 18 months into his four-year term. Mr. Fernandez's Dominican Liberation Party, which came to power promising economic reforms and an end to official corruption, controls just 1 of 30 Senate seats and only 10 of 120 seats in the lower house.
Dominican and American officials have recently expressed concern at what they describe as an influx of campaign funds to both opposition parties from cocaine cartels in Colombia and the United States, intended to thwart Mr. Fernandez's efforts to battle drug trafficking and money laundering. His Government has also sought, with limited success, to make the Dominican economy more attractive to foreign investment.
Those questions have been suddenly overshadowed, however, by the outpouring of grief that has followed Mr. Pena Gomez's death. A brilliant orator who endured racism and a grinding, almost Dickensian poverty as a child, Mr. Pena Gomez became the standard-bearer for many poor and black Dominicans, who took encouragement and comfort from his rise to national prominence.
Party leaders have sought to capitalize on that deeply-rooted affection by repeatedly broadcasting speeches from Mr. Pena Gomez's funeral, including one especially emotional tribute delivered by Felipe Gonzalez, the former Prime Minister of Spain. In addition, Mr. Pena Gomez's own campaign commercials have also continued to run on television and radio, most notably one showing him visibly ill and saying that he forgave those who had persecuted him.
That emotional message appears to have taken root among voters. "I didn't intend to vote, but the greatest homage I can pay to my leader is to vote for his slate," Juan Ramon Custodio, a 23-year-old grocery clerk, said Thursday as he sold soft drinks to a customer. "He may have physically departed from this world, but I want his ideas to live on."
At the same time, tempers have been running high here all week. Mr. Fernandez was pelted with oranges and insults when he went to a stadium to pay his respects to Mr. Pena Gomez, and his Vice President was spat at by supporters of Mr. Pena Gomez still resentful over their party's narrow defeats in 1994 and 1996.
In a striking confirmation of the personality-based foundation of Dominican politics, Mr. Pena Gomez's party turned to a star from the entertainment world as his replacement: the singer and band leader Johnny Ventura. On the ticket with Mr. Ventura, a former legislator whose image was already widely displayed in advertisements for whisky and other products, is none other than Mr. Pena Gomez's widow, Peggy Cabral.
Both other major candidates also have show-business backgrounds. Former Mayor Rafael Corporan de los Santos is the host of a television variety program, while Roberto Salcedo, the choice of the President's party, is a television producer.
Mr. Pena Gomez's death occurred too late for its impact to show in opinion polls. But the news magazine Rumbo, said it was clear that "his death opens the doors to substantial changes in the composition of Dominican political leadership."

HEADLINE: Scant Increase In U.S. Output

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Industrial production rose one-tenth of 1 percent in April as manufacturing output increased for only the second time this year and output by utilities and mines declined, the Federal Reserve said today.
The increase in April matched analysts' expectations and was slower than March's gain, which was revised today to three-tenths of 1 percent from the two-tenths of 1 percent reported initially. 
 The factory-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, fell to 81.9 percent in April from an unrevised 82.2 percent in March.
Manufacturing output rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April. Mining dropped two-tenths of 1 percent, and utility output fell 1.9 percent.

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE MARKETS;
Central Bank In Indonesia On Sidelines; Worry Grows

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Indonesia's financial markets ground to a halt yesterday when the central bank stopped acting as a middleman in foreign-currency transactions for a second day, further weakening confidence in the battered economy.
With the central bank on the sidelines, the outlook for the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, became murkier. The rupiah has fallen about 20 percent in value in the last week, which will cause the prices of necessities like food and fuel to rise and likely aggravate social unrest already fed by rising costs. 
 While markets throughout Asia remained relatively calm yesterday, investors are still very concerned about the long-term effects of Indonesia's growing crisis. Indonesian officials said the central bank might resume its foreign-exchange functions on Monday, but some analysts doubted that.
"Our sources there tell us that the central bank won't resume clearing until May 20," said Pratap Raju of I.D.E.A., an economics consultancy in New York. A few days' worth of delayed payments are not too serious, he said, but "what concerns us more is that it will scare away foreign investment at a time when Indonesia really needs the money."
The crisis also complicates negotiations between the Indonesian Government and international banks to repackage $80 billion in debt owed by private companies. And a team from the International Monetary Fund, which arranged a $43 billion rescue package last fall, postponed a weekend visit to Jakarta intended to review Indonesia's economic state.
Stock prices in Jakarta rose slightly on Friday, but the rupiah traded thinly and only in the accounts of offshore banks.
Indonesia's economic importance to the United States is small compared with that of Japan or South Korea, but some American companies have substantial dealings there. Chase Manhattan, which has $2.6 billion worth of loans and other involvements in Indonesia and has taken a leading role in the debt talks, evacuated 10 executives and their families yesterday by private jet.
Indonesia is the world's 11th-largest crude-oil producer, but oil processing is dispersed among thousands of islands and has not been disrupted. The country is the world's second-largest producer of rubber and palm oil, and continued problems are likely to affect tire makers and food companies.
Concern about intensifying economic problems in Asia contributed to a decline in share prices in the United States yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped eight-tenths of a percent, to 9,096.00.
Whether the turmoil in Indonesia will further damage investor confidence in the fragile economies of Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia is not clear. But analysts' predictions two months ago that the region had started recovering have been undermined by recent events.
Not only has the situation in Indonesia deteriorated, but India, by conducting five nuclear tests, has injected additional political and economic uncertainty into Asia's outlook. South Korea's economy has worsened and stock prices have fallen to the lowest level this year. Japan, an important source of stability in Asia, remains stuck in a serious economic downturn of its own.
"I think what we saw late last year was that the financial crisis would translate into greater social unrest and I think we're seeing this now," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former top State Department official. "What has hit more abruptly than I think anyone imagined is that Indonesia has collapsed so severely. And Japan, instead of growing economically and helping East Asia out, is still dangerously stagnant."
Some analysts and economists think that in recent months outsiders, particularly American financiers and politicians, were too quick to believe that Asia had turned a corner in the financial and economic crisis that began last summer.
"It was sort of like the doctor had been called in and we could all rest easy now," said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Thomson Financial Services in Boston. "I think that notion is all wet now, in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. We like to think of ourselves as nonimperialistic now, but we have to ask ourselves how closely we're trying to understand the political and economic realities in these countries."
E. Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman, Sachs managing director and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said it was naive to think these countries could overcome their problems quickly. "This is never going to be a straight line," he said, "and anyone who thinks it will be is missing the point."

HEADLINE: Capitalistic Sideline Drives China's Army

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 15

 BODY:
The Chinese Army, a colossus of three million soldiers, is a sprawling organization that controls or owns parts of a vast array of businesses, from arms dealers to airlines, pharmaceutical makers to vegetable growers.
Of all the military forces in the world, the Chinese Army is by far the most entrepreneurial. Its businesses earn billions of dollars each year, though they are so numerous and disparate -- their role often kept secret -- that no one inside or outside of China can accurately estimate their full scope. 
 Although China's military often looks like a stern-faced monolith, the army's role in moneymaking is clearly not part of any central government plan, experts say. Rather, army officers often take broad advantage of their leading positions in China's political apparatus to build lucrative operations.
"At the end of the day, this is an army that is more interested in making money than it is in being the guardian of the national interest," says Jonathan D. Pollack, a specialist on the Chinese military at the Rand Corporation, the research organization in Santa Monica, Calif.
Liu Chaoying, a lieutenant colonel who has been accused of making contributions through middlemen to the Democratic National Committee in 1996, is a senior executive at one such operation, China Aerospace International Holdings.
China Aerospace, incorporated in Hong Kong and listed on the stock exchange here, develops satellite technology, launches commercial satellites and manufactures a range of mechanical and electronic equipment, including television sets and telephones. It is a subsidiary of the China Aerospace Corporation, a state-owned corporation in Beijing.
Colonel Liu is one of innumerable high-ranking army officers who devote their time to business. Yet she is a member of Beijing's "princeling" elite -- the sons and daughters of China's most powerful leaders -- many of whom are hired by companies in order to trade on their personal connections, which can be critical in conducting business in China.
Colonel Liu is the daughter of Gen. Liu Huaqing, who was one of the top five men in the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, and vice chairman of the all-powerful Central Military Commission until he retired last year.
The upper ranks of the army companies are full of the relatives of senior officials. A son-in-law of the late leader Deng Xiaoping, He Ping, for years headed a major arms company, the China North Industries Group, which sold armored vehicles, infantry weapons, ammunition and radar.
Yet army-controlled businesses are not limited to military-related businesses. They include countless electronics companies, a commercial airline run by the air force, a movie studio that produces feature films, and crews of fruit and vegetable growers.
Military commanders have opened coal mines, karaoke bars and massage parlors. In many parts of China, they dominate real-estate development, building luxury housing complexes, hotels and office towers. In general, there seems to be virtually no area of moneymaking that military forces are kept from.
The pirating of American movies, music and software in China, investigators have often complained, is particularly hard to control because so many of the culprits have been military-owned or controlled companies, which can easily deflect prosecution.
The army's business operations spread so far that it sometimes seems almost humorous. In 1996, Gen. Chen Tianlin, chief of the Guangzhou Military Region's general logistics department, bragged in an army newspaper that every regiment, every brigade and every company under his command, in addition to their military duties, was setting up "production bases" to raise vegetables, fish, pigs and chickens.
General Chen said an artillery brigade sold 10,000 pigs last year for a profit of more than $40,000; and during the first eight months of this year, a military base on Hainan Island made $36,000 selling chicken feed and eggs from its chicken farm.
Those are small amounts of money, compared with arms sales, for example. But General Chen's comments underscored how widespread and entrenched business operations are in the military.
Aware that moneymaking has thoroughly infiltrated the army, the Communist Party's leaders have made feeble attempts to limit it, at one point ordering that military units below the group army level should keep out of business. But it is difficult to enforce.
It is even more difficult to gauge exactly how much its preoccupation with business undercuts the Chinese military's ability as a fighting force. International experts point to many glaring weaknesses in China's military readiness. With few exceptions, experts say, China's armed forces are poorly equipped and trained, and would be easily defeated in any encounter with modern forces outside the mainland.
Yet without an immediate threat to their borders, China's military leaders seem content to keep the troops focused on what is clearly the more pressing concern: how to keep making more money.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN PAKISTAN;
No Decision On Testing, U.S. Is Told

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 15

 BODY:
Pakistani leaders told a high-level American delegation today that they had not yet decided whether to test nuclear weapons, as India did this week, and suggested that they might still be dissuaded.
The delegation, which was led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Gen. Anthony Zinni, the chief Pentagon officer responsible for South Asia, met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and other officials. Mr. Talbott is to fly to Birmingham, England, on Saturday to brief President Clinton, who is attending a summit meeting there. At that meeting, the leaders issued a statement condemning India's nuclear tests, but did not go beyond that. 
 As the delegation was beginning its meetings here, Mr. Clinton said in Birmingham that he hoped to find a formula within which Pakistani leaders "will find it possible, politically possible, not to proceed" with nuclear tests. He said such a decision would be "an act of great statesmanship on their part."
Soon afterward, Prime Minister Sharif told reporters in Islamabad: "We are in no haste to test the bomb after India tested the bomb. I think we are a responsible nation."
American officials said after their meetings here that Pakistani leaders were facing the fateful decision with "a sense of anguish."
"We have not heard anything that says that the Pakistani leadership has rushed to a conclusion, not to mention a conclusion we would regret, with respect to what its next steps will be," an official said. "They want to see a continuing improvement in U.S.-Pakistani relations in a number of areas, but there was absolutely no sense in our conversations today of a wish list on their side in exchange for which they would not test."
"One of the concerns they have is that this will be just a temporary issue and that it will soon be back to business as usual with India," the official said. "They want the United States and the international community to take what they see as the Indian threat as seriously as they do."
In Washington, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said: "We're very aware of the political pressure that exists in Pakistan. But we hope that as a result of this mission, that the Government there analyzes the situation and concludes that not going forward with the testing program will redound to the advantage of Pakistan and testing will not."
Although Pakistani leaders did not say precisely what gestures would persuade them to decide against testing, American officials said the Pakistanis hoped for a lifting of American restrictions on military aid as well as diplomatic support in their disputes with India over Kashmir state and other issues.
An editorial today in The Nation, an Islamabad newspaper with Government connections, suggested that foreign powers should offer a write-off or reduction of Pakistan's debt obligations, a pledge of greater economic support and what they called "cast-iron nuclear-umbrella guarantees against the Indian threat," a demand that remained vague.
R. James Woolsey Jr., a former Director of Central Intelligence, told a Senate hearing this week that the campaign to persuade Pakistan not to test "is considerably less likely to succeed than not, but it's worth a good college try." Diplomats and political experts agreed that it will be difficult for Pakistan to refrain from conducting nuclear tests in the near future.
Zafar Iqbal Cheema, the influential chairman of the department of defense and strategic studies at Quaid-e-Azim University in Islamabad, said: "The Government must immediately work out a plan for a credible response, which should include testing a fission nuclear device, a thermonuclear device and a sub-kiloton test. If Pakistan prolongs its response, this would create suspicion about its nuclear capability."
At a meeting of the Pakistani Cabinet on Thursday, sentiment was reportedly in favor of a quick test. Pakistani newspapers said, however, that the Minister of Finance, Sartaj Aziz, had warned about the devastating effect of international sanctions that would certainly follow a test, and urged, "Let's wait and see."
Some Pakistani business leaders are also lobbying against a quick nuclear test, warning that resulting sanctions could devastate the economy. This week Pakistan presented international donors with a list of development projects it would like to finance in the coming year, at a cost of $1.69 billion. Nearly all of them would have to be scrapped if Pakistan were punished with sanctions like those imposed on India.
Other sanctions might include a possible cutoff of World Bank aid, which totaled $858 million in the last fiscal year, and aid from Japan, which was $550 million last year.

HEADLINE: Sold China 'Spirit Tree' May Have Been Stolen

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 15

 BODY:
Chinese officials charged with protecting relics are investigating the possibility that a spectacular ancient bronze candelabra recently sold in New York for a reported $2.5 million may have been illegally unearthed last year in south-central China and smuggled out of the country.
Last fall stories began circulating among Chinese archeologists and officials that a rare bronze funerary candelabra, known as a spirit tree, had been secretly unearthed from a tomb along the Yangtze River, in the region to be inundated by the Three Gorges Dam, and sold to a smuggler. The theft was never verified, although officials acknowledge that looting of artifacts in the dam area and nearby construction sites is a problem. 
 In late March a spirit tree, four feet high with dozens of branches and a blue patina, was offered for sale at the International Asian Art Fair, held at the Seventh Regiment Armory in New York City. It was sold to Leon D. Black, a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, for at least $2.5 million. Mr. Black is the founder and president of Apollo Advisers, a New York investment firm that owns stakes in many corporations, including Vail Resorts in Colorado; Samsonite, the luggage maker; Converse, the shoe manufacturer, and Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network.
Only two other intact spirit trees have been described in professional literature, according to Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, an art historian at New York University and expert on archeology in the region of the dam, in Sichuan and Hubei Provinces. Like the other examples, it almost certainly originated in the Three Gorges region, she said, and dates from the Eastern Han dynasty, of the first to third centuries A.D.
The possibility that the item sold in New York had recently been smuggled out of China has been publicized by international opponents of the Three Gorges Dam. In a press release on Thursday, the California-based International Rivers Network cited as evidence an Oct. 7, 1997, article in a Chinese newspaper, Southern Weekend.
That article quoted Yao Jiong, head of the Cultural Relics Unit in Fengjie County, Sichuan, as saying that an intact spirit tree had been unearthed and sold on the black market for about $25,000.
But Mr. Yao, in a telephone interview today, said only that he had heard rumors that a spirit tree had been found in neighboring Wushan County and sold illegally. Government regulations, only spottily enforced, forbid export of older and significant artifacts.
Yu Weichao, the Beijing-based director of the Government's program to protect cultural relics in the Three Gorges area, is in the region investigating the charges.
Reached by telephone in the town of Zongxian, Mr. Yu said he had heard stories of a smuggled spirit tree last fall, and, after becoming aware of the sale in New York, decided to pursue the matter with local officials. Until recently Mr. Yu was also director of the National Museum of Chinese History in Beijing.
The sale in New York was arranged by a Belgian art dealer, Giselle Croes. Ms. Croes's office said today that she was traveling and could not be reached.
A spokesman for Mr. Black, Steven Anreder, said today that according to Mr. Black the seller was a reputable Hong Kong dealer and that the item came with all the proper papers. No one has suggested that Mr. Black did anything illegal or improper in buying the object in New York.
Mr. Black came into public view in the 1980's as co-head of corporate finance at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct Wall Street firm that was dominated by Michael R. Milken, the junk-bond king. Now, besides his investment activities, Mr. Black is a well-known collector of Chinese bronzes and works by such 19th- and 20th-century European masters as Picasso, Cezanne, Degas and Bonnard. He also sits on the board of the Jewish Museum and the Mount Sinai Hospital, and recently endowed a Shakespeare Studies chair at Dartmouth College, his alma mater.
His firm is said to be considering bids for Polygram, the record company, and Simon & Schuster.
The narrow canyons above the Three Gorges Dam are sprinkled with subsurface and standing tombs, temples and other historical sites. Chinese historians have openly lamented the shortage of money and time to assess what will be lost when the dam is closed and waters start rising five years from now. They warn that a crucial, little-studied aspect of early Chinese history as well as the entire record of at least one ancient culture will be lost forever.
Another problem has emerged just above the future water line, where bulldozers are erecting new towns for the displaced populations and have little time for "salvage archeology." What the machines do not destroy is taken by local people for sale to antique dealers.
Since the dam construction began in 1992, according to an article last January in the Three Gorges Public Security Newspaper, "antique traders converged on Wushan from different parts of the country and from Southeast Asia," and local looters shifted from trailing bulldozers to actively prospecting for artifacts. In May 1997 the police in Wushan County formed a special task force to deal with looting and smuggling, some by organized gangs.
Reached by telephone today, Luo Zhihong, Director of Cultural Relics for Wushan County, said that because of the lack of resources, "a lot of relics have been sold to private dealers." He said his entire 1997 budget for protection was only about $3,600, while he had to offer that amount to entice local farmers to turn in even a single valuable relic they found.

HEADLINE: Hoboken to Hollywood and Beyond, Mourning the Man and His Magic

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
From Hollywood to the back streets of Hoboken, from seats of power in Europe and America to gritty barrooms where the old romantic ballads still intoxicate the soul, they mourned Frank Sinatra yesterday, not only as one of a century's most influential singers but as someone who had touched them intimately with a voice, a mood, a poignant memory.
There was an avalanche of remembrance and tribute to go with the sorrow. It came from presidents, prime ministers, fellow entertainers, personal friends and countless ordinary people who recalled the Sinatra magic: crooning at the Dorsey microphone or the Paramount for swooning bobby-soxers, drinking alone in the wee small hours, going down under Fatso's blows in a cell in Honolulu. 
 "The world has now lost one of the most precious commodities," the actor Ernest Borgnine, whose Sergeant Fatso Judson battered Sinatra's Oscar-winning Maggio to death in the 1953 film "From Here to Eternity," said of his old friend. "It's pretty hard because, you know, we loved each other. The world has lost a hell of a man."
Across the nation and halfway around the world, word that the 82-year-old vocalist had died of a heart attack on Thursday night in Los Angeles prompted an outpouring of headlines, news broadcasts, musical tributes and countless personal expressions of grief and admiration for the man and his music.
Fans placed flowers and lighted candles on his three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Purple bunting was draped from City Hall in Sinatra's New Jersey hometown, Hoboken. New York's tabloid newspapers issued rare extra editions. A flood of specials were broadcast on television. Radio stations everywhere devoted hours to the Sinatra repertory. And a black-bordered Web page appeared in cyberspace.
In Birmingham, England, where he was attending an economic summit meeting, President Clinton described himself as an "enormous admirer" of Sinatra's and said, "I think every American would have to smile and say he really did do it his way."
The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, also attending the meeting, called Sinatra "one of the greatest performers of this century," and added, "People like me of a younger generation have grown up with him, and he will be deeply missed."
In Paris, the President Jacques Chirac, said that millions around the world were saddened by Sinatra's death. "There was certainly his talent, his charisma and his voice -- which set the rhythm for, accompanied and made our whole era dream -- but there was also his warm and enthusiastic personality," he said.
The director Martin Scorsese, attending the Cannes Film Festival, said: "He was an idol of mine and millions. A great Italian-American, a great American, and a great actor, by the way, a great, great actor." The actress Jeanne Moreau, also at Cannes, said Sinatra would "sing with the angels."
In Italy, where Sinatra's parents were born, television stations flashed bulletins across the screens, the state RAI broadcasting network showed Sinatra specials and led news programs with announcements of his death. Paparazzi, with whom Sinatra had endless feuds, recalled him as a glamorous, temperamental figure on the glitzy Via Veneto during the era of La Dolce Vita.
In Lumarzo, a town near Genoa where Sinatra's mother, Natalie Garavente, was born, Mayor Silvio Lercari spoke of "the pain of thousands," and said: "This is a sad day. We've lost a person who is famous the world over." Sinatra's father, Antonio, was a fireman and amateur boxer from Sicily.
In Hoboken, where Sinatra was born in 1915, his presence seemed to be everywhere yesterday, although he had shunned the town for more than a decade because some residents had spoken to the writer Kitty Kelley for her 1986 unauthorized biography of Sinatra, "His Way."
Besides Sinatra street signs, Sinatra plaques and a Sinatra museum, there were bouquets yesterday at the rubble that had been the Sinatra birthplace. Nearby, vendors offered Sinatra T-shirts. But Piccolo's Clam Bar, which usually plays nothing but Sinatra records, was silent. "The Voice is silent, so there won't be any music today," said Pat Spaccavento, the owner.
Across the Hudson in New York, where television and radio stations aired the news and music of Sinatra, one announcer spoke of "Heartbreak in Hoboken," and a forecaster, gloating over a sundrenched day, said: "Skies are clear, except for the small black cloud over Hoboken."
Nonchalant New Yorkers, who ordinarily regard visits from Presidents and potentates as little more than traffic obstacles, were overheard on streets and in elevators and offices talking about Sinatra. The town learned of his death in big tabloid headlines and radio and televison news programs laced with Sinatra music.
"Extra! Extra!" The New York Post blared in red, and hit the streets with an early-morning edition -- its first since the O. J. Simpson verdict in 1995 -- with the news: "Death of a Legend." The Daily News announced "Sinatra Dead" on Page One, and mustered a 24-page Sinatra supplement in its first extra edition since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
Institutions as well as people expressed a sense of loss. The Friars Club mourned its "beloved Abbot Emeritus Frank Sinatra," and compared him to Jack Benny, George Burns, Enrico Caruso and George M. Cohan. Other tributes, reflecting Sinatra's wide philanthropy, came from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Carnegie Hall and the American Friends of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
Gore Vidal, the writer, offered a social commentary on Sinatra and America: "I would say that half the population of the United States over the age of 40 was conceived while their parents were listening to his records. He played a great romantic role in the country. Most singers are pretty bland, mellifluous. Bing Crosby put you to sleep. Sinatra got the blood flowing."
Some, as might be expected, perceived in Sinatra's death a renewal of the commercial engine he had fired for decades: record companies and retailers foresaw a bonanza in album sales, as did publishers of books on Sinatra and those in possession of Sinatra memorabilia: autographs, photographs, concert and movie posters.
At the other end of the spectrum, many of the most touching tributes came from entertainers who had been close to Sinatra. Mel Torme, the jazz singer, spoke of the "ultimate balladeer," and what he called an "everyman, a singer whose style touched a chord in the broadest part of the American psyche."
Vic Damone said: "He was my role model, my mentor, and most importantly, my friend. There will never be another Francis Albert Sinatra. Nobody will ever come close."
The singer Eydie Gorme and her husband and singing partner Steve Lawrence, longtime friends of Sinatra, went to his Bel Air mansion to pay their respects to his family. Afterward, Ms. Gorme called it "the saddest day of my life."
Outside the Sinatra home, many fans gathered, including Brian McCray, 22, who was clad in black and held a candle. "He's my favorite," Mr. McCray said. "I've listened to him since I was 6 years old. I have every Frank Sinatra CD. I used to hide them so my friends wouldn't know, but now everyone in my generation seems to like Frank. I just had to come here."
Mia Farrow, who was Sinatra's third wife, said: "Frank was the first love of my life, and he remained a true friend, always there when I needed him. I will miss him more than words can say."
The comedian Steve Allen spoke of "a day when American lyrics were coherent and civilized and clever, and when there was a glorious melody characterizing most of our popular songs." "He was the No. 1 salesman," he added.
At the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, where Sinatra wintered in the 1950's and 60's, Floyd McSwaine, a bellhop, remembered them all: Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop and Sinatra. "When he walked in the lobby, people would stand up and say, 'Hey, Frank,' " he said. "They were crazy about him. He could have been the President of the United States."

HEADLINE: Russia Resists I.M.F.'s Strategy for Reducing Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 15

 BODY:
Russia is at odds with the International Monetary Fund over the politically charged question of how to reduce the nation's huge budget deficit.
The dispute has emerged as a major challenge for Russia's new Prime Minister and comes at a sensitive time for the Russian economy. 
 On one side of the debate is the Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, who has embraced the same strategy Washington has used to attack its deficit: slash billions of dollars in spending without raising taxes.
I.M.F. officials, however, are skeptical about the Government's ability to make such deep cuts. Instead, they are urging Mr. Kiriyenko and his team to draft a politically unpalatable series of tax increases.
The debate has cast a shadow over the I.M.F.'s next infusion of money in its three-year, $10 billion Russian loan program. So far, the fund has disbursed $5.2 billion.
But the next $700 million installment has been delayed by the wrangling. An I.M.F. team is scheduled to renew negotiations here on Monday and top fund officials are expected to come to Moscow for talks summer.
Nervous foreign investors are anxiously following the deliberations. The Russian stock market has slumped in recent days because of a general concern over the strength of the nation's economy. The central bank's reserves for defending the ruble also have been shrinking.
The dispute not only underscores the monumental budgetary pressures confronting President Boris Yeltsin's new Government but also raises searching questions about the strategy of the I.M.F., which is already being scrutinized for its handling of the economic crisis in Asia.
Critics here say Russian taxes are already very high and there is no chance that the Communist-dominated Parliament would raise them. Also, Mr. Kiriyenko's position would be weakened if he proposed tax increases just as his new, pro-reform Government is trying to overhaul the nation's archaic tax system and get down to work.
Yegor T. Gaidar, a pro-capitalism reformer and former Prime Minister, said the I.M.F.'s position "is politically unrealistic and economically not very sensible."
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary of the United States, indicated on Thursday that Washington had some sympathy for the Russian position, though he was careful not to publicly criticize the I.M.F.
"The current economic team is more cohesive and more united in its commitment to economic reform than any government Russia has had in the last five years," Mr. Summers said after meeting with Russian officials here. "I think there is large scope for expenditure reduction."
The I.M.F. and Russia have long had a rocky relationship. Economists say that the I.M.F. has helped Russia control its money supply and reduce inflation. But the fund has sometimes been wrong, as when it sought unsuccessfully to make the ruble a common currency for the former Soviet republics.
One critical matter on which the two sides agree is the need to reduce Russia's budget deficit. Finance Ministry officials estimate this year's deficit will be around 150 billion rubles (about $25 billion), or around 5 percent of Russia's gross domestic product.
Financing such a deficit has required Russia to issue high-yield treasury bonds and take out loans. The result is that about a third of the Government's spending is devoted to interest payments.
"If we cannot solve the problem of Government debt servicing within the next two to three years, it will be a major blow to the defense capabilities and economic security of the country," Mr. Kiriyenko told his Cabinet earlier this month.
Where the I.M.F. and the Yeltsin Government disagree is over how to attack the deficit. The I.M.F. wants a stronger crackdown on tax delinquents, in addition to budget cuts. The Russian Government puts more emphasis on spending reductions.
The fund says Russia should raise 315 billion rubles (about $52 billion) in tax revenue in 1998. But the Finance Ministry says Russia can expect to raise only about 290 billion rubles (about $48 billion). Those figures do not include money raised through non-tax sources, including the sale of gold and state property.
The difference between the two revenue targets is significant because it comes on top of other serious budgetary problems. Even if Russia met its revenue target, it still would have to cut Government programs.
In insisting on additional cuts, the Russian Finance Ministry is saying there are still enormous inefficiencies in the budget. The 1998 budget passed by Parliament this year is 493 billion rubles (about $82 billion). The Finance Ministry would like to reduce it to 432 billion rubles (about $72 billion).
To accomplish that, the Russians are considering laying off 200,000 Government workers, closing underutilized universities and cutting subsidies.
"We should have the right to decide what course we need," Oleg V. Vyugin, the Deputy Finance Minister, said in an interview. "It should not be the job of the I.M.F."
I.M.F. officials, however, doubt that the solution can be found in spending cuts alone. One big risk in relying on cuts, they maintain, is that Government agencies will agree to go along with the budget reductions but will avoid tough decisions, and instead delay payments to workers or let bills go unpaid rather than lay off employees or take other harsh measures. Wage arrears and postponed payments have been a chronic problem in the Russian economy.
The I.M.F has told Russian officials in confidential negotiations that it is wiser to make less severe spending cuts, allowing for a budget of about 467 billion rubles (about $78 billion), according to Russian participants in the negotiations.
The fund has argued that the Russians should draft an emergency package of tax increases to make up the difference if tougher tax collection does not raise additional revenue. Specifically, the I.M.F. says, the Russians should be prepared to increase the value-added tax, excise taxes on gasoline, and import tariffs.
But Mr. Gaidar said that increases in the value-added tax and excise taxes cannot be put into effect without the approval of the Parliament, or Duma, and would embroil Mr. Mr. Kiriyenko in a debilitating and ultimately unsuccessful legislative battle. One casualty, Russian officials say, would be tax reform, which the Government wants desperately to push through the legislature.
"Of course, there should be improvements in tax administration and tax collection," Mr. Gaidar said. "But there is substantial evidence that tax increases will not be supported by the Duma and cannot be implemented. Import tariffs are the only thing that can be changed without the support of the Duma."
Rory MacFarquhar, an economist with the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy, says that the problem is not that Russia as a whole does not collect enough taxes. The problem, he says, is that regional governments get more than their fair share.
Some Western bankers say that the Russians should be given leeway in dealing with the budget crunch, as long as Moscow and the I.M.F. agree on the overall goals.
"What is important now is that the Russians get serious about their fiscal problems," said Charles Blitzer, the director of emerging markets research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The new Government is younger and more vigorous and committed to reform. It should decide what is the feasible way to meet the deficit target."

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE AMERICANS;
Navy Ships Put on Alert for Evacuation

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
More than 10,000 American troops and a flotilla of United States Navy ships now steaming through the South China Sea are ready to help evacuate American citizens from Indonesia if a planned airlift becomes impossible because of the chaos there, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The Defense Department alerted the ships that they might be needed for an evacuation after it became clear there were not enough seats available aboard commercial jets for the thousands of Americans and other foreigners seeking to flee Jakarta, Indonesia's riot-torn capital. 
 On Thursday, the State Department urged the estimated 6,000 Americans living in Indonesia's two largest cities, Jakarta and Surabaya, to leave the country as soon as possible, citing the worst political violence in Indonesia in decades.
Administration officials said they hoped that most Americans leaving Indonesia could be accommodated aboard two Boeing 747 jumbo jets flying from Jakarta to Singapore and Thailand beginning Saturday.
But they said that the United States was ready to use troops, military helicopters and Navy ships if the turmoil shut down airports in Jakarta.
Three American amphibious ships, helicopters and 10,600 troops are expected to participate early next week in long-scheduled military exercises in nearby Thailand, and the Navy ships were reported today to be en route to Thailand in the South China Sea, near Indonesia.
The Administration continued its calls today for political reform in Indonesia, which has been under the iron rule of President Suharto since the mid-1960's, and defended the International Monetary Fund from criticism that the rigorous package of economic reforms demanded by the fund in recent months had helped spark this week's violence, in which more than 200 people had been killed.
"We do not believe that the I.M.F. program is the source of Indonesia's troubles," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. "We continue to believe that a key component in restoring economic growth in Indonesia will be a vigorous program of economic reform as proposed by the I.M.F."
A spokeswoman for the I.M.F. at its headquarters in Washington would not comment when asked whether the fund intended to go forward with its multibillion-dollar rescue package for Indonesia, in light of this week's violence.
"That's not something I can give you any guidance on right now," said the spokeswoman, who under I.M.F. rules agreed to be interviewed on condition that she not be identified by name. "The I.M.F. is monitoring the developments in Indonesia very closely and clearly hopes that all sides will exercise restraint."
She said that the fund believed that its reform plan for Indonesia remained "very much appropriate for Indonesia's economic situation and for restoring confidence and for bringing about a resumption of economic growth."
Still, if there was confidence at the I.M.F. about Indonesia's future, it was not in evidence today at the fund's office in Jakarta, which was shut after the entire local staff was evacuated out of the country.
The World Bank, which is also participating in the Western-led rescue plan, said it had chartered a plane to evacuate its international staff from Jakarta, although the office director and a handful of senior managers planned to stay in the country.
"We want to insure the safety of everyone who works there and their families," said Graham Barrett, a World Bank spokesman.
Clinton Administration officials said they still planned to send an American military delegation led by Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, to Indonesia to urge military leaders to use restraint in dealing with anti-Government demonstrators.
The mission was canceled at the last minute on Thursday because of concern that the violence in the streets of Jakarta made it impossible to guarantee Admiral Prueher's safety in the city.
"Our diplomats are obviously pressing the Indonesians for restraint," said a White House official. "But in a crisis like this, the generals in Indonesia are more likely to listen to somebody else in uniform."

HEADLINE: UNREST IN INDONESIA: THE DIPLOMACY;
8 World Leaders Urge Suharto to Show Restraint in Handling Indonesian Turmoil

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, May 15

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia called on Indonesia's leader today to show restraint in responding to the country's growing unrest, and said a solution would have to involve political as well as economic changes.
President Clinton said President Suharto should "open a dialogue with all elements of the society" in an attempt to create "a genuine sense of political reform and reconciliation" while continuing to overhaul Indonesia's economy. 
 Mr. Clinton also scrambled tonight to assemble a united front to protest India's nuclear tests. Finding scant support for economic sanctions of the type the United States is imposing, Mr. Clinton won agreement on a toughly worded statement but received only vague promises of concrete action to punish India for escalating its arms race with Pakistan.
At the annual summit meeting of the eight nations, Mr. Clinton also said he was looking for a diplomatic formula that would convince Pakistan not to to move ahead with nuclear tests of its own.
Mr. Clinton suggested that one element of that formula might be the resolution of a long-running dispute in which the United States has blocked delivery to Pakistan of 28 F-16 jet fighters and refused to return the $650 million Pakistan paid for the planes.
Mr. Clinton and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- meeting tonight over dinner with only their interpreters present -- spent considerable time discussing Indonesia. Earlier, Mr. Clinton had called on President Suharto and his military "to avoid violence and exercise maximum restraint," and suggested that the Indonesian leader's best option was to respond to the unrest by moving toward democracy.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Suharto should "open a dialogue with all elements of the society" in an attempt to create "a genuine sense of political reform and reconciliation" while continuing to overhaul Indonesia's economy.
"Giving the people of Indonesia a real voice in the country's political affairs can make a real contribution to restoring political order and stability based on human rights and the rule of law," Mr. Clinton said.
Although the summit's formal agenda is packed with items ranging from combatting international crime to reducing unemployment, it was clear today that the crises in Asia would dominate the proceedings.
Administration officials said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott had finished meeting in Islamabad with Pakistani officials including Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and was heading to Birmingham to report to Mr. Clinton. The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said Mr. Talbott had been told by the Pakistanis that they had not yet made a decision on whether to proceed with their own tests.
"At the same time," Mr. McCurry said, "there weren't any assurances one way or another given to the U.S. delegation."
American officials said that any resolution of the F-16 dispute would be only part of any effort to convince Pakistan not to go ahead with its own testing, which American intelligence reports have suggested Pakistani officials are preparing to do. Any deal on the fighters would likely involve finding another country to buy the planes and then passing the money along to Pakistan.
The Administration has been trying to find a buyer for the planes for years -- a plan at one point to sell them to Indonesia fell apart because of objections in Congress to Mr. Suharto's human rights record -- and Administration officials said today that they had no other potential buyer lined up.
Delivery of the fighters was blocked by President George Bush under a 1990 nonproliferation law after he could not certify that Pakistan was not developing nuclear weapons.
White House officials had to Birmingham resigned to the lack of support among American allies for the kinds of sanctions against India demanded by American law against countries that test nuclear devices. Mr. Clinton has already announced that he will invoke the sanctions, which include cutting off direct foreign aid, withdrawing Government help for trade deals and working to stop loans and other assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
France and Russia had already made clear their opposition to sanctions, raising the possibility that those nations and their industries would win trade deals with India as the United States withdraws. British officials said that they would not invoke sanctions against India because of their historical ties to that nation. Of the eight nations here, only Canada and Japan -- the only nation to have experienced a nuclear attack -- have moved to cut off aid to India.
But American officials said they believed other nations would take steps short of sanctions to make clear to India their displeasure with the nuclear tests.
The decision by the United States not to even make a case for the imposition of formal sanctions may also have reflected the Administration's inability to win international support for sanctions required by American law against energy companies that invest in Iran.
Faced with strong opposition to the sanctions from the European Union, the Administration is expected to announce within a few days that it will waive sanctions under the law against French, Russian and Malaysian energy companies that plan to help build a pipeline in Iran.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Indonesian Meltdown

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
You can learn everything you need to know about Indonesia's problems by catching a blue taxi when you arrive at Jakarta airport and then riding into town to the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The taxi company is owned by one of President Suharto's children, so too are the toll roads that you have to pass through to get from the airport to Jakarta and so too is the Hyatt. Nice roads. Nice tolls. Nice hotel. It's no wonder that Indonesians say about the Suharto family that they are so lucky. They have everything in the world. Except one thing -- a sense of shame.
And it is that lack of shame that finally caught up with them. When Indonesia was booming there was just enough growth and corruption spilling over the top of the glass to keep Indonesia in some kind of balance. But the minute the boom slowed, and the glass became half full, the game couldn't go on. The gap between the haves and the have-nots became too wide. And the only way to refill the glass was with painful economic reform and institution building. And the only way to do that was for President Suharto to say to his people: "Friends, we've got to tighten our belts. We're all in this together." And when he tried that last week, the answer came back in a violent spasm: "Mr. President, we all weren't in the toll roads and taxi companies together." 
 The recent U.S. approach to Indonesia was based on a false premise: that our only choices were either supporting Indonesia economically, even though this might be exploited by Mr. Suharto to prolong his 32-year reign, or letting the country slide into chaos by withholding I.M.F. assistance. The U.S. thought that demanding political change was not an option.
Wrong. There will be no stability in Indonesia -- economic or otherwise -- without fundamental political change. The only question now is whether political change in Indonesia is directed by Mr. Suharto as his last act or simply explodes from below. If the U.S. wants to use economic aid through the I.M.F. as an incentive for President Suharto to immediately begin the political transition, that's fine. Because, unfortunately, Mr. Suharto has so decimated every other institution and potential political actor in the country that there is a vacuum under him. But the U.S. message to him has to be blunt: "Convene an assembly to re-write Indonesia's 1945 Constitution, establish a real parliament with real opposition parties, not the rubber stamp Indonesia has now -- and then be gone."
But if Mr. Suharto will not direct this political transition now, or if it's too late, then the U.S. has to completely disengage from him, because he's toast. Indonesia, Thailand and Korea were like 50-watt bulbs in the 250-watt socket of the global market. When the power surge came from that market last fall, these three bulbs blew up. But Thailand and Korea, precisely because they were democracies, were able to begin adjusting by voting in new surge protectors and software. That is, more democratic leaders and the beginnings of institutional reform -- with popular support. Indonesia, because it is a corrupt autocracy, couldn't just vote in new software and new institutions, and that's why it's melting down.
There was a time when we thought we had to tolerate the Suhartos as a bulwark against Communism, which was the strategic issue. No more. The relevant issue today is how your country relates to the opportunities and challenges of the global market -- whether you are building law-based institutions that enable you to get the most out of that global market and the institutional software to modulate its ups and downs. Therefore it is a prime interest of U.S. foreign policy to help countries face up to this challenge -- to help them become open enough and internally strong enough to both tap the global marketplace and protect themselves from it.
The big split in the world today is no longer between centrally planned Communist regimes and free-market democracies. Rather, it's between free-market kleptocracies (Mafia regimes) and free-market democracies. Those building the institutional software, and those who aren't. U.S. foreign policy should be devoted to helping the free-market democrats and stifling the free-market kleptocrats. The Suhartos are kleptocrats. As long as they remain, Indonesia will be unstable, because the Suhartos are a bulwark against the very reforms needed for Indonesia to thrive in this new era.

HEADLINE: Jerry Brown, in New Incarnation, Brings Celebrity to Oakland Race

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., May 15

 BODY:
Over the course of his unconventional adventures, Jerry Brown has popped up in many places, wearing many faces: India, where he ministered to the wretched with Mother Teresa; Japan, where he sought Zen enlightenment; Sacramento, where he spurned the Governor's mansion for a private apartment with a mattress on the floor.
But of all of Mr. Brown's incarnations, there is perhaps none more unexpected, if such a word can even apply to him, than the current one. 
 Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former two-term Governor of California and three-time Presidential candidate, is not only running for mayor of this troubled, unglamorous city, the seventh most populous in the state. He is, by all estimations, winning, although he is the only white candidate among 11 men and women vying for leadership of a place long perceived as an African-American stronghold, cradle to both the Black Panthers and ebonics.
With less than three weeks until an open primary on June 2, there are political analysts and a few of Mr. Brown's opponents who say that he stands a chance of getting more than 50 percent of the vote, eliminating the necessity of a runoff in November between the top two finishers.
The explanations they offer are varied and include the complicated demographics of Oakland, where no one racial group actually represents a majority, and Oaklanders' tradition of ignoring racial lines at the polls.
But more than anything else, they say, Mr. Brown's strong showing speaks to Oakland's fierce desire for national stature and the envy with which its residents have always gazed at San Francisco, the busier, taller, richer city just across the bay.
State Assemblyman Don Perata, whose district includes about two-thirds of Oakland, noted that San Franciscans have a celebrity mayor of sorts in Willie L. Brown Jr. and said that Oaklanders want one too.
"Willie Brown has bestowed upon San Francisco a certain fame that San Franciscans feel they deserve," Mr. Perata said. "I believe that people think this is what Oakland has in store for itself with Jerry Brown. If Don Perata was mayor of Oakland, I wouldn't be on 'Larry King.' Jerry Brown will. That cuts across every strata in every neighborhood."
Mary King, a member of the Board of Supervisors for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, said its residents are just plain flattered by Mr. Brown's courtship, an appraisal borne out by dozens of interviews with Oaklanders.
"Oakland has a longstanding sense of itself that's a kind of inferiority complex," said Ms. King, who is running against Mr. Brown. "And it's like the prince finally showed up and asked for a dance."
It is less clear to Mr. Brown's opponents and some voters why he wants to tango, although he has always been given to quixotic, offbeat gestures, one of which earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam: when he held the state's highest office from 1975 to 1983, he proposed that California launch its own space satellite.
Mr. Brown said that six years after his last failed bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination, he felt the need to "get back into the action." He has spent the last several years running his grass-roots nonprofit organization, We the People, and being the host of a radio talk show. Two years ago, he defected from the Democratic Party, which he said had become too much of a fund-raising machine, and subsequently declared himself nonpartisan.
He said that while national and state politics had been corrupted by money and influence peddling, a city the size of Oakland, which has about 388,000 residents, would afford him a chance to have a more direct connection to voters and a more tangible effect on their lives.
"This is a place that's small enough that I can make a real impact, yet it's large enough that it's significant," Mr. Brown said in an interview on Monday at the three-story tin-shelled loft across from the Amtrak station in Oakland that serves as his campaign headquarters, his home and a community center of sorts.
He lives here with about 10 volunteers and friends who take their meals at two long picnic benches next to a communal kitchen. Some are newcomers to his pro-environment, power-to-the-people gospel; a few, like Jacques Barzaghi, the French mystic who has been Mr. Brown's longtime adviser, are holdovers from the past.
There is an herb and vegetable garden on the roof; tai chi and yoga classes are held in the auditorium, and the wheelchair-accessible ramps that twist up the structure's hollow center give it the look of an ersatz miniature of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.
Mr. Brown, 60, sold his house in the tony Pacific Heights section of San Francisco and moved into this building in 1995. He said that he could not recall if he had the mayoralty in mind but that he had chosen Oakland for its frustrated but formidable potential.
"I could make a mark in Oakland in a way that's impossible in San Francisco," Mr. Brown said as he ate his lunch, a vegetable stew complemented by a misshapen hunk of bread.
Oakland has long been synonymous in California with crime and urban blight, and residents complain bitterly about its failing schools, its unattractiveness to businesses and the flight of retail establishments from its downtown, where the most upscale department store left is Sears.
But Oakland's unemployment rate of 6 percent is no higher than the state's, and its population, which declined between 1970 and 1980, has grown by nearly 50,000 people since then. The city has expansive pockets of affluence and, despite its history as a hotbed of black nationalism, is extraordinarily integrated. Blacks represent about 43 percent of the population, while non-Hispanic whites represent slightly more than 25 percent, and Asian-Americans and Hispanic people about 15 percent each.
Political analysts and city leaders said that the presence of eight black candidates in the mayoral primary, which throws candidates from all parties together, promised to disperse the black vote, but they also pointed out that Oaklanders have frequently voted in a strikingly race-blind fashion.
Although blacks outnumber whites, the nine-member city council, which includes the current mayor, Elihu Harris, an African-American who is not running for re-election, has one Hispanic, one Asian-American, four white and three black members.
None of Mr. Brown's opponents has a particularly high profile, and two of his best-known opponents, Ms. King and a City Council member, Ignacio De La Fuente, carry heavy political baggage.
They approved a much-touted deal to bring the Oakland Raiders football team back from Los Angeles, which ended up costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. Many Oakland residents expressed fury at this turn of events, which they described as one more dashed hope and broken promise in a city weary of both.
Although there have been no published polls since mid-March, that survey, commissioned by The San Francisco Chronicle, showed Mr. Brown with 38 percent of the vote and his nearest challenger, Mr. De La Fuente, with 5 percent. More than 40 percent of voters were undecided.
Although the poll did not break down the results by race, analysts and candidates said that Mr. Brown seems to be getting significant black support, as he has in past campaigns. This is a reflection in part of his record. As Governor, 49.8 percent of his executive appointments went to women and minorities.
One of Mr. Brown's more visible campaign aides is David Hilliard, who was prominent in the Black Panthers, and signs promoting Mr. Brown's candidacy appear in many corners of the city, which Mr. Brown strides through in his trademark casual dress -- no necktie, collarless shirts sometimes unbuttoned at the top.
But Mr. Brown readily acknowledged that of the $250,000 he has raised in campaign donations, at least 60 percent has come from outside the city.
After Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in November, he drew fire from the press and opponents for his expressed vision of Oakland as what he called an ecopolis, or a haven for environmentally friendly businesses, modeled after an Italian hill city. Perugia, he said, came to mind.
He subsequently began putting more emphasis on nuts-and-bolts issues like crime and education. In truth, the Oakland mayor has limited power, functioning as a figurehead and as president of the City Council. The day-to-day administration of city affairs is left to the city manager, who is hired by the City Council.
Many Oaklanders cited that as another reason to vote for Mr. Brown, saying that his celebrity would enable him to stand taller than anyone else could in what is essentially a bully pulpit.
Some voters also said that Mr. Brown could trade on his prominence and connections to lure Federal and state dollars and private investment to Oakland. Mr. Brown encourages this viewpoint.
"I know people all over America," Mr. Brown said. "I've raised money. I raised money for Al Gore for the Senate. I introduced him to Linda Ronstadt," the pop singer, whom Mr. Brown dated when he was Governor.
"You have to have a mayor who can be heard," Mr. Brown added. "There's a lot of clutter out there. There's a lot of noise. You have Texas and you have L.A. and San Francisco and Chicago. There's a lot of competition for attention."
The logic that Mr. Brown would be good for business contradicts his reputation as a politician not particularly friendly to corporations. But Joseph Debro, an Oakland contractor who worked in the Brown administration, said it made sense, even though Mr. Debro indicated he would not vote for Mr. Brown, whose professed interest in Oakland he distrusts as self-promoting.
"Oakland has not advanced because it is perceived as being a black town," said Mr. Debro, who is black. "Unfortunately, it's a racist country. I think the perception is that Jerry Brown will open a window to Oakland that people otherwise wouldn't look through. Business will probably come because if there's a white mayor, it must be an O.K. thing."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
SUHARTO REVERSES HIKE IN FUEL PRICE DEMANDED BY I.M.F.

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Saturday, May 16

 BODY:
Bowing to his countrymen's anger and a death toll from rioting that has grown into the hundreds, President Suharto has rolled back fuel-price increases he imposed only days ago at the insistence of the International Monetary Fund.
Returning hurriedly on Friday from a trip to Cairo, the President conferred with his advisers and top generals about his nation's turmoil as calls for his removal grew on the streets and from public figures here in the world's fourth-most-populous nation. 
 Today, as tanks guarded the suddenly quiet streets of the capital and the Presidential Palace, wisps of smoke continued to rise from four department stores in which more than 200 looters died when other rioters set the stores on fire. In the chaos of the rioting, the arsonists may not have realized how big the fire would become, or that it would be so deadly. Officials said they expected the death toll from the rioting to rise.
Young men still roamed the streets today, breaking into shops and homes. Some attacked firefighters who tried to douse the flames of burning buildings. More rioting was reported in the cities of Jogjakarta, Solo and Ugung Pandang.
The outbreak of anger caused by rising prices, unemployment and economic hardship in this nation of 210 million people threw into question the I.M.F. austerity package to which Mr. Suharto, 76, reluctantly agreed in return for a $40 billion economic rescue package.
His imposition on May 4 of increases of up to 70 percent in the prices of fuel and electricity, which came at the height of student protests, and his about-face under the pressure of social unrest, also raised questions about Mr. Suharto's sensitivity to the public mood and his grip on fast-unfolding events here.
As thousands of troop reinforcements took up positions around the city, military leaders warned again on Friday that strong action would be taken against looters and rioters.
This week's violence is the worst since the mass killings of 32 years ago, when Mr. Suharto took power from the country's founding President, Sukarno. At that time as many as half a million people died in an anti-Communist purge.
With the public now watching to see how the military will react to the crisis, Lieut. Gen. Prabowo, the President's son-in-law, went out of his way to assert that there are no splits within the armed forces.
Ethnic Chinese citizens, more than a dozen of whom were burned to death when their shops and homes were attacked in recent days, took refuge in hotels or gathered at the airport seeking to flee the country.
Foreigners also thronged to the airports, after the American Embassy issued a directive that United States citizens should leave the country. The embassy said it would provide two chartered aircraft today to evacuate people who could not find seats on commercial flights. But some Americans said they feared to leave their homes.
Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, France and the Netherlands were also preparing to evacuate their citizens.
President Clinton, speaking at an economic summit meeting in Birmingham, England, said the political future of Indonesia is for the people here to decide. "What we do believe is important is that the present Government open a dialogue with all elements of society and that it lead to genuine political reform," he said.
In Indonesia, political reform has increasingly come to have only one meaning for the people in the streets: a change in leadership.
With the military clamping down and the city's rioting seeming to pause, "the real action is about to begin," said Sabam Siagian, a political analyst. "I think this movement is unstoppable. It is not only the students now."
In one sign of the spreading opposition, a group of senior officers from Mr. Suharto's own revolutionary generation issued a statement today calling on the President to resign.
The statement proclaims support for the demands of student demonstrators "to carry out the reformation in the political, economic and legal fields."
As for the President, Mr. Sabam said: "I think Suharto is sitting back and assessing the situation. He has tried to buy time by reducing the fuel prices, but it won't work. We don't know what he will do next.
"It is like a Javanese puppet show," he added. "It's a slow buildup, and the climax comes in the early morning. You and I will still be sleeping, and when we wake up, we will be told the good guy won."
Meanwhile, the country's ailing economy has come to a standstill. Most banks and shopping malls were closed on Friday, many with their windows shattered. Smashed masonry and rocks hurled by rioters were scattered across some streets.
Many homes and shops flew the red and white Indonesian flag at half-staff in mourning for those killed. Black banners were hung on walls near the University of Indonesia bearing slogans like: "Is there still any law, justice or truth in this republic?"
The police said 800 looters and rioters in Jakarta had been arrested. In one instance, witnesses said, the police humiliated looters by forcing them to take off their clothes.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI PLANS CUT OF 1,000 WORKERS WHO AID HOMELESS

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration plans to cut as many as 1,000 positions from the Department of Homeless Services -- roughly half of the agency's total -- as it presses on with efforts to contract out the counseling and shelter that is provided to the city's homeless.
Administration officials said the cuts were a natural reflection of changes at an agency that is handing over more and more responsibilities for the homeless to nonprofit groups. But news of the proposed cuts prompted expressions of outrage from union leaders, who said they did not learn of the vast extent of the cuts until Thursday, during a meeting with officials of the homeless agency that was punctuated by shouts of shock and anger. 
 Most of the jobs at stake are the all-purpose positions well known to homeless shelters, filled by people who serve the food, clean the dishes and wash the laundry. But many of the affected workers are also those who counsel and nurse the homeless, including the families living at so-called welfare hotels.
Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, an umbrella organization representing 120,000 city workers, said yesterday that the affected employees are the "guts of the agency," and that he hoped to negotiate with city officials so that no jobs would be lost.
But the proposed cuts come at an awkward time; a recent agreement between Mr. Hill and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to preserve jobs at the city's hospitals seemed on the verge of collapse last night. Page B1.
Charles Ensley, the president of Social Services Employees Union Local 371, was more critical. "This is outrageous behavior to even contemplate layoffs during this kind of surplus," he said, referring to expectations that the city would end the 1998 fiscal year with a surplus of $2 billion. "These are our lowest-paid workers, almost all black and Puerto Rican, and it's incredibly insensitive to even discuss laying them off."
Mr. Ensley also questioned whether the layoffs were part of a larger plan to replace union workers with workfare workers, as the Giuliani administration struggles to find jobs for people who are removed from the city's welfare rolls.
High-ranking members of the Giuliani administration declined to comment yesterday. But Susan Wiviott, an associate commissioner for the homeless services department, said that workfare did not figure in the planned cuts. Rather, she said, the cuts reflected the agency's long-planned transformation.
"We are moving from being an agency that actually runs homeless shelters to an agency that essentially manages nonprofit contracts and oversees how they provide services," Ms. Wiviott said. "Our function has changed and it requires a very different staffing level."
Since the 1980's, the city has been contracting with nonprofit groups to take over shelters and services for the homeless. But the approach gained momentum in 1992 with the endorsement by the New York City Commission on the Homeless. In fact, Ms. Wiviott said, when the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins created the Department of Homeless Services in 1993, it was with the intention that the agency would gradually hand over shelter operations to nonprofit agencies.
In 1994, she said, the city operated 34 shelters. Now it runs 15: 8 shelters for single adults and 7 for families. The agency's goal is to winnow the number of city-run shelters to six.
By doing so, she said, the agency has managed to develop its own template for how to provide shelter around the city. In addition, she said, many shelters are designated for people with particular needs, from substance abuse to mental illness.
Also, proponents of privatization -- and many homeless people themselves -- say the nonprofit groups have made the shelter environment much more tolerable, providing better food and more secure surroundings than what the city's shelters had offered. On any given night, Ms. Wiviott said, the shelters run by both the city and its contractors serve as many as 7,400 single adults and 4,500 families.
George McDonald, the president of the Doe Fund, said that his nonprofit agency operates two shelters, in Harlem and in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, that have various programs designed to help clients reach self-sufficiency.
"It was a crack den when we took over," he said of the Harlem shelter. "Now, it's a beehive of economic activity. People move out of the condition they were in. They get jobs.
"Under the city," he added, "the shelters were crisis warehousing."
Not everyone agrees that privatizing shelters is the best approach. Some advocates say the city is allowing people to stay in the shelters for a longer time, to take advantage of the improved services. As a result, they say, there is less pressure to create permanent housing, the ultimate cure for homelessness.
In addition, the changes come at a cost, particularly to the city employees. In 1994, the agency had 3,000 workers; now it has 2,170. In addition, homeless advocates have complained that the Giuliani administration has cut the agency's budget; the current proposal calls for a $20 million reduction, to about $370 million.
Union officials said they knew the agency planned to make some cuts. But they said they became alarmed by the comments of its Commissioner, Gordon J. Campbell, before the City Council earlier this month about extensive plans to contract out various jobs, including cleaning, food-handling and laundry services.
Those comments prompted Thursday's meeting, during which city officials laid out their plan to cut 1,000 positions over the next year or two. Union officials said the timing of the news was almost as distressing as the news itself: a clause in the contract with Local 371, assuring that jobs would be found elsewhere in city government for these workers, expires at the end of June.
"We are furious," said Faye Moore, vice president of grievances and legal services for Local 371. "This is dangerous work. And to have our members treated as though they're disposable, we find it downright degrading."
The news also alarmed Steven Banks, the coordinating attorney for Legal Aid's homeless rights project, because among those slated to be laid off are the workers who, he said, "are responsible for locating shelter space and providing counseling at the initial point of entry in the shelter system."
"Those are not positions that the city can contract out," he said. "I think the overall plan is to make the process of seeking assistance so miserable that they won't seek it, and eliminating city workers who provide those services at a time when vulnerable adults and children need help more than ever. These families and adults need more help, not less help."
But Ms. Wiviott countered that although city jobs may be at stake, privatization has improved the services provided to the city's homeless. "Everyone will tell you that it's better than it was," she said.

Singapore Airlines Orders Airbus Jets

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
Singapore Airlines agreed yesterday to buy 10 wide-bodied A340-500 aircraft from the European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie for a total of $2.2 billion. The deal consists of five firm orders and five options, with deliveries to begin in 2002. The long-range aircraft, which have four engines and can carry more than 300 passengers, would be used for nonstop flights between Singapore and Los Angeles and San Francisco. The planes will be powered by Rolls-Royce engines. 
 The Singapore flag carrier also said its net income edged up by seven-tenths of a percent, to $1.04 billion (Singapore), or $630 million (United States), in the fiscal year that ended in March. But it warned that its prospects for the current fiscal year were poor because of the Asian financial crisis.

Indonesian Price Rises Are Rescinded After Riots
President Suharto of Indonesia, bowing to popular anger, rolled back fuel price increases that he imposed only days ago at the insistence of the I.M.F. Tanks guarded the newly quiet streets of the capital and the Presidential Palace as the death toll from four days of rioting reached into the hundreds. More than 200 looters died in four department stores when other rioters set the stores on fire. A1 

The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia, meeting in England, urged Mr. Suharto to show restraint in responding to the growing unrest, and said a solution would have to involve political as well as economic changes. A7

G.O.P. Challenges Clinton On Campaign Donations
Congressional Republicans, armed with new evidence that Chinese military intelligence funneled money to the Democrats in 1996, challenged President Clinton to prove that national security had not been threatened. "If the President does not act quickly and decisively, my presumption is that we have a genuine breach of national security for corrupt political purposes," Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said. Even senior Democrats expressed concern. A1
 
Bomb Scanners Underused
The bomb-detection machines that the F.A.A. bought for the airlines at $1 million each are largely unused, a Transportation Department audit found. The aviation agency asserted that that was because the airlines had developed other security methods, although it acknowledged that the machines had an error rate higher than anticipated. A8
 
Labor's New Political Strategy
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which spent $35 million to help Democratic Congressional candidates two years ago, is planning a different -- and, union leaders say, less partisan -- strategy for the fall election campaigns.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN INDIA;
New Delhi Premier Indicates Resolve to Produce Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 15

 BODY:
Only 48 hours after India ended a series of five underground nuclear tests that stunned the world, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee indicated today that India would not hesitate before deploying the nuclear weapons the tests were designed to perfect.
"We do not want to cover our action with a veil of needless ambiguity," Mr. Vajpayee said in an interview with India Today, a news magazine. "India is now a nuclear weapons state. We have the capacity for a big bomb now, for which a necessary command-and-control system is also in place. Ours will never be weapons of aggression." Both the magazine and the Government released transcripts of the interview. 
 Indian nuclear experts said the "big bomb" Mr. Vajpayee mentioned was apparently a reference to the largest explosion, on Monday, of what India described as a "thermo-nuclear device," meaning a weapon with many times the explosive power of the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan in 1945.
Mr. Vajpayee's remarks, which took the form of written responses to questions from India Today, did not indicate that India had already deployed nuclear missiles, or even that deployments were imminent. Rather, he seemed to emphasize that India, having demonstrated the ability to detonate nuclear warheads designed to be mounted on missiles, would not now be persuaded to stop short of producing them when it is ready.
The remarks appeared to close off a crucial avenue for diplomacy that American officials had hoped to explore as they seek to persuade Pakistan, India's arch-rival, not to respond with tests of its own. A delegation sent by President Clinton arrived today in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, and met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and other top officials, who indicated they had not yet decided whether to conduct a test and suggested they might still be dissuaded.
And at a summit meeting in Birmingham, England, Mr. Clinton won agreement on a firm statement criticizing India, but failed to mobilize other nations to take punitive action against New Delhi.
In the interview, Mr. Vajpayee, leader of a Hindu nationalist party that came to power at the head of a 14-party coalition Government only two months ago, was alternately blunt and conciliatory. He said the blasts proved that "we mean business" about becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, and vowed that India would not be "cowed down" by economic sanctions from the United States, Japan and half a dozen other nations. "India has the sanction of her own past glory and future vision to become strong," he said.
The Prime Minister called India's critics, including the United States, "hypocritical," adding: "Some of the countries which have talked of sanctions, or have otherwise criticized our action, have themselves not only conducted far more nuclear tests than we have done, but they have also built huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Many of them are enjoying the shade provided by somebody else's nuclear umbrella."
But the harsh words were accompanied by reassurances regarding India's resolve to be a responsible member of the "nuclear club" it gate-crashed with its tests.
"I would like to assure the people of the world, especially in our part of the world, that there is no cause for worry at all, much less any alarm, on account of India's action," he said. "All that India has done is conduct five nuclear tests. You place this fact in the context of the hundreds of nuclear tests that have been carried out by several countries so far, and it becomes obvious that India's action does not in the least warrant consideration of worst-case scenarios."
American officials had hoped that even if Pakistan did stage a nuclear test, they could still head off an arms race by persuading India and Pakistan to forgo military deployments of nuclear weapons. Mr. Vajpayee's remarks today did not ultimately exclude that option, since his Government or a successor could conceivably change India's policy as the economic sanctions begin to bite.
Another possible avenue of appeal appeared to have been closed off when Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress Party, India's main opposition group, announced that the party supported the tests. In remarks that were reported today, Mrs. Gandhi abandoned the equivocal stand that had been taken by other party officials earlier in the week.
"The nuclear question is a national matter, not a partisan one," she said. "On this, every Indian stands united."
Western weapons experts have estimated that it could take India anywhere from months to several years to deploy nuclear-tipped missiles in any numbers. Starting in 1993, India has test-fired three versions of the Agni missile, designed to become an intermediate-range nuclear missile, able to hit targets up to 1,500 miles away. A shorter-range missile, the Prithvi, with a range of 250 miles, has been more extensively tested, and Indian forces also have artillery capable of firing nuclear-tipped shells at battlefield range.
Together, these weapons would give New Delhi the power to hit targets anywhere in Pakistan and in southern regions of China, the country Mr. Vajpayee identified as India's primary security concern. Shortly before the tests, India's Defense Minister, George Fernandes, described China as India's "potential No. 1 enemy," and said some of China's fast-growing arsenal of nuclear missiles were targeted on India.
Mr. Vajpayee confirmed the role that national pride played in the decision to carry out the tests. His Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, leads a movement that has worked for 70 years to persuade Indians that an assertive Hindu pride is the solution to India's problems. That stance has alarmed India's minority of 120 million Muslims, as well as Pakistan, a Muslim state created out of the partition of British India in 1947.
"India has never considered military might as the ultimate measure of national strength," Mr. Vajpayee said. "It is a necessary component of overall national strength. I would, therefore, say that the greatest meaning of the tests is they have given India shakti, they have given India strength, they have given India self-confidence." Shakti is a Hindi word meaning power, commonly used when referring to Hindu gods.
He noted that Hindu nationalists had been advocating "the cause of India going nuclear" for 40 years, and had done so because of "a stark regional and global reality," meaning that China and other major powers had nuclear weapons stockpiles and showed no sign of abandoning them.
"The world knows the truth about the progress -- or rather, the lack of it -- made by the nuclear powers in the direction of nuclear disarmament," he said. "The world community should appreciate the fact that India, the second most-populous country on earth, waited for five decades before taking this step."
He said his Government, like all Indian governments since the 1950's, preferred a "nuclear-free world," but had concluded that efforts by the United States and other nuclear powers to prevent the transfer of nuclear technology were "singularly ineffective." This was a reference to reports, confirmed by United States intelligence, that China has transferred missile-building and bomb-making technology to Pakistan. As a result, he said, India's tests were "a minimal response necessary" to protect India's security.
Mr. Vajpayee renewed his Government's pledge to "discuss certain provisions" of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that 149 nations, but not India or Pakistan, have signed. But he said the treaty should require nuclear powers to abandon their nuclear weapons programs, a condition certain to be rejected.
On the effect of sanctions, Mr. Vajpayee was dismissive. "Yes, our action has entailed a price," he said. "But we should not worry about it. India has an immense reservoir of resources and inner strength. If we tap this reservoir, this benefit will be a hundred times more than any price that we may have to pay in the short term."

LESSONS LEARNED
 THE HARD WAY
 A Personal Report.
 By Newt Gingrich.
 Illustrated. 229 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $25. 
 At the mere mention of his slippery name, voters laugh. They roll their eyes. Often they shake their heads in disappointment. In random interviews around the country in recent years, I've found that among Republicans and Democrats alike, no politician arouses deeper or more negative passions than Newt Gingrich. Rehabilitating him to the point where he is more liked than loathed would take far more planning, positioning and perseverance than House Republicans managed in cooking up their vaunted "Contract With America" -- the very vehicle Gingrich rode to become Speaker of the House after the 1994 elections.
Whether his intention is to run for President, to fend off members of his own party who are campaigning for his job or to advance a revisionist view of his tenure for historians, "Lessons Learned the Hard Way: A Personal Report" is a first step in Gingrich's effort to remake an image so bruised that Democrats could not resist featuring his mug relentlessly in television commercials during the 1996 campaign.
It may take more than one book to persuade most Americans that the smiling, newly svelte (well, almost) man on the cover is just a humble, dinosaur-loving softy -- not the hostile rebel who savagely stepped over both Democrats and Republicans in his quest to rule the House. This is not your garden-variety politician with an enemy here and a rival there; this is a politician, remember, who had become such an outcast that fellow Republicans came close to toppling him last year.
"Lessons Learned the Hard Way" follows the familiar formula of politicians trying to refashion themselves: Offer a sanitized version of events. Admit some mistakes. Find a compliment or two for your rivals. Sound candid without actually being too candid. And, by all means, do not create new enemies -- or say anything that could haunt you later.
After re-establishing credibility with "Six Crises," Richard Nixon was elected President. More recently, another White House hopeful, former Vice President Dan Quayle, devoted an entire chapter of his comeback book to how he misspelled "potato." And Dick Morris, who was forced to quit as President Clinton's top political adviser, confessed in his book that his relationship with a prostitute came about because he was "out of control, driven by my ego."
While Gingrich's book lacks the self-deprecating humor of Quayle and the juicy (albeit self-aggrandizing) inside details served up by Morris, he deserves some credit: he is not so self-delusional that he cannot admit mistakes. He even manages to compliment the Democrats' political wiles as he revisits his humiliating defeat on the budget and Government shutdown. "Among our several miscalculations, in some ways the most dangerous of all," Gingrich writes, "was to underrate the communications prowess of William Jefferson Clinton."
Gingrich elicits perhaps the greatest sympathy when he talks about the challenge of graduating from a rabble-rousing backbencher in the House minority to presiding over (and trying to control) the first Republican majority in 40 years. As described by Gingrich in personal detail, the journey would have been forbidding for any politician.
But too often Gingrich's mea culpas sound as if he were merely embracing the conventional wisdom about himself. He has been so pilloried, so publicly, that the bar for self-redemption may be higher for Gingrich than for other politicians. In fact, Gingrich's writing betrays itself and assures us that this is the same Newt the public loves to hate. Gingrich careers from self-criticism to self-inflation, as when he cites those he seems to view as his peers in history. "I have studied the transformational leaders of the past," he writes, "most especially among them Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt." Turns out they all had challenges similar to his.
And for all his confessions, Gingrich still retreats repeatedly to the age-old technique of blaming "liberals in the press" for his predicament. Yes, reporters were ready to pounce -- not because they are members of some ideological cabal intent on bringing down the Republicans, but because reporters will always aggressively scrutinize a fast-rising leader who trumpets dramatic change. Clinton knows this all too well.
The book would have been more enlightening had Gingrich displayed more candor rather than merely the impression of candor. Though he writes at length about the ethics charges against him, he essentially skims over them, blaming himself for leaving the matter to his lawyers. ("I was really shocked," he says, "to discover how little research and investigation these lawyers had done.")
Nor does he offer any sense of drama about last year's coup attempt. When did he find out? How did he feel about his loyalists' betrayal? Instead of being treated to Gingrich the Man, we get a bellyful of Gingrich the Politician. The reader is to believe that he has no ill will toward those whom others in his orbit have denounced as traitors. "How could I, who had spent years trying to move the party faster than its senior leadership wanted it to move, stay truly mad at someone who was driven by the same passion?" he asks. "If I had been one of the militant sophomores, my heart might very well have been with them."
The only people who would buy that explanation are die-hard Gingrich devotees -- the few who are left. This is a book that will win favor with those who already toe the Gingrich line. It won't help the Speaker make new friends -- or build a new image.

HEADLINE: Being 13

BYLINE: By Charles McGrath; Charles McGrath is the editor of The Times Book Review.

 BODY:
Why 13-year-olds? You could make a case that in America now adolescence really starts at age 10 or 11, and that it continues well into the 20's. We have both intensified and elongated what used to be a simple biological transition, and have turned it into an arduous rite of cultural passage. To say that kids nowadays grow up too fast is a truism; it's equally true that we have made such a fetish of youth that not only adolescents but also many of us ostensible grown-ups dwell in a perpetual state of immaturity. But as an arbitrary cutoff, 13 has the virtue of standing at the beginning of what continues to be the heart of the journey -- the teen-age years -- and as these photographs amply document, 13 is the age that may most vividly embody all the paradoxes and contrasts of adolescence. These kids are still recognizably children, even as they are also premature grown-ups. Sometimes they're both at once -- children trying to act grown-up -- and sometimes you sense a younger self clinging forlornly to an older one. Many of the kids seem to be in a state of constant transition, slipping back and forth from one extreme to the other, as in Lauren Greenfield's pictures of suburban girls getting ready for a party in Edina, Minn. They're teeny-boppers one minute, miniature cocktail-dressed matrons the next.
The demographers already have a name for these kids: Generation Y. Together with their slightly younger counterparts, now biding their time in elementary or middle school, early in the next century they will swell the ranks of the nation's teen-agers to some 30 million, or more than at any time since 1975, when their parents, the tail end of the baby boom, were themselves pubescent. These youngsters are of surpassing interest both to doomsayers (who point out, for example, that they are bound to wreck more cars and drive up auto insurance rates) and to people in the marketing and media businesses. "They don't work," Joe Roth, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, points out. "They don't have families to raise. They're available consumers with money." Teen-agers, and teen-age girls especially, already have considerable economic clout. They spend about $122 billion a year, and not all of it on going to see "Titanic" again. Teen-agers account for more than 10 percent of supermarket sales, for instance, and though exact figures are harder to come by, they are also significant buyers of drugs and illegal guns. 
 This generation ought to be of interest even to those of us who aren't selling them anything. They are our children, after all -- literally and metaphorically -- and in the not-too-distant future, when we have shuffled off to our retirement communities, they will in a sense be our parents as well. They will be making the rules -- or trying to. (Luckily, unless we die with unprecedented swiftness, we will still outnumber and outvote them.) One characteristic of adolescents, however, is that they do not readily lend themselves to inspection.
Our collective sense of our teen-agers, I sometimes think -- our composite picture of them -- may be as unbalanced as my own family archive. In my house we have volume upon volume of photos of the kids when they were little, a vast, overdocumented record of birthdays, holidays and Kodak vacation moments. But as the children get older, they turn up in the family photographs less and less, until, when they're teen-agers, they're almost invisible. They were seldom around anymore when the camera was out, and when they did consent to pose, it was usually stiffly or self-consciously; in the finished pictures their eyes are invariably disfigured by that coppery, demonic glow caused by flashbulb burn. How come that never happened when they were small?
Teen-age pictures, though far less cute, are all the more poignant, it seems to me, for being so hard to capture. All babies, you could argue (and all baby pictures), are more or less alike; it's only when children approach adolescence, and begin to become social beings, that they start to develop private, inaccessible selves -- and it's just at that moment that they tend to disappear or go out of focus. They stop turning up in our photo albums, that is, almost at the same moment that we stop comprehending them. We look at them, but we don't always see who's there.
This spring, The Times Magazine commissioned roughly a dozen of the country's best photographers to take pictures of 13-year-olds all over America. (Some of them will no longer be 13 when the issue appears, and some will be turning 13 just after it comes out; all will be 13 at some point in 1998.) The results, reproduced in the pages of this special issue, bring these kids back into focus, at least for a moment, and they're eye-opening: they restore adolescence to view. This is what our teen-age children really look like, when they let us look at them. And, for good and for ill, these pictures are a substantial clue to who our children are.
In a lot of these pictures we see kids trying on various identities to see how they suit. We even see them trying on their own bodies, so to speak -- as if they were uncertain about the fit. In some of the pictures we almost sense the subjects morphing in front of our eyes, boosted by a sudden jolt of hormones. Not the least of the anxieties of adolescence, we're reminded, is that it's an age of spurts and eruptions. Here's a zit -- like, so gross! -- that wasn't there last time we looked in the mirror; those jeans that fit so great yesterday are now three inches too short and won't snap at the waist. The persistence of the werewolf theme, in literature and in movies especially, must owe something to this adolescent sense of the body as slightly out of control, suddenly and without warning enlarging itself and sprouting hair in unaccustomed places.
With all these hormonal surgings comes sex, of course, and sexual awareness, though that's a muted theme in these pages, present for the most part in an occasional daring flash of belly button. Most of these kids, you sense, not only aren't ready yet -- they know they aren't ready and are temporarily parked in a kind of androgynous rec room filled with posters of Hanson. In many ways, they're younger, and more sweetly innocent, than we may have imagined.
The really powerful feeling here, the emotion animating almost all these pictures in one way or another, is not so much physical desire as simply the wish to connect: to belong, to fit in. It may not be too much to say that all these kids are looking for surrogate families, for people who will take them in and accept them without question, and what's fascinating is how much of the process is reduced to symbols and uniforms -- the right clothes, the right hairstyle. Viewed from a certain distance, the rituals of a gang initiation in Los Angeles don't seem any stranger or crueler or more arbitrary than the elaborate pecking order among middle-school cliques in Edina. Both are systems that in order to work have to exclude as well as embrace; you can't have an in crowd, we learn from some of these pained faces, unless you also have that most dreaded category to those in their teens: "losers." To note that these designations mean nothing in the long run -- that the world is full of losers turned winners, and vice versa -- would surely do no good. The whole point about adolescence is that you live it in the moment.
A couple of things may be missing from these pictures, or are at least underrepresented. Violence, for one -- which, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, is the major source of anxiety among young people. And teen-age optimism as well. According to the same poll, most of today's teen-agers, unlike the slackers of Gen X, actually believe that things are improving and that they will lead even better lives than their parents. Finally, these pictures are eerily silent, when teen-agers, as we know, are anything but. Some of our 13-year-olds' words are here, in the form of transcripts from interviews, but to get the full picture, so to speak, readers may want to imagine a soundtrack, composed of equal parts Puff Daddy and the Spice Girls, booming from bedroom stereos and seeping from the headphones of countless Walkmen.

HEADLINE: Leaving the Freeway, Paying a Price

BYLINE: By DEANNE STILLMAN; DEANNE STILLMAN is writing "The Murders at Twentynine Palms," a book about a crime on the modern frontier (Avon).

 BODY:
SOME say that the frontier closed in 1867, when barbed wire was first patented. For others it was 1869, when the transcontinental railroad was completed. In 1893 Frederick Jackson Turner declared it closed in a seminal paper presented at a meeting of the American Historical Association. Entitled "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," it argued that "The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development. . . . The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West." This region, he suggested, was made up of a series of frontiers -- the trader's frontier, the miner's frontier, the rancher's frontier, and lastly, the farmer's frontier.
Not mentioned in his paper was the internal frontier, the personal landscape -- in the American imagination, wide-open space with a few itinerant tumbleweeds -- that is imprinted at the time of birth on every citizen's slate. Although I read in high school that the frontier, my birthright, was closed, I never believed it. 
 I used to escape the gray skies and frozen shores of northern Ohio by huddling under my covers with a flashlight and reading Zane Grey. I'd breathe easier, then go to sleep. In no time I was ordering desert plants from a mail-order house called Cactus Jack's. Finally, with driver's license in hand, I transformed my inner journey into a geographic one, joining the endless wagon train and hitting the trail.
Although the land was now hobbled by strip malls, housing developments that all ended with the word "View" and surreal establishments featuring characters named Chuck E. Cheese, I still didn't buy Turner's thesis. Call me a wide-eyed gal from the Buckeye State, but I could see and feel right past these fetters and deep into virgin territory. I wanted to go back and tell Turner that he didn't know what he was talking about. Didn't he understand that you couldn't erase space, no matter what happened?
Alas, a few months ago, everything changed. That was the day my life in this wide-open land got smaller, my space was encroached on, my breathing was once again labored. For me, the frontier finally closed. It was Oct. 27, 1997. That day, I was issued a traffic violation for an infraction I did not know I had committed. This came as a result of publicly placed Radio Frequency Identification equipment -- similar to technology used by the United States military to keep track of supplies in "conflict zones" overseas.
I was heading north from Dana Point, perhaps the most sparkling of the sparkling coastal communities in Orange County, about 60 miles from where I live in Los Angeles. Usually I take the Pacific Coast Highway until it stops in Long Beach and then head east to the 405, or I simply get right on the 405 and take it all the way to my exit, which is the 90 heading west. But this night I wanted to do something different.
I had spent the weekend at the grand beach house of my cousin and his wife, high atop the cliffs with a view to Hawaii, Asia, Hale-Bopp and beyond. Because of El Nino, or maybe just because they felt so inclined, the ocean waters this fall were unusually warm. By day we bodysurfed a pristine beach. By night we watched shooting stars; who needed a blinking light at the end of a pier to signal American resurrection? This was it, westward ho, as far as you could go, as good as it gets, let's order takeout and have some imported beer. I finished the giant prawns in the sauce of some police state on the far side of the Pacific, happy that my address was here on this side, and headed home from my weekend adventure.
I decided to try a shortcut called the San Joaquin Hills Corridor. This is a toll road that opened in 1996, directly linking San Juan Capistrano with Costa Mesa on a route that distills the essence of freeway travel in Southern California: It's faster and more scenic than the 405, cutting driving time by up to 40 minutes. Generally I am against toll roads, particularly in California, just as I refuse to pay for "beach parking," another perverse feature of latter-day travel in the Promised Land. Aren't our taxes high enough to merit unlimited access to any path, however pretty, that takes us through time and space to either land or water?
But tonight I did not want to get mired in traffic, not after my weekend of unrestricted movement. I could not bear the idea of getting hung up on the Y where the 5 and the 405 intersect, a junction so busy that it is marked by signs whose pictographs might translate as "Beware of fleeing stick figures" -- actually a reference to illegal immigrants who may be stealing across the freeway in front of your vehicle.
I turned east off the Pacific Coast Highway to Crown Valley Parkway, then left onto Alicia Parkway, left at Aliso Creek Road, and after five or six lights, there I was on the 73, "Your Roads, Your Way," heading home, having resigned myself to the $2 I would have to pay for the privilege of fast and scenic driving. But no tollbooth invited my deposit; no bucket blinked for quarters.
I slowed to double- and triple-check, confirmed my luck and headed home, convinced that the road gods, maybe even the ghost of Zane Grey himself, saw me coming and took pity on this solitary traveler living a hundred years too late. There I was on the open range under the stars, driving fast, getting away with something, fleeing, escaping, going, in pursuit of happiness; this was freedom of speech, religion, assembly -- exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind. I floored it.
SEVERAL weeks later, I received a bill with the return address of Fastrak Service Center. Under "Toll Due," it explained that "The vehicle identified below failed to properly pay the toll amount due upon entering the toll plaza, in accordance with Section 30843 et seq . . ." The notice listed my license-plate number, make of car, date and time of violation, and place where the camera had recorded my transgression: San Joaquin Corridor, Catalina View North, Northbound Lane 12. Evidently, in my euphoria at exercising my birthright, I had missed a lane marked specially for me ("all other traffic") and headed for the Fastrak lane for cars with transponders issued by Fastrak.
Actually, I think I did see the Fastrak sign, but took it as a signal that I was now permitted to travel fast, faster than the poor slobs stranded on the 405, which for all the delays still lives up to its billing as a "freeway." I quickly dialed the 800 number on my ticket. No, there was no mistake; my visit to the American Dreamtime had been memorialized by a kind of technology that is also being used on the battlefield. Maybe Saddam Hussein really won the Gulf War after all: we still had his neighbors' oil, and we probably always will, but so what? We had to pay if we used it on the wrong roads.
The American frontier is now officially closed, I thought as I mailed in my toll . . . at least until I find it again, somewhere, by accident.

HEADLINE: Tourism Thrives on the Coattails of Kykuit

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE jewel in the crown, the magnificent mansion, the big fish, the cash cow. No matter how Kykuit is described, the Rockefeller family estate in Tarrytown has become a national and international tourist destination, bringing economic benefit in its wake.
"Kykuit, opened on May 1 for its fifth season, has become the catalyst for an unprecedented revival of interest in tourism in the Hudson Valley, which translates into an increase in revenue for businesses in the region," said Burns Patterson, marketing director for Historic Hudson Valley, the nonprofit organization that administer Kykuit, a property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and five other sites in the Hudson Valley. 
 Kykuit has been so successful in attracting visitors, Mr. Patterson said, that the site has become a victim of its own success. "During our first year of operation, we had 116,000 visitors," he said. "Last year the number more than doubled to 243,000, and since each tour is limited to a fairly small number of visitors, getting reservations was difficult. But this year we've expanded in several directions in order to accommodate more people."
This season at Kykuit, Mr. Patterson said, visitors have two tour options, one of which is the special garden and sculpture tour, introduced last year on a limited basis. It is now available full time through Nov. 1, expanding the site's capability to handle more visitors. The other is the house and garden tour.
Susan T. Greenstein, Kykuit's new program director and formerly with the New York Botanical Garden, said the Garden and Sculpture tour is a guided walk through the gardens, fountains and modern sculpture on the estate. "The focus is on the fabulous sculpture, breathtaking landscape and the Beaux-Arts garden design of William Welles Bosworth, which is one of the few intact Beaux-Arts gardens in America," Ms. Greenstein said. "The Rockefeller family were very involved with the planning of the gardens, and the evolution of the gardens is illustrated during the tour."
Parts of the estate, which were not available on the original tour but are now open, include the Morning Garden, the Grand Staircase and the Italian Garden, she said.
As for the art on display, it is remarkable.
"Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's extraordinary collection of 20th-century sculpture, including the works of Picasso, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore and Louise Nevelson, are on display throughout the gardens," Mr. Patterson said. "Some pieces, including Picasso's 'Bathers,' Isa Noguchi's 'Black Sun' and Karel Appel's 'Mouse on Table' have never been shown in public before, a real feast for art lovers."
Ms. Greenstein recommends the house and garden tour for first-time visitors.
"The rooms are furnished with fine English and American pieces, portraits and family photographs," she said. "However, it is apparent that this is a family home, not a museum. Visitors, especially those from overseas, often are surprised that the house is so livable."
Tourism has been growing in importance every year as a source of revenue in the county, said Georgia G. Kalayjian, president of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau in White Plains.
Efforts to attract European tourists who have a penchant for visiting gardens and historic houses have been increased, Ms. Kalayjian said.
"We're gong to promote Kykuit at an upcoming meeting of select foreign tour operators in Chicago," she said."We're also going to market the site at a world travel meeting in London.
"The Rockefeller name is known around the world." People want to see their home. Kykuit is the big fish that draws tourists in, and the smaller fish eventually benefit. Larger numbers of European and Asian tourists are now eager to travel outside Manhattan. They want to see the countryside. They visit our attractions, stay at our hotels, eat in our restaurants, shop at our stores. They bring in new dollars, which are very good for our economy,"
Estimates show the average Kykuit day tripper spends $59 in the county on gas, restaurants, and the like, Ms. Kalayjian said. And for every overnight hotel stay, $189 is the average amount spent besides the cost of the room.
This season, for the first time, the Castle at Tarrytown is offering two getaway tie-in packages, the Sleepy Hollow and Rockefeller tours to Kykuit and Sunnyside, the home of Washington Irving, combined with a two-night stay at the authentic turn-of-the-century castle, now a hotel.
Rates range from $770 for a king-size double room to $1,490 for a large suite with a living room and a wood-burning fireplace. Packages include a Continental breakfast each morning, a dinner for two at the Equus restaurant in the hotel, a picnic lunch for two on the day of the tours and admission to the historic sites. The package is available until Oct. 31, but it must be reserved in advance.
The Castle also has a lunch-lecture package tie-in with Kykuit, which is new this year. The package, titled "Relive the Golden Age," is available on May 27 and June 3. On those days, the tour of Kykuit will be followed by lunch and a lecture by Ms. Greenstein at the Equus restaurant in the Castle. For reservations for all events, the number to call at the Castle is 631-1980.
The Renaissance Westchester Hotel in White Plains is also offering promotional tie-ins with Historic Hudson Valley. "We're advertising with them, and we're hooked up to their Web site," said Fred J. Heintz, director of marketing of the Renaissance Westchester Hotel. "During the week our occupancy rates are good, running about 80 percent. But weekends are slow, averaging about 55 to 60 percent. We'd like to bring that up to 70 percent. Maybe the expanded program at Kykuit will stimulate business."
For ease in obtaining reservations to Kykuit, Mr. Patterson said: "Visitors can now reserve tickets on the Internet rather than by phone. And they will get a saving of 10 percent or more when they do."
Tickets to Kykuit may also be bought through New York Waterway, which offers a combination package including a Kykuit tour and a Hudson River cruise. Ticket prices, which include Kykuit and admission to Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow, the round-trip cruise and ground transportation, are $60. The number to call for information on the New York Waterway packages is (800) 533-3779.
Kykuit is open every day except Tuesdays through Nov. 1. Each tour costs $18, $17 for people older that 65 and $16 for children 12 and older. Tours are not recommended for children younger than 12. Tickets are available by phone at 631-9491 or on line at www.hudsonvalley.org.
"I hope those who come to see Kykuit will also visit our other historic sites," Mr. Patterson said. "Sunnyside, Philipsburg Manor, Van Cortlandt Manor, Montgomery Place and the Union Church are all unique and wonderful in their own way."

HEADLINE: A Century of Art on a Blackboard Canvas

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman is an author whose books include "Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students, and Their High School."

 BODY:
ONE century ago, the man selected to lead the public schools of newly consolidated New York City delivered an acceptance speech. William Henry Maxwell had earned a reputation for eloquent oratory long before assuming the office of superintendent on March 15, 1898, and on that morning he turned his bass voice to a suitably grand theme.
"New York is the largest and wealthiest city on the continent," he declared. "But if New York is to be and remain a truly great city, it can only be through the education given to her children in the public schools. If public education is to do its perfect work for its community, it must be the best education that modern civilization can afford." 
 During that same inaugural year, a cameraman named G. W. Bitzer took over a Manhattan studio to make a silent movie entitled "The Nearsighted Schoolteacher." In Bitzer's version of the educational enterprise, a hapless teacher is flouted by his pupils and terrified by a toy spider.
The congruence of Maxwell's speech and Bitzer's film could hardly have been more appropriate, or more prophetic. For in the 100 years since, New York's public schools have been inextricably entwined with cultural expression, both producing it and serving as its object.
As Maxwell suggested, the schools forged much of New York's civic culture, its ideals of meritocracy and immigrant ascent. And from the Bitzer film onward, the schools have provided irresistible material for creative artists ranging from photographers to playwrights, authors to filmmakers to pop songwriters.
In just one timely reminder of the connection between culture and public education, the privately financed Arts Education Week opens tomorrow in nearly 500 schools. Last month, New York University convened a major conference on the centennial of the public schools, and next fall the Board of Education will mount an exhibition of archival photographs.
"In New York, there has been a particular debt acknowledged to schools and teachers," says Kenneth H. Jackson, the historian who edited the Encyclopedia of New York. "It's a city of immigrants, and it's a city with an ethos of achievement. There's always been a sense in New York that if you worked hard, you had a way to make it. The immigrants didn't have the money for private school, didn't have the connections, but they had the desire. And they passed that desire on to their children."
Bel Kaufman, a former teacher who wrote the definitive novel of New York's schools in "Up the Down Staircase," puts Jackson's thesis in both pedagogical and artistic terms. "The word 'possible' is a very important word," Ms. Kaufman says. "It's possible in even the most dismal surroundings to have the thrill of touching at least one student. That's often enough to make up for all the difficulties. The thrill of knowing who you touch. And why. And how."
That sense of possibility -- and the enormous obstacles conspiring against it -- collided at the very birth of New York's school system. In 1898 and for 40 years thereafter, immigrants constituted almost one-third of the city's population. Yet the concept of compulsory education, of sending children to the classroom instead of the sweatshop, was just beginning to take hold in the early decades of the century. Society demanded that the public schools not simply educate the unlettered but Americanize the alien.
In one emblematic event caught in a photograph from about 1910, a group of Lower East Side pupils, clad in the garb of their homelands, gathered worshipfully around a teacher decorated as the Statue of Liberty. "In teaching civics the aim should be to train for citizenship," the Board of Education's 1914 syllabus held. "Good citizenship depends not so much on a knowledge of the governmental forms . . . as upon the practice of civic virtue." Less idealistically, the 1934-35 edition of the school board's annual report attributed juvenile delinquency partly to Old World parents "with habits and attitudes fixed by tradition, prejudice, superstition and ignorance."
What New York offered in exchange took the form of schools designed to impart a sense of majesty. Like Gothic cathedrals looming over medieval cities, these edifices dominated immigrant neighborhoods. Erasmus Hall featured towers, Bay Ridge a landscaped courtyard, Seward Park a principal's office with fireplace and wood inlay.
"Just in their physical presence, schools became a representation of the American ideal that we the people have provided you with this magnificent opportunity to learn," says Stephan Brumberg, the author of "Going to America, Going to School," a study of Jewish immigrant students in New York. "The schools were more awesome than any building an immigrant child would have come into contact with. And in their grandeur, their attractiveness -- the marble wainscoting, the stained glass -- they were an invitation to become an American."
That invitation found many takers. High school enrollment in New York soared from 11,072 in 1898 to 154,512 in 1928 and doubled in the decade thereafter. The finest graduates proceeded to City College, the self-styled "poor man's Harvard." Hundreds of thousands of parents thronged to evening lectures on topics ranging from hygiene to history or enrolled in courses like "American Manners, Customs and Conduct."
At the time, however, art did not especially celebrate these achievements. Jacob Riis photographed New York schools around 1900 primarily to demonstrate their overcrowded conditions; one such print appeared in his muckraking manifesto "How the Other Half Lives." In her 1925 novel "Bread Givers," the Jewish immigrant author Anzia Yezierska bitterly described teachers "just peddling their little bit of education for a living, the same as any pushcart peddler." The socially conscious movies of the Depression years, whether melodramas like "Hell's Kitchen" or the early black feature "Reform School," focused on teen-agers who slipped beyond education's grasp into lives of crime. Richard Brooks's 1955 film "The Blackboard Jungle" shocked audiences with its combustible mix of delinquency and rock-and-roll.
It fell to the actual schoolchildren of the 1920's and 1930's, once they reached adulthood, to create a body of work celebrating their educations and educators. Kate Simon, in her acclaimed memoir "A Wider World," recalled a teacher named Mr. Brandon at Monroe High School in the Bronx who liberated her from a loveless household with lessons in Shakespeare, Keats and Wilde. Joseph Dorman's 1997 documentary, "Arguing the World," presented City College of the Depression years as the proving ground of renowned intellectuals like Irving Howe, Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell.
Many of these public-school alumni saw their teachers forever through the admiring eyes of the poor, ghettoized youngsters they had once been. "In an immigrant neighborhood, the teacher was someone who had succeeded, not so much economically but culturally, someone who was the epitome of America," says Kate Rousmaniere, the author of "City Teachers," a study of New York City educators in the 1920's. "Teachers were learned; they were articulate; they seemed refined. And teachers were expected -- demanded, really -- to be caring individuals, because that absolves the system of responsibility. Teachers feel they have to be superhuman. That's a romanticized view, but it's also true. And it's a potent, dramatic dynamic."
Bel Kaufman gave the dynamic memorable form in "Up the Down Staircase." An immigrant who had arrived from Russia at age 12 and ultimately taught English in New York's public schools for 35 years, Ms. Kaufman drew heavily on her own experiences as pupil and pedant. Her career linked the melting-pot metropolis of the pre-World War II years to the city being altered by the influx of Puerto Ricans and African-Americans in the postwar decades. What remained constant, at least in her rendering of urban education, was the alchemy of teacher, students and classroom.
"Up the Down Staircase" began as a short story entitled "From a Teacher's Wastebasket," which was published in The Saturday Review in 1962. As the title implied, the story consisted entirely of scraps of regulations, homework assignments, doodles and, finally, a young teacher's desperate and unsent plea to her principal for help. Ms. Kaufman extended the same narrative device across 340 pages in the novel, creating in her heroine, Sylvia Barrett, the enduring portrait of a New York teacher -- beleaguered, a bit intimidated, yet capable of changing at least one student's life.
"I wanted people to close the book and laugh and then say: 'Wait a minute. ' " Ms. Kaufman recalls. "I wanted the kind of humor that has a tear behind it."
Since its publication in 1963, "Up the Down Staircase" has sold more than six million copies, been translated into 16 languages and gone through 47 printings. Robert Mulligan's film adaptation, released in 1967, influenced many subsequent films and television shows about New York schools.
Without the supple hands of Ms. Kaufman and Mr. Mulligan, however, the results veered toward the formulaic. Alan Parker's 1980 musical film, "Fame," set in the High School of the Performing Arts in Manhattan, surrendered its grittier instincts to the happy-ending conventions of Hollywood. In the 1970's television series "Welcome Back, Kotter," the co-producer Gabriel Kaplan modeled fictitious Buchanan High on the school he had attended in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. His class of charmingly crude "sweathogs," led by John Travolta, resembled nothing so much as updated versions of the mischievous lads in Bitzer's silent movie "The Nearsighted Schoolteacher."
Slapstick and sentimentality hardly reflected the conditions in New York City's actual schools. Buffeted by white flight, fiscal crisis, unstable leadership above and social chaos below, the school system of the last quarter-century has struggled to equal its gilded reputation.
The chasm between past and present cracked open in 1968, when black parents and a largely white, disproportionately Jewish teachers' union warred over community control of the schools in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Under the combative leadership of Albert Shanker, the United Federation of Teachers struck three times in the fall of 1968, bringing the school system to a near-total halt and the city to an apogee of racial tension.
Just as the decentralization struggle was subsiding, racial strife engulfed City College. Its practice of admitting applicants on the basis of their high school records alone -- an act of principle in earlier decades, when Ivy League schools put quotas on Jews -- now came under attack as being racist in effect. Reeling from protests by blacks, Puerto Ricans and their leftist allies, the college switched to open admissions.
Taken together, the battles at City College and in Ocean Hill-Brownsville challenged the faith that public education in New York could teach and uplift all those willing to learn. "There was a profound loss of belief in our institutions," says Diane Ravitch, author of "The Great School Wars," the authoritative history of New York's public schools. "The belief in merit had been strong. But in the late 60's, you get an analysis saying merit is just a cover for privilege, for a system that protects certain groups. Up until the 60's, this city had believed in the central idea of the melting pot, even as we had vibrant ethnic communities. Then came this kind of rejection and contempt for the melting pot. And that was important for the schools, because they had always seen themselves as the primary agency of the melting pot."
The convulsions of the late 1960's, which shake public education in New York to this day, yielded art as despairing as an early generation's had been buoyant. It was art forged in the furnace of the moment, not crafted at a remembered distance, art resonating with the anguished ineloquence of public schools' losers rather than the elegiac tones of its triumphant graduates.
Herbert Kohl's 1967 memoir about teaching in Harlem, "36 Children," helped catalyze the modern school-reform movement. Another New York City teacher, Stephen Joseph, shaped the poetry of his inner-city students into the 1970 musical "The Me Nobody Knows," part of a boomlet of Broadway shows like "Hair" that forced social issues into a once escapist medium.
MR. KOHL and Mr. Joseph, as products of an idealistic, radicalized decade, at least trusted the power of documentary truth to stir the public conscience. More recent writers like Emily Sachar ("Shut Up and Let the Lady Teach"), Stephen O'Connor ("Will My Name Be Shouted Out?") and Cristina Rathbone ("On the Outside Looking In") have portrayed students and teachers as all but discarded by the larger society, left to negotiate their own path amid drugs, crime and familial collapse. What hope existed in their works was purely of the existential sort, the hope of mere survival.
"Through the kids' eyes you see what society expects of them, and it's grim," Rathbone says of her experience at West Side High in Manhattan, a last-chance school for 800 students. "It treats poor, urban kids as, at best, someone else's problem and, at worst, downright inhuman. And the kids internalize that, feel it's right and proper and normal."
No work of art more bleakly conveyed New York's education crisis than Shirley Lauro's play "Open Admissions," which was based on her years of teaching speech at various branches of City University. In the late 1960's, a veteran professor advised her: "Don't judge the open-admissions kids by the same standard. If their attitude is good and they try, just slide them through." By the time Ms. Lauro resigned in the early 1980's, students praised her simply for remembering their names.
Later produced on Broadway and broadcast on CBS, "Open Admissions" first reached the stage in 1981 as a 25-minute one-act presented by the Ensemble Studio Theater. The entire action occurs in the office of a college speech teacher named Ginny Carlson on the night a black student with a fifth-grade reading level demands to know why she keeps giving him B's. When Ginny puts off his request for extra help, he screams and seethes, curses and pleads, throttles her and then throws himself to the floor of her office, literally begging to learn.
The spectacle wracked audiences all too familiar with the play's historical backdrop. "I walked out of the theater one night," Marilyn Rockafellow, who played Ginny, recalled in a 1984 interview, "and this man and this woman, who were both obviously teachers, were in an argument. I felt sure it would become a fistfight. She was saying: 'Don't you see? We are to blame. We do it. We perpetuate it." And he said, 'No, you cannot tell me it's my fault, when I have these students, these jerks, who can't do anything.' It was a collision. The play caused a collision."
The aftershocks from that collision rumble all the way to the present. In the last weeks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has demanded that the City University system drastically reduce its remedial courses, the inevitable result of open admissions. Reckoning with high schools in which barely half the students graduate with their class, Chancellor Rudy Crew has proposed halting social promotion in the lower grades.
Hearing the horror stories, and having them replayed through the tape-loop of art, someone who has never set foot inside a public school might be stunned to find Chinese and Dominican immigrants analyzing "The Great Gatsby," blacks and Puerto Ricans of the underclass taming the iambic pentameter of "The Tempest." Such things actually do happen; they just go unrecognized amid the city's enveloping pessimism about public education. These days, it takes a media event like "Principal for a Day" to entice the entitled into a public school. Even the woman who runs the program has her children privately educated.
Meanwhile, in a storage room of the Museum of Natural History rest the pieces of a statue of William Henry Maxwell, the founding superintendent of New York's public schools. The rendering of Maxwell in his academic robes, sage as a Supreme Court justice, was built about 70 years ago with teachers' donations and stood for decades on a marble pedestal in an exhibition hall. Why and when the statue was removed and disassembled nobody seems to know.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Richard D. Parsons;
From Law to President of Time Warner

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
RICHARD D. PARSONS, Nelson A. Rockefeller's personal lawyer and prodigy, was someone the former Vice President thought should someday be a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. But Mr. Parsons's career went a different way. He gave up law, became a chief executive officer at a bank and in 1994 was made president of Time Warner. As such, he played a key role in the negotiations that led last year to the media giant's purchase of Ted Turner's cable network, including Cable News Network.
Today he is what Newsweek -- a rival of Time Warner's Time magazine -- called "arguably America's most influential black executive." On Wednesday, Mr. Parsons, who maintains homes in Pocantico Hills and Manhattan, will be the keynote speaker at the Westchester Community College Foundation's Annual Medallion Awards Dinner. The event will honor Frank S. McCullough Jr., a Rye lawyer and past chairman of the foundation's board of directors, for community service, the college's Prof. Douglas Kenny for education and Gannett Suburban Newspapers for corporate support of the college. The dinner, which raises funds for student scholarships, starts at 6:30 P.M. at Abigail Kirsch at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown. Tickets are $175 each. The number to call for further information is 785-6670. 
 Mr. Parsons, who graduated first in his class from Albany Law School in 1971, went on to work for the State Legislature and then Governor Rockefeller. When Mr. Rockefeller became Vice President under President Gerald R. Ford in the aftermath of Watergate , Mr. Parsons went to Washington with him. When Mr. Rockefeller returned to civilian life, Mr. Parsons became his personal lawyer.
In 1977, he stopped practicing law. Before joining Time Warner, he was chairman and chief executive officer of the Dime Savings Bank, one of the largest thrift institutions in the country. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Parsons:
Q. What will you speak about at the Westchester College dinner?
A. I'll probably talk about why I think the role community colleges are playing, particularly in Westchester County, is so important to people who come from less than advantaged backgrounds. I won't necessarily call them disadvantaged because I don't like the phrase. It sounds mildly demeaning, because lots of those people have other kinds of enrichment in their backgrounds; it doesn't mean they're disadvantaged. But they may not have had all the opportunity to develop their own potential and to acquire skills. I think the mission of the community college, particularly as we approach the 21st century, is critical from an equity-in-society perspective.
Q. Did you come from a disadvantaged background?
A. I personally would answer that question no. But if you looked at the demographics, you would say yes. I was born in the Bedford-Stuyvesant part of Brooklyn, raised in what's called South Jamaica, Queens, both of which are heavily minority communities. I went to the New York City public schools, had a one-income family -- but an intact family, and that's an important thing. My father probably never earned more than $7,500 a year when I was a kid, but at the time I had absolutely no idea that we were statistically working poor. We were like everybody else on the block; it didn't seem so bad to me.
Q. Was it your parents and your schools that instilled in you the drive that got you where you are today?
A. I owe a lot to my parents, to be sure. And, of course, I owe a lot to the schools because -- good intentions not withstanding -- if you don't get quality instruction and a certain amount of discipline and accountability that comes to the instructional process, you don't learn things. And if you don't learn things, you won't have anything to offer.
Q. How do you see your role as the president of Time Warner to influence public debate on these issues?
A. Well, that's a good question, and I don't have a spiffy answer for you. Or at least I don't have a packaged or canned answer. I do think that simply by virtue of the shoulders that I'm standing on I have some visibility and an opportunity to at least be heard above the din. First, you have to decide: to what extent do you want to join into the public chorus on one side or the other? Generally, I try, although I'm not always successful, to stay below the radar on most things outside whatever it is I happen to be doing for a living at a point of time -- with the exception of the educational arena. That's because I'm a big believer both from a humanistic point of view and also from a practical point of view in what I'll call societal equity. We have to have a society, if it's going to endure, where the bounty of that society is shared on a fair basis with the participants in the society. If you have a system where we kind of get put into two camps -- haves and have nots -- sooner or later whatever holds those two together will break. Then you will have a collapse of society.
From an equity-in-society perspective, I'm a big believer in public education as a necessary mediating ingredient. And that's something that I have some experience with, as a product of it, and some passion about because I think in many respects the schools are failing their mission.
Q. Was race a handicap to you along the way or not a factor?
A. That's another tough question to answer. There is perception, and there is sort of a larger reality. I have said and have been criticized for this that in my case I never personally thought race was a handicap. And that has a lot to do with who I am and how I have interacted with the world. There are others who take a dimmer view of American society and say it's always a factor and it's always a negative. I think a large part of the answer for individuals is: you can allow it to be a determining factor or you can take the reality of your race in stride, like the reality of the weather. You know, some days it rains, some days it doesn't. You can't let those factors determine what you're going to do with your life.
Q. You had a close association with Nelson Rockefeller. We frequently hear that Rockefeller Republicans are a dead breed.
A. It's not true.
Q. So you would still give yourself that label?
A. Absolutely. I think that if you define a Rockefeller Republican as I do as someone who -- well, the easy way used to be as someone who was fiscally conservative and socially liberal. It's someone who believes in fiscal discipline and believes that you can't solve problems simply by throwing money at them. You can't solve all the problems by manipulation of the financial structure. You've got to adjust the institutions of society to help promote social equity, but you have to do that within the context of sound economic discipline and policies. You know a lot of those people who now call themselves conservative Democrats are really starting to spout that message, including the current President.
Now, nobody wants to call themselves a Rockefeller Republican because in the Republican Party that's a kind of kiss of death. That's because you have these crazy right-wing Republicans who reign terror on anybody within the party who doesn't subscribe to their doctrine.
Q. Rockefeller had talked about you as a possible Supreme Court nominee. Looking back, would you have liked to have gone that route?
A. You don't get do-overs in real life. So I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that. It was something that intrigued me at the time, but it was something I consciously moved away from when I moved out of law.
Q. Vice President Rockefeller died so you lost your main advocate.
A. That's true.
Q. How have things changed at Time Warner now that Ted Turner is part of the empire?
A. It's an even more interesting place to work. This was always an interesting company. We have probably the best collection of the media and entertainment assets of any such company; adding CNN into our world globalizes the company by an order of magnitude of what it was. And CNN is an important global institution. Ted himself is a larger-than-life figure who is brash and bold, captivating, and an interesting guy. I like him.
Q. Please define your job. You are not the one who decides who will be on the cover of Time, or what the lead story will be on CNN. How do you fit into those decisions, if at all.
A. Just think of Time Warner in essence as a holding company with all these operating units under it. What we do at the corporate level is make sure that each of our businesses is running on a sound basis, both financially and operationally. And we make sure the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts by effectively shepherding the profit collaborations.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Hotels;
Will the Former Ritz-Carlton Thrive as a Westin?

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
FOR six months it was a hotel with no name. After a bitter, protracted dispute with the then-owner of the hotel at 112 Central Park South, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company lowered its trademark lion flags from the front of the building last August and severed its agreement to manage the property.
Although ITT Sheraton quickly took over the management, the corporate name was not attached to the hotel. Telephone operators greeted callers with the phrase "the luxury collection." 
It was not until late January, after the Starwood, which owns several hotel chains including Westin and Sheraton, took ownership of the property, that the hotel was renamed the Westin Central Park South. It is the first time Westin, an international chain of 120 properties, has operated a hotel in New York under that name. The parent company does, however, own other hotels in the city, including the Doral, the St. Regis and the three Sheraton properties.
Now the new managers of the property are trying to lure back old customers who shifted their allegiance during the interregnum and attract new ones. Whether they will be able to do so without the magic of the Ritz-Carlton name is questionable in the view of many hotel industry analysts.
Ritz-Carlton, after all, is the only hospitality company to have won the Federal Government's Malcolm Baldrige Quality award. The company's system of recording the service preferences of each guest so the services can be available whenever a guest checks in at an affiliated hotel anywhere in the world, and its insistence that "certainly" and "my pleasure" are the only acceptable responses to guest requests, are cited routinely in management books and articles.
Mark Spadoni, the general manager of the Westin here, said he planned to offer most, if not all, the amenities of a Ritz-Carlton, but in a different way. He said the company's Westin Premier program included a computerized guest preference program similar to Ritz-Carlton's, along with a points system and airline miles credits that can be redeemed for additional benefits and travel.
Mr. Spadoni said there was a conscious difference in the way the two hotel chains operated. "There is a spectrum of service that ranges from formal and stuffy service to casual service," he said. He said Ritz-Carlton was toward the formal end of the spectrum, while he described Westin as "friendly and professional."
He also noted that most of the approximately 200 people on the hotel's staff were holdovers from the Ritz-Carlton era. Only the top managers are from Westin, so a hotel guest with a favorite desk clerk or concierge will see familiar faces.
But some industry analysts say the Westin name simply does not have the cachet of Ritz-Carlton. "Ritz-Carlton is five-star brand, Westin is a four-star brand," said Michael Fishbin, a hospitality consultant with E&Y Kenneth Leventhal. He said Starwood was planning to use the name of the St. Regis hotel, which it also owns, as its five-star brand nationally and internationally.
Since the St. Regis name is already established in New York, he said, the parent company apparently decided to hang the Westin label on the Central Park South property.
Brand loyalty is a major issue in the hotel business, analysts say. "A Westin is not considered at the level of a Ritz-Carlton," said John A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hospitality consulting company. "There are some people who when they travel only want to stay at a Ritz-Carlton or a Four Seasons, which are interchangeable in the top luxury segment."
Nevertheless, Westin is charging Ritz-level prices. The corporate rate for a standard room facing the city is $330 a night, with rooms overlooking the park renting for as much as $490. The Presidential Suite, an 1,800-square-foot multiroom space that includes a whirlpool bath and a balcony overlooking the park, goes for $3,500 a night.
Because of the six months of uncertainty, Mr. Spadoni said he had some catching up to do. "There was a slow deterioration of the business from August on," he said. "Some loyal customers kept coming here anyway, but we definitely lost some business."
THE effort to remarket the hotel -- which has included offering juice, coffee and danish pastries to taxi drivers so they would recognize the new name -- comes at a time when the hotel business in New York is as good as anyone can remember. The occupancy rate last year, according to figures compiled by Coopers & Lybrand was 82 percent, which hotel executives describe as very close to full.
The average room rate increased 11.1 percent during the year to $187.91 a night, an indication that hotel operators are using the tight market as an opportunity to increase prices.
Combining the increased occupancy with the higher daily rates produces a number dear to the hearts of hotel operators, the revenue per available room. That increased 12.6 percent during the year to $154.09.
Mr. Spadoni said the previous owner, a Saudi businessman named Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim al-Ibrahim, had been dissatisfied with the financial performance of the hotel and had not invested in its upkeep. He said Westin would inject capital to "freshen up" the property.
That freshening up will include new bed covers and other so-called "soft goods" in the guest bedrooms, new carpets in public areas and the replacement of metal keys for guest room doors with an electronic system. In addition the building will be reconfigured so that office and other space on lower floors facing the park will be turned into 20 guest rooms, which will be added to the 208 now in operation.
Most of the work will be done during the traditionally slow period during the summer, Mr. Spadoni said, so the renovated hotel is expected to be ready for fall.
As the rebranding of the hotel indicates, there is very little connection between who owns a property and who manages it. Ritz-Carlton, for instance, owns none of the 34 hotels it operates around the world. Marriott and Hilton own some of the hotels they manage, but analysts say most hotels are owned by groups of investors and operated under contract by a management company or via a franchising arrangement. Despite having voluntarily withdrawn from the city, Ritz-Carlton is anxious to reestablish its presence in New York, analysts say.
"I think it violates no confidences to say Ritz-Carlton wants to get back into New York," said Arthur Adler, a hospitality consultant with Coopers & Lybrand. "It is a significant hole in their portfolio."
The disconnect between image and reality is also illustrated by the company's corporate structure. Although Ritz-Carlton carefully cultivates its image of, as Mr. Spadoni puts it, "ladies and gentlemen taking care of ladies and gentlemen," it is 100-percent owned by Marriott Corporation. "Ritz-Carlton would never market itself as a Marriott product," said Stephen Rushmore, the president of HVS International, a hotel consulting company.
One reason for the reluctance to advertise the corporate affiliation, Mr. Rushmore said, is that hotel chains, in general, have been more successful in establishing down-market brands than those in higher priced brackets.
He said Holiday Inns had successfully established the Hampton Inn brand at a point below the parent chain, but had struggled to make its upscale Crowne Plaza successful with travelers. "When people want to stay at an upscale hotel, they don't want to stay at a Holiday Inn," he said.
Branding is the talk of the hotel industry, according to the consultants, as companies like Starwood and Patriot American, another large hotel real estate investment trust, seek new market niches. According to a report by Coopers & Lybrand, new lodging brands have "stretched the concept of limited service from economy/budget to midprice/upscale, introduced the concept of all-suites and created the dedicated midprice or economy extended-stay hotel."
Nevertheless, trying to establish new hotel brands is expensive and risky. The Coopers & Lybrand report counted 113 new brands that were introduced between 1980 and 1996, and noted that almost half had failed. Among the brands that were introduced were Embassy Suites, Courtyard by Marriott and Holiday Inn Express.
Nevertheless, analysts say Starwood executives have signaled that they plan to launch a new brand of urban high-style hotels that incorporate, in the words of one, "the best of Ian Schrager." Mr. Schrager is the owner of the Royalton and other hotels in New York.
The new brand is to be called, simply, W, said Mr. Fishbin of E&Y Kenneth Leventhal. A likely candidate for conversion in New York is the Doral, analysts said.
Barry Sternlich, the chief executive of Starwood, said the new brand would be a sister to Westin but "high in design content and extraordinarily cool."

HEADLINE: Writers Falling for the Lull of the North Fork

BYLINE: By LORRAINE KREAHLING 

 BODY:
"I WROTE half of 'Plum Island' in six weeks on the North Fork," said the best-selling author Nelson DeMille. "The summer I rented on the South Fork in Sag Harbor, I wrote like 10 sentences of 'Cathedral,' because I was going to summer parties in the Hamptons.
"The North Fork is so quiet, physically, deathly quiet," he added. "You can write into the night, because there is nothing else to do." 
 The smaller of the two pincers of the lobster claw that forms the Eastern End of Long Island, the North Fork is separated from the South Fork by Peconic Bay, in which Shelter Island is trapped like a Little Neck clam.
Any North Fork writer, therefore, who wants to partake of the Hamptons summer social scene, where literary agents meet clients and editors read manuscripts on the beach, must make a journey that includes two ferry rides and some driving.
"In the summer, writers don't go to the South Fork to write, they go there to schmooze," Mr. DeMille said. "Writers go to the North Fork to write."
If Mr. DeMille chooses to spend part of the season on the North Fork again, he will be part of a growing group of writers who say they prefer isolation to the glamour of the South Fork society that buys and markets their wares.
North Fork writers opt for a landscape of old farmlands and new vineyards, that some say is reminiscent of the bucolic Hamptons of 50 years ago. They point out that like the Hamptons in the 1950's, the North Fork's year-round population offers a politically correct mix of classes and incomes, which includes mariners and farmers.
And while the North Fork cannot boast of crashing waves and spectacular dunes, it does have beaches on the Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. It is also a lot cheaper than the Hamptons.
"I spent a summer in the Hamptons," said the screenwriter Terry Reed. "I don't care to do that again. We had black tie parties on Saturday night. It's another competitive kind of environment like the one you live in in Manhattan. Why go back into it when you are trying to get away from it all?"
Ms. Reed wrote her first screenplay, "Cherry," currently being made into a feature film, in a cottage she rents in Rocky Point, which looks out over the Long Island Sound .
"The North Fork is not glamorous at all, but it's very gratifying to look at something beautiful when you are trying to generate ideas," Ms. Reed said.
The novelist Sandra Scoppettone sold her Soho loft in Manhattan and has just finished renovating and winterizing a waterfront cottage in Southold that will be her permanent, year-round residence.
"I like the fact that where I am isn't the Hamptons and it isn't Soho or Greenwich Village," said Ms. Scoppettone, whose 17th book is a mystery that takes place on the North Fork.
"It's not chic, because we don't have the beach," Ms. Scoppettone said. "It could be opening night of 'Titanic' in July, and you would still get into the local theater."
The memory of the ocean apparently haunts many of these writers, but none said they would trade their rocky, waveless beaches for the infamous traffic jams that come with the South Fork's sandy seaside.
"Every summer I make two or three trips to go to the Hamptons to go to the beach," said the novelist Connie Schraft, who owns a second home in Orient. Ms. Schraft is at work on her third novel, "No More Street."
"I walk out onto the sand, and nearly cry, 'I'm missing the beach, the light, the water!' " Ms. Schraft said. "Then I pull back into the traffic on Montauk Highway, and I think, nothing can be worth this hassle."
Of course the North Fork's miles of public and private waterfront property along the sound and bay do offer the writers some consolation.
"Everywhere you look, the street ends in water," said the novelist Abigail Thomas, whose book "Herb's Pajamas" has just been published.
Ms. Thomas spent summers as a child in Amagansett with her father, the writer Lewis Thomas, but she now lives year-round in the village of Greenport, which is the Shelter Island ferry's north port. Ms. Thomas said she visits her children and grandchildren on the South Fork only on weekdays in the summer.
"East Hampton used to be the quietest, most boring little town," Ms. Thomas said. "It's now become a stage set for everyone from Manhattan."
To writers like Rob Buchanan, who reports on his participation in extreme sports for both Outside and Details magazines, the North Fork is an affordable, year-round paradise.
"In a nautical sense, we are totally surrounded by very usable water," said Mr. Buchanan. "I can fish at the end of my street. You can sail 25 miles to Montauk and you are in the open Atlantic. In October you can put on a mask and grab up your quota of scallops in 10 minutes."
Real estate brokers may enthuse about the North Fork's being "the next Hamptons." But most writers said this gave an unrealistically bullish gloss to a strip of water-lapped, economically depressed farmland where the income of the leisure class is separated from the wealth in the Hamptons by more than the Peconic Bay.
"That book 'Heaven on Earth' is the Norman Rockwell version of things," said the journalist Greg Palast, referring to a volume of photography that portrays the North Fork as a hybrid of the French countryside crossed with Nantucket.
"Those photographs don't include the migrant workers or the marine equipment that's been sitting and rusting in your neighbor's backyard for 10 years," said Mr. Palast, who writes on American white collar crime and government regulations for The Guardian in London.
"Greenport is the kind of place where two guys buy a big old Victorian house together and spend a lot of money fixing it up, while next door to them someone is moving a refrigerator onto the porch so they have more space to store beer," said John D. Williams Jr.., who moved to the village 25 years ago.
Mr. Williams has had two screenplays optioned and published "Everything Scrabble," a guide to the game.
"The North Fork doesn't demand financial or worldly success or status, and yet it's not provincial," said Peggy Gormley, a sreenwriter and actress who is a partner with Harvey Keitel in The Goat Singers film production company.
"There's a middle class, a professional class and a working class," said Ms. Gormley, who rents an apartment as a year-round retreat in Greenport. "Theoretically, if we could afford the Hamptons, we wouldn't go there."
The novelist Alan Furst, who lives among the burgeoning South Fork community of writers in Sag Harbor, confirmed that when the summer crowd leaves in the fall, Sag Harbor's frenetic social pace ebbs, and full-time writers-in-residence go back to work.
"The line of Mercedes in front of Caldor's disappears, and Sag Harbor Village becomes a village of working people again," Mr. Furst said. "There are a lot of writers here in the winter, and it's quiet socially."
But for those North Fork writers who are full-time residents, the isolation of the winters is not always inspiring or enchanting.
"It's bucolic and it's isolated, but it is also isolating," said Mr. Palast, who confessed that he may eventually move with his wife and children to a more cosmopolitan setting.
"The phone doesn't ring, and there are no art openings," said Mr. Buchanan. "It's quiet as the tomb, and that's really good when you're on deadline. Social opportunities in the winter, however, seem to be limited to the Whiskey Wind Bar."
But as the quality of coffee improves on the North Fork, andwords like merlot and chardonnay pass into local parlance and more farms stands offer organic produce, many reclusive North Fork writers wonder if things will change.
"I found a Prada dress for $3 marked down from $6 in our secondhand store, the Opportunity Shop," said Ms. Reed warily. "But there's still only one French restaurant and nowhere to shop."
"I was in the I.G.A., when a guy pulled up in a Mercedes," said Mr. Williams. "He left the car running and forced his way into the cashier's face to ask, 'Do you have mesquite?' She said, 'Mosquito spray?' and he said, 'No, mesquite, mesquite!"'
The television writer and performer Billy Kimball, who spent summers on the North Fork as a child and keeps a full-time residence in Cutchogue, took a more jaundiced view of the rumors of the demise of the North Fork's glamourless bucolic charm.
"The government put up money to erect a beautiful hand-painted wooden sign, that says, 'Welcome to Long Island Wine Country,' " Mr. Kimball said. "Underneath it, a farmer had nailed a piece of cardboard that said, 'Pigs for Sale,' with his phone number.
"No matter how much they try to Hamptonize the North Fork," said Mr. Kimball, "it's always going to be the kind of place where a local farmer has a new litter of pigs and can't see the point of a perfectly good signpost going to waste."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Bishop Peter Rosazza;
A Mission in the Archdiocese of Hartford

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
SINCE 1978, Peter Rosazza has served as auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Hartford, which encompasses about 220 parishes and 800,000 Roman Catholics in Hartford, New Haven and Litchfield counties.
Bishop Rosazza, 63, was born in New Haven and raised in Torrington. After his ordination in 1961, he served as parish priest in West Hartford and taught Spanish, French, and Italian at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield. He began his ministry to the Spanish-speaking community in 1972 at Sacred Heart Church in the north end of Hartford, where he became a voice for the poor. Bishop Rosazza now works from the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven. 
 In a recent interview, he discussed his work. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How did the experience of being a priest in a poor Spanish-speaking parish influence you?
A. It was a turning point in my life. It was from riches to rags in a sense. I saw urban poverty. People came from a place which was so different, Puerto Rico, with beautiful sun and sea. They never had to put up with the winter before. Whole families would show up at the end of October with clothes that one would wear in July. So we had all sorts of social services -- clothing, food, furniture, counseling and advocacy.
In 1986 the U.S. Catholic bishops published a document on the U.S. economy called Economic Justice for All. I made the motion to have this study done. If I hadn't had the experience at Sacred Heart in Hartford, I don't think I would have been ready for that economic critique.
Q. What are your duties as bishop?
A. My main commitment is the ministry to the Spanish speaking. We have about 20 parishes that have services in Spanish in the archdiocese. On the national level, I'm the bishop advisor for the National Catholic Student Coalition and I'm on two committees of the Bishops Conference -- home missions and migration and refugees.
Q. What issues does the migration and refugees committee deal with?
A. Anything legislatively that concerns immigrants or migrants. We mounted a big lobbying effort about cuts to legal immigrants. Since the cuts were made, there has been a constant effort to get legal immigrants covered at least by food stamps. We work very hard to show that the image of the immigrant shouldn't be a negative one.
We have counselors for refugees and migrants throughout the U.S. We have a ministry for truckers, people on the move, gypsies. We have coordinators that work with many different communities -- the Vietnamese, the Hmongs, the Chinese, the Koreans, the myriad Spanish-speaking countries, Brazil.
Q. What issue concerns you most in Connecticut?
A. I was very concerned about welfare reform. The bishops of Connecticut worked hard to make sure that what was supposed to be reform wasn't a disaster.
The A.F.D.C. grant is gone now, and in its place there is a 21-month period maximum. We're a watchdog on that, to see how poor people's lives are being affected.
Q. You have spoken out against physician-assisted suicide. Why shouldn't someone suffering from a painful, terminal illness have the right to assistance in ending his or her life?
A. Tough cases make bad law. Do we make law because of a few extremely difficult cases? A woman whose husband has abused her for years finally shoots him. Perhaps she was justified. But does society make a law saying that under these circumstances a wife may kill her husband? Hospice care givers say that the terminally ill and those in pain want pain control and to be surrounded by family or others who will support them in the dying process.
It's a slippery slope. Once you start, what happens? A very powerful point is the intrusion into the consciousness of people, especially the frail elderly. One can imagine an elderly mother saying to herself, "Do they want me to ask for euthanasia now?" when she sees the family come in and knows that they're angry because their inheritance is being dissipated. And no society should ever let that happen to people.
The American Medical Association is opposed to it. The doctor wants to be seen as a healing person. But now, if I get old, and here comes the doctor; what does that mean?
Q. In January, you were one of a group of 54 bishops who called for an end to sanctions against Iraq. Why do you favor an end to sanctions?
A. We have a large body of Catholic social teaching and ethics. People have basic rights -- to life, food, clothing, shelter, basic education, medical care and a job. If sanctions are imposed, then the basic needs of people somehow have to be assured. In this case they are not. A million people have died as a result. UNESCO says that every month 4,500 children die of malnutrition. There's no potable water outside of Baghdad.
Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit went over to Baghdad with a group and they talked to Church leaders. There is a sizable Catholic community there too, the Caldeans. They're very upset about the lack of food and medicine. Some of us undertook a fast. Several times I woke up very hungry at night. I could have eaten if I had wished to, but the Iraqi children can't.
Since that time, there was the whole question of military intervention. My position is to make sure that all diplomatic means have been exhausted, because the people have already suffered too much.
Q. What is your position on women in the priesthood?
A. If you want to talk about women in ministry, as a bishop of the church I have to be obedient to the Pope. But separate from the ordination question is the number of women in ministerial roles in the Catholic Church that we never saw 35 years ago -- in hospitals, in prisons, and as campus ministers. There are women who work full time in many parishes. And some of the priestless parishes now have women administrators. So the people are getting used to this. The involvement of women raises consciousness about the importance of women as they use their many beautiful talents in ministry.
Q. You have been active in promoting cooperation among the different religions. Why is that important?
A. If we worship God, we should work together for the common good. I like to avoid the concept that all religions are the same. But there's a lot of good in each. We're children of the same God.
The other reason is to face down secularism, which is a very prevalent philosophy -- you know, there shouldn't be any kind of rules anywhere. This might be a time of revival -- even that million man Promise Keepers event was very powerful. Most wives would be very happy if their husbands promised to be faithful to them and to spend more time with them and the kids. Maybe there is a fundamentalistic thrust here, but so what? Maybe we're heading for a time of revival now in the face of blatant secularism.
Q. There are people who believe they are living spiritual, moral lives outside of organized religion. What do you say to them?
A. Fine. But I wonder how long people can continue to live that kind of life without the sustenance of a community of faith.
All religions are communitarian religions. They were always communities. People got together to listen to God's word. The values were held by tradition. As the years go on, as we've seen in the last 25 years, you have an invasion of other thinking, and so values often dissipate.
There are exceptions. For example, persons who are not members of any organized religion but are very generous with time and talent and are prayerful. There are also some atheists who are very principled. Organized religion at least is a help to a lot of people, including myself. To listen to God's word, to be confronted by it day in and day out, to try to live it in such ways that I do put God first, to love my neighbor as myself. That is not easy.
Q. What challenges face the Catholic Church as we enter the next millennium?
A. No. 1 is lack of clergy -- because the priesthood is limited to celibate males. In the archdiocese, we're going to need 50 priests within the next five years because of retirement. This year we'll ordain 5. Our average age is 59. There are some dioceses where things are worse. The indifference of a lot of young people to religion is another challenge, though they're not indifferent to God. I can see it in the students in the National Catholic Student Coalition. One notices a deep spirituality in many students.

HEADLINE: In an Anniversary Year, Quest for Land Heats Up

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
The youngish couple were strutting along the matted-down carpet of leaves that rolled through the woods beyond the house they had just bought. Yes, strutting. They were marveling at the turn their lives had taken: the deal, the house, the pool, the ocean a bike ride away, the woods as fresh and as fine as when Indians padded along trails like this one. Even the birds: happy, fluttery creatures with small red and yellow stripes on their blue-black wings.
Flying rep ties, the wife said. The husband laughed. 
 Their Sunday afternoon reverie lasted a few hundred yards. The trail ended at a freshly paved cul-de-sac where they could smell the tar, or so it seemed, and they could see the bright red fire hydrant. Above their heads, signs had been nailed to the trees: Lot 21, Lot 22. They spent the rest of the weekend in a panic that their view would be ruined by new houses.
Oh, the things people worry about on eastern Long Island when the midafternoon fog rolls in, creeping across what used to be potato fields, crossing what began as unpaved colonial-era thoroughfares. These roads are now dotted by restaurants that stay open almost all year, a sign that the "season" keeps getting longer. For in this year of anniversaries, when East Hampton celebrates its 350th, and Montauk the centennial of Theodore Roosevelt's encampment there at the end of the Spanish-American War, the real estate broker's mantra of location, location, location has given way to something more basic: land, land, land.
Indeed, land is to eastern Long Island what earthquakes are to California and tsunami are to Hawaii: the subtext of everyday conversation, if not every conversation. This is the case on streets whose residents' names appear in bold-faced type in the newspapers: the road in East Hampton where the fashion designer Donna Karan and the rap impresario Sean (Puff Daddy) Combes have houses -- she two, he one. And there is the block where the life style doyenne Martha Stewart and the real estate developer Harry Macklowe have taken their backyard border war to court. Centuries ago, neighbors who could not agree on where one's land ended and the other's began had muskets. Now they have lawyers.
Sorry, glitterati (and literati), but eastern Long Island is more obsessed with land than with celebrity, and that has led to a peculiar conversational shorthand: "one point two" is money, not miles. "Routinely I get inquiries for $1 million, $1.2 million," said a man who bought a five-bedroom, four-bath house on one acre south of the Montauk Highway for $175,000 in 1978 and now, sounding somewhat sheepish about his good fortune, did not want to be identified. "To me, that's astonishing. I bought it because I liked the house. It was significant money to me, but still. If I didn't have this house, I couldn't buy this house, even though I have more money now. A million-two would be too much of a stretch."
Yet much as he loves his house, this man understands that its bankability, its appeal to would-be buyers, is not its architectural charm but the little acre beneath it. He explained: "Ten years ago, I said to the guy who handles my insurance, 'do I have enough insurance on my house?' He said: 'Don't worry about it; your house could burn down tomorrow. The land is what the real value is.' "
It is difficult not to encounter others who say much the same -- just take a random Sunday afternoon walk along a beach on the South Fork, where sea birds race-walk along the sand, and the waves look like churning lace. Peggy Sheehan, a Manhattanite who was visiting friends in Sagaponack, lamented that there are "fewer and fewer fields and more and more houses." The ultramodern houses overlooking the beach? "They've been there so long, I kind of accept them," she said.
And the beach itself? "The beach is narrower, but they tell me it will come back by summer," she said. "I know it was wider than this last summer."
And her dog, a 6-year-old Maltese? "Sophie is like a toxic waste dump every summer," Ms. Sheehan said, reciting a litany of shampoos and rinses, fleas and collars and oils. Two summers ago, when she rented a house near Gardiner's Bay in East Hampton, she and Sophie dashed off to the beach for a quick, early-in-the-season romp. "Sophie got six ticks stuck to her, including one on her eyelid," Ms. Sheehan said.
Whine, whine, whine: there is an uneasiness on eastern Long Island, a sense that the city worries people came to escape are catching up. Like the erosion that shrinks backyards by the water, the process is subtle, not something dramatic and instantly noticeable. It is subtler than the Gatsbyesque gossip of outsized deals and oversized blueprints, which inevitably leads to some mention of the 29-bedroom house with the 20-car garage that conforms to zoning regulations. (If you're going to have a 53,000-square-foot house, you need a garage that large, don't you?)
And then there are the complaints about traffic and tank-sized Mercedeses that go roaring by: just try making a left turn on 27. (Some call it the Montauk Highway, but others spit out just the number: "27," the way they call another much complained-about highway, the Long Island Expressway, "495.")
There are also the fears that the distinct identities of individual communities are being blurred. Old-money Southampton used to be proud that it was not nouveau-everything, like parts of East Hampton. The areas were as different from each other as rural Sagaponack was from Sag Harbor. Now, fast-track houses are appearing almost everywhere.
Some longtime residents speculate that the tangle of power lines, telephone poles, flat residential streets and magazine-quality houses originated with land purchases made years ago. The boom may be a sign of pent-up demand, with much of the hammering and sawing taking place on plots developers bought earlier and held onto during the recession after the 1987 and 1988 stock market plunges.
In other words, the anxiety comes down to land, land, land. It is true that zoning is tighter in many parts of eastern Long Island. It is also true that more acreage than ever has been protected from real-estate development, thanks to easements and other long-term arrangements worked out by organizations that promote land conservation, including the Nature Conservancy, the Peconic Land Trust and the Group for the South Fork.
Still, the real-estate columns in local newspapers are filled with megabuck transfers -- every week, the prices seem higher. The pressure to sell has land-preservation advocates worried that without open spaces and scenic places, there will be no tourism, no recreational economy.
"We really depend on recreation and tourism," said Marcia Kenny of the Peconic Land Trust, a nonprofit group that has arranged to protect 2,500 acres since the mid-1980's. "Once there's nothing left, nobody's going to want to come out here because it's not going to be pretty and charming and restful."
Some fun seekers complain that it already isn't. Vincent Manzo, who first encountered East Hampton in the early 1980's, when he was in his 20's, talks of "this Riviera feeling," which he says has disappeared.
"I felt glamorous and young and rich," said Mr. Manzo, who now runs a store in East Hampton that sells vintage goods, from furniture to housewares. "Well, I was young. We'd end up at Calvin Klein's house. Steve Rubell would pull up in a limo. Now it's different. Now it doesn't have that fantasy feel. The New York City vibration is coming out here. They've got to drive with their brights on. They've got to be aggressive. They don't know how to leave all that behind."
The information age has only made things worse, he said as he straightened a $10 stack of red-and-white bread plates ("red and white's getting hotter than blue and white"): fax machines and personal computers have let dashboard-pounding New Yorkers live on eastern Long Island year round.
"The only thing I can compare this to is the California gold rush," Mr. Manzo said. "Carpenters kiss the ground they walk on."
No wonder that Adam Janovic, the scion of a Manhattan paint-store chain, is opening a store in Wainscott this summer. "I don't hold myself out there as a prophet," Mr. Janovic said, "but as long as the stock market stays strong, the Hamptons will stay strong. I'm hoping that will last a couple more years." That is plenty of time for him to do some in-store celebrity watching. "We carry the Ralph Lauren paint and the Martha Stewart paint," he said. "They're both locals. We can sell them back some of their own product."
Historians observe that the transformation of eastern Long Island into a series of second-home communities has been going on for most of the 20th century. How different the weekenders are from the original colonial-era farmers and fishermen, who arrived not over the land from New York City, but across Long Island Sound from Connecticut. This year's 350th anniversary in East Hampton, for example, celebrates the arrival of nine settlers who took possession of 30,000 acres. Nancy Hyden Woodward, an author and Hamptons historian, said that the grant of that land from the colonial governors of Connecticut resulted from a deal with the Montauk Indians for "the whole breadth from sea to sea."
The price was a bit more than what Peter Minuit paid for Manhattan: 20 coats, 24 hoes, 24 hatchets, 24 knives and "24 looking glasses," among other things. The nine named their plantation Maidstone; some had been born in the town of that name in England. But soon they were calling this new place Easthampton, one word.
There was a building boom even then: chimneys rose on 8- to 12-acre parcels. "Invitations to settle in Maidstone are extended to persons who can supply a trade that the town lacks," Miss Woodward writes in her book "East Hampton: A Town and Its People, 1648-1994" (Fireplace Press, 1995). "A carpenter from Weathersfield, Conn., a blacksmith from Huntington and a weaver from Southold accept such offers. For moving to Maidstone, each man is given a home lot, acreage for farming and pasturing and exemption from paying taxes."
But the settlers' lives were hardly worry-free. In April 1649, Indians scalped Phoebe Halsey in the herb garden outside her Southampton home. Lion Gardiner, who lived nearby, volunteered to be a hostage to the local tribe while Wyandanch, the sachem of the Indians on eastern Long Island, journeyed to Southampton. On the way, Wyandanch encountered two Pequots from Connecticut, disguised as Long Island Shinnecocks, whom he quickly determined were Halsey's killers. Miss Woodward writes that Lion Gardiner's reward for his bravery was an invitation to live in East Hampton. Robert David Lion Gardiner, his descendant, lives there still; one of Phoebe Halsey's descendants, John Halsey, heads the Peconic Land Trust.
This year's other anniversary marks the Spanish-American War, when the communication age was already beginning. Miss Woodward reports that word that President William McKinley had signed a war resolution reached East Hampton surprisingly rapidly. A correspondent from The Brooklyn Eagle called the drugstore there less than half an hour after McKinley put his name on the document.
Eastern Long Island was involved in the end of the war: Camp Wikoff in Montauk, where Theodore Roosevelt was photographed in his colonel's uniform of high leather boots and broad-brimmed hat, was set up in four days in August 1898 as the debarkation center for about 25,000 troops. The Army hoped to send them home on the Long Island Rail Road, but about 40 miles of track remained to be laid before their troop ships landed.
Camp Wikoff turned out to be as much a medical center as a military camp: in addition to battlefield wounds, the Army had suffered heavy casualties from diseases like malaria and typhoid. There were contaminated water problems at Montauk, too: healthy solders got sick until several 6,000-gallon railroad tank cars rolled in, carrying fresh supplies.
Later, the head of the Women's National War Relief Association appealed for women in East Hampton to make apple sauce ("a good substitute for butter") and care packages for the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, which were made up of black soldiers who had not been given the kinds of care packages the Rough Riders had received.
"There must be a screw loose somewhere," The East Hampton Star said in an editorial Miss Woodward quotes in her book, "when Uncle Sam's soldiers, backed by a country of unlimited resources, are allowed to starve on transports and compelled to depend on charity for food when they land upon our shores."
Camp Wikoff sent the last troops home in late October. But the transformation was on: the summer people had found a new destination. Now, a couple of generations later, James Brady, the author of last summer's page-turner "Further Lane" (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $22.95) and the forthcoming "Gin Lane," said another transformation was on.
"The acres and acres of potato farms have become 1-acre or 4-acre or 11-acre mini-estates," he said. "There was a real estate photograph in the newspaper 10 days ago that showed a house on Further Lane from the air on an 11- or 12-acre plot that is up for sale for $19 million."
Still, Mr. Brady said that all the talk about free-spending celebrities in the Hamptons may be just talk: privacy is still possible. "Steven Spielberg is out there," he said, "but I have never in all of those years seen him. I have seen Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger once in the grocery store, in Dreesen's, the famous place where they make the doughnuts. I used to see Jann Wenner a lot because he rode a motorcycle. Bruce Wasserstein lives on Further Lane. I don't know what Bruce Wasserstein looks like. I know who he is." (Mr. Wasserstein is an investment banker and takeover specialist.)
At least, Mr. Brady said, Further Lane has not been cursed with Hollywood-style tour buses cruising past homes of the rich and famous, "with the guy on the loudspeaker saying, 'Here's the writer James Brady's house. That's Mr. Brady pulling weeds.' "
Yet.

Hamptons Old Hat? Try a Nassau Summer Rental

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
TIRED of coping with traffic jams on roads leading to the Hamptons, some city dwellers looking for a summer getaway are renting houses much closer to home -- in the bedroom communities of Nassau County, a short commute from midtown Manhattan.
What they are finding on the North Shore is a rural countryside criss-crossed by quiet roads and still dotted with horse farms and vegetable stands and large estates that add to the feeling of seclusion and privacy. 
 Moreover, residents have access to beaches that either are town-owned or are maintained by incorporated villages and homeowners' associations. And because the beaches are on Long Island Sound, many have docking for boats.
While the South Shore is more congested, renters can find houses there within a few minutes' walk of ocean beaches in communities that are less than an hour from Manhattan by train.
Unlike many houses in the Hamptons that are purchased as investments to be rented out, houses available for rent in Nassau tend to be the permanent residences of owners who either have vacation houses elsewhere or who travel. Rentals run the gamut from co-ops and condominiums to mansions.
An investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity said he used to rent in the Hamptons, but now rents on the North Shore for several reasons.
"The commute is a lot shorter, but the biggest issue for me is that I really prefer the relaxed atmosphere and the privacy of the North Shore to the hype of the Hamptons," he said. "The Hamptons are a lot more glamorous, for sure, but what's the point of having all that summer entertainment if you can't get a reservation in a restaurant?"
Brokers say that because the popularity of summer rentals on the North Shore has been growing, their main problem is finding houses for their customers. Most have only a handful of listings available.
Adding to the demand are families who rent a house for the summer because they want to become familiar with the area before purchasing a house, said Jean Mansueto, the owner of Century 21 Coast in Bayville.
The healthy economy has also helped the market.
"Last year, customers started calling me in March and April for rental properties," said Lori A. Grafstein, an associate broker who is in charge of the rental department at the Douglas Elliman-Jane Hayes brokerage in Locust Valley. "For this year they started calling right after Christmas and I haven't had that much to show them,"
And rents are up 20 percent over what they were a year ago, she said. A house that last year rented for $12,000 a month is now $15,000 a month, she said.
Still, Nassau rents are still much lower than those in the Hamptons, brokers say.
Typical of houses Mrs. Grafstein rented for this summer is a seven-bedroom, six-and-a-half bath contemporary in Lattingtown priced at $15,500 a month from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
The nine-year-old house, which is on four acres, has an indoor racquetball court, a new pool and a new tennis court. In addition, as town residents, the tenants have the right to use local beaches and public golf courses. Many of her customers already belong to private country clubs on the North Shore, Mrs. Grafstein said, which is another reason that the idea of having a house there is so appealing.
Among houses she still has available is a 24-room estate in Centre Island with a private beach, sweeping views of Long Island Sound, a pool and a deep-water dock. It even has a helicopter landing pad. The flying time to Manhattan is 12 minutes. By car, the city is about an hour away. The rent, which includes maintenance of the grounds but no utilities, is $37,500 a month for the summer season.
On the same 35-acre gated estate as the mansion are seven smaller residences ranging in size from two to four bedrooms with rents of $4,500 to $12,000 a month.
THE smallest, a two-bedroom, one-bath cottage renting for $4,500, is one of two still available. Though rustic, it has a very private setting surrounded by lawns with unobstructed water views. The lawn leads down to a private cove. The house shares two tennis courts with the other rental houses.
Mrs. Grafstein's other properties include a four-bedroom, two-bath contemporary in Lattingtown, overlooking a golf course, which is available for August for $7,000. Another is a six-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath turn-of-the century Victorian on two acres in Laurel Hollow, which is available for $10,000 a month.
Margaret Faughnan, the owner of the Laurel Hollow house, who is a Manhattan real estate broker, said she and her husband, Henry, are renting the home, which they have owned 26 years, because they plan to spend the summer in Europe.
The house is a five-minute drive from a private beach with docking for boats and it is a mile from the Long Island Rail Road Station in Syosset; the trip to Manhattan takes 50 minutes. Yet riding trails are across the street, and the house has a paddock where horses can be kept, Mrs. Faughnan said.
"We have so many calls coming in from people who don't want to do the Hamptons any more because of the crowds and the Sunday night traffic," said Vera J. Wiedenhaefer, a broker with the Daniel Gale agency in East Norwich. "So they are coming to this area, preferably to a place near the water. Oyster Bay Cove, Cove Neck, Cove Spring and Laurel Hollow are very popular."
One of the houses she is showing is a 34-year-old colonial in Cove Neck with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, a library and a family room. All the rooms have water views. The house is available for $60,000 for the season. The property includes a pool, a tennis court, a private beach and a dock.
Another house, this one listed by Connie Kelly, who is in charge of the rental department at the same Daniel Gale agency, is a restored three-bedroom, two-and-a-half barn in Laurel Hollow in a secluded setting near the beach. It is available, but only for August, for $6,000, and it is her only current listing, Mrs. Kelly said.
Brokers say that because so few houses come on the market just for the summer, tenants sometimes rent them year-round at a much reduced monthly rent, and use them on weekends as well. The Laurel Hollow barn, for example, is available year-round for $2,600 a month.
Although year-round rentals are seldom furnished, furnishings can be rented through companies like International Furniture Rentals in Jericho, which charges about $400 to $800 a month for furniture for a four-bedroom house, with the price dependent on the length of stay.
Summer renters are often required to pay as much as one month's rent for security. The minimum security is usually $5,000. Tenants also pay all utilities and the broker's fee, which can amount to 10 percent of the total rental amount. Landlords usually provide a landscaping service, but monthly pool maintenance is often left up to the tenant. The full summer's rent is paid before the tenant moves in.
Summer rentals are more plentiful in Long Beach and other resort areas on the South Shore where condominiums and co-op apartments in oceanfront buildings also become available.
Like their counterparts on the North Shore, many of the homeowners are not professional landlords. They usually rent out their houses or their apartments because they live elsewhere during the summer season.
For example, Georgeann and Noel Corpuel, who own a three-bedroom, three-bath colonial in Lido Beach, run a children's camp in Pennsylvania, so they are away all summer.
"Since we are never here, we decided that renting our house for the summer would give us some nice income, and we've been doing that for 25 years," Mrs. Corpuel said. "In all that time, we have had only one bad experience." The house rents for $15,000 for the season and they already have a tenant.
Prices in Long Beach and its neighboring towns start at $8,000 for the summer season for small two- and three-bedroom cottages on the city's west end and range up to about $25,000 for the season for a three- to four-bedroom house, said Richard B. Nunziata, the manager of the Century 21 Petrey brokerage in Long Beach.
Typical of his listings is a four-bedroom, two-bath house in Point Lookout, which is two blocks from the beach. It rents for $20,000 for the season. A two-bedroom, one-bath house in Long Beach, on a canal with docking for a boat, can be rented for $24,000. And a one-bedroom, one-and-half-bath duplex condominium apartment with two terraces overlooking the ocean is available for $18,000.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Giving a Suburban Sprawl a Sense of Community

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
LIKE other developing suburbs in New Jersey, Washington Township in Mercer County is a sprawling community with a patchwork of tract houses and a highway shopping strip, but no communal heart.
"We do not have a center point, a place people can go to meet or congregate," said Glen E. Beebe, a 10-year resident who is the township's Mayor. 
 Determined to change that, local officials are advancing a plan, adopted last year, to bring that slice of traditional small-town America, the town center, to suburbia. The plan outlines a mixed-use development within walking distance of businesses, a community in which home buyers can choose from residences of many styles and prices.
In the process they hope that the plan -- the result of 12 years of discussions and negotiations with landowners, developers and government agencies -- will turn the tables on suburban sprawl, preserve open space and give their township not only an identity distinct from its neighbors, but, said Mayor Beebe, a sense of community as well.
The new town center will eventually contain up to 250,000 square feet of retail space and professional offices and up to 1,350 residences -- from town houses and rental apartments to duplex houses and detached homes -- spread over 330 acres in the western sector of this 20-square-mile community of 8,500 residents. It is to be developed at an estimated cost of $250 million over the next 10 to 15 years.
Two builders have already committed to the project. One is Sharbell Development Corporation of Hamilton Township, which has been working with Washington Township officials on the plan for the last five years. The other is Westminster Properties, the new construction arm of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, which came aboard in the last year. Principals of both companies said they expected to begin construction by the end of this year or early in 1999.
The plan also calls for bike lanes, public squares, a major anchor attraction such as a theater for live performances -- to keep the communal center lively at night -- and a greenbelt around three-quarters of the development area, bordered on the east by Route 130 and bisected by Route 33. The township's municipal complex already sits along Route 130 on the eastern edge of the area, and there is a shopping strip on the western edge.
The local middle school stands just outside the town center. Within it is Robbinsville -- with Windsor one of two historic cores around which the township grew up during its early days as a farming community. Those agrarian roots, which are still present today (6,000 of the township's 13,000 acres are farmland or open space), are what the town-center plan will help to preserve.
All of this, said Robert F. Melvin, the township's director of planning, will be accomplished in ways that strive to make growth an equal partner with preservation. When the town center project is completed the hope is "that grandparents will live on the same block as their grandchildren," he said.
To achieve a visual sense of nostalgia the homes will be in traditional styles popular between 1890 to 1930, with design principles that call for, among other things, such evocations of the past as front porches. The houses will sit on 2,000- to 7,000-square-foot lots. While prices have not yet been set, they are expected to be $150,000 to $300,000 for individual homes, said Mr. Melvin.
The rental apartments -- the number and rents have not been determined -- will be above the stores. So that the development becomes part of the entire community, there will be no gate, homeowners' association or even a name for the development, he added.
That Washington Township took the lead on the project, rather than a developer, which traditionally has been the case, makes it distinct in New Jersey, industry professionals said. It is also significant, they added, because it breathes life into the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan.
The state plan encourages growth in established areas where sewers, highways and mass transit links are available. In less developed areas where those facilities are lacking, the plan tries to manage growth by encouraging mixed-use and compact development such as in designated town centers. Last month Washington Township became a designated town center, making it one of 36 in the state, but the only one that is basically being built from scratch.
State agencies give priority for approvals and financing for physical plant improvements to designated centers because they are in compliance with the state plan, which Mr. Melvin said would be helpful "in taking the plan to the next level." That level includes making the improvements necessary to accommodate the project, he said.
THE Office of State Planning calls Washington Township's town-center plan a model. "In terms of suburban development it shows that the state plan is not just rhetoric, but that it really works," said Herb Simmens, executive director of the semiautonmous agency, which is the staff arm for the State Planning Commission.
The town-center plan also won the community development award last year from the Middlesex Somerset Mercer Regional Council, a nonprofit planning organization in central New Jersey.
"We have been promoting the concept of town centers since the mid-80's as a vision for a different future," said Jon A. Carnegie, the group's vice president of planning. "Essentially, it rearranges growth in a different land pattern."
If there is no change to the familiar development pattern of subdivisions and shopping centers the region, like the state, "will see the same old sprawl" and more traffic that potentially could choke off growth, he said. Those concerns are what prompted Washington Township to pursue the town-center plan as an alternative to sprawl. Through the proper arrangement and design of public spaces and buildings, the township "is better able to accept growth while creating a sense of community character," Mr. Melvin said.
As such, the new town center reflects the principles of neotraditionalism, also called the New Urbanism, which says that walkable streets, attractive public spaces and a close-by town center can help define a community. One of the largest such communities is Celebration, the enclave that Disney is creating on a former cow pasture in Orlando, Fla. Eventually it will contain 8,000 homes.
Getting to this point has not been easy because to a large degree their plan preceded the state plan, Mr. Melvin said, adding that the recession also slowed progress. Now all the people involved -- from the developers to every level of government -- "are rowing in the same direction," he said.
How home buyers will respond to the concept remains to be seen. But the developers involved with the town-center plan are betting it will catch on.
Jeffrey Freireich, a principal of the Kushner Companies, said his concern became involved with the town center project because "the concept is exciting, different." He also said that the township's central location, including access to Interstates 95 and 195 and Route 130, was a plus. "And the approval process goes faster, because you're not fighting with the town," said Mr. Freireich.
As now planned, Kushner will build up to 275 residences and 50,000 square feet of commercial space. Construction is to start in 1999.
"Our position is to create a competitively priced alternative to conventional suburban subdivision," said Thomas Troy, senior vice president of Sharbell Development, "and in that context this plan makes a lot of sense."
Mr. Troy said his company still had a "bit of reluctance because we don't control our own destiny." But, he added, the plan "is an opportunity" to do business in Washington Township "versus other towns that throw up a brick wall of no development."
Under the plan Sharbell can build some 550 homes and 170,000 square feet of commercial Space. Mr. Troy said he expected to present plans for 110 initial homes by this fall, start pre-construction sales in the next nine to 12 months and then begin construction.
"It is not for everyone," Mr. Troy said of the town center plan. "But there will be enough buyers who recognize the appeal of living in place with neighborhoods and a sense of community."

Blocked in Stamford, Cendant to Move to Wilton

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
THE Cendant Corporation's decision last month to move from here to Wilton shows the level of maturity that the Stamford office market has reached. With a vacancy rate of around 6 percent, the city cannot accommodate companies that need to expand.
"Space here is tight," said Robin Stein, director of land use planning for the city. "No buildings have any significant empty spaces." 
 Cendant is the name adopted last year by CUC International of Stamford and HFS Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., following their merger. Among other things, the merged company is a franchiser of hotels and real estate brokerages and owns brands such as Avis, Days Inn and Ramada Inn and Coldwell Banker real estate brokerages.
Since 1981 Cendant and its predecessor have been renting space in Stamford. The company has a total of 143,000 square feet scattered through four Summer Street buildings owned by four different landlords.
In an effort to consolidate by building a 440,000-square-foot office complex on 28 acres off Long Ridge Road in Stamford, Cendant applied for a zone change from residential to commercial in 1997. But the plan was strongly opposed at public hearings and rejected by Stamford's Planning and Zoning Board last May.
"I think Cendant's attempt to change the zoning was ill-advised," said Mayor Dannel Malloy, "and led to some hard feelings on their part, so they took their plans elsewhere. Stamford is not a major campus setting. We don't have locations for that. We're sorry to see Cendant go, but we win more than we lose and many of the 500 to 600 jobs involved will be retained by local residents."
Kip Bergstrom, Stamford's Director of Economic Development, noted that it had been a "longstanding policy of the city to locate development downtown."
"That comes at a price occasionally," he said. "When the planning board made the decision it knew that Cendant would leave the city. But it's part of Stamford's function to be for the rest of Connecticut what New York has been for Stamford -- a means of capturing jobs and, after a period of 10 to 20 years, passing them on to outlying towns like Shelton, Trumbull and now Wilton."
Notwithstanding the buoyant attitudes of developers who are building and quickly renting up speculative office buildings in outlying towns, developers of the two prime downtown Stamford locations are not prepared to follow suit.
"We don't believe that in the 90's it's prudent to build on spec," said Scott Toombs, head of Toombs Development Company in New Canaan. He owns the vacant four-acre tract called Parcel 38 behind the Stamford Town Center mall. Nicknamed "the hole in the ground" because Mr. Toombs has excavated the tract in anticipation of construction, it has stood empty for two years waiting for an anchor tenant.
"Tenants are watching their cost factors," Mr. Toombs said, "so I don't think it's smart to pay so much for money that rents have to be higher." He was referring to the fact that construction loans on speculative buildings are higher than those for new buildings that are preleased. According to Mr. Bergstrom, rents approaching the mid-$30's per square foot in Stamford are still a bargain compared to $50 a square foot in midtown Manhattan.
The other prime downtown property, at Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard, is owned by Hines Interests L.P. Plans for a 480,000-square-foot office tower designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill have received the required municipal approvals. What is lacking is a major tenant. "We are encouraged by the continued strengthening of the market and hopeful about a tenant," said Thomas M. Craig, senior vice president of the Houston-based company.
But the Louis Dreyfus Property Group, the real estate arm of S.A. Dreyfus & Cie in Paris and developer of Cendant's new home in Wilton, has broken ranks with its more conservative counterparts here. It will proceed with construction of a speculative building designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill on Washington Boulevard, opposite Swiss Bank's new Stamford headquarters.
With a minor change in zoning regulations Louis Dreyfus -- whose parent deals in commodities, among other things -- can build up to 500,000 square feet in 25 stories. "We will start as soon as we have our approvals," said Jeffrey I. Sussman, president of Louis Dreyfus, "and we will go for the maximum space. We believe that there are one or two large users seeking up to 400,000 square feet." Groundbreaking is targeted for the fall.
"I don't think Stamford had reached saturation," Mr. Sussman said. "It will definitely be a growth market for quite some time -- not just from the exodus from New York, but from tenants in Greenwich where restrictions on the size of buildings force tenants to look elswhere for more space."
For the last 10 years, Louis Dreyfus has maintained its American headquarters in Wilton, sharing a 200,000-square-foot office building on a 57-acre tract with two tenants -- the world headquarters of Deloitte & Touche accountants and CSC Weston Group, a marketing and consulting firm.
In 1990, plans by Dreyfus had been approved for two additional office buildings on the same tract totaling 323,186 square feet, plus an additional 13,778 square feet for a cafeteria, fitness center and structured parking, according to Wendy Johnson, planning director for Wilton. She said all approvals were valid for 10 years.
AT the time the Cendant deal presented itself, said Mr. Sussman, "we were in the process of making a decision to build without a commitment and probably would have gone ahead with one building."
"We certainly had enough interest," he said. "We consider ourselves a small to mid-size company and since we can't purchase existing buildings in competition with the REIT's, we must make money by going the value-added route -- develop, build, lease and manage." Louis Dreyfus owns and manages more than 3 million square feet of office space in Europe and North America, and has approvals for constructing 1.4 million square feet more in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, and 2 million square feet here and abroad. Its partner in this and other projects is Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund II.
The Wilton site, 10 Westport Road, is on Route 33, just off the junction with Route 7. A long entrance driveway becomes a winding road lined with stately trees and leading past woods, dry stone walls, rocky outcroppings, a large pond and a meadow where Canada geese and their spring hatchlings forage for food. The existing building, designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates of Hamden, also designers of the Cendant project, is surrounded by plantings of specimen trees, shrubs and flowers.
The two new buildings of 156,000 square feet each, costing a total of $70 million, will be joined by an enclosed connector and called 20 Westport Road. Cendant expects to take 100,000 square feet in each building and Dreyfus will lease out the rest.
Cendant's recent problems with accounting irregularities in some of its units sent its 1997 earnings down by $100 million to $115 million, resulting in a precipitate drop in its stock price and a number of management changes. But the episode is not expected to affect its plans in Wilton.
"We are a very strong company with very strong cash flow," said Eliot Bloom, spokesman for real estate at Cendant. "We just acquired National Parking Corporation in Great Britain for $1.3 billion."

HEADLINE: Adieu, My Beloved House, I Knew It Well

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
WHAT I remember most about the December 1979 afternoon that I went to closing on a three-bedroom ranch in the pine woods outside Sag Harbor was the alternating sense of excitement and dread I felt.
In the late 1970's it was rare for a single woman to buy property on her own. Banks routinely discriminated in their lending policies, making mortgages tough for women to obtain. Moreover, the entire emotional landscape of home ownership seemed linked to marriage and couplehood. Wasn't it men ---husbands, boyfriends -- who had an almost genetic understanding of carpentry and plumbing? Didn't one need four sets of hands and two stable incomes to keep home and acreage from turning to rot? 
 I, Claudia Dreifus, was a city-bred divorced journalist, deeply ignorant of lawn seed and electric wiring. I longed for a place where I could write, cook, hike and bike -- and not answer to anyone for it. But I feared the responsibility. At the house closing, I kept hearing the voice of my dead father, Henry H. Dreifus, a lifelong socialist, whispering, "Property is theft -- property is theft." What on earth was I getting myself into?
A lot of fun, it turned out. At least, at first. Decorating the place with yard-sale odds and ends was a kick. Once the gray-shingled ranch was furnished, I gave it a name -- "Mandalay" -- after the grand mansion in Daphne Du Maurier's "Rebecca." Next I bought myself an electric drill and a book called "The You Don't Need a Man to Fix It."
Also: I learned about bird watching. I purchased hiking boots -- and investigated the flora and fauna of the undeveloped forest behind my house. I bought a car, a blue Toyota, and swore I'd learn how to drive it -- though I never did. And yes, this city kid planted the beginnings of a garden. Sunday mornings, I'd dig around the soil in front of the house humming the theme song from the film, "Exodus."This land is mine, God gave this land to me.
On the downside, one didn't have to be on the East End long before running into the class war between the local merchants and the weekend homeowners from New York. Property may have been "theft," as my socialist father claimed, but in the Hamptons it was property owners who were stolen from.
During my first Hampton years, a large number of my business contacts involved -- um, how to put it? -- deception: padded grocery bills; insurance coverage that was nothing like what the broker said it was; a phony repair on my water-well; billing for yard work that was never done, endless charges for goods and services never rendered.
And what could a busy person do? Spend the weekend fighting these genial crooks? Waste a midweek navigating the Suffolk County court system? If you didn't want to negate the whole reason for owning a country house -- relaxation -- you shut up and moved on.
Or you grumbled. At posh Hampton dinner parties, the main topic was usually thieving contractors. At East End brunches you'd meet best-selling authors obsessing about their plumbing bills. The name of a great carpenter -- and I eventually had one, Yves LePine of Noyac -- was a prized secret shared only with closest friends.
I should have known this -- but in the country, the outside grows. This insight came to me when a friend guesting at my dacha reported a flood of water streaming out the toilet. A $1,200 plumber's house call netted this astonishing diagnosis: vines from the forest were eating the sewer pipes. Indeed, if one didn't apply a little judicious Agent Orange, the forest was likely to creep up and envelope the entire homestead.
Vines from the woods grew like mutants from a horror movie -- as did colonies of carpenter ants, who snacked on my wooden deck, forcing me to replace it repeatedly. Indeed, the only thing that didn't grow at Mandalay was the front lawn, which was as bald as Kojack's head and the shame of the neighborhood.
In the 1980's my jouralistic career took a sharp turn. I began working on stories that took me to far-flung places throughout the U.S.A. and also abroad. The more I traveled, the more of a burden the house became. I hated being in bad-phone countries like Nicaragua, Chile and South Africa, and ringing up East End real-estate agents or plumbers with house emergencies.
After a while, with my new stepped-up work life pressing, and with travels, renting out the house began began to make economic sense. But putting the house up for rent was a serious life-experience.
For a small deposit, this landlord was lending tenants thousands of dollars worth of house, antiques and appliances. Anything could go wrong. The most astounding things did. One year there was a famous tennis pro who took the place and let his cat use it as a urinal. Another summer, a horsewoman left me fleas. There were tenants who didn't like my tchotchkes and tossed them out. There were others who liked them very much and took them home.
One winter I let the house to a man with immpecable references (Pierre Franey and Joseph Heller). References or not, this gentlemen was so spooky that my Sag Harbor neighbors were soon wondering if he wasn't the serial rapist then terrifying Long Island. My tenant man wasn't a rapist; he was just weird. After he had vacated the place, I found huge black footprints on the master bedroom ceiling. How the footprints got up there is an interesting question.
More positively, two babies were conceived by summer tenants at Mandalay. A terrific book -- Samuel G. Freedman's "Upon This Rock" -- was written there.
And I did get to use the place periodically -- including full time for a delicious two-year period where I got a lot of writing done.
I'm not sure exactly when I decided to sell my little dacha. It might have been three years ago when I was dashing off to Myanmar, formerly Burma, while worrying about some leaking pipes. More likely, it was after I returned from Asia and saw that most of the forest behind the house had been cut down, replaced by a row of ultra-tacky vacation homes. This wasn't the worst ecologic atrocity that had happened in the Hamptons. But still, it broke my heart.
When I first moved to the East End, it was a place that mixed social glitz with spectacular natural beauty. In the 1980's one could avoid the glitz; now it overwhelmed and was the whole scene. Camera crews from "Access Hollywood" and "Hard Copy" were all over the towns -- as they searched out Kim Basinger and Billy Joel. One had the feeling that one was living in Beverly Hills East.
Keeping the house going had always been a struggle for me; it no longer seemed worth it. There would be people I'd miss and whom I would probably see less of -- like the Knab family who lived next door and who had taken me in as one of their own and some friends from town: Mary Alice Kellogg, Star Black, David Alpern.
But on the whole, I had come to think of Mandalay as a failed experiment. It turned out that "you do need a man to fix it." Single-home ownership is no wiser than single parenthood -- and pretty much for the same reasons: it is just too big a responsibility for one person, especially a globetrotting one.
The house was sold on Feb. 23 to a young local couple. It's their first home. She works at one of the shops in the Bridgehampton mall and he's a carpenter. At the bank closing, they were giddy with joy to take over Mandalay, a house they may not bother to name. Instead, they are likely to fill it with hand-crafted furnishings and babies -- and that feels rather right.

HEADLINE: Airport Changes Under Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
AVIATION experts say they will never know for sure if approach lights would have made the difference last month when Charles Gunzburg of Jericho, N.Y., apparently missing a runway in fog and driving rain, crashed his single-engine plane into an Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport parking lot and died.
But the crash, on April 19, has restarted the decades-long debate about proposed improvements that would add safety zones to the two runways as well as a sophisticated approach light system at the Stratford airport. 
 The airport, in the Lordship area of Stratford at the edge of Long Island Sound and the Housatonic River, is owned and operated by the city of Bridgeport, which supports a plan for $12 million to $15 million in improvements. (The Federal Aviation Administration would pay 90 percent of the cost, the state 7.5 percent and Bridgeport 2.5 percent.)
"Every time there is a crash there are all these hysterical calls for airport expansion and improvements," said a member of the Stratford Town Council, Susan A. Collier, a Democrat whose district includes the Lordship area. "But each time we get a final report on the crashes from the National Transportation Safety Board we find out that pilot error was the main reason for the crashes. If the airport is unsafe it should be closed down, if not, it should remain the way it is."
Supporters of improvements -- including airport administrators, the F.A.A. and pilots -- say that there have been four crashes on the same runway within the past decade (each time in rain and dense fog) and that the proposed upgrades might have saved some lives. Eight people, including the pilot, were killed in April 1994 when a charter twin-engine plane from Atlantic City struck a steel fence at the end of the runway and burst into flames. Two months earlier a consultant had proposed extending the runway and eliminating the fence.
"For years we have wanted to bring the airport up to current F.A.A. standards for safety and design, but local opposition had kept that from happening and we're still trying to get it done," said Kurt Fendlein, superintendent of operations at Sikorsky. "We still don't know what happened in this latest crash, but approach lights might have made a difference."
Opponents of expanding the airport say that the crashes were all caused at least in part by pilot error and improvements probably would not have prevented them. They also say expansion would be costly and have a negative environmental impact on the Great Meadows Marsh. A proposed rerouting of Main Street to add safety zones would also have a negative impact on the community, opponents say. A study on the environmental impact of airport improvements is to be presented shortly to the Town Council and a town committee studying the issue.
An F.A.A. and Connecticut Department of Transportation report last year recommended creating two 1,000-foot safety zones at the end of the 4,677-foot runways, rerouting Main Street away from the runway where several crashes have occurred, and installing approach lights to help pilots land. The agency stopped short of saying the improvements are crucial or that the airport is unsafe.
"As part of restructuring airport runways, it is our policy to improve areas where they do not now meet the F.A.A. safety standards," said Vincent Scarano, an F.A.A. regional airports division manger in Burlington, Mass. "Part of that process is to add runway safety zones and approach lights. While it is not always possible to achieve these standards and we make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, they are usually preferable."
The Sikorsky Airport manager, John Ricci, has long sought the improvements, arguing that the runways have been the same since 1956 and are not adequate for an airport that serves more than 45,000 passengers a year and is expected to generate more than $80 million a year for the region by the year 2003.
"Airport improvements would not only bring the airport into accordance with F.A.A. safely standards, it would also be good of the region's economy," said Mr. Ricci, who also recently suggested that approach lights might have helped the pilot in last month's crash.
Opponents of expansion say the airport is safe for the twin engine turboprops, which carry between 19 and 47 passengers, and they fear any airport upgrading would lead to larger planes and increased activity in the Lordship area. Some residents say the town would be better off without the airport at all.
"Because the airport is owned and operated by the city of Bridgeport, the town of Stratford doesn't benefit at all from it. We don't get taxes or anything else out of it other than increased traffic and pollution and this never-ending debate," said a Stratford Council member, Patricia A. Kronenberg, a Republican. "I would prefer to see the airport closed and the land given back to the town."
Pilots who use the airport say it provides an economic boost to the Bridgeport region. "The airport is one of the economic engines for the region, and every viable major city has a viable airport that can meet the increasing travel needs of its citizens as we head into the 21st century," said David Faile, a pilot who is president of a group called Friends of Sikorsky Airport. "The improvements are so long overdue it is hard to believe they weren't made years ago."
Neighborhood opponents disagree. "Our position is that we have several nearby airports like Tweed Airport in New Haven, that already have longer runways than Sikorsky, and that there isn't any need to expand or make other changes," said Marcia Stewart, president of Protect Your Environment, which has been fighting airport expansion for 30 years. "Rather than using these crashes to argue for airport expansion, we should be asking why in this latest crash was a pilot unfamiliar with Sikorsky trying to land there during bad weather conditions?" (Mr. Gunzburg, flying alone, was apparently trying to return to his home airport in Farmingdale, N.Y., but because of weather conditions there was directed instead to Sikorsky.) The chairman of the Stratford Town Council, Debbie Rose, a Democrat, said that because the issue has been so divisive for so long she will soon propose another townwide referendum to let the voters, who have rejected expansion before, decide again.

HEADLINE: Closely Guarded Secrets: Some Islands You Can't Get to Visit

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
STANDING on the shores of the East End, you can see across the water to some of Long Island's greatest treasures, tantalizingly close yet forbiddingly inaccessible.
They are privately owned islands, and although just a short boat ride from the main body of Long Island, they are off limits to the public. Visits are held to a handful of guests, by invitation and special arrangement. 
 A mystique as thick as an East End ocean fog envelops the islands, and it is well earned. These islands -- Gardiners, Great Gull, Little Gull, Plum and Robins -- have been the setting of some of Long Island's most exciting historical chapters.
Captain Kidd buried pirate treasure there. One Island woman was tried for witchcraft decades before Salem's trials. Another was so beautiful that she dazzled Washington society, married the President and inadvertently saved his life. And during the cold war, one island was used for secret research for a germ warfare attack on the Soviet Union.
Today, by an odd combination of design and chance, the islands have evolved into land preserves, sanctuaries from the suburban highways, malls and subdivisions that continue to gobble up Long Island's remaining open spaces.
"These island oases near populated resorts are phenomenal," said Sara Davison, executive director of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group that has been in the forefront of the preservation movement. "Especially as more and more people come to the East End, we've got to have" refuges for wildlife.
Naturalists prize the islands, with their coastal cliffs, freshwater ponds and glacial boulders, as home to an abundance of creatures and vegetation. The bounty includes the world's largest tern colony, ospreys with wingspans up to six feet, turkeys, seals, deer, the state's healthiest eastern mud turtle population, tiny voles, one of the biggest stands of white oak in the northeast, swamp maple and beach plums, to name but a few.
Despite their idyllic image, the islands have figured in conflicts dating back to the Indian wars. Disputes over control and use of the islands have prompted court battles among feuding owners and bitter political fights involving preservationists, developers and government officials.
An island is no small financial commitment. Louis Moore Bacon, a reclusive hedge fund manager and currency trading star, paid $12 million for Robins Island in 1994. And the annual cost of taxes and maintenance at Gardiners has been estimated at $2 million. Guests on the islands have included the likes of Dag Hammarskjold and Ernest Hemingway.
Culturally, the islands have inspired naturalist painters and contemporary authors. Nelson DeMille's current best-selling novel "Plum Island," published by Warner, is about a detective investigating the murder of a couple who may have been engaged in germ warfare research. In one passage, the detective describes his arrival on Plum:
"Here I was on a restricted island with this blond SS lookalike, an armed helicopter circling around, armed guards all over the place, and I'm feeling like I somehow stepped into a James Bond movie, except that this place is real. I said, 'When do we meet Dr. No?' "
Steven Gaines devotes a big chunk of his new book, "Philistines at the Hedgerow, Passion and Property in the Hamptons," due next month from Little, Brown & Company, to colorful tales of the Gardiner family, which has occupied its island for 359 years. His book calls the island "a sanctuary not just for wildlife but from the 20th century as well."
Raising the issue of public access during a debate five years ago over what to do about Robins Island, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said the problem was "how you preserve it but allow people to enjoy it without trampling on it."
For Ms. Davison and many other environmentalists, the answer is to keep people away and let them appreciate the vulnerable islands from afar. "I don't think the lack of public access is a big deal," she said. "There are plenty of other places -- parks and preserves -- where people can go."
Outsiders are clearly unwelcome at the private islands, as no-trespassing signs attest. The owners of Gardiners Island have gone so far as to advertise its off-limits status in public notices in The East Hampton Star.
The owners of all the islands are silent about their caretakers and security measures to keep out intruders, although Mr. Gaines's book says that Gardiners Island's "please leave" signs are enforced with shotguns and dogs.
One man rowed ashore at Plum Island and was caught breaking into the abandoned lighthouse, recalled Carlos Santoyo, the assistant director of the Federal Agriculture Department's Animal Disease Center there. Because the man's boat was not very seaworthy and the center was legally responsible for his safety, "we were nice and even took him back, but we told him not to return without permission," said Mr. Santoyo.
Regattas are sometimes held near the islands, and tourist cruises also pass by to view the flourishing seal population, whose varieties include harbor, gray, harp and hooded.
Boaters are free to sail around the islands, of course, and depending on the season, those who stop to fish may be rewarded with fluke, flounder, porgies, bluefish, blackfish, striped bass or weakfish. The waters are also noted for oysters.
For people intent on setting foot on one of the islands, the best bet is Plum Island, which is Government property. For many years, it was the most tightly guarded of the islands, because of the classified work done there. But now the center has occasional tours for outside groups, by arrangement.
Perhaps people are drawn to the islands as much by the lure of the forbidden as by their history and natural beauty. Mr. DeMille, the novelist, recalled how he became interested in Plum Island: "Growing up, I used to see it from boats, and you saw those signs that said: 'No landing.' It always intrigued me."
Today he has mixed feelings about access to the islands. "In one way, I like seeing them go back to nature, but I'd still like to have them opened to people, in a very limited way."
 
GARDINERS ISLAND
With 3,300 acres and 27 miles of coastline, Gardiners Island is said to be the nation's largest privately owned island and oldest family estate.
But after a reign of more than three centuries, the Gardiners are not one big happy family. After prolonged litigation, two feuding relatives have been forced into shared custody of the island, and they alternate their stays to avoid crossing paths.
One is Robert David Lion Gardiner, who proclaims himself the 16th Lord of the Manor. The other is his niece, Alexandra Creel Goelet. In Mr. Gardiner's obsession to control the island's destiny, he once searched out a distant relative in Mississippi and tried to adopt him as a son to inherit the property, but the man declined.
Despite the hostilities between Mr. Gardiner and Mrs. Goelet, both say they are dedicated to preserving the island. They can well afford to do so, although Mr. Gardiner stopped paying his share of the upkeep years ago. Mrs. Goelet recently paid to help preserve the abandoned farm buildings, the oldest dating to 1690. The complex, which once housed slave quarters, includes a windmill.
Historians, naturalists and other academics are sometimes given tours, and when Mr. Gardiner is the guide, he relishes telling the island's stories.
In 1639, the original Lion Gardiner, over six feet tall and red bearded, bought the island from the Montaukett Indians, bartering a large black dog, blankets, a gun, powder and shot for it. Hedging his bets, he also obtained a land grant from King Charles I of England.
The Montaukett tribe's wiley sachem, the legendary Wyandanch, had decided to make allies and trading partners of the English after white soldiers killed hundreds of fierce Pequots in Connecticut.
But the sachem and the Englishman also became dear friends -- some say blood brothers -- especially after an enemy tribe kidnapped Wyandanch's daughter and Gardiner personally arranged her safe return. When Wyandanch died, Gardiner was grief stricken.
Gardiner's daughter was the first child of English descent born in New York. She died as a teen-ager, and in her terminal delirium accused an unpopular local woman, Goody Garlick, of witchery. Soon a tribunal was convened, and others accused her of causing several premature deaths by sorcery.
Lion Gardiner did not believe the charges and had the proceedings moved to Connecticut, where she was acquitted. By some accounts, she returned to Gardiners Island to live out her years.
Late in the 1600's, Capt. William Kidd, a privateer who had been declared a pirate, landed on the island to bury his plunder of gold and jewelry, then turned himself in and sought to clear his name.
The authorities ordered the Gardiners to return the treasure, which they did, except for one large diamond, or so the story goes. In London, Captain Kidd was convicted of murder and was hanged twice, the second time because the rope broke the first time.
Perhaps the most colorful of the Gardiners was Julia, whose looks and charm earned her the description the Rose of Long Island. Overseas, she broke the hearts of an English nobleman and an Italian prince. That was just a rehearsal for her assault on Washington, where she dated two Congressmen and three Supreme Court justices, among others, while in her 20's.
Invited to a White House party, she proceeded to captivate President John Tyler, a widower. One account said that "by evening's end, the President, 30 years her senior, was chasing Julia down the stairs and around tables."
Julia's mother frowned on the President's courting, because he was not rich enough for a Gardiner. In 1844 the Gardiners were invited to the ceremonial firing of a large gun, the Peacemaker, on a Navy ship. Unfortunately it exploded, killing the Secretaries of State, Treasury and the Navy and Julia's father, a State Senator. She and the President would have been likely victims, too, except that they had slipped below deck for champagne together. Soon after, they wed.
 
GREAT GULL AND LITTLE GULL ISLANDS
These are the smallest of the private islands. Great Gull is a 178-acre sliver of land, and the adjoining Little Gull is a tiny islet, both east of Plum Island.
Thanks to naturalists who restored a habitat that had been destroyed by military fortifications, the Gull Islands are today home to the world's largest tern colony.
In the 1800's, the Federal Government used Little Gull as the site for a lighthouse, and Great Gull was farmed by the lighthouse keeper. In that era, the Gull Islands became a refuge for terns, who were being slaughtered in more accessible locations so that their feathers could be harvested for the millinery trade.
But the terns eventually lost their refuge. In the Spanish-American War, Great Gull was transformed into Fort Michie, which was not abandoned until after World War II.
In 1949 the American Museum of Natural History and the Linnaean Society, a bird-lovers group, bought the property and began enticing terns to return. By 1955, there were 25 pairs. Volunteers began the tradition, still followed today, of counting and banding the birds and checking their nests and eggs.
Today, thousands of pairs nest every year, and the program is so successful that some people have given Gull Islands a nickname: Guano Islands.
Terns are sea swallows distinguished buy their black caps and forked tails. Other birds on the islands include ospreys, double crested cormorants, bald eagles, oyster catchers, mergansers, loons, sandpipers, tufted titmice and song sparrows.
 
PLUM ISLAND
As Government property, Plum Island is not privately owned. But access to it is strictly controlled and it has the tightest security of all the islands. The 105 workers there commute by the Orient Point ferry.
Unlike the secret germ warfare project in the 1950's, the first Federal project on Plum Island was quite open and ordinary. In 1826, the Government belatedly bought 3 of its 800 acres for a lighthouse that had originally been authorized by President George Washington. In 1869 it was replaced by another, which still stands today, more or less. Since the Coast Guard closed the lighthouse in 1978, it has deteriorated, and erosion keeps gnawing at the cliff, which moves ever closer.
About the time of the Spanish-American War, the Government bought the rest of Plum and built Fort Terry as the headquarters for artillery batteries at Montauk and on Gardiners, Great Gull and Fishers Islands. In World War II it was used for training and for arming torpedoes, and then the fort was closed. Boarded-up military buildings, fortification ruins and overgrown gun placements remain, but no guns.
Suffolk County was in the process of buying the island for tourism when Federal officials backed out and converted the site to the Animal Disease Center in 1954. The island was chosen as a safeguard against accidental contamination. Since 1929, the country's only outbreak of the dreaded foot-and-mouth disease was in 1978, when it spread to animals outside the laboratory buildings.
For ecades, officials denied rumors of biological warfare experiments. But in 1993, Newsday unearthed previously classified documents on plans to disrupt the Soviet economy by spreading diseases to kill its pigs, cattle and horses. Most of the diseases studied, like African swine fever and rinderpest, affect only livestock. But one, Rift Valley fever, also occurs in humans.
The warfare plans ended long ago, officials say, and now the laboratory focuses exclusively on preventing diseases. To satisfy their own concerns, Russian scientists inspected the center in 1994.
Although there is no formal conservation program on Plum Island, the laboratory occupies only a small part, leaving the rest untouched. "We don't call it preservation," said the center's assistant director, Mr. Santoyo. "It just happens." Some conservation advocates say that Plum would benefit from an organized program like those on the other islands.
 
ROBINS ISLAND
Robins Island has changed hands many times, from its early Indian inhabitants to the King of England to a series of private owners. A few years ago it was almost bought by Suffolk County and New York State for a public preserve.
Instead, the 435-acre island ended up as the family retreat and hunting domain of a multimillionaire financier, Louis Moore Bacon. He decided to complete a house on the island whose construction had been abandoned by a previous owner, a New York City businessman, when his wife died in 1918.
But otherwise Mr. Bacon appears committed to conservation of his densely wooded isle. He has agreed to restrictions preserving the island forever, and his foundation set aside $1.1 million for the Nature Conservancy to oversee the program and pay for the new job of Peconic Baykeeper to safeguard the surrounding area.
In the island's long and checkered history, King Charles I granted ownership to the Earl of Sterling in 1615. Later it was sold to the Wickham family, but was wrested from their control after the American Revolution because they had sided with the Tories.
After a series of owners used the island as a retreat and for hunting, German investors took over in 1979 through the Southold Development Corporation. Fearing that the island would be built up, Suffolk County tried to buy it for $9 million, and Governor Cuomo agreed to have the state share the cost.
But then another company, Robis Corporation, made a $16 million bid and promised to develop no more than 22 luxury houses on 33 acres, leaving the rest of the island pristine. County Executive Robert Gaffney provoked a political furor by endorsing the Robis plan, which many others attacked. The issue figured in the defeat of one county legislator in the next election.
When Southold Development fell into arrears, litigation abounded and Mr. Bacon emerged at the 11th hour to snap up the island for $12 million in bankruptcy court. Critics were skeptical of his intentions at first, but so far he appears to be true to his word.
Besides the Bacon family's guests, the only visitors allowed onto the island are Nature Conservancy workers and students from the New Suffolk School District.

HEADLINE: A Stage Where the Homeless Star

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
ONE man is in recovery from crack-cocaine addiction. Another recently completed a four-year prison term. A woman struggles with manic depression.
They are all members of New Haven's Homeless Theater Troupe, a collaboration between homeless and formerly homeless individuals and Yale University students. The troupe's new play, which recently had its premiere in a church basement before an enthusiastic audience, offers the message that through faith in God, human beings can overcome addictions and other demons, to fulfill their potential as individuals. 
 The troupe, a project of the Inner City Community Coffee House, was founded in February 1997 by a Yale student, Jane Chen, to give homeless people the opportunity to develop self-sufficiency by getting involved in theater, to give them a voice in the community, to break down stereotypes, and to educate audiences about homelessness.
Having first gotten to know homeless people through the Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project, Ms. Chen began recruiting troupe members in the soup kitchens and homeless shelters of New Haven. It was not easy. On some days as many as six people would attend rehearsal; on other days nobody would show up.
In July, Ms. Chen and other Yale students who had gotten involved began providing transportation to rehearsals. That turned out to be an important breakthrough. Nevertheless, Ms. Chen says, "the troupe is always in flux in terms of people -- an unstable population sort of coming in and out; but through it we've definitely had commitments from people for some extended period of time."
The juxtaposition of instability and commitment that has characterized the troupe was recently demonstrated when it lost two homeless actresses less than a week before the premiere performance of the new play. The remaining five performers pulled together to make major last-minute revisions.
One of those performers was Andree Thompson, a 28-year-old man who has been with the troupe for over a year. When he joined, he was staying at the Columbus House shelter. He moved into his own apartment in December, after being homeless for 10 years. A month later he was hired as actor-director of the troupe, through a grant from the Haymarket People's Fund. Ms. Chen, who graduated in December with a dual major in theater studies and American studies, has remained in New Haven to train Mr. Thompson.
"One of the consequences of using crack cocaine is to become homeless," said Mr. Thompson, who completed a drug treatment program shortly before joining the troupe. "A lot of times people come out of homelessness and forget where they came from. This keeps everything right up front for me. It's amazing to see the talent that everybody has, and a lot of times that talent is lost. It makes me feel good to know that I'm having a positive impact on the community instead of having a negative impact that I had before God helped me get my life together."
Mr. Thompson says the plays, developed through improvisation, are based on experiences of the troupe's members: "None of our plays are script written. We go from a blank stage; how you're feeling and what you've been through -- we act it out. Everybody puts in their ideas and we come up with a play."
A troupe member who became homeless in February, Denise Potter, explains, "This isn't structured. This is something that you have to base on yourself, and I find it very difficult. It's a lot harder than just reciting a couple of lines from Shakespeare. It's something that touches the very soul of your being. It's kind of like therapy. You're able to do things and say things differently than you did the first time." The troupe has three-hour rehearsals, three nights a week. Rehearsals take place at Dwight Hall, the center for public service and social justice at Yale. Dwight Hall also provides the vehicles for transportation and some financial resources.
Thursday is a work night, when members work with Yale students to accomplish the administrative tasks of the troupe, including writing press releases, producing posters for performances and composing fund-raising letters. The students provide tutoring on computer and word-processing skills, resume writing, and use of E-mail, photocopy machines and facsimile machines.
There are also discussions about issues related to homelessness. "We end up having pretty heated discussions about where homelessness comes from and what to do about it," says the troupe's producer, Laurie Kennington, a sophomore.
Students tend to place the roots of homelessness in the political and economic system, whereas homeless people tend to focus on bad choices they made in their lives or on unfortunate circumstances.
"I had a college background and I'm homeless," says Judy White, who became homeless two years ago, when losing her job, apartment and custody of her daughter sent her into a deep depression. "It doesn't matter who you are. Situations can occur in your life that you cannot handle, and you fall down."
But both students and homeless agree that homeless people cannot be stereotyped. "Homeless people come in all shapes and sizes," Ms. White says.
Being involved with the troupe has changed the way Connor Martin, a sophomore, looks at homelessness. "You meet very interesting people who all have different stories," she says. "It's just a myriad number of things in people's pasts that leads them to be homeless."
Despite the instability in troupe membership, strong bonds form. "It's kind of like a family," Ms. Potter says. "You know you're not alone. It helps to be with people that are in the same position as you are."
For Krissy Clark, a sophomore, the most important aspect of working with the troupe has been the personal connections with homeless people -- "just having them be my friends, rather than people I helped or pitied or felt awkward around."
In addition to participating in work nights and providing transportation, students help with such diverse tasks as set and costume design, lighting and sound, grant writing and baby-sitting.
While the troupe aims to increase student involvement, it does not want to have to rely on students, who, like the homeless, tend to be transient, according to Connor Martin, who will take over as producer in the summer. Ms. Martin said she would seek to recruit non-student volunteers, to find rehearsal space apart from the university, to raise funds to buy a van and to provide stipends to homeless and formerly homeless troupe members, and to begin to form partnerships with other groups that provide services to the homeless.
A long-term goal is to transfer leadership from students to homeless and formerly homeless people themselves. The hiring of Mr. Thompson as director was a step in that direction.
"The Family Angel" is the troupe's third production. The premiere performance took place before 60 people at St. Mary's Unison Freewill Baptist Church on Goffe Street. The cast included Mr. Thompson, Ms. Potter, Ms. White, Grafton Riddick, who has been with the troupe from the start and Al Vasseur, who lives at Davenport House, a transitional home.
The next performance, a benefit for the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen, is scheduled for Saturday. In late June, the troupe will perform at the International Festival of Arts and Ideas in New Haven. A discussion between audience and cast follows each performance.

HEADLINE: Investing to Cover College Cost

BYLINE: By JARRET LIOTTA 

 BODY:
FOR Townsend Smith, a second grader from Darien, the future is a shining sea that he intends to sail across. "When I graduate from college I want to be in the Navy," he said. "I like boats a lot. I'd like to be a captain."
While his mother, Eileen Smith, noted that he seems to change his mind every week about his ambitions, one probable bet is that Townsend will be pursuing higher education. "He's a very bright kid and I think he wants to go on to college," she said. 
 Like many parents, however, Eileen and her husband, Tad, are expecting the cost of putting their son and twin 6-year old daughters -- Ella and Tori -- through college to be sizable. And hope for their future won't necessarily translate into a practical solution.
In January, the Connecticut Higher Education Trust was created by the State Treasurer's office. The tax-deferred savings and investment program is designed to offer state residents variations in the allocation of assets according to the age of the child, and a flexibility in the use of the money upon withdrawal. More than 600 accounts have been opened, with more than $3 million invested by participants.
The Smiths, who had some equity investments earmarked for college, are among those 600. "What's good about it is the fact that the money will come out and it will be taxed at the child's tax rate," said Mrs. Smith. (The college-age student's tax rate is likely to be substantially lower than that of the parents.)
In the portfolios, Lazard Freres & Company has been designated to handle small-capitalization equities, Aeltus Investment Management Inc. large-cap stocks, J. P. Morgan Investment Management fixed-income investments and Montgomery Asset Management international investments. "What I wanted to do was have the average taxpayer have a chance to access top-notch asset managers," said the State Treasurer, Paul J. Silvester, who is overseeing the program. "We have a tremendous amount of investment expertise here."
Part of the managers' responsibility is to orchestrate the investments so that they will gradually change from riskier equities into fixed-income investments as the children get closer to the time they need to withdraw the money. A tentative model shows that 90 percent of the account will be held in diversified equities when the child is 5 years old or younger. By the time the child reaches 17, only 10 percent will still be in stocks.
Mr. Silvester acknowledged that risks remain. "There's market risk," he said. "But I always say that the only investment that's kept pace with higher education is the stock market."
"What we used to do is issue zero-point municipal bonds," said Mr. Silvester, but these ultimately lost purchasing power. This new investment portfolio, he said, is designed to keep pace with inflation.
The price of college education has outpaced the cost of living in recent years. According to the Federal Department of Education, the average tuition, room and board at a four-year institution has nearly doubled in 10 years, to $10,825 last year from $5,964 for the 1986-87 school year. The treasurer's office predicts that costs will increase at twice the rate of inflation in years to come.
Kathy Houlihan, assistant director of financial aid at Housatonic Community-Technical College in Bridgeport, said that schools are trying a variety of ways to help parents with the costs. "Schools have come up with all sorts of creative, innovative ways to meet costs -- freezing tuitions, prepaying tuitions," she said. "They've had to get very creative because the burden keeps getting heavier every year."
Financial aid administrators from schools as diverse as Yale, the University of Connecticut and Housatonic agree that the biggest mistake parents make is waiting too long to start to save.
"It needs to be done when the children are really small," said Ms. Houlihan. "I guess it's never too late, but the earlier you do it, the much better position you're in."
Though saving for college has an effect on students' ability to receive financial aid, often, she said, the only aid that is available is in the form of student loans. "Colleges do not have the deep pockets that people think they do," she said. Students now leave school with an average of $17,000 in student loans, she said.
Any Connecticut resident is eligible to open a Connecticut Higher Education Trust account, regardless of income. The money, and there is no limit on the amount invested, can then be used at any higher education institution.
An account may be opened with an initial investment of $500, or a minimum of $50 a month if a payment plan is used, either through payroll deduction or a checking account. Accounts can be opened through any First Union bank in the state.

HEADLINE: Tempest Brews Over Development in Scarsdale

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
CHANGE comes slowly to most small places, but the growing pains here are legendary. For more than 30 years, residents of this seemingly tranquil suburb have been locked in bitter wrestling matches over everything from the disposal of autumn leaves to the very future of their village.
After rejecting 23 studies, reports and proposals to revitalize Scarsdale's low-key downtown, nearly everyone seems to understand that something must be done with the large parking lot on the Freightway site, which sits like a gaping hole next to the Metro-North train tracks. The proposal would also link the village's two separate shopping areas. 
 There is also general agreement that the village's traffic and parking problems are in desperate need of a solution. But all that accord has not been enough to get a consensus on the next move. And in Scarsdale, consensus is everything.
The current proposal -- which will be discussed at a public hearing on Wednesday -- is a hyped-up version of a concept originally offered by 29 citizens in 1995. It would mean building 215,000 square feet of parking, stores, apartments and walkways alongside the Metro-North tracks, and it would turn the Freightway parking lot into the second story of a two-and-a-half-floor garage by digging under the present lot and adding a floor above it.
Above the garage would be a landscaped plaza, with small shops and apartments -- some built directly over the tracks. Commuter trains to and from Manhattan would race beneath them in less than five seconds and emerge on the other side of Popham Road, where there would be more stores and a second plaza above the tracks.
Not surprisingly, there are some who feel the estimated $30 million plan would change the character of Scarsdale forever.
"My observation is that this is the kiss of death to the village being a village," Richard Behr, an architect, said. "How does this gigantic thing relate to a small village area? This is not flowers and little benches. It will make this place an urban development."
Even the likely builder, Sam Klein of Fairchild Properties in Manhattan, conceded that the Scarsdale project was more involved than typical developments. "This is going to have a visual impact on the community," he said. "Not everybody understood that initially, but now they do, and it's moving forward quite rapidly." Already, he is picking out lobby furniture and paintings.
Mayor Edward A. Morgan hopes to sign off on the zoning and environmental papers by the end of June, and optimistic supporters like Mr. Klein say they would like to see a shovel in the ground by next spring. But most people questioned randomly about the plan on a recent Friday just shrugged at the thought.
"Development? It can't happen -- not in this town," Anthony Rende, owner of Homer Rich Opticians, said. "There's like 200 cars looking for spaces here already, so tell me how more stores and more people are going to create any solution to the problem."
Driving around Scarsdale, even on sleepy weekday afternoons, can be a nightmare. A quick shopping trip easily turns into an hour of negotiating sludge-like traffic and searching for a parking space.
The proposal would add about 300 parking spaces but would fall 121 short of the number required by code. Mayor Morgan said the village planned to grant waivers allowing the smaller number.
Some of the residents, who were appointed by the village and labored for 18 months on the downtown building concept, are incensed. The village government, by ignoring their more modest outline, will make Scarsdale's worst problems -- traffic and parking -- worse yet, they say. So far, only a few vague sketches of the grand plan have been offered -- nothing on which to base a firm agreement -- but they are complaining loudly about being shut out of the process.
It would not be the first time. Earlier development plans have been scuttled in the face of community outcry so violent that Village Trustees were forced to throw up their hands. Each of the six Trustees, and the Mayor, were chosen through the village's unusual, nonpartisan system -- a clubby style of government in which certain residents are invited to serve rather than running in a traditional election. Campaigns are frowned on and only recently were candidates permitted to discuss specific issues. The village does hold a pro forma election, but it is rarely contested.
On paper that might sound nice. A genteel village of 17,000 people who know one another well enough to organize without party politics or divisive campaigns -- a government built on consensus rather than conflict. But in practice it can mean endless community discussions, decisions made by committee and compromises that go nowhere -- hence, the 30-year plan, still in its infancy, to develop Scarsdale's downtown.
"Development? It's almost laughable because they've been talking about this forever, it seems," said David A. Pravda, a lawyer with an office in the village center. The concept, he said, sounded excellent, adding that he was not holding his breath.
"The nonpartisan system has basically served this village well," Mr. Morgan said. "We don't have people yelling at each other. We're elected without having promised to do anything on the premise that we're going to listen to people and then try to make the right decision. And no personalities. We're not going to say a bad word about anybody. The premise is you beat on the issues instead of beating on the people."
That may have been true in 1911, when the system was designed. But 87 years later, some Scarsdale residents have grown mistrustful of that old-fashioned style.
"Generally, Scarsdale runs very well -- it's Nirvana," said Mike Anastas, co-chairman of Scarsdale Responsible Citizens, which is spearheading opposition to the downtown plan. "Everybody's happy -- except when something goes wrong. Because the system doesn't involve the community in discussions that matter like, for instance, the future of our village."
Les Levin, 70, complained that despite all the community committees, real dialogue between the village and its residents was nonexistent. About 50 people attended a public meeting on May 5 to complain. In typical fashion, the two-hour discussion grew into a four-hour confrontation, and by midnight people were still waiting to speak. Many were unhappy with the downtown building plan and feared that the village leadership would barrel through with it.
"We do not want, nor do we need, housing over the railroad tracks creating the first and only subway station in Westchester," said Phyllis Rozans, 76, who has lived in the village for more than 40 years. Another man stood up to complain that he had not left Manhattan to move next door to a shopping mall.
But there are others -- particularly the Mayor and the six Trustees -- who are tired of noodling over endless proposals and insist that the time has come for action. Village Manager Alfred A. Gatta shook his head in undisguised disgust at the idea of more opposition. "There are those who believe we should still be operating as if Eisenhower were in his first term," he said. "Small towns are tough. The people are just not much into government. They don't trust it."
That is the way it has always been in Scarsdale, said Lowell Tooley, Mr. Gatta's predecessor, who managed the village for 34 years. For much of that time, he worked with Brad Perkins, the architect who has been trying since 1984 to hammer out a design the town can embrace.
"I like the nonpartisan system," said Mr. Perkins, who has lived in Scarsdale for 25 years. "There are times, though, I'll admit, when you'd like a more clear-cut decision-making process. The whole thing has gotten more and more tortuous, but when this thing is finally up, people will say, What was all the fuss about?"

HEADLINE: In Bridgeport, It's Time to Play Ball Once Again

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
ON Thursday, a new sports era begins for Bridgeport when the Bluefish play their first professional baseball game in the new Atlantic League. An opening-day sellout is assured; all 5,300 seats in the new stadium, the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, have been sold for the 4:05 P.M. opener against the Newark Bears. Pre-game ceremonies with Gov. John G. Rowland and Mayor Joseph P. Ganim will begin at 2:15.
The ball park is the first component in a sports arena and transportation complex along the city's waterfront. About $125 million in state money, along with additional millions in city and private money, is expected to be allocated over five years for the project, known as Team Bridgeport. Included is $12.5 million from Zurich Reinsurance, which had planned to build a new headquarters in Bridgeport but decided to move to Stamford instead. In addition to baseball, Team Bridgeport could also bring professional hockey and basketball to a city that has been struggling since its factory base began to erode about 30 years ago. Indeed, Bridgeport was an industrial hub when its last minor league team, the Bridgeport Bees of the old Colonial League, played their home games at Candlelight Stadium in the city's North End in the late 1940's. 
 Since the Atlantic League, unlike most minor leagues, is a brand new independent circuit with no major league affiliations, no one quite knows what to expect in terms of playing caliber. For the most part, rosters, include a handful of players with major league experience as well as minor leaguers who never made it to the big show and are, for the most part, are likely in the twilight of their playing careers.
"I think the quality of play will be slightly above Double A standards, and you'll see some of these players go up to the big leagues," said Mickey Herbert, one of the team's four principal owners and the founder and a chief executive officer of Physicians Health Services Inc., based in Trumbull. Other members of the ownership group are Jack McGregor, a Bridgeport lawyer and civic leader who founded the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League; his wife, Mary-Jane Foster, also a lawyer, and their firm, Bridgeport Waterfront Investors. Stressing that the Bridgeport Bluefish Professional Baseball Club is very much a local operation, Ms. Foster said, "About 76 percent of the people we have hired" -- the total number is between 200 and 250, she said -- "are from Bridgeport." She continued: "And we have already spent more than $1.5 million in the Bridgeport area on various equipment, including the scoreboard, which was made in Norwalk."
No matter the caliber of play -- expected to be like Class A minor league baseball, a step below Eastern League teams in New Haven, New Britain and Norwich -- the cozy and attractive ball park at Broad and Main streets is likely to enchant spectators.
So, too, is the spectacular view from inside the ball park that includes ferryboats of the Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamship Company entering and leaving Bridgeport Harbor, Amtrak and Metro-North trains above the right field fence, the Bridgeport skyline and the Connecticut Turnpike bridge, about a quarter-mile behind third base and left field.
The new stadium, which was built on the site of the Jenkins Brothers Valve Company plant off Broad Street in the city's South End and whose brick exterior evokes Bridgeport's past as a major industrial city, is similar to Dodd Stadium in Norwich.
That three-year-old ball park, where the Norwich Navigators of the Eastern League play their home games and which has drawn rave reviews, was built by C. R. Klewin Construction of Norwich, which also built the Ballpark at Harbor Yard.
Asked to compare the two ball parks, Gerry Chaiffre, the superintendent in charge of the Harbor Yard project, said, "This one is nicer. It has wider aisles between the seats and the concessions, more amenities, grander entrances and more space overall."
The Bridgeport ball park also has a huge edge in its surroundings. Dodd Stadium is in an industrial park several miles from downtown Norwich. Harbor Yard, by contrast, is about a five-minute walk from the heart of downtown Bridgeport. "You can park your car downtown and walk to the ball park," said Steven Schoenfeld, the public relations director for the Bluefish. "It's close to everything."
About 1,200 parking spaces, including a 600-car paved lot just beyond the left field fence, have been created. Some fans may not have to concern themselves with parking at all. The ferry terminal, which links Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, N.Y., and the Amtrak and Metro-North railroad station, are only minutes away by foot; so, too, are the exits from the Connecticut Turnpike and Routes 8 and 25 from the north.
Charlie Dowd, the team's general manager, thinks the stadium's location will be one of the keys in attracting fans. By the time the Bluefish had signed their first player, Brian Cornelius, a 31-year-old outfielder, in March, almost 100,000 tickets had been sold. Now, with the opener only four days away, the team has sold more than 130,000 individual game tickets and about 1,300 season tickets, including all 100 club seats (at $1,050 per seat) behind home plate.
Another lure, Mr. Dowd believes, will be ticket prices, which are far less expensive than for major league games but comparable to those at the state's three Eastern League ball parks in Norwich, New Haven and New Britain as well as in Waterbury where the Waterbury Spirit of the Northeast League (also an independent circuit) play their home games.
In Bridgeport, single-game prices range from $10 for premium box seats, which are directly in front of the sold-out club seats, to $4 for reserved seats ($2 for children under 12 and people over the age of 65).
Spectators in the club seats will be able to take advantage of a buffet dinner in the enclosed Harbor Club, directly behind their seats, and then place food and beverage orders while watching the game, the trains, the traffic on Interstate 95 or the ferryboats plying Bridgeport Harbor.
Nineteen of the 20 skyboxes, which accommodate up to 20 people and cost $20,000 for the season, have been sold, mainly to corporations in Fairfield County, Mr. Schoenfeld said. Most of the signage space on the outfield fence -- 325 feet down both foul lines and 400 feet to dead centerfield -- has also been sold. Just beyond the 8-foot-high "home run fence," a second fence, 16 feet high, has been erected to display advertising signage on the top portion.
In keeping with a popular trend in minor league baseball, there will be a heavy focus on families. At Harbor Yard there will be a picnic area, a supervised play area and a concession where Bluefish merchandise can be purchased.
Before a spadeful of dirt was dug at Harbor Yard, nearly $200,000 in Bluefish merchandise -- including caps, jackets, sweatshirts and pennants -- had been sold, all with the team's navy blue and sea green logo of a tenacious-looking bluefish wielding a baseball bat.
"We placed ads with the logo in Baseball America and Baseball Weekly, and the response was tremendous," Mr. Schoenfeld said.
The site that Harbor Yard occupies had been purchased by Donald Trump, with a view toward building a gambling casino.
But after being rebuffed by the state legislature, Mr. Trump transferred ownership to the city for $1 in lieu of back taxes.
The stadium project, which was coordinated by the Kasper Group of Bridgeport and designed by Design Exchange of Newark, Del., cost $17.2 million.
Mr. Schoenfeld said the team's owners have spent between $2 million and $3 million on amenities, including a 60-foot-high scoreboard.
Still in the planning stage is an intermodal transportation center and a sports arena with construction at least a year and a half away, says Michael Freimuth, the city's director of economic development. Mr. Freimuth said the arena -- it is expected to cost $35 to $40 million and to seat 8,000 to 10,000 -- could be used for games and for events including concerts and circuses.
"There've already been inquiries from two hockey leagues and one professional basketball league," Mr. Freimuth said. "And both Fairfield and Sacred Heart universities could also use the arena for basketball and hockey games."
For now, though, Mr. Freimuth and other Bridgeport officials are focusing on the Ballpark at Harbor Yard and a Bluefish team that did not begin spring training until last Monday, 10 days before opening day and the day after the Atlantic League's draft in Plant City, Fla. Since then, the team has been practicing at the former Cincinnati Reds' training site in Plant City before heading to Bridgeport yesterday. From today on, the Bluefish will work out daily at Harbor Yard.
The roster includes three former major leaguers -- outfielders Mike Felder, who spent 10 seasons in the big leagues with four different teams and Dwayne Singleton, who has played for Milwaukee and Detroit, as well as catcher Terry McGriff, who has seen service with four big league teams. The Bluefish had also signed a fourth former major leaguer, second baseman Jose Lind, but he was dropped from the roster last Monday when he failed to appear at training camp in Florida.
The Bluefish manager, Willie Upshaw, is a veteran of 10 years in the major leagues who later spent six seasons as a hitting coach with Toronto and Texas. For Upshaw, who also spent two seasons playing in Japan, the managerial situation is ideal since he lives in Fairfield, where all four of his children go to school.
The Atlantic League is one of about a dozen independent leagues that have been established in recent years as minor league baseball, on the verge of extinction in the 1970's, has surged in popularity, in large measure because of the expense of going to a big league game.
"We're going to provide family entertainment at affordable prices, and we're going to do it in a beautiful setting," said Dowd, the general manager, who came to the Bluefish from the New Haven Ravens. "And you'll see good baseball."
And perhaps a good omen for Bridgeport. "The ball park is symbolic of the city's comeback," Mr. Freimuth said. "And there's much more to come."

HEADLINE: Using Thin Air To Let Buildings Grow Taller

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
MORE and more, the castles in the air rising around New York City are a combination of one landlord's castle and another landlord's air.
Unused development rights -- widely called "air rights" -- are a keystone in almost every big project under way or being planned. 
 Consider the Planet Hollywood Hotel that is soon to rise at Broadway and 47th Street, developed by Robert Gladstone. It would ordinarily be limited to 182,640 square feet of floor area by zoning rules. Through the transfer of air rights from the adjacent Lunt-Fontanne Theater, it will have 320,131 square feet.
Or take the luxury apartment tower at 515 Park Avenue developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf. Zoning rules would permit 72,000 square feet on that site. By transferring air rights from neighboring buildings on East 60th Street, including the Lighthouse, the tower will have more than 165,000 square feet. Ground is to be broken tomorrow.
In a hot market, air is money; $50 a square foot or more for development rights from Broadway theaters, maybe as much for those of Public School 191 at Amsterdam Avenue and West 61st Street.
The city's Economic Development Corporation is negotiating the sale of most of the air rights from P.S. 191 to Laurence Ginsberg, who would build two 30-story apartment towers next door. The project would grow to 600,000 square feet, from 400,000 square feet, through the transfer.
This would evidently be the first such transfer from a public school. The city agency hopes it will not be the last. It has identified 80 public buildings in Manhattan -- schools, police stations, fire houses and libraries -- whose air rights might be marketable, depending on the appropriateness of receiving sites.
"Early on in the Giuliani administration, a decision was made to try to take assets like these and put them in private hands," said Charles Millard, president of the corporation. The process is painstaking, he said, but the result is "better development sites and more property on the tax rolls for the city."
Some government officials, however, are alarmed by the P.S. 191 transfer. "Not only are we overbuilding but we're finding additional ways to do it," said Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, in whose district the school is located. "It's very scary."
Another project using air rights from a public property is 150 East 57th Street, a 32-story apartment tower nearing completion between Lexington and Third Avenues, developed by Bernard Spitzer and Louis Brause. They paid $1.2 million for the rights from a subway power substation in a deal with the Economic Development Corporation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Five floors in the tower are attributable to that transfer. Between the air rights from the substation and another large adjacent property, the developers are expanding their project by 72 percent.
The Pataki administration is also looking to exploit air rights where it can. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said five developers have responded to a request for proposals for a new building atop the Port Authority Bus Terminal at Eighth Avenue and 42d Street, using about 1 million square feet of its untapped development potential. The five are the Forest City Ratner Companies, LCOR Inc., Park Tower Group, Silverstein Properties and a team composed of the Lawrence Ruben Company, Starrett Corporation and Vornado Realty Trust.
This project embodies the traditional definition of "air rights" -- building in the air directly over the property that generates the development potential.
More commonly today, air rights are shifted from one property to another. This is the heart of a proposal before the City Planning Commission that would allow the owners of 25 Broadway theaters to transfer their air rights -- totaling 2.4 million square feet -- almost anywhere within a 60-block area from Eighth Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas, 40th to 57th Street.
USING those air rights, developers could construct buildings 20 to 44 percent larger than zoning would ordinarily allow, without having to go through public review. Theater owners who took advantage of this liberalized procedure would be required to preserve their structures as playhouses and pay $10 a square foot from the sale of air rights into a building maintenance and theatrical development fund.
Indirectly, the four office tower sites at the Times Square crossroads -- including the Conde Nast and Reuters headquarters -- also exploit the unused development potential from nearby theaters, in this case the historic houses along 42d Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
A stated goal of the government-sponsored 42d Street Development Project in 1984 was to "maintain the low-scale character of the mid blocks and limit new tower construction to the avenue ends of the project area." This was to be achieved by shifting development to Broadway, Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue.
With a total of 8.1 million square feet, the overall project is no greater in size than would be allowed by special permit under current zoning rules. But on the office tower sites, the density will be much higher.
The four sites together could accommodate up to 2.8 million square feet of floor area by special permit under current zoning rules. As built, the towers on those sites are to have a total of 3.9 million square feet (even more -- 4.1 million square feet -- if mechanical space is counted).
And officials are expecting the developers to lobby for even greater density. "Of course, there'll be pressure," Mr. Gargano said. How would he respond? "The simple answer would be, 'No,' " Mr. Gargano said. "The planning and density which was approved in 1984 gives us a size to go by and that's what we're staying with."
That precludes building over the New Amsterdam Theater. "Any build-over would diminish its presence," Mr. Gargano said.
Across town, a deal is near for the first transfer of air rights from Grand Central Terminal in almost 20 years. From the standpoint of contemporary zoning, a tower on that site could have about 1.7 million square feet more floor area than is contained in the Beaux-Arts landmark.
The landlord, the Penn Central Corporation, sought to build a skyscraper over the terminal in 1968 but was turned down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Ten years later, upholding the landmarks law, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Penn Central had not suffered a "taking" of its property in part because it could still transfer development rights.
In 1991, after only 74,655 square feet of those development rights had been drawn down (for the Philip Morris headquarters at Park Avenue and 42d Street), the planning commission created a special 22-block subdistrict around the terminal to which its air rights could be transferred. A similar nine-block district already existed to absorb the development potential from the historic buildings of the South Street Seaport.
The first development to take advantage of the expanded Grand Central transfer district would be the headquarters planned by the Bear Stearns Companies at 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets. That 43,300-square-foot site is zoned for a building with a floor-area ratio of 15, or 649,500 square feet. The addition of 285,800 square feet of air rights would yield a tower with 935,300 square feet of floor area (equal roughly to the Municipal Building), with a floor-area ratio of 21.6, the highest allowed.
About 50,000 square feet of air rights might be transferred to Harry Macklowe for a 1 million square foot building he plans at Madison Avenue and 42d Street to replace the 310 Madison Avenue building.
Even if those transactions occur, however, Penn Central's successor company, American Premier Underwriters of Cincinnati, will still be left with nearly 1.5 million square feet of development rights.
"The market seems to be strong and there seems to be interest from a limited number of buyers," said John A. Anderson, vice president of the company. "The problem is that there aren't enough soft sites to put a major dent in the air rights."
That is the same problem faced by the owners of Broadway theaters: plenty of air rights but almost nowhere to send them.
"All of the value is locked up," said Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman & Colin, a lawyer representing the three major owners, the Shubert Organization, Nederlander Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters.
Edward I. Koch, in whose mayoralty many Broadway theaters were made landmarks -- over the objections of their owners -- said there ought to be some form of compensation. "I've come to the conclusion," Mr. Koch said last week, "that the proposal to expand the area within which they can sell their air rights is reasonable."
On April 22, Borough President C. Virginia Fields of Manhattan broke with the two local Community Boards and most of Manhattan's City Council members by offering conditional support of the zoning proposal.
"In some instances," she said, "zoning is an appropriate mechanism to preserve specific industries." She did, however, join with critics in saying that special permits ought to be required for any air-rights transfers.
But Robert E. Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, said a lengthy review procedure "will discourage many developers and result in many less theaters preserved and protected."
Rebecca Robertson, a Shubert vice president, said it was "critical that the transfer be as straightforward as possible."
The Shubert Organization has wrestled for years over what to do with its unused development potential. On one block alone, between 44th and 45th Streets, seven Shubert theaters are estimated by city planners to have 471,525 square feet of available air rights. Shubert has occasionally floated a plan to build an enormous new tower directly over that cluster on a platform supported by columns among the theaters.
WHILE that approach has been met at City Hall with reactions ranging from cool to incredulous, Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, believes that towers on platforms are exactly the kind of threat that the new zoning proposal would diminish.
"Every theater basically represents a development site with a large floor plate in the central business district of the hottest market in the country," he said.
City planners maintain that the zoning proposal would not add to the density of the theater district but merely redistribute it. The real-estate industry agrees. "Such districts do not increase the amount of allowable development," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, "they simply reallocate it in a carefully limited way to nearby areas to facilitate investment. In this case, the midtown area has sufficient infrastructure to absorb the redistributed density."
But critics say that the city should have prepared an environmental impact statement on what would happen to sidewalk and street traffic, open space and air quality if all 2.4 million square feet of development rights from the theaters were used.
Opponents also worry that a wide transfer area will be a model for more, particularly since it follows those around Grand Central and South Street. "The establishment of still a third 'unique' special district would obviously provide even more justification for others," declared the rezoning task force of Community Board 5 in mid-Manhattan.
The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects told the planning commission that the proposal would "set a bad precedent for preferential treatment of a certain class of owners."
"It would allow other property owners, such as religious organizations, to claim they are similarly burdened and deserve special treatment through the ability to transfer air rights over a broader area," said Edward I. Mills, speaking for the chapter at a planning commission hearing.
Roberta Brandes Gratz, co-author of a newly published book, "Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown," asked: "Who is to say an argument won't be made for a religious-properties district with a cluster of churches and synagogues? And why not a 'school district' for N.Y.U. or Columbia, so they too can float air rights?"
Mr. Rose insisted that the theater air-rights proposal would set no precedent, since it involves a special zoning subdistrict that has existed more than 30 years as home to an industry that is recognized as culturally and economically significant.
But it is true that planners have heard other proposals for expanded air-rights districts. For example, there was discussion of allowing owners of the small buildings in the Stone Street Historic District to sell their development potential elsewhere in lower Manhattan. "It involved taking air rights from within a district and transferring them outside," Mr. Rose said. "That's not necessarily a principle we wanted to commence."
He also said the sale of publicly owned air rights would be evaluated case by case. "There is no agenda afoot to do some kind of massive sale of air rights over public buildings," Mr. Rose said. "But that doesn't mean it's not sometimes appropriate."
The case of P.S. 191 is a "win-win-win-win" situation, Mr. Millard said. "The Board of Education benefits. The city budget benefits. The developer benefits. And the school keeps 20 percent of its air rights so it can expand if necessary."
Under the arrangement, the city has acquired the air rights from the Board of Education and applied the value of the air rights against the board's budget, as part of a $17 million credit. In turn, the Economic Development Corporation will sell the development rights to Mr. Ginsberg.
In 1987, the Ginsberg family built an apartment tower at 108 East 96th Street that was 12 stories taller than allowed by zoning rules. The city required them to remove those floors. "They made a mistake and they paid dearly for it," said their lawyer, Paul D. Selver of Battle Fowler.
Public schools and Broadway theaters are not the only beneficiaries in the current round of air-rights transfers. So is the Lighthouse Inc., a not-for-profit agency that helps the blind and visually impaired. Its international headquarters is in a 14-story building at 111 East 59th Street.
AFTER constructing its new building four years ago, the Lighthouse had 10,000 square feet of left-over air rights, which were sold on Tuesday for $2.5 million to the 515 Park Avenue project on the same block, being developed by the Zeckendorfs and a fund managed by Goldman Sachs. "We had an asset we really couldn't use, from a building point of view, so the sale of those air rights was wonderful for us," said Barbara Silverstone, the president and chief executive of the Lighthouse. "It's money in the bank. It goes into our endowment. It was a win-win negotiation."
Between the Lighthouse and the 515 Park Avenue site are two five-story brownstones, whose air rights also figure in the transaction. The goal of amassing air rights is simple, Arthur Zeckendorf said.
"The higher the units, the better the views," he said. (And the greater the price, he did not have to say.) "What they add is obviously a larger building with more economies of scale," Mr. Zeckendorf said.
Although the transfer of air rights is commonly understood as a development technique, it also relieves the economic pressure on owners of undersized structures -- often 19th- and early 20th-century landmarks -- to demolish and rebuild.
"In terms of housing stock, building stock and residential tenants, it's a very pro-preservation technique," said Michael T. Sillerman of Rosenman & Colin, who has negotiated many air-rights deals, including the zoning issues posed by the 515 Park Avenue project. "You're preserving the scale, age and diversity."
Air-rights transfers are sometimes more than an enhancement; they are a necessity.
"This project could not have worked without the air rights," said Frank Williams, of Frank Williams & Associates Architects, designers of the Planet Hollywood Hotel, which Mr. Gladstone is developing. By extending the zoning lot to include the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, the hotel grew by 75 percent and gained larger floors. (The 300-foot-high sign tower that will rise next to the hotel does not count in the floor-area calculations.)
When the small L-shaped parcel at Broadway and 47th Street was auctioned in 1996, other prospective buyers were merely looking to use the shell of the existing building for retail. "I was the only developer there," Mr. Gladstone recalled.
That was because he had already struck a deal with Stanley Stahl, the co-owner with the Nederlanders of the Lunt-Fontanne, for the air rights that would make it possible to build a 53-story skyscraper on the little parcel. "We had a handshake," Mr. Gladstone said, "and that was it."

The ABC's of F.A.R.
 It is not simply the size of a building that determines its development potential but what zoning applies to it.
Since 1961, zoning rules have prescribed the permissible density of every district in the city, expressed as a ratio of floor area to lot size. Floor-area ratios (or F.A.R.) range from 0.5 in neighborhoods like Douglaston, Queens, with one-family detached homes, to 21.6 in the high-rise core of Manhattan.
 A theater with 40,000 square feet of floor space on a 10,000-square-foot lot is said to have a floor-area ratio of 4 -- that is, 40,000 divided by 10,000.
If this theater were on a neighborhood commercial street where zoning calls for a floor-area ratio of 4, it would have no left-over development rights.
But if it stood on a parcel in Manhattan where zoning would permit a floor-area ratio of 15, it would have potential to spare: 110,000 square feet.
And that can be a valuable commodity if there is an eligible transfer site.
If a new tower were being planned on a 10,000-square-foot parcel adjacent to this hypothetical theater, the owners would be in luck. They could sell their air rights to the developers, who would add them to the 150,000 square feet already permitted by zoning (in a 15 F.A.R. district), yielding a 260,000-square-foot tower.
The most common method of transfer is a zoning lot merger, in which the existing building and the development parcel are counted as a single lot for zoning purposes, even though they are separately owned.
A zoning lot merger can occur only if properties are adjacent. Slightly wider latitude is granted to landmarks, whose air rights can be transferred across the street or cater-corner across an intersection.
Unused development rights trade at anywhere from 50 percent to 150 percent of land value, said Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman & Colin. Because his law firm has been involved in dozens of such deals over the years, he can argue the transaction either way.
Buyers, Mr. Lindenbaum said, are offering "found money" to the owners of air rights by unlocking value that could not otherwise be exploited, without actually taking title to the property. (That's the 50 percent argument.)
Sellers, he said, are allowing buyers to add more height to their new towers. Those upper floors are the ones that will sell or rent at the greatest prices. (That's the 150 percent argument.) DAVID W. DUNLAP

When Mega-Mergers Are Mega-Busts

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
MARRY reliable old Daimler-Benz with go-go Chrysler? The union is bound to yield better cars. How about SBC and Ameritech, the telecommunications giants? Streamlining their front offices and linking all those zillions of phone cables into one awesome network ought to save billions.
With industrial regulation out of fashion, even the largest mergers are greeted sanguinely by the stock market -- and Washington. Last week the House passed a bill that would end Depression-era controls on banking, opening financial industries to new mega-mergers. 
 Populist fears of industrial concentration have faded, replaced by the conviction that the globalization of markets and the speed of technological change has tied efficiency to size. Bigness is no longer a threat to consumers, the thinking goes, but the salvation of affluent economies struggling to stay ahead of the pack.
But just when you've learned to stop worrying and love Consolidated Amalgamated Technotronics, economists are putting another spin on the conventional wisdom: Many now doubt that huge mergers will increase productivity. Indeed, most of the hard evidence from past mergers, along with the anecdotal evidence from the current wave, suggests that mergers do as much harm as good. Mergers, it seems, are too often the progeny of executive megalomania and deal makers' dreams of year-end bonuses.
Still, few counsel a more aggressive anti-merger policy that tries to second-guess the outcome of the behemoth couplings. Economists and regulators no longer fear unchecked corporate power, the concern that drove antitrust policy for the first half of the century. In the last few decades, the politically acceptable grounds for blocking mergers have narrowed considerably.
"Conglomerate mergers between companies in different businesses are now acceptable, as are vertical mergers between suppliers and producers in the same industry. Only horizontal mergers between competitors and potential competitors are likely to be challenged, and only when they concentrate the market enough to restrict output and raise prices.
By this standard, DaimlerChrysler raises little concern because its combined share of the world auto market would be modest. And mergers that link regional companies -- BankAmerica-NationsBank, SBC-Ameritech, Bell Atlantic-Nynex -- are acceptable because they don't reduce competition in local markets. Even where there is risk of monopoly, the Justice Department's guidelines permit mergers that generate substantial operating efficiencies.
"A merger has to be flat-out anticompetitive to attract the attention of the antitrust division," concludes F. M. Scherer, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
 
Executive Ego
But just because most big mergers are legal doesn't mean they are good for the economy. The bulk of the evidence from the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's suggests that mergers are more closely linked to fad -- not to mention the boss's ego -- than they are to cost savings or marketing synergies.
While stockholders in acquired (typically smaller) companies usually do quite well in mergers, owners of the acquiring companies rarely do. A 1997 survey by Dennis Mueller, an economist at the University of Vienna, showed that the acquiring companies typically had better-than-average returns on capital before mergers and worse-than-average ones afterward. Highly profitable companies, it seems, can't resist the urge to buy other companies with their accumulated cash rather than let the stockholders get the proceeds.
Research by Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School echoes these findings. His study of acquisitions by 33 large, successful corporations from 1950 to 1986 found that over half the acquired companies were sold off or liquidated within a decade. General Mills, for example, sold three-quarters of the 86 new businesses it had bought. Even General Electric, considered the best-managed diversified enterprise on the planet, scrapped 63 percent of its 51 acquisitions.
Mr. Porter's research focuses on conglomerate mergers rather than acquisitions by companies that already have an understanding of the industry they are entering. Moreover, the fact that mergers don't last doesn't prove they all failed; in some cases acquired companies may have been sold at a considerable profit.
Perhaps the current wave of couplings between companies in related businesses will prove more productive, but that is by no means certain. While it is too soon to assay the impact of the dozens of giga-mergers of the last few years, horror stories are dribbling out.
Wells Fargo choked on its acquisition of the First Interstate Bancorp in 1996. Records were lost, customers were forced to put up with long lines and tens of thousands of account holders left for more efficient banks. Adding to the confusion, three-quarters of First Interstate's top and middle managers were encouraged or allowed to leave in the first year.
A.T.&T. bought NCR for $7 billion in 1991 and then invested billions more in the electronics company with the aim of taking the computer industry by storm. Four years later A.T.&T. spun off NCR and the market valued the stock at a humiliating $3 billion.
 
Big Duds
 Quaker Oats did even worse with Snapple, buying the New Age brand for $1.7 billion in 1994 and selling it last year for $300 million. Novell, the networking software giant, acquired WordPerfect for $885 million in 1994. Two years later it dumped the second largest maker of word-processing software for just $115 million.
Japanese consumer electronics companies lost huge amounts in Hollywood in the 1980's. Matsushita lost billions on MCA-Universal before Seagram took the ailing studio off its hands. Sony has hung onto the wreckage of Columbia Pictures but has been forced to write off most of its investment.
Arguably, though, the most spectacular merger fiasco of modern times is still playing out. In 1995 the Union Pacific Railroad agreed to swallow the Southern Pacific. And a year later, over the objections of shippers who worried that the consolidation of routes would give the railroad the power to raise rates, Washington approved the merger.
But far from improving service, the new railroad quickly descended into chaos. Union Pacific's by-the-book corporate culture clashed badly with Southern Pacific's, where managers had long been accustomed to making do with chewing gum and bailing wire. Meanwhile the two carriers' information systems proved as compatible as Sonny and Cher.
The railroad had three fatal accidents in its first seven months. Shipments piled up at bottlenecks, particularly along the Mexican border. And tens of billions of dollars worth of freight has been delayed or simply denied access to the rails.
For all their skepticism about merger mania, it is still hard to find an economist inclined to put up roadblocks. The unique strength of American-style capitalism, the argument goes, has always been the freedom of businesses to mix and match assets. And the only compelling reason to interfere is to prevent the growth of old-fashioned monopoly power.

A Time to Heal. A Time to Move?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THE REV. WILLIAM HANOUSEK, who grew up in Astoria and was educated at Stuyvesant High School and City College, took over the Bethany Reform Church on the southeast corner of First Avenue and 67th Street in 1977. He came from a church in Canarsie with his wife and three small children because he wanted to live and minister in Manhattan, and in a racially mixed neighborhood.
The funky 88-year-old stone church is owned by the city's four-century-old, rich and powerful Collegiate churches. All are members of the Reformed Church in America. Bethany is a kind of poor cousin. The Marble Collegiate Church's superstar, the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, supported Bethany's programs, especially after Mr. Hanousek discovered what he decided was his mandate. 
 "Twenty years ago," he said, "we had lots of sports in the gym, a youth ministry, a vacation Bible camp. But after the first cancer patient wandered in looking for a place to lie down, I came to believe that God had put us across the street for a purpose."
Across the street was the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, its waiting rooms crowded with scared patients and their scared caregivers, often from out of town. By word of mouth, Sloan patients found out they could crash in the church across the street, make a hot meal in the kitchen, talk and cry through the night with other suffering families, be comforted by "the Reverend Bill," who lived upstairs. In the early 80's, the Dykstra family of Wyoming, Mich., arrived with 20-year-old Tim, who became a favorite of the entire congregation. They stayed in the church for more than a year as Tim had chemotherapy, lost his leg, eventually died of osteosarcoma. Mr. Hanousek pinned Tim's snapshot to his office door and vowed that Bethany would do more.
Bible study rooms and the choir room were renovated into bedrooms. Twenty people can be accommodated, five in a crowded "women's dorm." The fee is $10 a night for those who can afford it. There is nothing else so close and so cheap.
"We give them more than a room," said Lois Sullivan, a former pediatric nurse who coordinates Bethany's cancer ministry. A Catholic, she found out about the program when she enrolled one of her children in a Bible class. "We give them hope. We listen to them. What's happening now is wrong. The church is supposed to do what God told them to do, take care of the sick and the helpless, not make millions off their misery."
What's happening now is that the Collegiate Corporation wants to sell Bethany to a developer, Jack Parker, for $7.4 million. Mr. Hanousek is trying to stop the sale. He has filed a suit invoking old church contracts. This is being lawyered over in Civil Court before Supreme Court Justice Diane S. Lebedeff. Bethany has also appealed to the Reformed Church's national body. But with a congregation of under 50, few of whom are rich or well connected, Bethany is not exactly a power church. And according to the Rev. Arthur Caliandro, the successor to Dr. Peale at Marble Collegiate, it may not have an economic right to exist.
"It looks like a David and Goliath story," Dr. Caliandro said. "But there's more to it."
"I think he wants to be a martyr," he said of Mr. Hanousek. "At every turn he's been a snake in the grass. What I don't know is what he really wants. I'm buffaloed. We've always supported his cancer ministry. And we will continue. But that building is barely functional, that church is nonviable, and with the money we can build a new church and serve many more people."
Last Tuesday, Collegiate raised its original offer of $700,000 for the church to find a new home to about $1.25 million. But it stood firm on its alternative offer: Bethany can have only three bedrooms on the second floor of the new high-rise that Mr. Parker would build on the site. The small church had asked for enough space in the luxury apartment building for five bedrooms and a room for Sunday services. Justice Lebedeff told Bethany to find out what was available in its price range in the neighborhood.
Mr. Hanousek is scrambling and says he is afraid of being pressured into making a decision that will be wrong for his regular congregation and for the cancer ministry families. Mr. Caliandro is angry at being cast as a villain, he says, when his Marble Collegiate congregation raised $130,000 for local charities on Easter.
Meanwhile, Steve Samples, a 29-year-old from Florida, moved into a Bethany bedroom last week with his pregnant wife. His parents are in another room. He came from across the street after surgery for osteosarcoma, his third major cancer surgery since he lost an eye at 9 months. He's too seasoned to be scared by church politics, but with some heavy-duty outpatient chemotherapy coming up, he'd hoped to stay put for a while.

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Retirement Havens, Even for U.F.O.'s

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
IF you're thinking about relocating when you retire but are weary of reading about the usual places that pop up on most lists of recommendations, the June issue of Kiplinger's offers some relief.
Its top half-dozen picks are interesting and decidedly offbeat. Not one is in Florida or Arizona. And No. 3 on its roster is home to a U.F.O. museum. 
 The magazine started with 50 cities and towns recommended by several experts on retiree relocation. That list was winnowed down to 11 -- each visited by a Kiplinger's writer -- and then a final six based on criteria like cost of living, home prices, medical care, crime rate, weather and cultural opportunities.
That doesn't explain exactly why Kiplinger's list lacks the usual suspects. Whatever the reason, the final choices include cities that some readers may have never heard of:
* Anacortes, Wash. (population, 13,903; typical home, $225,000): In the northwest corner of Washington, this town is the place to catch a ferry to the nearby San Juan Islands.
* Chico, Calif. (45,965; $120,000): In the upper Sacramento Valley, Chico is known for produce and Bidwell Park, a 3,670-acre area with bicycle and walking trails that stretches into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
* Roswell, N.M. (47,559; $85,000): In the Pecos River valley, Roswell is near the site of what some claim was the crash of an alien spaceship in 1947. The town is known for its U.F.O. museum.
* Natchitoches, La. (17,269; $95,000): It's nack-a-TISH to the locals and where the 1989 movie "Steel Magnolias" was filmed. In the north-central part of the state, the town is known for its relaxed life style and outdoor activities like fishing, camping and hiking.
* Opelika, Ala. (24,041; $94,000): About two hours from Atlanta by car, it has plenty of Victorian-era homes and a 54-hole Grand National golf course.
* Summerville, S.C. (24,395; $103,000): With a growing season that lasts 239 days, this city in southeastern South Carolina is known for its flowers and pleasant weather.
Kiplinger's said the other five towns didn't make the final cut for various reasons -- too quiet, for example, too many retirees or not enough medical facilities. But the magazine says they still merit consideration: Monticello, Fla. (3,500); Dothan, Ala. (55,944); Florence, Ore. (6,570); Boerne, Tex. (5,800), and Silver City, N.M. (12,007).
TAKING STOCK If your retirement hopes are linked to the bull market, the June issues of two magazines could leave you a bit bewildered: they offer nearly opposite assessments of the market's future.
In Bloomberg Personal, David Hackett Fischer, a professor of history at Brandeis University and an expert on economic cycles, describes what he calls serious structural imbalances in the American economy and hints at a big bust for stocks.
He cites historically high price-to-earnings ratios, driven by pension, mutual fund and foreign investments; falling per-share earnings even as stock prices rise; a growing trade deficit; excess capacity and shrinking demand; concentration of economic control in a small number of large companies; low productivity growth, and the chasm in wealth distribution, which he says is wider than at any period in the nation's history except the late 1920's.
"The evidence suggests that it is time to think about the direction of change in our economy," Professor Fischer writes. "Our future may be very different from the recent past."
But in Mutual Funds magazine, Barbara Mlotek Whelehan cites scholars from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, who make some eyebrow-raising comments about the market. Because of probable future earnings and interest rates, they say, the market is undervalued by a factor of 4 to 1; were that imbalance corrected, according to such thinking, the Dow could be near 35,000. She also reports a forecast by Don Wolanchuk, the superbull publisher of The Wolanchuk Report, that the Dow will hit 16,000 this year. And then there's Glenn Neely of the Elliott Wave Institute, who foresees annual market gains of 50 to 100 percent in the next two years.
 
CYBERBANKING The June issue of Smart Money looks at on-line banking services in terms of products, security, fees, account information provided and customer service. It compares the offerings of 15 banks; Citibank is rated No. 1, followed by Bank of America, BankBoston, Wells Fargo and Chase Manhattan.
 
TRY AGAIN Money magazine, continuing its makeover, has been adding features and deleting others. But beginning in the June issue, it has restored tables listing banks with the highest rates on certificates of deposit and the best deals on credit cards. Robert Safian, the managing editor, said readers had complained about the data being dropped.
 
BITS AND PIECES The summer issue of Family Money offers investment tips for women . . . The June issue of Individual Investor examines satellite communications companies.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES;
A Bond-and-Stock Package Equipped With Seat Belts

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
IS it time for a spin in a convertible? With the Dow galloping toward 10,000, investors torn between the relative safety of bonds and the risk of stocks have this third option: convertible bonds that in effect are part bond, part stock.
"It's a way to stay invested with a much lower risk posture," said Nick P. Calamos, a managing director at Calamos Asset Management in Naperville, Ill., which specializes in convertibles. 
 Convertibles start off acting like bonds, paying what is usually a fat fixed return in dividends or interest. Since they can be turned into stock when it's attractive to do so, convertibles tend to rise when the issuer's stock is rising -- generally about 75 percent as much. But when the stock is falling, convertibles only tend to fall about a third as fast.
Convertible bonds themselves are complex and are often out of reach for ordinary investors: They cost at least $1,000 apiece and rarely trade in lots of fewer than 10, according to Kathryn Battles, director of fixed-income trading at Charles Schwab & Company. A diversified portfolio of 10 issues, each with 10 bonds, would thus demand at least $100,000. And retail investors are often frozen out of many new issues.
An easier path is found in mutual funds specializing in convertibles. But investors should choose such funds carefully. Looking only at total returns can give a deceptive picture.
First, investors should check the fund's position in ordinary stock: in some funds, it can be a third of total assets. A fund, of course, can use stocks selectively as a diversification tool, but you may not be lowering your risk as much as you intended.
Fund assets are also important. Because the size of the convertible bond market is just $140 billion, a fund with more than $1 billion can have a hard time putting all its money to work.
It also makes sense to gauge a fund's credit quality. Low-rated securities can give a fund extra kick when the economy is percolating nicely. But when a recession hits, such bonds can be pummeled.
A look at the top five funds, ranked by five-year total returns, shows a range of investing styles and themes at work. Andrew Davis, manager of Davis Convertible Securities, uses stocks and real estate investment trusts liberally in his fund as well as convertible bonds and preferred stock; he believes real estate and convertibles are similar defensive securities that boast good yields.
Mr. Calamos manages two of the other four top funds -- Calamos Growth and Income and Calamos Convertible. Growth and Income is the more aggressive, with a larger stock position and more bonds of small and midsize growth companies, many of them rated below investment grade.
For the Convertible fund, Mr. Calamos favors large-cap convertibles, like those of Hilton Hotels. Foreign issues now represent 18 percent of the fund's assets because they are attractively priced, Mr. Calamos said. About 70 percent of all holdings have investment-grade ratings.
Sandra K. Durn, portfolio manager of Nicholas-Applegate Income and Growth, looks for a company undergoing sustainable, positive change, then makes sure the bond is priced to participate in most of any upward swing in the stock price but less than half the downside. These criteria, plus a penchant for higher-quality names, led Ms. Durn to the convertible bonds of Home Depot.
Pacific Horizon Capital Income, managed by Ed Cassens, has a relatively high 12-month yield of 3.0 percent. The portfolio has benefited from recent mergers, particularly in the financial sector. Mr. Cassens is positioning his portfolio to weather a stock market fall by buying higher-grade credits and those that can still be a good investment if the underlying stock slides. One favorite: the Healthsouth Corporation.

HEADLINE: The Pink-and-Green Police

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
BANISH the black dress: it is not true Lilly.
Bring back the monokini -- the pink bathing suit bottoms with bows that we used to wear around the pool in Palm Beach as little girls. 
 And the colors -- they must be bolder.
Those are a few of the suggestions made when 15 women who are passionate about the correctness of lime green and shocking pink got together for the first meeting of the Lilly Pulitzer Advisory Committee.
The group -- a cross-section of the city's junior socialites, who can afford to take two and a half hours out of a weekday afternoon -- gathered over hors d'oeuvres last month at Doubles, the private club in the basement of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
Giggles and loud chatter bubbled from their table in the deep-red room, as the women traded memories of a favorite Lilly sun dress worn on the terrace of a Hamptons beach club, or a mother's watermelon-colored hostess skirt with big pink elephants, worn to the yacht club picnic.
James Bradbeer, now an owner of the Lilly Pulitzer label, which returned to production in 1994 after a 10-year absence from stores, took notes furiously. In reviving the Lilly label, Mr. Bradbeer and a partner brought back a brand that once had a nearly cultlike following among the rich and social -- "a major force in Prep resort wear," as "The Official Preppy Handbook" put it in 1980.
What the new owners did not have was the company's original namesake designer at the helm. Lilly Pulitzer, a Palm Beach socialite, knew instinctively what appealed to customers like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and C. Z. Guest. Mr. Bradbeer, 36, an apparel marketer from King of Prussia, Pa., did not. And so was born the advisory committee, a group of young women who are to the manner born (or wed). Their role is to channel the ideal Lilly customer for the label's owners.
The women have plenty to say. The new Lilly's update of beloved old prints -- famously garish in pink, turquoise, yellow and blue -- has not always been to the liking of longtime customers. "I don't want it to lose the classicism," said Calvert Saunders, a committee member, who recalled the comments she made at the Doubles meeting.
To the untrained eye, a Lilly dress might seem impossibly loud, as well as unsexy in its shapelessness. Old prints are terminally cute, featuring elephants dancing the fox trot or monkeys drinking Champagne.
But the very boldness marks them as part of a uniform -- a secret code among members of a privileged set. When someone says, "I love Lilly," or, "I grew up wearing Lilly," it's a telegraphed way of saying, I grew up summering in Southampton and wintering in Palm Beach. In the old days, men who wore navy suits on Wall Street would jet to Palm Beach and put on apple-green pants and a sports jacket wildly patterned with owls.
"It's something I identify with," said Ms. Saunders, who has homes in Manhattan and Locust Valley, N.Y., and spends her time as a volunteer fund-raiser for cultural institutions. "It's not like I want to wear bell-bottoms, but I just want a modern update of what was original."
Almost to a woman, the advisory committee members loathed a cotton pique shift dress the company was producing in black. "It has nothing to do with Lilly -- black is about your New York Prada uniform," said Kristina Stewart, the editor of Quest magazine and a committee member.
The group consensus: Get rid of it.
Mr. Bradbeer agreed to do just that, or at least to remove the offending garments in the New York area.
He takes seriously the opinions of his style council, whose other members include Lilly Phipps, a niece (and namesake) of Lilly Pulitzer; Rachel Hovnanian, a painter married to Ara Hovnanian, a New Jersey-based real estate executive, and Hilary Dick, a member of the duPont family.
Many are stay-at-home mothers or decorators who do not, strictly speaking, need to work, but there is also at least one corporate lawyer, Mayme Greer. Almost all are involved in the charity fund-raising circuit in Manhattan. They were recruited through Mark Gilbertson, a chairman of the director's council of the Museum of the City of New York and a friend of the Pulitzer family. The women are unpaid, although they are invited to buy Lilly from the New York showroom at prices well below the average $140 for a dress sold in Bloomingdale's or Saks Fifth Avenue.
Mr. Bradbeer said he would heed their advice in many ways, including eliminating a Keds sneaker in a Lilly print (too downscale, the women said); reviving the monokini for little girls, and bringing back a Bermuda-style handbag with interchangeable covers at a more Lilly-like price of about $50, rather than the $200 charged when the bag first appeared.
The members of the advisory committee are "our influencing segment," Mr. Bradbeer said. "They are so high-end. People around the country will look to them to set the taste level."
"The first time around, Lilly didn't have to have advisory groups, because she lived among her peers, so she got information hourly among her target customer," he said.
The clothes were created as a lark by Ms. Pulitzer, whose husband was Peter Pulitzer of the publishing dynasty (the two later divorced and Mr. Pulitzer's subsequent separation from his second wife, Roxanne Pulitzer, led to all those headlines that scandalized outsiders but not, really, Palm Beach).
To keep busy, Lilly Pulitzer opened an orange-juice stand and had a seamstress sew her knee-length, sleeveless dresses in colorful prints from Woolworth's (to hide the juice stains). Soon, everyone was asking for them, and the business she founded in the early 1960's grew to 32 stores.
Slim Aarons, a society photographer and an old friend of Ms. Pulitzer, explained the insider-y appeal of Lilly fashions and, inevitably, their snobbishness. "Her stuff goes on people who appreciate it," he said. "She placed it in the best places -- wonderful Waspy communities. She catered to a market that will always be. It's the solid rich people -- not the nouveau, not the models."
The "Preppy Handbook" noted that you could "count on at least four women at any yacht club gathering to be wearing one of Lilly's whalebone-bodiced dresses."
Ms. Pulitzer, who is now in her 60's, recalled: "I never really thought of it as a business. You know, whenever I had a friend who needed a job, I'd open a store somewhere in the country."
By the mid-80's, the era of dress-for-success, the frivolous print dresses had fallen out of favor and Ms. Pulitzer's company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
A decade later, another go-go economy with a taste for emblems of the upper-class life, along with an obsession with retro looks of every description, has brought Lilly back. Or maybe another reason for embracing the dress is a yearning for a return to an era that seemed more civil.
Last summer in the Hamptons there were so many Lillys, a combination of vintage and newer dresses, that many women met themselves coming and going.
Ms. Pulitzer sold a license to revive the line in 1994 to Mr. Bradbeer, who had been a marketing executive for Eagle's Eye, an apparel maker, and Scott Beaumont; the two men formed Sugartown Worldwide to bring back the clothes. In the first seasons, the colors were more muted and the prints more sedate than the eye-popping Lilly of old; longtime customers balked. Since then the company has tried to recapture its classic look -- a prime reason for the creation of the advisory committee, which is scheduled to meet four times a year over cocktails, over lunch, over sample swatches.
Andrea Lans, 28, a professional party planner on the committee, bemoaned the label's turn away from classic prints. "They shouldn't try to get tame, they should stick to the wild, crazy prints," she said.
The company has tried to move in that direction. At Saks Fifth Avenue, which has carried the line for three years, sales this season tripled last year's, said Deborah Daly, the buyer of active casual sportswear and swim wear. "The company is getting the product right," Ms. Daly said.
At Bloomingdale's, which introduced the line this year, it is a tougher sell, partly because the store's moderate-income customers haven't yet joined the Lilly cult. "It's a very inside group," said Shoshana Baker, a sportswear buyer.
Paradoxically, Ms. Pulitzer, who is a consultant to the new company, has argued against bringing back the original prints. She would also like to see dresses in larger sizes for full-figured women (14 is the largest, but it fits more like a 10). On this point, Mr. Bradbeer is sticking to his guns; he wants to sell only slim silhouettes, to maintain the image that Lilly is for those who can never be too rich, etc.

Lilly Pulitzer isn't the only echt-preppy look making a comeback. In recent months, Black Watch-plaid luggage has flown out of Barneys and quilted jackets with equestrian-print linings have been spotted on Manhattan streets.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Whale of a Bond Sale For Long Island Power

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
IT was the biggest municipal bond offering in the nation's history, but the market had no trouble swallowing it, and came up hungry for more.
The Long Island Power Authority made its mega-debut this week, winning raves for its performance and favorable rates for its bonds. 
 "We surprised a lot of people on the interest rate," said Daniel Keating, senior managing director for the lead underwriter, Bear, Stearns & Company. "There's a misperception that a big deal hurts the rate."
The sheer bulk of the offering -- $3.5 billion as the first chunk of a $7 billion financing -- could have flooded the market and forced rates higher. (The previous municipal bond record was $2.8 billion for a New Jersey pension fund.) Instead, the authority got the law of supply and demand working in its favor by whetting buyer appetite. Authority officials traveled extensively to pitch the issue to analysts and institutions. In New York, radio commercials aimed at individuals stressed the bonds' tax-exempt status.
"The authority did a terrific job getting its story out," Mr. Keating said. "The size actually helped get a better response" because so many investors heard about the bonds. "It was a highly anticipated offering."
Overwhelming demand resulted. The sale's first phase, for retail buyers, drew more than $800 million of orders at preliminary interest rates ranging from 3.9 percent for a 1999 maturity to 5.6 percent for a 2029 maturity. Long Islanders placed more than half the orders.
Institutional buyers had hoped to command up to 15 basis points, or 0.15 percent, more in interest on the bonds they bought. But the authority, its hand strengthened by the response from retail investors, stood firm. The institutions caved in, scrambling to get in on the deal, and the authority actually cut the rate on some bonds by five basis points.
In the end, the bonds were oversubscribed fourfold. Some $18 billion of orders were placed, as much volume in three days as the entire municipal market usually sees in a month. A complex priority list will allocate the bonds among those who ordered.
The authority will use the proceeds to take over the Long Island Lighting Company's electricity distribution business, cut what are now among the nation's highest electric rates and pay refunds to customers.
The response augurs well for the authority's remaining bond sales in coming months. Once Mr. Keating's formal role ends and the rules permit, he said, "I'll buy some of the bonds myself."

More Cars Going, Going, Gone to Auction

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: MANHEIM, Pa.

 BODY:
NEAR one edge of 194 acres of asphalt poured across the heart of eastern Pennsylvania's farm country stands a shed as long as two football fields, with a concrete floor and a steel roof. Every Friday, cars and trucks -- thousands of them -- snake across the parking lots toward the shed, forming two dozen lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic.
Inside, two dozen auctioneers, each on a yard-high wood platform, bellow prices into microphones at a speed that would leave a race track announcer breathless. Scores of car dealers, mostly men in blue jeans, mill about the cars while signaling bids. Instead of banging a gavel, the auctioneers wave foot-long pieces of inch-thick green plastic telephone cable as each sale is made. 
 Sotheby's auctions across North America may have sold $919 million worth of Renoirs, oversize diamonds and the like last year, while Christie's was passing title to $1.07 billion worth of collectibles like Princess Diana's dresses. But that's small change for the Manheim Auto Auction, the nation's largest, which sold $2.9 billion in vehicles last year -- 233,000 cars and trucks.
Mainly because of the explosion in auto leasing, the number and particularly the value of used cars sold at auctions have grown sharply over the last decade, . In 1997, the volume auctioned in the United States and Canada almost equaled the number of new cars sold, according to the National Auto Auction Association. And over the last decade, the value of used cars offered at auction has nearly quintupled, hitting $70 billion last year. Up to half the vehicles sold on the nation's used-car lots come from auctions.
And practically everyone who owns a car in the United States is affected. Auctions are the main source of information for the Kelley Blue Book and other price guides, which car dealers consult to determine the value of a trade-in. Banks use the guides in making used-car loans, while state officials use them for property tax assessments. And by providing a highly efficient market, economists say, auctions buttress the resale value of used cars.
So why are these huge auctions so little known? Because dealers and the auction companies prefer it that way. Dealers do not want customers to find out how much they pay for vehicles; most of the nation's 202 auctions are privately held and release few financial details. The Atlanta-based industry leader, Manheim Auctions Inc., a subsidiary of the privately held Cox Enterprises, owns 80 auctions in North America and Britain. The business started with the one here.
Manheim sold $28.4 billion worth of vehicles last year -- taking in about $1 billion in fees -- up from $18.5 billion worth in 1994. Two smaller chains are units of publicly traded companies: ADT Automotive, owned by Tyco International, and the Adesa Auctions Corporation, a subsidiary of Minnesota Power. More than 100 independent auctions are privately owned.
Here in Manheim, the speed of the auctions is remarkable. Most vehicles are sold in less than a minute, as bidders flash a series of hand gestures and other signals while the auctioneer rattles off prices. With a cry of "Sold, roll it out of here," the car is driven the width of the shed and out the other side. By evening, the local roads are full of huge car carriers.
TO a surprising extent, the business is based on trust. Consumer advocates usually advise shoppers to take a used car to a professional mechanic before buying it. But here in Manheim, dealers and their agents commonly bid on cars they have examined for a minute or less. Test drives are allowed before the auction, yet many dealers do not bother.
Lessors, dealers and other sellers are generally expected to fix mechanical problems before bringing used cars to auction; buyers take responsibility for touching up any scratches and fixing any dents. Dealers bring their own mechanics and are allowed an hour after a purchase to make sure a vehicle is in good condition. If a buyer finds a problem that was not disclosed, he and the seller immediately consult one of the auction house's arbitrators, and the sale may be canceled or the price adjusted. In rare cases, the auction buys the disputed vehicle and resells it after disclosing the defect, often at a loss.
Only 6 percent of the sales here go to arbitration. Buyers and sellers alike say the system works for a simple reason: Many dealers have been coming here for decades and constantly compare notes about the quality of the vehicles they buy. A vehicle's seller is identified before the bidding begins. When a seller disposes of even a few defective vehicles, it is widely talked about within weeks, and buyers simply refuse to bid on the seller's cars, or bid low.
"There are certain guys out there, I just will not buy their cars," said Chris Fadigan, a used-car manager in Cherry Hill, N.J., who wore an orange Philadelphia Flyers shirt to the auction here on a recent Friday. "I like to feel secure that when I get it back to the lot, it won't need $1,000 of work." Eight former police officers, now employed by the auction, check to make sure none of the cars have been stolen.
Regulars, like J. Mark Martin, a used-car trader based in Manheim, check late-model used cars fairly quickly. (A few older models are sold "as is," and buyers check them more carefully.) Mr. Martin scanned the vehicles approaching the auction lanes and spotted a purple 1995 Nissan pickup. Striding over, he opened the door and looked inside, glanced under the hood, inspected an almost imperceptible dent in the back and examined the chrome of the wheels, all in about a minute.
"The paint all matches -- over all, it's in good condition," said Mr. Martin, who buys cars and light trucks here and ships them by train to dealers in 10 Western states. Mr. Martin joined the bidding for the pickup, keeping his eyes locked on the auctioneer and nodding very slightly or winking his right eye each time he raised his bid.
In less than a minute, the pickup was his for $11,000, plus $195 in auction fees, and he was making plans to send it to Colorado or New Mexico, where used pickups are especially popular. "It's the type of truck that'll sell well there," he said, estimating that it would fetch about $13,500.
About a third of the cars that come off lease are bought by those who have been leasing them. Nearly another third are bought by the leasing dealers, who then typically resell them on their own used-car lots. Most of the rest belong to the auto makers and banks that issued the leases, which typically sell them at auctions, the biggest of which takes place here every Friday.
Lessors are not the only sellers, although they provide most of the growth in revenues. Rental cars are commonly sold at auctions, too. And dealers typically send to auction any trade-ins not suitable for their markets -- a pink convertible, say, that winds up in rural Maine but that would be far more likely to sell in the Sun Belt.
Insurers typically sell wrecked cars and recovered stolen cars at their own, far smaller auctions, which are open to the public.
Only new-car dealers can bid on cars previously leased by auto makers, because the auto makers' franchise agreements require them to sell all their cars, new or used, through their dealers. (In Manheim, these cars are confined to certain lanes.) Most auction companies go further, banning the general public entirely. The presence of retail customers, the thinking goes, would slow the bidding and probably result in more disputes over vehicle defects. And because of fears about car theft and break-ins, auctions near big cities try to avoid publicity.
Auction executives say their job is to please large-scale buyers and sellers. "We do not cater to the retail public -- they are not our concern, we don't even want them to know about our auctions," said Robert D. Rauschenberg, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Adesa.
Stenciled in big red letters on the glass doors of the entrance here are the words: "No Trespassers; Dealers Only, No Retail Customers Allowed."
The big auto auctions do face a few threats to their long-term prosperity. Some municipalities, including this town of 4,900 people, eight miles northwest of Lancaster, have become fed up with traffic congestion and other problems, and are trying to limit the auctions' growth. Some dealers are trying to bypass the auctions by communicating directly with one another over the Internet. Used-car superstores, meanwhile, try to deal directly with nearby dealers for their trade-ins.
Nevertheless, the auctions keep expanding. They are buying more parking lots in distant towns and have successfully fought taxes by threatening to move elsewhere. They have transferred some of their operations to the Internet. And auctions still supply the bulk of the inventory for used-car superstores.
Top auction executives are confident that no one will figure out a more efficient way to gather up used cars that have been turned in, sort them and send them on to new owners. "We understand that bypass attempts have taken place -- we're not worried about it," said G. Dennis Berry, Manheim's president and chief executive.
AUTO auctions are held across the country, but throughout the used-car business, this small Pennsylvania town is the place to be on Fridays. Dealers fly here from all over, often in private planes. "It's the place where everybody can find what they're looking for," said Robert H. Gussack, a wholesaler of used Mercedes vehicles in Massapequa, N.Y., who charters a flight here every week with several new-car dealers on Long Island.
Four local businessmen started the Manheim auction in a barn in 1945. Civilian production of new cars had just resumed after a three-year interruption during World War II, and millions of Americans began selling their used cars. Unlike many auction houses that grew up at the same time, the auction specialized in late-model, high-priced cars with few problems.
Its business has exploded since the late 1980's, as rental cars and then off-lease cars poured into the market in record numbers. The company said it auctioned an average of 9,195 cars and trucks a week here last year, mostly on Fridays, compared with 1,200 a week in 1986. (Just under half go unsold because the final bid does not meet the seller's minimum.)
While some auctions have tried to lure dealers with liquor or beautiful models, Manheim has prospered by offering a serious, conservative atmosphere. No alcoholic beverages are served and virtually no one brings his own. The auctioneers are almost all gray-haired men.
"If you have a young woman near a car, you're going to have people coming from 20 lanes around," which disrupts the normal flow of business, said M. Gregory Gehman, the general manager of the auction.
"What's more, I'm a Christian, and many of the people here are, and I wouldn't stand for that," he said.
The auction tries instead to attract buyers and sellers with hearty food. The 380-seat cafeteria does not sell only hot dogs and potato chips; there are also pork chops, smoked sausages and roast beef, at reasonable prices. Enormous helpings are ladled out by the cheerful women behind the steam counter, some of whom wear the white head coverings of the Mennonite and the Brethren, two Christian sects with many adherents in this part of Pennsylvania.
"I weighed 180 when I came here and now I weigh 240, and that's in 12 years," Mr. Gehman said before digging into a huge plate of macaroni and cheese.
But what really seems to excite the crowds are cars. When a bright red Corvette was driven up to one auction booth, men young and old swarmed from nearby lanes, eventually obscuring the car from view. They ran their hands over the body, popped the hood and checked the wheels. Only a few actually appeared to bid, though, and when the next car in line was a purple Saturn sedan, the crowd melted away.
The buyers and sellers tend to talk about making money, not their role in the auto industry. But auto executives and economists say the auctions have a powerful influence. Without the auctions, it would be harder for used-car buyers to find sellers, and this would drive prices down. If used cars were worth less at trade-in, fewer Americans would be able to afford new cars, the sales of which account for 4 percent of the nation's economic output.
George E. Hoffer, an economist at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in automotive retailing, said used-car auctions should be used in textbooks to illustrate economic efficiency. The auctions have thousands of buyers and sellers, and the auction fees are relatively small, typically several hundred dollars a vehicle, he noted, adding, "The used-car market at wholesale is almost perfectly competitive."
WHILE the Manheim auction's efficiency may please buyers and sellers, its growth is angering local residents. With up to 26,000 cars at a time awaiting sale or repair, the auction is constantly scrambling for more parking. Just to move cars around and drive them through the auction lanes, the company employs 600 drivers, mostly retirees who work on Thursdays, when a small auction is held, and on Fridays.
Brian Cain, owner of Cain's Lanes, a 12-lane bowling alley up the street from the auction, said the huge business was a mixed blessing for the town. "I'm afraid it could make people afraid of moving here because of all the traffic," he said. "Sure they create jobs, but who wants to live around just cars? Already, on Thursdays and Fridays, the traffic is just insane."
The auction company, however, worries more about satisfying dealers like Victor Moes, who owns a used-car lot in Richmond. Mr. Moes recalled that when he once took the rare step of disputing an arbitration ruling, Mr. Gehman decided on the spot that the auction would buy the defective car so that neither the buyer nor the seller would lose money -- even though the car was a $47,000 Ferrari.
"He just wrote the check like he was buying me lunch," Mr. Moes marveled.
 
So, How Much Did the Car Cost?
AUCTIONS provide an easy way for dealers to buy and sell used cars at the open-market price. But they don't offer the average American the inside skinny on used-car prices.
The auctions track every sale, but like the auctions themselves, the data are reserved for industry professionals -- and are often expensive even for them.
For example, copies of the widely employed Kelley Blue Book of used-car prices, published every two months, sell for $9.95. But Kelley's on-line service for professionals, with the latest auction prices, costs $329 a year, plus $100 a month for the first 50 vehicles checked.
There are many used-car pricing services available to the public on the Internet; five, including Kelley, are available free at www.autobytel.com. Such services, however, typically smooth over short-term swings in auction prices. The services use adjustments based on recent bulk sales, historical experience and personal judgment.
Blue Book wholesale prices are typically a little higher than auction prices; they reflect the auction price plus the cost of transportation, cleaning and repairs, said Charles Vogelheim, the book's editor.
Car auction companies are leery of upsetting dealers by releasing daily or weekly prices to the public. "That frankly begins to give them inside information on what a dealer may have bought a car for," said George Largay, the marketing director for one such company, ADT Automotive. "We have to be really careful -- the dealers are our bread and butter." KEITH BRADSHER

HEADLINE: The World: Everybody Knew. Now They Care.;
Out of the Nuclear Closet

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PROUDLY ripping off a veil last week, India removed the artificial ambiguity from what the world already knew -- that it could produce and deploy nuclear weapons. But if everyone already knew, why all the fuss?
The answers lie in the particular roles that fear and hypocrisy play in international relations. 
 While countries, like people, may plan quietly for what they fear, they must plan publicly for what they can no longer pretend not to know. And that makes a big difference in the pressure for an arms race.
Few Governments, for example, credited India's 1974 promises, when it first tested a nuclear device, that its program was only for peaceful purposes. But now no country can afford to doubt India's intention to build a nuclear arsenal.
"India's tests matter because every public act of nuclear danger generates a chain reaction of public acts by others," said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies security. "Every veil removed from nuclear weaponry creates new military requirements, and when they are generated in one country, they are generated in neighboring countries."
Joseph Cirincione, director of the Nonproliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment, is nearly distraught that India is shredding the global nonproliferation regime, which was designed to freeze the technology of nuclear weapons.
"This is really the difference between containing a problem and having it spin out of control," he said. "With India's test, the nonproliferation regime we've built for the last 35 years hit an iceberg."
 
Fear Yields Pressure
The main stimulus comes from pressure for vulnerable countries to respond in kind. "You increase the threat, which increases fear, which increases the threat that other people will act on those fears," Mr. Cirincione said.
Officials in Washington are desperately trying to persuade Pakistan to reap the diplomatic and global benefits of restraint. But few officials think Pakistan's Government will be able to resist public pressure to test. A test would mean that weaker, smaller Pakistan will also be hit with American sanctions that would seriously hurt its economy and could destabilize the state.
The competition among India, Pakistan and China has entered a new and dangerous stage, Mr. Krepon said. Nuclear tests create a set of new military requirements, from better satellite and radar networks to intensified missile development. And those programs, notes Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official in the Bush Administration who is now with the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, draw scarce money in poor countries.
Mr. Cirincione says "the whole region is a nuclear powder keg, and India just lit the fuse." The arc of responses runs from China to Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and Egypt. "All those countries are connected," he said. "They all have, want to have or have thought about having nuclear weapons programs."
In a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen was explicit. "There will be other countries that see this as an open invitation to try to acquire this technology," he said. "We have a real proliferation problem that's taking place globally. This is only going to contribute to that."
India's test had an impact on American politics, too, with Republican senators citing it as they pushed a bill mandating a nationwide missile defense. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina even referred to India as "an emerging nuclear threat to the territory of the United States."
The Senators, citing the unreliability of international treaties in restraining other countries, emphasized the need for America to depend solely on its own weapons for national security. That is an exact echo of the argument cited by India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party when it went ahead with these tests, Mr. Cirincione noted.
The hope seems to be that a vigorous global response will shake India from its fever before contagion spreads.
"This act of strategic defiance is not the real India, and it won't last," Mr. Krepon said. "They'll get hammered diplomatically and economically. It is so contrary to Indian self-interest that it cannot be sustained over time."
Mr. Sokolski said: "This is not India's proudest moment. It was better off with Gandhi and the peace stuff."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Roaming Near Home For Plays In a Region

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
HERE'S an idea for a fund: Find one of the most economically depressed areas of the country. Then invest most of the fund's assets there.
That is the premise behind the new Bullfinch Fund Western New York Series. Of course, if you are not a big Buffalo Bills fan or planning to take a chain of spicy-chicken-wing restaurants public, some skepticism may be in order. 
 Bullfinch Western New York is one of a quirky group called regional funds, which cull their stocks from various areas around the United States. Most have lackluster records, though there is at least one high-profile winner among them. Franklin California Growth I has beaten its peer group of mid-cap growth funds over the last three- and five-year periods, according to Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
But Buffalo is not Silicon Valley. The 14 counties in the region have unemployment rates as high as 9.6 percent, almost twice the national average.
The Western New York Series owns stocks of companies with an economic presence in those counties. A company can be eligible if it employs just 50 people in the region, is based there or has a capital investment there of more than $1 million.
That gives the fund a lot of leeway. Christopher Carosa, president of Carosa, Stanton & DePaolo Asset Management which runs the fund from Honeoye Falls, N.Y., south of Rochester, says managers can choose from more than 250 companies, including Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart and McDonald's.
Mr. Carosa defends the logic of seeking investors in the area's businesses. "There are a lot of people from west New York with a lot of pride in the region," he said, adding that he feels he can offer competitive returns and more. "Our long-term strategy is giving back to the community."
Mr. Carosa currently owns 20 stocks. His top three holdings are Hartmarx, the Chicago-based clothing maker with a manufacturing plant in the region; Comptek Research, a company based in Orchard Park, N.Y., that provides simulation software to the military, and American Precision Industries of Cheektowaga, N.Y., which makes motor control and heat transfer equipment. The no-load fund, with assets of under $1 million, has an annual expense ratio of 2 percent. It is currently available only to residents of New York state. Go Bills.

HEADLINE: A Homecoming At Fannie Mae;
Franklin Raines Takes Charge Of a Most Political Company

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS a child in Seattle in the 50's and 60's, Franklin D. Raines saw his father build the family a house with his own hands.
"Five years it took him," Mr. Raines said of his father, Delno, who worked most of his adult life as a janitor. "He dug the foundation by hand. He built the frame. He bought a house that the state was going to tear down for a highway and he pulled it apart for the materials. He could only build as he and my mother earned money. It was an incredible process he went through." 
 To have such an emotional connection to a home may serve Mr. Raines well as he leaves his post this week as White House budget chief to take over Fannie Mae, the curious and huge Washington corporation whose Government-mandated mission is to encourage homeownership, especially among low- and moderate-income working people.
But Mr. Raines, 49, will need more than misty memories to succeed in the company's top jobs, which he will formally assume at the end of this year after a transition period in which he will be chairman and chief executive-designate under the outgoing chairman, James A. Johnson.
Although it doesn't make mortgage loans, Fannie Mae is the dominant force in the nation's housing finance industry, helping to keep mortgage rates low by serving as a bridge between lenders on Main Street and the vast pools of capital available on Wall Street. By buying mortgages up to a certain level -- currently $227,150 -- from lenders and holding them as an investment or selling them in the huge secondary market, it has not only helped make more mortgage financing available, but has also built a steadily profitable business for its shareholders and enriched its top executives.
Because much of its success can be tied to financial advantages stemming from its roots as a Government agency, Fannie Mae has a huge interest in holding off political attacks on its franchise. Indeed, the company plays hardball politics with tremendous sophistication to defend its interests. Mr. Raines will have no choice but to continue the practice as the company comes under continued intense scrutiny in Congress, where there are periodic attempts by free-market conservatives to strip it of the advantages it holds over more traditional financial institutions.
He will also have to find ways to keep the mortgage business, and Fannie Mae's earnings, growing at a time when middle-class homeownership rates may be peaking and further expansion of the housing market will have to come from groups -- black and Hispanic families, immigrants and single people -- that traditionally have been far less likely to buy houses. And he will need to lure them into homes without loosening credit standards in a way that endangers investors' regard for Fannie Mae.
But in taking over the company, Mr. Raines will be confronting some personal challenges, too. As the first black chief executive of one of the nation's 100 largest corporations -- Fannie Mae ranks 33d on the Fortune 500 in revenue and first in asset size -- he will, more than ever, assume the status of pioneer and role model, with all the pressure, responsibility and opportunity that goes with it.
Indeed, he is at the leading edge of a wave of black executives who have fast been rising toward top corporate jobs, many of them in finance. These peers include Kenneth I. Chenault, the heir apparent to Harvey Golub as chief executive at American Express; Thomas W. Jones, a vice chairman at Travelers Group who is expected to emerge with a key role after the company's planned merger with Citicorp, and Richard D. Nanula, formerly the chief financial officer at the Walt Disney Company, who was recently named president and chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts.
"It's part of my job to insure that the path I've been able to follow can be followed by other black kids," Mr. Raines said. "There are a lot of shoulders I get to stand on. I need to provide a hand and shoulders for others to follow."
At the same time, Mr. Raines will be making a leap from supporting player onto center stage, where his company's successes and failures will be seen as his own and where the exercise of power becomes much trickier than amid the Byzantine passages of White House staff work.
Polished, poised and articulate, he is also cautious and reserved. While a respected voice in internal White House debates and a frequent spokesman for the Administration on the Sunday news programs, he often seemed most comfortable working in the background, helping to forge consensus and execute policy. He has yet to show the flair that Mr. Johnson has deployed in selling Fannie Mae's agenda to its diverse constituencies through sound-bite-friendly initiatives like his commitment to back $1 trillion of mortgages to low- and middle-income borrowers by the end of this decade.
"I don't claim to have any big ideas going in the door," Mr. Raines said. "There will be a need to innovate, but the goal will be the same -- steady, double-digit earnings growth along with steady progress in meeting the company's public mission."
Still, in almost every other way, Mr. Raines comes so well prepared for the job that his selection, announced last month, seemed all but inevitable.
As director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, he was often the point man for the Administration in political and policy battles with the Republican leadership in Congress, including the successful negotiations last year on a plan to balance the Federal budget. In short, Mr. Raines knows how Washington works as well as anyone.
He proved himself a sufficiently skilled operator to be considered for the job of White House chief of staff last year, but took himself out of the running because of the demands the job would have put on his wife, Wendy, and their three young daughters. Before announcing last month that he would leave for Fannie Mae, he was widely seen as the leading candidate to become the next Treasury Secretary if Robert E. Rubin were to leave before the end of President Clinton's second term.
Having served as Fannie Mae's vice chairman for five years before joining the Administration in 1996, Mr. Raines knows Fannie Mae and its business and is highly regarded by Mr. Johnson and the rest of the company's management team for his mastery of the most arcane details of its operations and technology. And, in financial circles, he is well known for his dozen years on Wall Street, starting in 1979. During that time, he helped Felix G. Rohatyn build a substantial business for Lazard Freres & Company in providing financial advice to cities and states in fiscal trouble.
Charles A. Gabriel Jr., an analyst in Washington for Prudential Securities who has watched Mr. Raines at work both in the business and political worlds, said: "It would be easy to dismiss him as a politically gifted, politically correct individual. But he is much more than that. He is perfect for Fannie Mae."
BUT there is no minimizing his political skill. When Mr. Raines is introduced during public appearances as a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, he sometimes tells the audience that he is also a graduate of A.F.D.C. -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children, better known as welfare.
"I grew up in a working-class family, an intact family," Mr. Raines said in an interview. "My parents raised seven of us, six boys and a girl, one a cousin who grew up with us after his mother died. We had all the problems working-class families have."
For example, he said, "if somebody loses a job, things are fundamentally different" -- just how different he found out as a young boy. His father, who had been working at the Boeing Company, fell ill and was hospitalized for an extended period, unable to support the family. For two years the Raineses were on welfare.
When Delno Raines recovered, he took whatever jobs he could get. Mr. Raines remembers being 9 or 10 years old and accompanying his father to work late one summer, picking beans in the fields outside Seattle.
"You'd get picked up at 2 o'clock in the morning down on Skid Row," Mr. Raines said. "You'd start picking when the sun came up, and you'd finish at 4. A grown man could earn $10 a day. A kid could earn $5, plus all the beans you could bring home."
His father eventually went back to work full time as a custodian for the city of Seattle, and his mother, Ida, worked for years as a cleaning woman at Boeing. Mr. Raines distinguished himself at the city's Franklin High School, where he was student body president, captain of the football team and state debate champion, and then went off to Harvard and a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University.
But his childhood brush with life on the financial brink continues to resonate in both his politics and his personality. Within the Administration Mr. Raines has been a strong voice for maintaining a social safety net for working families, most recently staking out a position against any wholesale privatization of Social Security. He also found himself motivated to build financial security for himself and his family -- something that his multimillion-dollar annual paychecks from his first stint at Fannie Mae helped him achieve. His new job could pay him as much as $7 million a year, versus the $151,500 he has earned at the White House.
"It made me quite sensitive to issues of personal and financial security," Mr. Raines said of his upbringing. "That probably made me very conservative in my own financial dealings and also made me worry a lot about people and the ordinary vicissitudes of life and how things can be great and then all of a sudden you're out in the street."
Mr. Raines received his introduction to national politics in 1969, at age 20, when he worked in the Nixon White House. Along with two other interns, he prepared a report for the President on the causes and patterns of youth unrest around the country as anger grew about the Vietnam War. In September of that year, Mr. Raines met with Mr. Nixon and his entire Cabinet to deliver a carefully documented -- if coolly received -- analysis of what was happening on the nation's campuses.
"It was really a very significant thing, a 20-year-old standing before the President of the United States and telling him things he didn't want to hear," said Stephen Hess, who was Mr. Raines's boss in the White House and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "He had shown how meticulous he was as a scholar and how cool he was. It was always in my mind that Frank would become the first black President of the United States."
SO far, though, Mr. Raines has been drawn not to elective office, but rather to jobs at the intersection of business, economic policy and politics -- positions that have played to his strength in quietly building relationships.
Fannie Mae, formerly the Federal National Mortgage Association, was established by Mr. Raines's namesake, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as a New Deal agency with the job of maintaining an adequate supply of mortgage financing. During the 1960's it was transformed into a shareholder-owned corporation. That began a period of rapid growth in which Fannie Mae played a dominant role in the development of the secondary mortgage market, which allows mortgages to be traded like securities.
In recent years, under Mr. Johnson, a prominent Democrat who ran Walter F. Mondale's 1984 Presidential campaign, Fannie Mae has established itself as perhaps the most politically astute of big corporations. By hiring some of the best lobbyists in town, spreading campaign contributions around and relentlessly selling members of Congress on what Fannie Mae is doing to help homebuyers in their states and districts, it has consolidated and exploited the advantages granted to it by Washington. At the same time, it has shaken up the housing finance industry by attacking a wide variety of impediments to homeownership, from discrimination to high closing costs.
The company has repeatedly neutralized efforts to re-examine or scale back the benefits of its Government-chartered status, including its exemption from state and local income taxes and the widely held assumption -- nowhere written down -- that the Government would bail out Fannie Mae if it ever got into financial trouble.
But the challenges to its interests continue to come fast and furious. Right now, the company is battling a proposal that would increase the size of the mortgages that could be insured by the Federal Housing Administration, so-called F.H.A. loans.
If approved by Congress, the change would move the Goverment more directly into the moderate-income market that is the heart of Fannie Mae's business. It would also raise further questions about why the Federal Government needs to have any special relationship with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, its Washington-chartered competitor.
Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raines no doubt understands full well the power of well-placed campaign contributions. (Fannie Mae gave a total of $378,873 to candidates for Federal office and national party groups in the run-up to the November 1996 elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the current election cycle, its gifts so far total $281,578.) Fannie Mae has mastered the art of grabbing Congress's attention by running special housing programs in the districts of key lawmakers -- and, further, so linking itself to the cause of homeownership that opposing the company seems almost un-American.
"Fannie Mae was created because of the national policy to favor homeownership and housing in the allocation of scarce capital," Mr. Raines said. "You'll always have people arguing that you shouldn't favor any use of capital. If the public policy changes, then there will be an incentive to change Fannie Mae's charter. But until it changes, even the brightest person is going to have trouble showing how to favor homeownership without an institution like Fannie Mae and without costing the Government anything."
Fannie Mae's ability to increase its profits from investing in and trading mortgages depends on growth in mortgage lending -- and, by implication, in homeownership.
Yet while home sales set records each of the last two years, the most robust parts of the market are reaching the saturation point. Among white people, the homeownership rate is 72 percent and unlikely to go much higher. If there is going to be significant growth in coming years, it will have to come from black people, who have a homeownership rate of 44 percent, or Hispanic people, whose rate is 42 percent.
SO Fannie Mae has concentrated on what it can do to make it easier for those groups and others, including immigrants and single people, to buy homes. For example, it distributes literature in nine languages to help immigrants understand how the real estate business works in the United States.
The company recently introduced a program that allows lenders to offer mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent to borrowers considered good credit risks, a structure intended to help single working mothers and others who have trouble saving the traditional down payment of 10 to 20 percent.
To Mr. Raines, broadening the ideal of home ownership and insuring Fannie Mae's continued success require a combination of financial engineering and concerted attacks on barriers to home ownership.
"Discrimination, high transaction costs, lack of information -- all those barriers have to be continually knocked down," Mr. Raines said. "As you knock one down, the next is harder to do."
Mr. Raines said that he was leaving the White House with some reluctance but that he has no plans to get back into politics -- at least beyond politics as it is played by Fannie Mae.
"This opportunity came too early as far as I was concerned," Mr. Raines said of Fannie Mae's offer. "But these opportunities don't come very frequently. Here was a company I knew. The board knew me. It's a job that opens up every 10 years or so. It was a case of being pulled to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity rather than jumping or being pushed."
