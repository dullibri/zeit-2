HEADLINE: From Necessity, New Forest Industry Rises

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: MAD RIVER, Calif.

 BODY:
It was a charmless stand of scrubby black oak that Louie Myers strode into as dusk settled on Mad River Ridge the other day. But his eyes lit up. They began to dart. He scanned the wood like any animal-world forager, and he smiled.
Asked what so captivated him in the sparse growth typical of these remote Northern California mountains, he declared: "I see money. Lots of money. And I don't have to cut down a single tree to get it!" 
 On one tree trunk, Mr. Myers found a luxurious bed of moss, the kind that stores need in bulk for their Easter baskets. On a low branch hung salable strands of usnea moss, a natural antibiotic. The ponderosa pine nearby could provide decorative boughs at $3 a bunch, he said, and the burl of a fallen oak would fetch a decent sum from furniture-makers.
"There's 10 different items here but you're not going to see them unless you know what you're looking for," said Mr. Myers, a 45-year-old Vietnam veteran and rural jack-of-all-trades. "Like, there's yarrow all over the place."
His skill goes back to the hunters and gatherers at the dawn of humanity, but it has been resurrected under a trendy new name: wildcrafting. And, researchers and the people of this depressed logging region say, it has a promising new postindustrial future, as a way to help forest communities around the country get by as lumber jobs evaporate.
Harvesting the forests' riches without cutting the trees is already an industry that brings in hundreds of millions of dollars a year nationwide, experts say. Though it is by no means a replacement for the financial heft of the lumber industry, wildcrafting began to take off at the same time that court and Government decisions began to curtail logging on public land sharply in the early 1990's, and it is now looked to as a modest economic life preserver for some of the rural unemployed, particularly here in the Northwest.
For part-time gatherers like Mr. Myers, wildcrafting can provide a welcome injection of cash: surveying the stand of black oak, he estimated optimistically that he could pull $20 worth of forest products out of it in less than half an hour. The revenue is considerably more for the processors and sellers.
The market for forest products other than trees has mushroomed by nearly 20 percent annually over the last several years, estimates Catherine Mater, an expert on the forest industry. The growth is fueled particularly by the exploding popularity of alternative medicine and herbal remedies, she said, citing projections that United States sales of medicinal herbs, which totaled $1.5 billion in 1995, would reach $5 billion in 2000.
"I feel like when I go into a forest system now, it's like watching a fast-paced Ping-Pong set," said Ms. Mater, who works for the family concern of Mater Engineering of Corvallis, Ore. "I'm seeing so many things I never saw before."
In 1995, American exports of commercial moss and lichen alone amounted to $14 million, said Nan Vance, a United States Forestry Service scientist who studies wildcrafting under the more prosaic title "non-timber forest products."
And that is only a tiny corner of a category that includes ferns and shrubs for floral arrangements, Christmas greens, foods like mushrooms and more than 100 medicinal herbs with names like feverfew and St. John's wort.
Rare wild ginseng can bring up to $400 a pound, Ms. Vance said, and some forest mushrooms are so valuable that they have sparked violence and gang attacks among the Asian, Hispanic and white harvesters who follow the Northwest's "mushroom trail," mainly in summer and fall.
Wildcrafting is especially attractive to forest communities because in the long-smoldering conflict between conservationists and lumber companies, it is part of an evolving middle way.
"We're scrambling," said Lynn Jungwirth, a community advocate and resident of the nearby town of Hay Fork, where a lumber mill is about to close and leave more than 100 unemployed. "We're saying, 'Let us be the stewards, and get some of the product and hit the niche markets. We have to re-create our own economic base.' "
Here in northern California's Trinity County, where nearly 90 percent of the land is Government-owned forest, dozens of people, most formerly dependent on income from the lumber industry, are in effect beating their chain saws into pruning scissors, following the example of counterparts in Washington and Oregon.
"It's a good ethical thing to be doing," said Irene Hetrick, a supervisor at Blue Heron Botanicals in Mad River. "We're not hurting anything or polluting -- and we can make a living at it."
Blue Heron, part of the 30-member High Mountain Herb Cooperative, buys the discoveries of Mr. Myers, among others, and markets more than 50 types of herbs. "We had 17 people full time last year, three of them women who would have been on welfare otherwise," Ms. Hetrick said.
The American Indians who once inhabited these woods knew intimately the properties of each growing thing. Yet the Forest Service, which requires that wildcrafters on public lands have permits, is still studying how much of the forest products can be harvested without harm.
Forest rangers and environmentalists worry that the lure of big money from top-dollar products like mushrooms is leading to over-harvesting -- much of it illegal -- and trampling that damages the forest floor.
"We're really at the very beginning here," said Yvonne Everett, an ecologist studying the potential of wildcrafting around Hay Fork. "We're very unsophisticated, and the most important piece is that the Native American knowledge here is about wiped out."
With Federal and private grants to aid communities hurt by logging cutbacks, farmers in Mad River are also experimenting with cultivating forest herbs, as on the acreage that 72-year-old Millie Pollard has planted mainly with echinacea, an herb that is said to bolster resistance to disease and whose seeds can bring more than $100 a pound.
The herb appears to be thriving, but Ms. Pollard said that if she were a bit more spry, she would be venturing into the woods to gather the stuff instead of trying to grow it.
"If I were young, I'd be head over heels into the wildcrafting," she said. "You're out, you're grubbing from daylight to dark, you're seeing all kinds of new places all the time."
For all the primitivist fun of it, researchers say, wildcrafting, like many agricultural occupations, is unlikely to provide much more than subsistence-level income for those who do the gathering. But the market could take off with improved processing and refrigeration.
In the short term, Ms. Everett said, wildcrafting "is not going to make a big difference."
"But in the long term," she said, "it's the direction we're going in, and we'll manage the forest more holistically, moving away from a lumber monoculture. In the long run, it's going to be economically very, very important to forest communities."
Wildcrafters like Mr. Myers are often in the woods and at conferences, learning what is what and -- as they put it -- making up for all those years when they could not see the forest for the trees.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRATS;
The President and His Party Seem Closer After Past Battles

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The relationship between President Clinton and his fellow Democrats in the House has, from time to time, read like a case study in "Can this marriage be saved?"
There were bad feelings on both sides from the 1992 campaign, the 1993 budget battle, the 1994 health care debacle and various miscellaneous slights and slips in between. But last year's budget struggle and the approach of the election has, by many accounts, brought the two sides closer. 
 Democrats on Capitol Hill still have jitters, worried that the White House will act first and foremost to protect its own political interests. But they also recognize that to a large extent, their fates are linked.
"We're not talking about a traditional political marriage here at all," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "This is much more about understanding where their interests are in common."
As Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia, puts it, "While we have our differences and our different operating styles, we are lashed to one another."
To begin with, Democrats need a net gain of about 20 seats to reclaim control of the House, and a big, enthusiastic Democratic turnout for the Presidential campaign could help turn the tide in many of the more competitive districts. Mark Gersh, a Democratic analyst, said that would be particularly true in the Pacific Northwest, New York and parts of New England -- parts of the Democratic base where the President will do especially well if he is successful nationally.
The idea of Presidential coattails is often much maligned, but Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the Connecticut Democrat, said, "I used to be Secretary of State in my state, and I know the numbers. Your fates are tied, no question about it."
Congressional Democrats also learned last fall just how valuable the Presidency can be in carrying their message; public opinion took a significant turn when Mr. Clinton took up the Democratic indictment of the Republican budget as too extreme and too stringent with Medicare, education and the environment.
"We worked for nine months to get the Medicare message out there," Mr. Wise said. "It was beginning to percolate, but when the President picked it up, it just flew."
Officials at the Democratic National Committee continue to meet regularly with House and Senate Democrats and the White House to coordinate their message.
They are also combining efforts on fund raising. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Gore are the House Democrats' best draws as they struggle to raise money as a minority for the first time in 40 years. "The President is doing everything that we've asked him to do," said Representative Martin Frost, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "He did a New York event for us that raised somewhere between $1.5 and $1.9 million. He did an event for us in Washington that raised half a million."
That rapprochement stands in sharp contrast with the experience of 1994, when many Congressional Democrats felt they had paid a harsh price for the President's unpopularity and his handling of issues like health care and gays in the military. Dozens of Republicans ran campaign commercials of Democratic members metamorphosing into Mr. Clinton, and the President was considered a drag on the Democratic ticket in much of the country. Today, Mr. Clinton's political health is much improved.
For all of that, Democrats on Capitol Hill still worry. Many would like to see the President put more emphasis on the economic security issues that House Democrats hope to make the centerpiece of their campaigns. "Their reluctance is a source of some frustration," said one House Democratic strategist.
Big tactical differences could also evolve as the election approaches. For example, the Democrats need to hold on to some open seats in the conservatively realigning South, but it is entirely possible that the Presidential campaign will decide to write off some Deep South states like Alabama -- although at this stage, talk of writing off any state is anathema to both parties.
Finally, there is the painful memory of "triangulation" -- the strategy that many Congressional Democrats detected on the part of the White House last year that involves distancing the President from his own party on Capitol Hill, positioning him as the centrist broker between the Congressional Democrats and Republicans.
At the root of all these fears is the issue posed by one strategist close to Congressional Democrats: "There's a real tension between whether Bill Clinton is going to run to build a Democratic majority or run to re-elect himself. He feels very strongly about establishing himself as a 'New Democrat.' What he should also appreciate is that having a bully pulpit could also articulate a message for the whole party."
In the end, though, many Democrats argue that the Republicans will drive the White House and the Democrats on Capitol Hill together, whether they like it or not.
"There's a much better feeling than there was six months ago," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. "As Republicans move to the extreme, the Democrats have much more in common. Having Gingrich as a foil has helped both Congressional Democrats and the President."

HEADLINE: Homecoming of Ethnic German Immigrants Sours

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: SOHREN, Germany

 BODY:
Emmi Schleicher arrived in Germany from her native Kazakstan six years ago and thought she had finally come home to the land her ancestors left over two centuries ago. Since then, she has learned a painful lesson.
As an ethnic German in Kazakstan, she said, she faced nationalist hostility among Kazaks who called her a foreigner. Now she confronts another kind of animosity from Germans who do not accept her as a German and who say she and others like her receive social benefits they do not deserve. 
 "In Kazakstan they said we were Germans and should go back to Germany," said Mrs. Schleicher, 32, who was a librarian in Almaty, Kazakstan, and collects admission at a public swimming pool in this small town in western Germany. "Now we are in Germany and people here curse us as 'the Russians.' "
She is not alone. Since the late 1980's, in one of Europe's greatest population shifts since the end of the cold war, more than a million ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union have taken advantage of German laws permitting them to reclaim full citizenship, and thus automatic access to Germany's bountiful welfare system that provides unemployment pay, housing allowances and state pensions.
But their arrival has coincided with economic straits for many Germans, who are facing record unemployment at a time when the abundance of social benefits is being called into question. A result has been a greater readiness among Germans to attribute their woes to their immigrant kin, and an equal readiness among politicians to play to those passions for votes.
The animosity threatens Germany's social fabric with perhaps the most emotional collision of identities since neo-Nazis rampaged against foreigners, particularly the country's two million Turks, after reunification in 1990.
"Burning houses have shown that the readiness to accept people is not without limits," Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said, referring to attacks on foreigners elsewhere in Germany. With three important state elections scheduled for March 24, he is campaigning for limits on immigration by ethnic Germans.
The hostility has a particular twist here in Sohren, a town south of Coblenz where many of the 1,200 immigrant Germans have moved into apartments vacated when some 15,000 United States troops and their dependents pulled out from the nearby Hahn air base two years ago.
"For 40 years we lived in good, neighborly relations with the Americans," said Heinz Michel, Sohren's Mayor for the last 22 years. "But right now, all these people moving in at once is just too much."
For many of the new arrivals, the hostility has come as a shock after the upheaval and persecution their families faced since 1941, when Stalin banished them to Siberia and Central Asia to punish them for Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.
Throughout the cold war, German leaders routinely campaigned for the right of ethnic Germans to return home. German governments even paid millions of dollars to the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu to allow ethnic Germans to leave Romania.
West Germany even made it a constitutional right for ethnic Germans to acquire full German citizenship, even though it had been 200 years since the czars invited Germans to Russia, where they were prized for their agricultural skills and organization.
The end of the cold war changed the equation.
German reunification cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. An economic slowdown added to unemployment and strained the state's ability to finance pensions and other social benefits. The opening of Eastern Europe's frontiers threatened Germany with an unchecked flow of poor migrants. Hostility to outsiders inspired the German authorities to enact a string of laws to keep the numbers of foreigners -- and ethnic Germans -- within tight limits.
Since Jan. 1, 1993, the number of immigrant Germans accepted in Germany has been limited by law to 220,000 a year. And now Mr. Lafontaine wants that number halved, a demand that has struck a responsive chord among many Germans. One recent opinion survey said about 70 percent of Germans support his campaign.
The end of the cold war also meant a drastic reduction in the number of American forces in Germany. At the height of the cold war, American military personnel stationed in Germany numbered around 250,000. Now the total is 76,000.
In Sohren, where the original inhabitants number some 2,000, the American presence injected thousands of jobs and $180 million a year into the local economy. When the last Americans left two years ago, Mayor Michel said, "we became poor."
The arrival of the immigrant ethnic Germans, by contrast, has produced only a sense of division and strain. In the area surrounding Sohren, immigrant German children already outnumber the children of the original inhabitants in some schools. Five new kindergartens have been built, and resentment has grown.
"They have a completely different mentality," Mayor Michel said of the immigrant Germans. "They have trouble with the language. Most of them have no work. The living standards we have are totally strange to them. We have no jobs to offer them."
Neither do they shop, visit the bars or spend money as the Americans did, people at several stores on the town's main street said.
Mayor Michel said that when Mr. Lafontaine brought the issue into the public spotlight, "he destroyed the only little bit of reconciliation that had happened in this town."
Indeed, in other places where immigrant ethnic Germans are housed in former NATO barracks until they find homes, German officials worry that disaffected young men among them, speaking no German, are rapidly forming a crime-prone underclass that will arouse even greater German hostility.
In her new three-level house that she shares with 10 other people from two generations of in-laws, Mrs. Schleicher does not see it that way.
"Our people are disappointed, upset, confused," she said, speaking only slightly accented German. "They are people who have lost themselves. Here, they thought they would find a home where they wouldn't be discriminated against. But they have been disappointed."
Her father-in-law, Johannes Schleicher, 69, a former truck driver, seemed to agree. In 1941, he said, he and his family were ordered out of the autonomous republic set up for ethnic Germans in the Volga region and sent to Siberia. They built a house, he said, but then the family was sent on to Kazakstan. They built a house there, too.
Now, propelled by anti-German sentiment in Kazakstan and lured by the better economic prospects here, he has come to Germany. So the family pooled their pensions, their wages and their own labor to build yet again. "Where am I supposed to go?" Mr. Schleicher said. "Back to the Volga? The Russians don't want us there."
Such was Germany's desire in the early 1990's to avert massive immigration of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union that Bonn offered tens of millions of dollars to Moscow to rebuild its onetime republic on the Volga. That plan foundered on the refusal of Russians now living there to give up their land and the reluctance of ethnic Germans to return.
According to official statistics, the immigrant ethnic Germans as a social group are notably younger than average in Germany's aging society, meaning that they draw proportionately less in pensions and contribute more to the work-force paying social security contributions.
At the same time, the statistics suggest that unemployment last year among immigrant ethnic Germans, while disproportionately high in some areas like Sohren, was lower than the average in states like Baden-Wurttemberg, where the most contested of the March 24 state elections is taking place.
In Mrs. Schleicher's neat living room, with its new furniture, its television and a garden gnome as decoration, the perception is different.
Sure, the older people said, they are drawing pensions of around $900 a month -- 30 percent less than the German average -- to which they have made no direct contribution. But they said their children wanted to work and pay their dues, even with jobs other Germans would not look at, and well below what they were qualified to do in the Soviet Union.
"People say we've brought unemployment here," said Olga Borge, another immigrant. "But the Germans who come here from Kazakstan want to work. If there's work and they can get it, they do it, whatever it is. Sometimes, it makes you weep."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Looking to San Francisco Voters To Send Message to Steinbrenner

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
There are two enormously appealing arguments for the proposed 42,000-seat baseball park at San Francisco's China Basin: one, a 335-foot home run down the right-field line will splash into the bay, and two, the $255 million park will be built entirely with private money. If voters clear the way by granting a zoning exemption on Tuesday, perhaps we can also consider the plan a message to New York: Let George Steinbrenner pay for his own sandbox.
In fact, the Giants' president, Peter A. Magowan, recently told a business meeting in San Francisco that other owners who "conned money out of the cities that they're in . . . and those who are planning to con money" were rooting against the plan. 
 Of course, Magowan has his back to the water. Even under threat of the team's leaving, San Francisco voters have rejected -- four times -- stadium plans that would cost them money. The club had one foot in Tampa, Fla., in 1992, when Magowan, an owner of the Safeway stores, put together a group that bought the team and kept it in Candlestick Park.
He also put together a China Basin coalition that included a prominent gay liberal female politician, a conservative straight male politician and a leading black clergyman. Winning is still no sure thing.
"Nothing comes easily in San Francisco," said Magowan. "It's a skeptical, fragmented city. It took 20 years to decide to build the Golden Gate Bridge. But after the fabulous success of ball parks in Baltimore, Cleveland and Denver, people can see that something can be good for the economy, which appeals to nonsports fans, and still be nice for fans."
Maybe. Economists like Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College insist that teams merely divert entertainment dollars and don't really bring in torrents of fresh cash, as owners, including Magowan, claim. However, economists like Roger G. Noll of Stanford say that teams do boost a community psychologically, and may stimulate other investment.
The edifice complex is the disorder of the season. In Cincinnati, the Citizens for a Major League Future asserted that Schott City would be so much bratwurst without the Reds, and last week won public financing of new baseball and football stadiums. In Detroit, the battle still rages over replacing historic Tiger Stadium with a modern ball park that will supposedly revive downtown and certainly make the owner, a pizza king, even richer. Dispatches also keep arriving from Boston, Seattle, Milwaukee and Minneapolis.
The Giants' approach is interesting, both financially and socially. The club began romancing the electorate in a highly enlightened way, sending players out on charitable missions, refurbishing inner-city fields and, most notably, becoming the first major professional sports organization to identify itself with the battle against AIDS. Players wore iron-on red ribbons and game proceeds went to research.
"That was something the city and baseball never saw before," said Magowan, "macho ballplayers with their arms around people with AIDS."
The financing model is based on successes in other sports. The first $100 million will be raised by selling concessions, the better seats and even the right to name the stadium. (Magowan is quick to remind purists that Wrigley is also a brand of chewing gum.) Many seats will be one-backside condos; an owner will be legally obligated to maintain the seat by paying the season-ticket price, but is free to sell it.
Once a guaranteed income stream is established, Magowan expects the rest of the stadium cost to be easily raised from lenders.
Meanwhile, as the opening of the baseball season looms with Steinbrenner's deadline for a stadium deal, the Yankees seem poised to scuttle down to a West Side Manhattan site or sideways to New Jersey. In either case, city or state taxpayer money will be used to help Steinbrenner make more money from luxury boxes, parking and concessions.
Comparing New York to San Francisco is useless, but comparing Steinbrenner to an owner who at least recognizes that community commitment is good business seems like a valid exercise. Magowan -- who, by the way, is no maverick, as he is on the owners' strategic planning committee and thinks the Fox TV alliance will bring the sport innovative publicity -- has said that a baseball team is like a public utility. It's a concept that leads to this: If we can demand moral standards from players and spectators, we certainly need their role models -- our most visible entrepreneurs -- to show us the way to waterfront property without stealing from the school, hospital, police and fire funds.
There are many reasons to wish the Giants a victory on Tuesday, one of them provincial -- as Steinbrenner comes barking and whining with his hand out again, we can tell him this time to put that hand in his own pocket first, or go splash in the bay.

HEADLINE: Fighting Poverty Programs;
Hartford Faces Vote to Bar New Nonprofit Services

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 23

 BODY:
While advocates for the poor say that more social-service programs mean more people turning their lives around, city leaders here have a different perspective: they say that more social service programs drain the economy, breed dependency and mean more poor people moving to Hartford, where one in four people is already on welfare.
Accordingly, the City Council has taken what many consider a hard-line approach to stem the growth of poverty: a six-month moratorium on all new homeless shelters, rehabilitation homes and other treatment or social-service centers. 
 With thousands of middle-class people having left Hartford in recent years and roughly one in 30 buildings abandoned, city officials complain that Hartford is being taken over by what one official calls "Poverty Inc., the social service industry." Although no one knows the total number of social-service agencies operating in the city, Hartford, which has one-fifth of the region's population, serves three-fifths of its needy in residential programs alone.
"We have more than our fair share," said Mayor Mike Peters, who described his city, the state capital, as "the dumping ground for every project for the needy."
The moratorium, which was approved last year, and a bill to broaden it, which faces a vote on Monday, have led to protests from service groups that say they are already struggling to meet the needs of the city's poor. With no definitive surveys, they dispute officials' claims that the poor are gravitating from other areas to take advantage of Hartford.
"I agree that it's time for other communities to step up to the plate, but that doesn't make it right for Hartford to erect barriers to people who need to be served," said Nancy Hroneck, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Hartford County.
The proposal comes as Hartford -- a city of 124,000 and the home of some of the nation's largest insurance companies -- is struggling to remain the prosperous hub that it was for more than two centuries. Known for its generous social services, the city has recently made it tougher to get welfare benefits and is questioning its traditional role as the region's social service center.
Hartford is certainly not alone in adopting strong measures to restrict the poor. Cities across the country, including Hartford, have barred panhandling and loitering. A recent study by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty found that at least 30 cities have used zoning and building codes to exclude service agencies.
Last year, Huntsville, Ala., used its code to close two shelters. St. Paul limited daytime centers for the homeless to onlythe heaviest commercial districts. Middletown, Conn., has a moratorium on mental health and substance abuse programs.
Two years ago, New York State stopped developing programs that offered extended stays to homeless families, and several New York City community boards are seeking a moratorium on group homes or shelters. It is unlikely that New York City could adopt a sweeping measure like Hartford's. "I don't doubt that some in the administration would love that kind of approach, but it's not transferable to the reality of New York," said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Democrat of Brooklyn who heads the Council's General Welfare Committee.
A moratorium, he noted, would clash with court orders that require New York City to find shelter for anyone in need. He added that the scope of New York's problems made such a broad approach impractical.
Indeed, Hartford's approach goes beyond what most cities have tried.
In January 1995, the Hartford Council passed a resolution blocking new special-needs buildings until there was a "regional cooperative solution." In November, it imposed a six-month moratorium on new rehabilitation homes, transient lodgings or centers for "welfare and charitable purposes."
Now, the Council is seeking to extend the limit another six months and expand it to include community centers and medical and health service programs, like support centers for people with AIDS or mental illnesses. The Council is scheduled to vote on the new proposal on Monday.
The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union has warned that the plan will not survive a lawsuit, saying it discriminates against the disabled, like the mentally ill. When Peekskill, N.Y., blocked new housing for the mentally ill, a Federal judge rejected the city's argument that it was a "dumping ground," saying that "past efforts do not create grounds for refusing to provide any more."
So far, no lawsuit has emerged in Hartford, and while advocates say the moratorium has had a chilling effect, no agency has had a proposal turned down because of the law.
Deputy Mayor Frances Sanchez, the original moratorium sponsor, says the new measure is intended to allow for time to develop a more thoughtful approach on social services. But more than a year after the first moratorium was imposed, the city has made little progress on new guidelines, and advocates for the poor worry that it is merely a tactic to drive the needy out of Hartford.
"It sends the message that poor people are the problem," said Mary McAtee, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.
 
From Yuppie Haven To 'Poverty Inc.'
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Sanchez and Councilman Art Feltman, both Democrats who have championed the moratorium, offered a tour of South Green, a neighborhood a few blocks from downtown that was once an emerging yuppie haven.
In the space of a few blocks were the empty windows of several upscale restaurants that had closed in the last year and a row of abandoned buildings. Condominiums going for $130,000 in the 1980's cannot be sold for half, they said.
The main presence in that area now, Ms. Sanchez said, is what she calls "Poverty Inc., the social service industry" -- two homeless shelters, a check-in center for just-released prisoners, a health clinic and a methadone clinc. "They're spreading like kudzu throughout the city," Mr. Feltman said.
Ms. Sanchez shook her head. "You constantly see new faces around here," she said. "We have enough programs. They say they promote self-sufficiency. That's bull."
It is not clear whether the decline of South Green is a result of nonprofit social service agencies, some of which have been there for years. Foes of the moratorium note that many middle-class Hartford residents moved to the suburbs when real estate prices fell in the late 1980's. They also say that too many one-bedroom apartments were built in Hartford and that the city has lost at least 7,000 jobs since 1992.
Statistics are sketchy on whether the poor from elsewhere are overrunning Hartford. Social service agencies say most of their cases are Hartford residents. A survey of 13 nonprofit groups by the Hispanic Health Council, a local nonprofit group, found that 90 percent of their clients were Hartford residents.
Irene Glasser, a sociologist at Eastern Connecticut State University who is studying Hartford's homeless, said that one shelter's records showed that 68 percent of the families had been living in Hartford more than a year. Another shelter's records indicated that 73 percent gave Hartford as their last address.
Service providers say it is natural that some poor people would gravitate to the city. They note that Hartford has better access to public transportation and many inexpensive rental units. It is a city's role to help all these people, advocates say.
"Whether they live here for one week or 28 years, they are still residents of Hartford," said Elizabeth Toledo, the coordinator of a drug treatment program for women at the Hispanic Health Council.
Cities around the country worry about bearing too heavy a social service burden, yet Hartford's problem seems more acute.
According to the Census Bureau, Hartford is one of the smallest of the nation's 522 urban centers, and it does not have as broad a tax base as larger cities. To further complicate matters, Connecticut has no county government to share the costs of services, as in most other states.
In his 1993 book "Cities Without Suburbs" (Johns Hopkins), David Rusk ranked Hartford second in the country in the poverty gap between a city and its region, a situation he said would ultimately lead to the city's decline. The percentage of Hartford families below the poverty line was four times as high as in surrounding towns, he wrote.
In the 29 towns in the capital region, Hartford has all the AIDS residences, the only shelter for battered women, all three methadone clinics, the only check-in centers for released convicts, and four of every five emergency shelter beds.
An inventory of residential programs by Hartford's Planning Department showed an increase to 52 from 42 over the last two years, about 25 percent. This growth, officials say, imposes a fiscal burden by turning millions of dollars worth of land into tax-exempt property.
Some Are Calling Issue a Scapegoat
Advocates for the poor counter that the small nonprofit groups are being used as a scapegoat for the city's broader budgetary troubles. They say their groups create jobs and improve the property they own.
And although they do agree that Hartford officials have identified the problem -- an unfair distribution of services -- they say the moratorium is the wrong solution.
"I don't think this is going to enlighten the suburbs," said Laura Thornton, director of Peter's Retreat, a home for people with AIDS.
The moratorium also comes while the state and city are cutting welfare, and advocates for the poor say there is a shortage of services.
In recent months, St. Elizabeth House, which offers housing for people with AIDS, support services for the mentally ill, an emergency shelter and a longer-term residential program for the homeless, has seen the demand grow. Its transitional program has its longest waiting list ever, and this winter, the emergency shelter had to turn people away.
"You're going to have to have more services, because the demand for services is growing," Pat Kohnke, who runs several of St. Elizabeth's programs, said.
Still, the debate is not rooted in the need for services as much as the philosophy behind them. On the one side are moratorium supporters who say the services perpetuate dependency; on the other are those who see them as a force for good.
At a public hearing this month, John Bonelli, a former City Council candidate who has led the social-service advocates, testified: "I am shocked by those who keep arguing that these are destroying the city. They are building community."
A few days before the hearing, Councilman Feltman dismissed that argument. "You've got an infinite demand for services, and there will never be enough," he said. "If you served everyone from Hartford, there will be others from outside. We'll never run out of clients."

HEADLINE: Businesses Should Be Loyal To Employees, Clinton Says

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, March 23

 BODY:
Harking back to the workplace reforms of the Progressive Era, President Clinton came to this old industrial state today to urge American companies to share success with their workers in the form of better benefits and training and announced that he would hold a conference in Washington to showcase good companies next month.
Mr. Clinton used a speech at Xavier University here and similar remarks in his weekly radio address to the nation to expand on his recent comments on the need for greater corporate responsibility to help workers adjust to a rapidly changing economy. It is the latest of a series of issues -- from violence in Hollywood to school uniforms -- on which Mr. Clinton has acted as a kind of civic cheerleader in chief. 
 "Let me be clear: the most fundamental responsibility for any business is to make a profit, to create jobs and incomes by competing and growing," Mr. Clinton said in the radio address. "We recognize, too, that not every business can afford to do more than worry about the bottom line, especially a lot of small businesses. But many of America's most successful businesses have shown that you can do well by doing right by employees and their families."
Today he outlined five ways that what he calls enlightened businesses, in mostly voluntary cooperation with workers and the Government, should help improve employees' lives: by being "friendly to families" by offering flexible work schedules and child care, by giving better health and pension benefits, by offering improved education and training, by working "in partnership" with employees to cope with fluctuations in profits and productivity and by insuring a safe workplace.
It was no accident that Mr. Clinton chose to deliver such a message here today. In 1992, he carried Ohio with 40 percent of the vote, with 38 percent going to George Bush and 21 percent to Ross Perot. Ohio has 21 electoral votes and, by every standard, it is shaping up as one of a handful of Midwestern industrial states where this year's contest could well be decided.
With Patrick J. Buchanan on the campaign trail complaining about the economic dislocations of global trade, the White House is determined not to let anxieties about the economy -- the issue that Mr. Clinton rode into office in 1992 -- boomerang on him this year. Accordingly, on a one-day trip to Cincinnati and Columbus to raise money for the Democratic National Committee and the Ohio Democratic Party, Mr. Clinton took the chance to reassure voters that he still feels their pain.
But despite calls by some advisers, like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, to reward companies who treat their employees well with new tax breaks, Mr. Clinton made it clear that his approach remains almost completely oratorical.
"The Government can't make all companies do this," he said here. But he added that companies should ask themselves, "are there things the Government could do -- not to make me do this, because you can't freeze the future -- but at least to create a climate in which it would be easier for me to do this and still do well."
White House aides said that details of the corporate conference remained to be worked out but that, at a minimum, a sampling of chief executives would be there, perhaps joined by labor leaders and students. Today, Mr. Clinton praised innovative programs by companies like Procter & Gamble.
"We're going to talk about not how we can complain about the disruptions the global economy is bringing to America, but how we can do something about it to guarantee more economic security to the American families that are out there doing the best they can and working hard," he said.

HEADLINE: Criminal Case Is Ruled Out In Collapse

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The Manhattan District Attorney's office has concluded that it cannot file criminal charges against the owners of a Harlem apartment building that partially collapsed a year ago, killing three people.
After a yearlong investigation, prosecutors have decided that even among the most abused buildings, structural failure like that at the Harlem building that collapsed is so rare that it cannot be viewed as a predictable result of neglect. Therefore, they said, owners cannot be held criminally responsible. 
 "We had to conclude that the collapse was not reasonably foreseeable," the legal standard for prosecution, said Daniel Castleman, chief of investigations in District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau's office. Even if the owners had ordered a structural inspection of the building, at 142 West 140th Street, before it fell, he said, "They would have found structural problems, but probably not serious enough to force evacuation of the building and indicate imminent collapse."
Since most buildings collapse as a result of improper new construction or demolition work, not merely age or neglect, the decision is unlikely to apply to many cases.
After years of neglect and thousands of tenant complaints, the six-story building on West 140th Street, which had stood for 69 years, simply crumbled.
The outer wall gave way on the morning of March 21, 1995, pitching sleeping residents and their belongings to the ground amid a rain of bricks. Three people were killed, several others were injured and all of the tenants were left homeless. Mr. Castleman said the failure was caused by a weakening over time of a stone and mortar wall that formed the eastern foundation of the building, possibly because the mortar was improperly mixed.
With the District Attorney's office bowing out, the city will resume a contempt-of-court action against the owners, Marcus I. Lehman and Morris Wolfson, seeking jail terms and $1 million in fines for their failure to comply with court orders to fix several buildings they owned, said Harold M. Shultz, deputy commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. That suit had been filed before the building collapsed, but it was put on hold pending the outcome of Mr. Morgenthau's investigation.
The maximum jail term the two could face for contempt is six months, but Mr. Shultz noted that the sentence is usually less. He said he did not disagree with Mr. Morgenthau's conclusions, but he added, "It would be better if we could get more under these circumstances, because these circumstances are particularly egregious."
Just after the collapse, prosecutors said the owners might face charges of criminally negligent homicide, a felony with a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years in prison.
Former residents of the building and relatives of the victims were taken aback by Mr. Morgenthau's decision.
"These men ought to go to jail, and I was waiting to go to court to testify against them," said Roslyn Wiley-Haughton, a tenant of the building who now lives in the Bronx. She disagreed strongly with the District Attorney's conclusion. "It was foreseeable," she said. "There was evidence all over the place that the building was falling down."
When she was told that there would be no prosecution, Catherine Baylor, the sister of Ozzie Payne, a 76-year-old woman who was killed in the collapse, exclaimed, "What?" and then began to cry. "I can't even tell you how this makes me feel," she said.
Maurice Sieradzki, a lawyer who had sued the owners several times on behalf of tenants for a variety of problems in the building, said the result of the District Attorney's investigation was unfortunate but legally correct. "I did not see any criminal culpability," he said.
The owners, Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Lehman, could not be reached for comment. Their lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said that they "have been fully exonerated."
Several independent engineers had said shortly after the collapse that the conditions described by tenants could have been warnings of impending disaster. But Mr. Castleman said that an engineering firm specializing in building failures, which was hired by the District Attorney's office, concluded that there was probably no way to predict what happened.
In connection with the investigation, the Housing Department looked through decades' worth of records of building collapses and found that virtually all were caused by improper new construction or demolition work. Mr. Shultz said that "you had to go back to the late 1960's" to find a case like the one in Harlem where a building simply crumbled.
For instance, he said, the collapse on March 18 of part of a building on East 54th Street probably occurred because of recent construction work on the building next door.
Last September, the company owned by Mr. Lehman and Mr. Wolfson, Mount Wilson Realty, sold all of its apartment properties -- including the site on 140th Street, where what remained of the building was demolished -- to Baruch Singer, owner of a company that had managed the building before it collapsed. City officials said there were 12 properties in all, 9 in Harlem and 3 on West 108th Street between Central Park West and Manhattan Avenue.
TRW-REDI Property Data, a real estate research firm, found records of eight of the sales, showing that Mount Wilson Realty received $2.4 million for the buildings, well below the more than $4.8 million it had paid for them in 1987 and 1988.
At the time of the collapse, there were 337 housing code violations registered against the building on 140th Street, 56 considered potentially life-threatening though not related to the collapse. Housing inspectors had logged thousands of violations in the building since Mount Wilson bought it. Inspection reports read like a catalogue of decay, listing rat infestation, floors that caved in, leaking pipes, lack of heat and gaps between floors and walls, among other problems. Housing officials said that even before it collapsed, they considered the building to be unusually bad.
But Mr. Brafman contended that many violations were counted two and three times, and that in any case many were the tenants' fault. "In a high-crime neighborhood, it is simply impossible to keep the buildings in a completely violation-free condition," he said.
Though housing inspectors found many signs of structural problems, which were noted in their reports, they did not pass that information on to the Department of Buildings, as they are required to do. Since the collapse, all the city's housing inspectors have been given training in recognizing hints of structural distress, a program that Mr. Shultz said had resulted in dozens of warnings to the Department of Buildings.
People in the real estate business have said that Mr. Lehman and Mr. Wolfson were amateurs who paid inflated prices for Harlem real estate, hoping that the gentrification boom of the 1980's would keep moving uptown. The partners could not keep pace with their costs, and when the recession hit, their chances of recouping their investments evaporated.
Mr. Sieradzki, the lawyer, said he did not personally know Mr. Wolfson but had concluded that Mr. Lehman was "basically a decent guy" who was in over his head in the real estate business.

HEADLINE: TAIWAN'S LEADER WINS ITS ELECTION AND A MANDATE

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 23

 BODY:
President Lee Teng-hui swept to an election victory today that exceeded all expectations and served as a forceful rebuke to mainland China. This island's voters gave Mr. Lee a strong mandate in their first democratic balloting for President.
Final results showed that 54 percent of the nearly 11 million Taiwanese who cast ballots voted for Mr. Lee. His tally was more than double that of his closest challenger in a field of four candidates. 
 A strong sense of crisis over mainland China's threatening series of military exercises apparently caused significant numbers of voters to defect from Taiwan's largest opposition group, the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, to Mr. Lee's camp.
In Beijing, the official New China News Agency interpreted the election results as a sign that the voters of Taiwan opposed the idea of separation from the mainland. [Page 16.]
Mr. Lee's efforts to create a more independent international image for Taiwan have given him a broad appeal among voters of conflicting ideologies, including those who would like Mr. Lee to dump the island's longstanding commitment to a "one China" policy in favor of independence.
"This was a plebiscite without the label of plebiscite, and I hope that China got the message," said Parris H. Chang, a pro-independence member of Taiwan's legislature. "And the message is that Taiwan does not want to reunify with the mainland."
But other people watching the election closely said Mr. Lee would take the mandate and seek a new dialogue with Beijing in the hope of reducing military tensions.
Those tensions caused the Clinton Administration to send two aircraft carrier battle groups to waters near Taiwan to signal China that it should not interfere in Taiwan's democratic process.
[In Washington, a White House spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Glyn, said, "We congratulate the people of Taiwan on their first election." She added: "We hope to see tensions in the Taiwan Straits greatly reduced in the days to come."
[But American officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that no formal congratulations would be offered, because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.]
Mr. Lee had said before the vote that the next president's main job would be to work on cross-strait relations, and many took that to mean that Mr. Lee was preparing a post-election effort to cool tensions.
But the 73-year-old leader has given no clue as to whether he is willing to make substantive concessions to Beijing, like moderating Taiwan's drive for a seat at the United Nations. Beijing considers that effort to be part of an unacceptable "two China" strategy.
The pro-independence candidate, Peng Ming-min, 72, a longtime dissident who was only allowed to return to Taiwan from exile in 1992, turned out the poorest showing the opposition has made in the last three islandwide elections. The Democratic Progressive Party chairman, Shih Min-teh, announced his resignation at a news conference tonight, saying, "Someone has to take the responsibility" for the loss.
Two other tickets, headed by Lin Yang-kang and Chen Li-an, both breakaway members of Mr. Lee's governing Nationalist Party, polled 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
In a victory appearance at his campaign headquarters in downtown Taipei, Mr. Lee greeted a cheering and flag-waving crowd and said: "This is a historic moment. The door of democracy is now completely open."
Speaking in turn in Mandarin Chinese, English and his native Taiwanese dialect, Mr. Lee made only one reference to the campaign of military pressure mounted by mainland China during the last 10 months to weaken his hold on power.
"In this very difficult and dangerous moment with threats coming from the outside, we have completed our mission," he said.
The election was cheered in other parts of the region.
"This is a proud day for all Chinese people around the world," said Martin Lee, head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party. "It is the first time in China's history that a leader is elected on a one-person, one-vote basis on Chinese soil."
During the day, a crush of voters streamed to polling places registering a turnout that surpassed 76 percent, election officials said.
The results reflected a remarkable response to Mr. Lee's plea for a mandate to open a new round of negotiations with Beijing over Taiwan's future.
"From now on we should focus on economic development and strengthen the cross-strait economic and trade ties and cooperation," said Taiwan's Economics Minister, Chiang Pin-kung. Taiwan's central bank governor, Sheu Yuan-dong, also sought to reassure the island's investors and business community that pressure on the value of the Taiwan dollar caused by the flight of capital in recent weeks would return to normal.
Some analysts said that the true measure of Taiwan's rebuke to Beijing's Communist Party leadership could be seen in adding Mr. Lee's and Mr. Peng's tallies together, which represented 75 percent of the votes cast.
"The message from 75 percent of the voters is that what the mainland tried to accomplish by coercion and the threat of force, failed badly," said Mr. Chang, the legislator.
While Mr. Lee's vote tallies were strong throughout Taiwan, his total in this capital city was among the weakest, at 39 percent. Mr. Lin and his running mate, former Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun, registered their strongest showing in Taipei, with nearly 25 percent of the vote.
By contrast, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, a hotbed of independence sentiment, Mr. Lee took nearly 51 percent of the ballots and Mr. Lin took only 13 percent.
Appearing on Taiwan television tonight from a studio in Washington, the former American Ambassador to China, James R. Lilley, said that the election would serve to make China recognize "that power does not grow out of the barrel of a gun," as Mao Zedong once said, "it grows out of the ballot box." But Mr. Lilley added that he believed that Mr. Lee is now well-equipped with a mandate to "start talking to China again and get the relationship going again" in order to reduce military tensions in the area.
In conceding defeat, all of the other candidates congratulated Mr. Lee and his running mate, Lien Chan. Though deep personal animosities were visible during the campaign, each sought to take the high road, although Hsieh Chang-ting, the Democratic Progressives' vice presidential candidate, seemed to be reminding the winning ticket of its obligation to pro-independence voters who crossed over.
"We hope the people who got elected will not betray the people who voted for them," he said. Less than a week ago, Mr. Hsieh reminded voters that President Lee had referred to himself as Moses last year and had promised to lead the people of Taiwan out of the "red" sea, meaning a sea dominated by China.
Mr. Hsieh had warned voters in the pro-independence party not to cross over to support Mr. Lee because the defections might go to Mr. Lee's head.
"Lee Teng-hui thinks he's Moses right now, but if he gets a mandate, he will think he is God," Mr. Hsieh said.
But it seems that many voters did not take this advice.
"Of course I voted for Lee Teng-hui," said Chen Bo-jui, a 42-year-old businessman, after he cast his ballot in midmorning. "He is a strong leader, and we have to be strong in order to talk to mainland China. Otherwise, they will just tell us what to do."

HEADLINE: From a Defeated Ex-Leader, a Warning

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 23

 BODY:
If there was a big loser in today's presidential election, it was Hau Pei-tsun.
Even as he sought voters' acceptance in his effort to defeat President Lee Teng-hui by running as the vice presidential candidate on an opposing ticket, Mr. Hau, a 77-year-old former Prime Minister, had come to symbolize "mainlander" domination of Taiwan. 
 As a young general, Mr. Hau had helped to establish the authoritarian rule of the Republic of China in its home in exile on Taiwan, serving as chief military aide to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the 1960's, and then as Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of Taiwan's military forces.
To millions of native-born Taiwanese, though they share the ethnic Chinese background of the mainlanders, Mr. Hau and the Nationalists have always carried the taint of occupiers, whose dream of reunification with the mainland they have never fully accepted.
Neither have they accepted Mr. Hau's presence on the political stage.
Mr. Hau has already been ejected from the governing Nationalist Party, after losing a power struggle to Mr. Lee in December. Taiwan's political humorists have enjoyed twittering in recent weeks that if Mr. Hau's New Party ticket led by Lin Yang-kang were to win, he would set himself up as shadow president.
Speaking in a 90-minute interview this morning after he had cast his ballot in the race that President Lee won decisively, Mr. Hau spoke openly of his deep sense of betrayal by the native-born Mr. Lee.
At various times he referred to the 73-year-old President as a "traitor," a "liar," a "cheat" and a "dictator," and he warned that Mr. Lee's victory would usher in a period of sustained conflict with mainland China that could wreck Taiwan's economy and draw the United States into a larger confrontation with Beijing.
"I was the first one who discovered that Mr. Lee really favors Taiwan independence in his mind," he said, though the President has never publicly endorsed a separation. And now that Beijing has become convinced of the same thing, he added, "This Taiwan independence movement is actually encouraging nationalism on the mainland."
During the presidential campaign, nothing undermined Mr. Hau's credibility as much as Beijing's use of military force to intimidate voters, subjecting him to the charge that he and other mainlanders were "apologists" for Beijing's bullying tactics.
Mr. Hau just smiles when he hears the charge and moves on to what still concerns him: that during Mr. Lee's new four-year term the tension with the mainland "will not be eased."
He said he fears that the mainland will try to strangle the island militarily, and that it would not be easy to defend Taiwan against that strategy, even with American naval power.
"As a military man, I believe it is not necessary for Beijing to prepare an amphibious assault against Taiwan to do harm," he said.
"I estimate that Beijing's missile tests were designed to demonstrate the capability of using missiles and submarines to mount a blockade against Taiwan. And once those tests last more than six months, it will do serious harm and undermine the economic development of Taiwan."
Mr. Hau, who gained recognition by his defense of Little Quemoy Island during a 44-day shelling engagement with mainland Chinese forces in 1958, said the Clinton Administration's "show of force" in the waters near Taiwan "has only raised the temperature between the two sides and will only serve to irritate Beijing further."
Mr. Hau said his understanding of history and of the use of military power are causing his alarm.
In nearly 2,000 years of Chinese history, China's emperors have fought to hold its diverse territories together, Mr. Hau said, and if Beijing were to lose Taiwan to an independence movement, it would only incite people in other regions under its control -- the Tibetans, the herders of Inner Mongolia and the Muslims of the Xingjiang region -- to seek their own independence.
A rush toward reunification is not the answer, he said, and would only force Beijing to advance its own schedule for reunification and risk conflict.
"Taiwan is part of China, but, of course, that doesn't mean we are part of the People's Republic of China," he said. "Once the mainland sets a timetable for reunification, that is a disaster for the Taiwanese."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
You, Too, Can Balance the Federal Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ANYBODY can balance the Federal budget over seven years. I did it in a couple of hours.
This is all it required: 
 1. The hubris to make crucial policy judgments about matters I know absolutely nothing about (what the consequences would be, say, of reducing the number of Navy aircraft carriers to 10 from 12).
2. The willingness to raise other people's taxes (those who drive a lot) and reduce Federal benefits I never expect to have (farm-price supports).
3. The determination to maintain the tax breaks (mortgage interest deduction) and Government subsidies (mass transit) that I enjoy.
4. The ability to make the decisions by myself without having to strike compromises with people (my family and friends, to say nothing of people who live across town or across the country) who have interests, needs and views different from mine.
5. The knowledge that (unlike the politicians who have been unable to agree on a budget plan) I never have to run for re-election.
 
 
 
Billion Here, There
 I used a game called Debtbusters 2002 developed by the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that promotes a balanced budget (202-467-6222). It lists dozens of deficit-reduction options that President Clinton and Congress have considered in four areas: domestic spending, national security spending, taxes and entitlements. The player is supplied with brief arguments for and against each option and the amount of spending that would be saved (or revenue gained or lost, in the case of tax changes) if the option is selected.
The object is to check off options that add up to $850 billion, enough, the authors of the game say, to balance the budget in seven years.
The best place to start is benefit programs, called entitlements, since that category accounts for two-thirds of all Federal spending. There are two main types: those like Social Security and Medicare that are available to the elderly regardless of their means and those like welfare, Medicaid and food stamps for the poor.
I decided to spare the poor and go after the elderly, whose benefits have risen most rapidly in recent years (see No. 5, above).
Big bucks can be saved ($281 billion) by making benefits like Social Security and Medicare subject to the income tax to the extent they exceed an individual's contributions. Other hits on old people: Hold the annual cost of living increase in Social Security benefits to half a percentage point below the rate of inflation ($59.7 billion); gradually raise the Social Security retirement age ($72.6 billion); raise the Medicare premium for outpatient services for individuals with incomes above $50,000 and couples with incomes above $65,000 ($25.9 billion).
Other entitlement savings not primarily involving the elderly or the poor: reduce farm subsidies ($31.6 billion, see No. 2); restrict veterans' compensation for those with relatively minor impairments like flat feet and eliminate payments to new applicants with disabilities unrelated to military service ($7.6 billion); increase fees for using Federal resources and services ranging from mining on Government land to obtaining a communications license ($29 billion).
Total entitlement savings: $507.4 billion.
The next biggest category of Government spending is the Pentagon. The cold war is over, and big cuts here seem easy (see No. 1). These are the ones I made:
Cancel development and production of various high-technology aircraft like the F-22 advanced tactical fighter, the C-17 transport plane, the F/A-18 attack aircraft, the V-22 vertical takeoff plane and the Comanche helicopter ($42.8 billion); reduce the number of aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates and cancel the third Seawolf submarine ($15.9 billion); reduce the troop strength of the Army ($16.7 billion); reduce nuclear delivery systems and other nuclear weapons programs ($9.4 billion); consolidate military infrastructure, whatever that means ($7.7 billion).
Total military savings: $92.5 billion.
Cutting other Government programs is harder. Whole programs can be abolished without saving much money. But this is not the time to be daunted (see Nos. 3, 4 and 5). These were my cuts:
Cancel the space station ($13.8 billion); consolidate the Departments of Education and Labor ($3 billion); abolish the Commerce Department ($7 billion); eliminate funding for several arcane education programs like the one that gives school districts extra money for pupils whose parents live or work on Federal property ($4.8 billion); cut in half funding for the arts and humanities ($3.6 billion); eliminate community development block grants and some rural development programs ($31.6 billion, see No. 2); limit low-income energy assistance to the most needy ($5 billion).
Total savings from miscellaneous cuts: $68.8 billion.
Now for taxes. Unlike President Clinton and the Republicans who control Congress, I see no need for tax reductions. In fact, I chose these tax increases (See No. 2): Raise the gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon ($108.7); raise the cigarette tax by 75 cents a pack and the tax on alcohol by about 50 cents for each six-pack or bottle of wine or spirits ($98.7 billion); eliminate the deduction for mortgage interest for interest payments above $20,000 a year ($56.5 billion).
Total tax increases: $263.9 billion.
Time to take stock. The spending cuts and tax increases I have so painlessly checked off total $932.6 billion, $82.6 billion more than necessary to balance the budget under the rules of the game.
So since I may want to retire at 65 (see No. 3), let's forget about raising the retirement age ($72.6 billion). And to avoid fights with members of my family who disagree with me (see No. 4), let's not cut funds for the arts and humanities ($3.6 billion).
That leaves a surplus of $6.4 billion over seven years. I'll give it to the Pentagon. You can't be too careful about the nation's defense needs (see No. 1).

Virtual Recruiter: Software That Reads Resumes

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

 BODY:
THE next time you get hired or transferred, the person you may want to slap on the back or in the face may not be a person at all. That is because your fate was decided by a computer.
Companies like Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Texas Instruments and Ford Motor have turned to virtual recruiters, software programs that let employers turn the resumes they receive into a data base that can be searched to fill job vacancies. For example, if a company is looking for an engineer with five years' experience who can speak Spanish, the computer will provide a list of candidates who qualify. 
 This makes it easier for companies, but it puts pressure on job seekers not only to have the attributes the employer wants, but also to describe those qualifications on their resumes in a way the computer will recognize. And misspellings in a resume, which often used to be merely embarrassing, now can automatically cost you the job.
Giving so much control to a computer raises concerns that a machine will miss the subtleties and nuances of what makes a good employee. "There is something to be said for using a professional staffing person, because the hiring manager using the software quite often looks just at experience, but doesn't go under the surface to find out what kind of person you are, whether you are a team player, the intangibles," said Jac Fitz-enz, director of the Saratoga Institute, a human resources research and consulting firm in Santa Clara, Calif.
But, he said, a human recruiter cannot look for standard qualifications as fast or efficiently as a computer can. The software helped Elizabeth Richards, who had been working as a marketing representative, get a new job last fall. She was hired by the Overnite Transportation Company of Richmond, a $1 billion division of Union Pacific, after giving the company her resume at a job fair. On her resume, she had included a job she held earlier in her career as a compensation analyst, writing "base pay plan design, incentive plan design" to describe the post.
That is the job she got. Overnite was looking for a compensation analyst and, after scanning her resume into its data base, a recruiter typed "base pay plan design, incentive plan design, strong administrative skills and five to seven years experience" as the search parameters. Up popped Ms. Richards's resume.
When the company called her in for an interview, Ms. Richards was startled to find that the company had been so astute as to look beyond her current marketing duties to notice her old job.
"Without the software system, there would have been no connection," she said. "If you file paper resumes by hand, the resume would likely have been filed by the day it came in rather than by my background. I believe so many companies lose potential applicants in the piles of paper."
Resume tracking software, which is sold by companies like the Restrac Corporation in Dedham, Mass., and Resumix Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., for $80,000 to more than $1 million, not only searches by key words, but also helps give the information some context. Resumix, for example, contains 10 million terms related to various industries. The terms represent skills for different professions, like "general ledger" for accountants and "application design" for software developers, that help recruiters conduct their searches. Restrac and Resumix said about 400 companies used their software.
Overnite said the Restrac system had changed the way it finds new employees, saving $1.5 million on recruiting costs like advertising and agency fees since it installed the software three years ago. The system also sends rejection letters automatically. "Our recruiters don't have to deal with paper at all," said David Huffer, director of staffing at Overnite. "Their efficiency goes up because they can spend more time with candidates and hiring managers."
Hewlett-Packard installed the tracking software about five years ago. This year the company expects the system to handle 330,000 resumes. James R. Green, manager of the company's employment response center, said the data base was accessible on the desktop computers of all the company's hiring managers.
THE system has another bonus for job seekers: resumes remain in the data base and a candidate who lost out on one job can easily be identified for a future opening.
"Now when we say we'll put your resume on file, we really mean it," said Edward Kleinert, administrator for human resource information technology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which uses Restrac to screen the 25,000 to 30,000 resumes received annually.
AT&T, which recently announced it would lay off thousands of workers, is using the software to help those employees find different jobs within the company.
A data base was created that contains the resumes of laid-off workers and any openings within the company. Another data base holds more than 100,000 job openings at 3,000 other companies.
"It is emotional enough to be in a job that is being phased out and find your financial future is clouded," said Burke Stinson, an AT&T spokesman, "but it can be like rubbing salt in the wound to learn that a job that you were quite capable of doing, 100 or 1,000 miles away, was just filled by someone from the street."
Starting in June, it will be even easier for workers to get resumes into data bases of the companies using the Restrac system. Its clients will be able to connect to the Monster Board (http://www.monster.com), a huge job- and resume-posting site on the World Wide Web, and download resumes directly into their data bases.
"There's been a dramatic change in the way hiring was done 20 years ago," Mr. Fitz-enz said. "With scanning systems and key-word search and retrieval software, large companies are able to put all applications from around the country into one central data base, and any hiring manager can access it to look for job candidates. Companies are getting far greater cost economies from it."
 
First, Forget The Green Paper
 Quirky typefaces, colored paper: job applicants have long schemed to make their resumes stand out. But as more and more companies scan resumes into their computers and use software programs to judge them, these and other rules are changing.
"Maximize the use of your industry's jargon and acronyms," the Restrac Corporation advises job applicants who want to create computer-friendly resumes. The reason is that the software that examines the resumes uses a "key word" search system to find promising ones.
As for eye-catching graphics, avoid them. "Use a standard font," Restrac suggests. "Use white paper." And "don't try to dress up your resume with borders, boxes or graphics." Human recruiters may or may not be impressed with such tricks, but computers never are. "The computer can't read them," the brochure notes.
At least one old rule of writing a resume has vanished in cyberspace: confining it to one page. "Multiple pages are fine," Restrac says, but "print your resume on one side only." Computers can read quickly, but they can't turn the sheet over.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Think That I.P.O. Looks Good? If It's Offered to Pay Debt. Look Twice.

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
INVESTORS buy initial public offerings because they want to get in on a venture's ground floor. As the company uses the offering's proceeds to build the business up, people hope that their returns will ride higher and higher, too.
But, more and more, the money from new issues is used not to expand a company; it is designated to pay for debt. In 1995, about 34 percent of all such proceeds went to repay or refinance bank loans and fixed-income debt, according to the Securities Data Company. That share is the second-highest annual number since 1986. 
 The stock market's surge holds the explanation for the trend, said Linda Killian, an analyst with Renaissance Capital, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. Given the high value of stocks today, she said, "it makes more sense, for companies that are able to do it, to raise equity capital to pay debt rather than increase debt via a bank loan or other means."
Of course, interest rates are now relatively low, which makes bank loans cheap. But low interest rates also help the stock market -- and today's market levels are apparently attractive enough to overshadow economical rates on loans.
Thus, the general lesson is clear: companies' growing fondness for refinancing debt through new issues is a sign that they, as sellers, are getting a good price for their stock. The flip side, of course, is that investors, as buyers, may be paying top dollar.
Nevertheless, some new issues are much better investments than others. With more than $15 billion in initial offerings scheduled for the second quarter of this year -- a quarterly record -- how should investors react when a new offering they like will devote a big piece of the cash raised to debt?
With caution, most analysts say. In nautical circles, "two square red flags with black centers represent hurricanes," said John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket Report, a newsletter. "Investors should use the same warning signals when reading that an I.P.O.'s proceeds are going to repayment of debt."
One general reason for this wariness, of course, is that investors commonly expect new-issue money to fuel growth and propel share prices higher. If the money goes to debt instead, the assumption vanishes.
But investors must also dig deeper to see if, for a particular offering, the focus on debt is a plus or a minus.
"You have to look at companies on a case-by-case basis," Mr. Fitzgibbon said. "It can be tricky." Investors should examine the size of the company's debt, its overall financial strength and the reasons the debt was incurred.
For Irv DeGraw, Shells Seafood Restaurants offers an example of a new issue that should make one wary. The company, a chain based in Tampa, Fla., plans to raise $7 million -- and wants to use 30.6 percent of that amount to pay debt and 38.3 percent to finance current operations.
"Shells is issuing an I.P.O. in order to save itself," said Mr. DeGraw, research director at IPO Insider, a newsletter in Sarasota, Fla. "They are desperate for the cash."
SHELLS is usually packed on weekends, according to analysts, and the management -- former Red Lobster executives -- is seasoned. But the company, which has been around since 1985, has had a history of cash-flow problems. And in a recent audit of the company, the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche concluded that the financial position of Shells was weak enough to raise doubts about its ability to stay in business. Because the company is still in the offering period, executives at Shells declined comment.
Similarly, when Revlon went public last month, its likely need to use the proceeds to pay large debts was a big concern.
But sometimes the focus on debt should not raise alarms.
"Paying down debt often frees up a company to make acquisitions and acquire working capital to expand the business or use for internal growth," said Robert S. Natale, director of equity research at Standard & Poor's.
Consider Orthodontic Centers of America, a provider of management services to orthodontists that went public in December 1994. The company sought $20.9 million in the offering, and scheduled 17 percent for retiring regular debt and 59 percent for paying off debt incurred in expansion. But the company had grown fast, and continued borrowing for such an enterprise can raise its debt to risky levels. So, using 76 percent of the offering's proceeds to pay debt freed the company to continue growing. For industry observers like Mr. DeGraw, that kind of debt situation is auspicious.
As investors try to separate the worrisome from the welcome in this area, though, they can be stopped by vague terms -- like "general corporate purposes" -- used in offering documents to describe the destination of the cash raised. But that problem may diminish if the Securities and Exchange Commission adopts a rule, as it has proposed, to make the language of prospectuses plainer and more specific.

A Little-Known Strategy for Bond Buyers

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
KURT GUTFREUND, the president of a Chicago company that makes children's clothing, is like many other bond buyers. He doesn't like to take risks, and he puts a high priority on yield.
So why did Mr. Gutfreund recently sell $250,000 of triple-A municipal bonds, bought just two years ago and carrying a coupon yield of 6.75 percent, and buy an equivalent sum of bonds paying only 6.35 percent? 
 Mr. Gutfreund was simply taking advantage of a strategy that can give him a bigger pot of money. The method involves "pre-refunded" bonds. Here is how it works: The issuer of Mr. Gutfreund's bonds, the State of Florida, recently took steps to effectively back the bonds' principal and interest with Treasury securities up to the issue's first call date, June 1, 2001. The state said it would call, or redeem, the bonds then.
These actions conferred on the bonds a shorter maturity but also the high creditworthiness of the Treasuries that now backed them. Thus, their price rose to roughly 10 percent more than the price Mr. Gutfreund would have received if he held the bonds until the 2001 maturity date. By selling the old bonds at the higher price, Mr. Gutfreund received about $26,000 more in gains on principal -- even after paying a commission on the sale -- than he would have if he had never sold them.
True, the new bonds, $250,000 of a city housing issue from Atlanta, have a yield of only 6.35 percent, so Mr. Gutfreund will get about $5,000 less in yield between now and 2001 than he would have with his original holdings. There will also be a commission to buy the new bonds. And more of Mr. Gutfreund's total returns from the pre-refunded strategy will be capital gains, and thus taxable; only the yield on municipal bonds is always federally tax free and possibly free of state taxes.
But, even after these effects, Mr. Gutfreund will come out ahead. "It's a terrific strategy," he said.
Sharon A. Alister, his broker at Dean Witter Reynolds, agreed. "This is one of the most underused and unknown, and yet profitable, strategies that is available to the individual investor," she said.
Now may be the time for investors to pay attention. When interest rates fall, as they did during most of the early 1990's, issuers of both tax-free and taxable bonds often like to pare their interest payments by issuing new bonds at lower coupons. The pre-refunding procedure helps issuers, like Florida, accomplish this switch.
There are no statistics to show how many bonds are candidates to be pre-refunded. Last year, however, Ms. Alister noticed a pre-refunding almost every month for the 25 or so different bond issues that are typically held in an average portfolio for her clients.
True, interest rates have risen recently, and that has reduced refinancings. But there are still more pre-refundings coming, and if rates resume their fall, as Ms. Alister thinks they will, there will be more.
For an issuer to try pre-refunding, the difference in yield between the new and the old bonds must be at least 1.25 or 1.50 percentage points, Ms. Alister said.
"For me, any bond that is paying 6.5 percent or higher is an attractive candidate," she said. "However, because I think interest rates are still going to go lower, I'm also on the lookout for bonds that are paying 6.375 percent."
This strategy may not appeal to investors who need high income from regular coupon checks. At a 6.35 percent yield, Mr. Gutfreund's new bonds produce $1,000 less in payments each year than his old ones did. Also, while price jumps are typical with pre-refunded bonds, the rise can vary greatly from issue to issue, sharply affecting the tactic's attractiveness.
Ms. Alister also noted that the pool of potential pre-refunded bonds was smaller than it was when interest rates first moved down, and that the strategy was harder with taxable bonds than with tax-free ones.
What about buying a pre-refunded bond instead of selling it? "With these bonds you often get gilt-edged credit quality and good current yields," said George D. Friedlander, a managing director and fixed-income strategist at Smith Barney.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Life of a Cold Caller: Riding on a Smile and a Thick Skin

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: TREVOSE, Pa.

 BODY:
EVELYN WILEY'S desk is unadorned. No family pictures. No mementos or favorite sayings. The only thing distinguishing it is a small hand mirror perched on the keyboard of her computer.
She keeps it there to see if she's smiling. If she is, chances are she's selling. 
 "They always listen when I smile," Ms. Wiley said.
No small challenge. Ms. Wiley is one of those people America loves to hate: a telephone solicitor. Each day, she interrupts dozens of people she doesn't know, trying to sell them something they didn't ask for and probably feel they don't need.
But Ms. Wiley, a "30-something" Philadelphia woman who has worked as a telephone solicitor for nearly a year, sees her role in a different light. To her, she is nothing less than a telephone help mate.
"I feel important," she said. "I know it's disruptive, but my approach is: I have a great offer for you."
In a sense, telephone solicitors are the door-to-door salesmen of the 90's, intrusive and uninvited. Instead of peddling brushes and vacuum cleaners, they push everything from credit cards to insurance to newspapers (this one included). They may ask for charitable contributions or suggest a change in your long-distance carrier. Whatever they are selling, they always seem to call at dinner time.
And like door-to-door salesmen, they face rejection, suspicion and, at times, outright rudeness, with angry hang-ups replacing slammed front doors.
In short, theirs is a job that is arguably at the bottom of the retail food chain, traditionally filled by retirees, homemakers and college students looking for part-time work.
But as the job market has tightened, telemarketing has increasingly become a haven for older white-collar workers set adrift by the latest recessionary shock or round of downsizing. Many of these people are in it for the long haul.
And if you think they aren't racking up the sales, despite all their annoyances, think again. A day spent watching Ms. Wiley and others at the ICT Group Inc. calling center here, just outside Philadelphia in Bucks County, was notable not for the number of hang-ups, but for how many people took the callers up on their offers.
In just over two hours on a Tuesday in February, Ms. Wiley and 11 colleagues -- cold callers to the public but who prefer to be known as telephone service representatives, or T.S.R.'s -- persuaded credit card holders around the country to accept more than $100,000 in cash advances, using a reduced interest rate as the bait. That put them well ahead of their goal of "selling" $2,600 an hour in advances per sales representative, reaching an average of $4,400 instead.
That kind of success helps explain why, despite problems in the industry with fraud, deception and public scorn, the cold-calling side of telemarketing has grown into a multibillion-dollar business.
Sales to consumers by so-called outbound telemarketers -- retailers or the representatives they hire, like ICT, that initiate calls to customers -- soared to an estimated $159 billion last year, from $117 billion in 1990, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group based in Washington. When calls to business customers are added in, sales came to $385 billion last year, the association says. (That is not counting the billions of dollars taken in by fraudulent operators. Nor does it include the huge amount of business done by catalogue companies, which are characterized as inbound telemarketers because the consumer calls them.)
"It's the kind of business that I think people like to complain about, yet people are spending $385 billion on goods and services purchased by the telephone, which speaks to the fact that it offers a service people are not getting other ways," said Donna Krampf, director of consumer public relations for the trade group.
MS. WILEY'S employer has been on a roll for years now. Revenues for ICT, which is involved in telemarketing management and research services as well as sales, have grown from $2 million in 1987 to $52 million last year. Among companies that specialize in outbound calls, ICT was ranked eighth last year in billable minutes by Telemarketing and Call Center Solutions Magazine.
"We've been doubling in size every two years," said John J. Brennan, ICT Group's president and chief executive. "The market is very good, and we've done a lot of diversification to broaden our approach."
The company, which is based in nearby Langhorne, Pa., operates 20 outbound calling centers, 3 of which have opened this year. Two of the centers are abroad, in Dublin and St. John, New Brunswick.
Compensation for sales representatives varies in the industry, depending on skills and the part of the country where the caller is working. At ICT, the pay averages $6 to $8 an hour to start. For those with special skills, like licensed insurance agents, the rate is generally $8 to $10 an hour to start. And medical benefits, seldom provided before, are now being given more frequently to people in that group.
The company and its clients also frequently offer incentives to push the employees. Callers working at least 40 hours a month can increase hourly wages by a maximum of $4.75 if they consistently perform above their peers.
In addition, the callers can eventually move into supervisory or management jobs, which pay better salaries. At ICT, supervisors earn annual salaries of about $25,000, a call center manager will make $30,000 to $40,000 and a director of regional operations can make up to $60,000.
New employees not cut out for the job will generally leave within the first two weeks, said Amy Brennan, the office manager at the Bucks County calling center. Generally, about 5 percent drop out by that point. To keep the turnover that low, she says she is very selective. What does she look for? "It's voice inflection, it's tone, it's their attitude in the interview," said Ms. Brennan, who is not related to the company's president.
"I don't really expect to sit with anyone and have them say, 'This is my dream job,' " she added. "But sometimes they come and find they like it."
Looking back to her early days on the job, Ms. Wiley confessed to wondering if it was going to work out. A business school graduate who also went to a community college for two years, she selected a job in telemarketing over secretarial and clerical positions because she liked the idea that she would be using her communication skills.
Her first week, however, was a disaster as she tried to persuade people to change long-distance companies.
People either hung up on her or took the time to tell her off. "They're telling you their company is better," Ms. Wiley remembered. "They'd go into, 'Let me tell you about your company' . . . 'It cost me X amount of dollars to talk to people next door' . . . 'Stop calling here.' "
It was at that point, she recalled, that she turned to a mirror for some role playing.
"I acted like I was the customer," she said. "I asked questions and answered myself back. I used my rebuttals, and I felt real confident."
So she took the mirror to work.
"It was excellent because it was a very hard program, and I reached the goal in one day," she said. "I've been carrying my mirror ever since."
ALTHOUGH the callers receive training to help them present themselves and the product in the best possible way, how they deal with rejection must come from within.
"You have to be strong," said Ms. Wiley, expressing a view echoed by other sales representatives. "I think it's a built-in thing."
Those familiar with the business say Americans have an ingrained sense of politeness and generally beg off without getting ugly, although people in New York City (rude) and Wisconsin (suspicious) are known to be more difficult.
When the rejection is bad, a supervisor might come over for a personal pep talk. Management prepares for particularly difficult selling campaigns -- in which just one sale is expected every two or three hours -- by selecting the best people and backing them up with a higher number of supervisors. Financial or other incentives -- ranging from unexpected boxes of candy to complicated bonus arrangements for those who sell more than the office average -- are also used to "sweeten the pot," Ms. Brennan said.
Morale boosters might be something as simple as passing an envelope containing a $10 bill to the person with the most recent sale. At the end of a designated period, the person with the envelope can keep the money.
ICT employs 3,000 service representatives, including 540 who have been with the company for three years or more.
As the business has grown, the sales force has become older, Mr. Brennan said. He began to see a change in the recession of 1991, when the average age of new hires went to 31, from 21. "When people started losing jobs," Mr. Brennan said, "they got involved in this."
Larry Twine, 55, is one of those people. He took his job out of necessity. He had worked as a securities analyst for 28 years and then became a consultant. But the stock market crash in 1987 ended that career, he said. After a long stretch of being told he was over qualified for a variety of jobs, he joined ICT in 1990.
His approach to the job was to learn as much as he could about telephone sales so that he could perform as professionally as possible. To earn as much as possible, he obtained licenses to sell insurance in half the states. Now, he consistently leads the office in sales.
Mr. Twine and the others at the calling center use computers and well-honed phone lists to reach their unsuspecting clientele. The computers dial the numbers, giving the calls to the sales representatives while they are still ringing. The computers will adapt their pace to the amount of business being done by the representatives.
The system is a vast improvement over the days without computers. Now, sales representatives spend 40 minutes each hour talking with customers, compared with 25 minutes in the old days, making it possible to do the same volume of work with roughly half the number of people.
The calls start going out at 9 A.M. (Federal regulations prohibit calls between 9 P.M. and 8 A.M.) Callers sit side by side in identical cubicles staring at computer screens that detail basics like the name and address of the person called as well as the information needed to discuss the sale.
MR. TWINE sits poised to talk as the computer connects him to a phone ringing in Santa Barbara, Calif. A man picks up. Mr. Twine introduces himself and -- working from a script -- tells the man he has "good news" for him. He would like to send him a check for his available credit card balance at an annual percentage rate of 9.9 percent. The rate remains in effect until the loan is paid off.
"Many might tell you, 'I have too much credit,' " Mr. Twine said later. "But you've got to ask, 'What's the rate you are paying?' "
"When you explain what you have, they can find a need," he said.
In this case, the customer gives what is known in the business as a "hard no." It is definite and leaves little room to maneuver, unlike someone who says, "I don't think so."
The soft-spoken Mr. Twine takes his cue and signs off, but only after double-checking that he can't interest the man in the offer. The computer then dials up homes in Toledo, Ohio; El Paso; Oceanside, Calif., and Rome, N.Y., but no one answers.
Finally, the silence is broken. Not by a customer, but by Maurice Watson, a 25-year-old colleague who comes over with his sales sheet requesting that Mr. Twine check it out.
"Does this say $42,000 before lunch?" Mr. Watson asks, tweaking Mr. Twine.
"He's having a great day," said Ms. Brennan, after witnessing the exchange. "He's taking advantage of it by rubbing it in everyone else's face."
Noting that he extended $40,000 in credit the day before, Mr. Watson seems to have surprised even himself with his $42,000 before lunch.
But offering consumers a cash advance at 9.9 percent less than two months after Christmas is kind of like offering a hungry child another cookie. Many are going to think about it, and several will find it hard to refuse.
Still, Mr. Watson runs into some interesting twists. First there is the man in New Mexico who wants to consult with a friend about the offer.
"Can I call you back?" the man asks.
No. If Mr. Watson lets him go, he will probably lose the sale. Then it dawns on the customer that he has access to a cellular phone with a different number. He calls the friend, setting up a rather bizarre three-way exchange.
Mr. Watson can hear the man saying, "I can't call him back, so I was wanting to know your thoughts on it." Then the customer comes back, "What kind of information do you need?"
Mr. Watson says he needs to know only how much of an advance the man wants.
Within a few minutes, Mr. Watson is wrapping up the deal to hit the man's credit card limit by sending him a check for $4,600.
Then it's right back to business for Mr. Watson. A wrong number, then someone in Monroe, N.C., answers.
"I'm in pain up to my elbows," the customer says. Or was it paint? Mr. Watson doesn't press.
He moves on. After two calls are not answered, he gets a man who has just come home from the hospital after open-heart surgery. Mr. Watson starts to back off until the man mentions his medical bills.
"I'm sorry to hear about your condition," Mr. Watson says, "but this could help you to pay some of those medical expenses, and there's no time limit."
The customer counters that his wife has the credit card in her name, and she is going to pay things off that way. "I think right now I'll stick with that," he says.
"Hope you get better," Mr. Watson concludes. "Thank you for talking with me."
The call epitomized what makes telephone solicitors successful. Although Mr. Watson was working from a script, he adapted it to suit the situation. Every representative has to find the right approach, and quickly.
Consider the ICT sales representative in Dublin who was calling the United States for a campaign. Although he was speaking English, it might as well have been Japanese to the man he reached in Texas.
The customer asked whether he could put someone on the line who could speak "West Texas." The caller left the phone for a second, thought back to the American Westerns he had seen on television and then resumed the call doing his best John Wayne impression. He made the sale.
OVER time, sales representatives come up with their own winning styles.
Hank Kulig, a career salesman who was downsized from his job selling corporate lighting, said he just stuck to the facts. For the credit card campaign, he has written notes on his script ticking off the various ways a cash advance can be used: home improvements, special purchases, vacations, medical expenses.
When a man in Indiana says he has no need for the money, Mr. Kulig stresses the 9.9 percent rate and the fact that this kind of deal never seems to be there when you need it.
"You can always return it," Mr. Kulig says of the cash advance.
"It sounds awful good, but I don't need any right now," the man responds.
"You don't need a check for $3,000 or $4,000?" Mr. Kulig asks, making a last run at it. When the man continues to decline, Mr. Kulig asks him to "keep us in mind" and leaves him with an "800" number for customer service.
All representatives are monitored at random throughout the day. Three times each day they will be scored on their performance by quality assurance monitors, who will examine everything from their diction to the "rebuttals" they use to keep a resistant customer on the line to their overall professionalism.
"We're like your mother," said Karen Furman, one of the monitors.
The sales representatives are also being watched closely by the higher-ranking supervisors.
Plagued by phone scams conducted by fraudulent operators, legitimate companies are constantly refining their approach to raise the level of consumer acceptance, Mr. Brennan said.
Ms. Krampf, the public relations director for the marketing association, concurred, noting that companies attribute their success to their ability to pinpoint their audience, providing information and services that those consumers actually want.
Still, consumer skepticism is warranted. Authorities estimate that $40 billion in fraudulent or deceptive sales are made each year in the United States.
To protect the interests of consumers and legitimate telemarketers, the Federal Trade Commission adopted the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which went into effect at the beginning of this year. Two major facets of the rule, which parallels Federal Communications Commission regulations, set the restrictions on when telephone soliciting may take place and require companies to stop calling customers who say they want to be left alone. The rule also details what telemarketers must disclose during a call, like their identity and the nature of the goods or services being offered.
Sales representatives say they have no problems with the regulations because they are only hurt by illegitimate operations.
Amelia Hartzel, head of quality development for ICT, said trainees are taught not to push people who say they are not interested.
"It's not fair, and it's not correct," she said. There is, however, that business of the differing ways of saying no.
"There is the soft no and a hard no, and you really teach them the difference," she said. "One is 'Convince me,' the other is, 'Get out of my life.' "
At the end of the day, it is those get-out-of-my-life calls that make the job so difficult. "Per hour," Ms. Hartzel said, "you get more rejection in this job than any other."
Sales representatives say they try not to take it personally, but sometimes it's difficult. It takes a certain kind of person to follow through, they say.
"After about 30 or 40 rejections, sure you can get a little frustrated and want to go get a cup of coffee," Mr. Kulig said. "You ask, 'Is it me or the program?' You just can't let it bother you."
Looking down the road five years, Evelyn Wylie believes that she and her husband, Troy, whom she met on the job and married during a lunch break, will still be in telemarketing, only not at ICT.
"Troy and Evelyn Telemarketing Service," she said. "We've already discussed it."
But facing an afternoon in which 43 minutes of calling had led to four refusals, five "reschedules" and no sales, Ms. Wylie focused her attention on her mirror and smiled.
"I'll catch up," she said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH;
Mark G. Holowesko: Templeton Foreign Fund

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
SCANNING the globe for undervalued stocks often takes money managers to exotic locales. Mark G. Holowesko, an acclaimed manager of several Templeton foreign funds, is no exception.
So you might expect his fund portfolios to be larded with obscure stocks from tiny markets and far-off lands. But some of his favorites are household names readily available here. In fact, one is a United States company that does big business abroad -- the Boeing Company. Boeing's shares surged nearly 10 percent last week on news that the company was gearing up production to meet increased demand for commercial aircraft worldwide. Even now, the stock remains undervalued, Mr. Holowesko said in a phone conversation last week from his office in the Bahamas. 
 As his Boeing position suggests, Mr. Holowesko is not wedded to a portfolio with a certain percentage of assets in country A and a lesser percentage in country B based on their relative economic conditions, markets and currencies. More in the vein of Peter Lynch, Warren E. Buffett and John Templeton, his mentor and the company founder, Mr. Holowesko is a stock picker. "Basically, we want the stock selection to drive the country allocation," he said.
To select stocks, he looks for what is cheap, instead of hot companies with rapid earnings growth. And market volatility, the bane of small investors with short time frames, can work to his advantage. In volatile markets, he said, it is easier to find share prices that fail to reflect their companies' true values. When a market plunges, he may see an opportunity to snap up bargains. When Latin America's markets were devastated last year, Mr. Holowesko acquired a substantial stake in Telebras, Brazil's telephone company. Since then, he said, that holding has gained 35 percent in value.
All his funds score high in long-term performance. The Templeton Foreign Fund, which invests primarily outside the United States, ranks in the top 10 percent of all foreign funds over the last 10 years, according to Morningstar, the fund tracking company in Chicago. It returned an average 15 percent a year, with 30 percent less risk of a decline than the average equity fund -- quite a feat for a foreign portfolio.
His two other charges, Templeton Growth and Templeton World, rank in the top third of all global funds, providing annual returns over the last 10 years of 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively, again with less downside risk than other equity funds. Over all, Mr. Holowesko, who is 36 and has been with Templeton 11 years, manages $26 billion, with 10 percent to 20 percent of that in cash.
Although Mr. Templeton, a pioneer in international investing, stepped down in 1992 from daily management of the fund family, now part of the Franklin/Templeton group, his passion for finding values lives on at his firm.
A list of "the cheapest stocks in the world," with 80 to 200 names, is generated by Mr. Holowesko and 38 other portfolio managers and analysts in Templeton offices from Paris to Ho Chi Minh City. Everyone is responsible for recommending bargains in the countries and industries he follows.
Stocks on the list are usually cheap relative to their earnings growth or are cheap in relation to what the companies would fetch if sold.
If earnings growth has not yet been recognized by the market and it appears to be sustainable over three to five years, Mr. Holowesko becomes interested. When pressed for a benchmark, he said he liked to buy stocks trading at three to five times their projected earnings over the next three to five years and then to sell those stocks at 8 to 10 times earnings.
When it comes to companies worth more to prospective buyers, he must focus on those whose values can be unlocked. Many stocks trade for substantially less than the potential sale value of their companies -- and for good reason. Either the company is not generating a good return on assets or it is controlled by an investor uninterested in realizing its potential value. But if management is willing to restructure, sell assets or even sell the company, Mr. Holowesko and his colleagues get excited.
Though he avoids country allocations and macroeconomic analysis, there are certain investing themes in his portfolios. Right now, a major theme is the revamping of cyclical European companies. The recession that hit Europe in 1991 and 1992 scared many of these companies, he said, and they are reorganizing and reducing debt, much as American companies did in the 1980's.

 
 
Back to Basics
 His favorite play in this area is Volvo, the Swedish car and truck maker. Several years ago, the company tried to turn itself into a mini-conglomerate. "It was pretty much a disaster," he said. In the last 18 months, though, a new management team and a new board have focused on the core business.
Spinning off other lines of business will result in a significant infusion of cash. After subtracting that cash from the stock's current price, the core auto business is selling at just 5.7 times its value, by Mr. Holowesko's calculation, and that is too low. The stock, traded in Sweden, is worth 28 percent more than its current price, he said. Volvo's American depository receipts closed last week at $23.75 apiece on Nasdaq.

 
 
Lighting Up the Sky
 Another favorite group is United States companies that make planes, computers and industrial equipment. "About half of all U.S. capital goods exports go to developing markets," Mr. Holowesko said. "America is very, very competitive in this area."
His largest investment in this category is Boeing, whose stock appears in the World and Growth funds. Concerns about a floundering domestic airline business and the cost of developing the 777 line depressed the stock from 1992 through 1994. Mr. Holowesko's team bought the stock in 1993, expecting Boeing to benefit from a booming Asian market, where it was already supplying planes to Singapore Airlines and others.
Now, with the domestic airline business improving and demand for planes in Asia growing, Boeing may well reap the benefits. Its only major competitor is Airbus Industrie, and lately, Boeing has won key contracts, Mr. Holowesko noted. Even though the stock price has doubled since his purchase, he sees room for more gains. The stock closed Friday at $88.875 a share, but is worth more than $100, he said.

 
 
A Surprise in Japan
 The search for undervalued companies relative to their earnings power has led Mr. Holowesko to the Sony Corporation, the Japanese consumer electronics giant. It is a surprising investment in part because Templeton is well-known for skirting Japan in recent years because of high valuations there. And Sony is selling at what Mr. Holowesko figures is 26 times 1997 earnings. Though that is not cheap, he still considers the stock undervalued.
Sony's profits are expected to grow about 85 percent in the next 12 months, he said.
Perhaps more important, the company is a leading developer of the digital versatile disk, which will allow people to play music, watch a movie and retrieve information by computer all from one entertainment center. Only a few companies can provide the entire package, Mr. Holowesko said, adding that another is Philips Electronics N.V., also a favorite stock.
Sony's earnings growth, which should exceed 20 percent a year over the next three to five years, and the promise of the new technology are not reflected in the stock price, he said. Within five years, he expects the stock price to double. The A.D.R.'s closed at $60 apiece on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: A Forum on the Tax Deductions for Corporations

 BODY:
"Tax Reformers, Take Your Mark" (Feb. 11), Reed Abelson's article on the tax deductions available to corporations that have made expensive mistakes, drew many responses from readers. In general, the letters defended these deductions, and for a variety of reasons. Some said the breaks were justified because a business cannot be expected to succeed in every project it undertakes. Others said no business would deliberately lose a huge amount of money just to save part of it in taxes. And others contended that the corporate deductions were not different from those available to individual taxpayers.
 
To the Editor:
True, when a corporation or any other form of entrepreneurial enterprise makes a mistake or suffers a serious accident, most often it can include the cost of the incident in its cost of doing business. As a result, the business reduces its profits and therefore its Federal and, often, state income taxes. 
 But the great bulk of business tax-saving incidents are not planned and occur while the managers or owners are engaged in risking capital -- the essence of the capitalist system.
We all depend on the success of business ventures for the economic well-being of the nation; the question of tax breaks is a matter of public policy. We could throw the major burden of the income tax on businesses and thus lighten the load on consumers, but the simplest logic makes clear that the increased cost of doing business would lead to higher prices if companies are to make a profit.
For whatever reason, we -- that is, our Representatives and Senators in Congress, the President and business lobbies -- have shaped the present system. The negotiations among these three groups are a matter of deep concern to every citizen; sometimes these groups lean too far to favor business, but sometimes they lean too far to favor consumers. In either case, individuals can sometimes affect the details of these negotiations through various organizations.
Let us not forget that individuals also enjoy tax breaks. Look at the personal I.R.S. Form 1040, Lines 23a through 30. One of the most interesting tax breaks is indicated on Line 29, "alimony paid." If I make a mistake in choosing a mate such that the marriage ends in the personal equivalent of a corporate bankruptcy, then a local divorce judge, over whom the I.R.S. has no official power, can order alimony payments, which I can then deduct from my Federal income for tax purposes.
In other words, the enormous divorce rate we're now suffering -- a serious symptom of social dysfunction in America -- is subsidized by the Federal tax code.
The rest of these "adjustments to income," which reduce adjusted gross income and thus tax owed, are analogous to corporate and other business deductions. The I.R.S. also subsidizes individual mistakes that involve capital losses (see Schedule D), within limits.

To the Editor:
Who could have predicted that a low-fat hamburger marketed by McDonald's would be a flop while a product with three pieces of bread and two patties of meat would be a smashing success? Coca-Cola, despite a setback from its new Coke, and McDonald's have done quite well for shareholders over the years, and presumably the I.R.S. has shared handsomely in these successes. 
 For every losing innovation there are many more winners: an extra sliding door on a Chrysler mini-van; a closer-shaving Gillette razor; a new Windows operating system. To tax successful projects of these companies but not to allow an eventual deduction for the marketing and development costs of the failures would reduce incentives for innovation. Under the law, the cost of these failures can only offset income earned from the successful ventures.
Further, to ask Congress to write laws seeking to distinguish among expenditures of corporations as wise ones or follies can only lead to unnecessary complexity and an unenforceable tax system.

HEADLINE: West Virginia Sheds Image and Opens for Business

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SLANESVILLE, W. Va., March 21

 BODY:
Coal mining, poverty, old cars on concrete blocks, children running around barefoot: West Virginians know too well the outside world's perception of their state.
Eleanor Milliken, a retired inspector for Westinghouse, says she just laughs now when her son-in-law from Silver Spring, Md., says, "You can tell girls from West Virginia because they have no teeth." 
 But to Mrs. Milliken and many other West Virginians, the time has come to stop the jokes and change the stereotypes. They have had it with the hillbilly image of ol' ma and pa settin' there on the porch rocker.
And so have state officials, who have designated this year in West Virginia as Homecoming '96, a chance for cities and towns to show off a little and celebrate as the old images are beginning to fade. So far, almost 290 communities have signed up, planning street fairs, parades, motorcycle rallies and pig roasts as a way to trumpet all the change.
Gov. Gaston Caperton came here, in the northeastern corner of the state, today to help register two Hampshire County events: Slanesville's Apple Butter Festival in October and Springfield's Peach Festival in July.
"People are beginning to have a real sense of pride in themselves about who they are, and not be ashamed," Mr. Caperton, a Democrat and former insurance executive who is completing his eighth and final year in office, said in an interview before the ceremony. "This gives the state the opportunity to show off what we've done, brag a little and get people excited about their communities."
There is much to cheer about. With the luxury of working with an overwhelmingly Democratic State Legislature, as well as an entirely Democratic delegation in Congress, Mr. Caperton has pushed through major changes in business and education policies that have led to new population and job growth in West Virginia -- which has 1.8 million people, 96 percent of them white -- after years of decline.
Since 1989, his first year in office, the state has used tax incentives to add 75,000 jobs and attract 500 new businesses, an overall investment of more than $2.7 billion that makes West Virginia a leading state in the rate of job creation when many industries around the country are reducing employment. West Virginia has made especially strong gains in attracting companies in the plastics, chemical, wood-products and health-care industries.
At the same time, the state is spending more than $500 million for public school construction and renovation, and a $46 million program is putting computers in every classroom from kindergarten through fifth grade. The legislature appropriated $16.3 million this month to extend that program through the 12th grade, an effort that Mr. Caperton said would make West Virginia the first state to have computers in every public school classroom.
The state also gave teachers raises to improve their standing, to the 33d-highest-paid among the states and District of Columbia in 1994, up from 46th in 1987, according to the National Education Association. And high school curriculums now require students to prepare for college or learn specific job skills.
"He deserves high marks for what he has done," Robert Dilger, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, said of Mr. Caperton's initiatives. "But it almost didn't matter who was governor when he came in. West Virginia had no room to go but up. The state had just about bottomed out."
It was not until Mr. Caperton ordered his first audit of state finances, just weeks after his inauguration, that he learned the extent of the state's indebtedness, $500 million in unpaid bills, including the gas bill for the Governor's official residence in Charleston. "They were about to shut the gas off," he said.
In a move that was widely unpopular at the time, the Governor raised taxes by $300 million and cut $100 million in spending across the board. But Mr. Caperton also convened task forces to plot a course toward financial stability, with a dual focus of strengthening the state's business base and educational system.
"It was like turning around a ship going in the wrong direction," he said. "It takes a huge amount of energy, and the hardest thing is getting people to believe that they can do it. They were not used to success."
Many still are not. Pockets of poverty around the state endure, particularly in mountainous central regions once heavily dependent for employment upon the coal industry, now highly mechanized and more efficient. While the state's annual unemployment rate is the lowest in 20 years, 7.8 percent, it remains the highest of any state.
Further, many West Virginians are too old or disinclined to take advantage of new technology in their schools or new industries, and some parents object to the longer bus rides their children take to reach a newer school.
But over all, the gradual changes are nudging aside images of hillbillies and moonshine, especially in areas that have enjoyed the higher rates of economic development: around Charleston in the south, Clarksburg in the north and the eastern counties between Maryland and Virginia that have become a favorite weekend and retirement spot for people from the Washington area, about 60 miles east of here.
The key, Governor Caperton said, is finding niches. So he set up a trade office in Nagoya, Japan, rather than compete with other states in Tokyo. As a result, six Japanese manufacturing plants have opened in West Virginia in the last few years.
By the same rationale, the Legislature appropriated $18 million to enter the wholesale artwork business. In a plan that tested Mr. Caperton's lobbying skills in the Legislature, the state intends to buy art and crafts, as well as fruits and vegetables, from West Virginians and sell them at a 59,000-square-foot complex called Tamarack, planned for the southern town of Beckley.
"This is controversial," he said. "But it's a whole new industry. We expect to attract 500,000 visitors a year and create 3,000 jobs."
With all these projects as Mr. Caperton is about to leave office, state officials decided that a yearlong festival was the appropriate send-off.
Slanesville, which is using the Homecoming '96 festival to raise money for a new community building, is no stranger to big events. In 1991, President Bush and Mr. Caperton flew in helicopters to the elementary school here to honor Rae Ellen McKee as national teacher of the year. Today, Mr. Caperton returned by car to present official Homecoming '96 highway signs to Slanesville's festival leaders, Jean and Don Sowers and Springfield's chairwoman, Jean Horne.
The school's fourth graders sang songs. Local officials spoke. Mr. Caperton told the small crowd from Slanesville and other nearby communities, "Homecoming is a time to reflect on who we are and where we came from." Then he cut a cake.
Later, after the Governor had left, the Sowers, Ms. Horne and a few other local residents thought about West Virginia's growing mix of images and wondered if they would ever change for good.
"Tourism plays such a large part of what's going on," said Janet Harlow, who runs an art studio in Augusta, referring to the growing popularity of skiing, white-water rafting and other outdoor activities. "I tell friends they should come here and see the natural beauty of the place, buy a vacation home, retire here.
"But I also tell them," she added ruefully, "we don't have one leg shorter than the other just because we walk on mountains."

HEADLINE: Talbots Makes Debut On Litchfield Green

BYLINE: BY SUSAN PEARSALL 

 BODY:
LAST WEEKEND, one of Litchfield's venerable brick buildings, part of the business district that faces the green, took a retail identity for the 21st century. Built in 1890, the "Beach Block" (as it is known in the archives) now sports a fresh coat of bright, white paint on its fluted pilasters, display windows full of tastefully dressed mannequins, planters filled with hardy red geraniums, a distinctive red door and signs bearing the logo "Talbots."
This is store number 472 for the women's clothing chain based in Hingham, Mass., and one of 11 such stores in Connecticut. It is the first chain store on the green and it has caused considerable controversy in the town of 7,365, where small, independent shops have been the rule. 
 Supporters said Talbots would draw more people in and boost the local economy. Opponents feared one chain store would start a trend that would raise rents and drive out local merchants.
It appears both sides had valid points. Since August, when Talbots signed a 10-year lease with officers of the Greater Litchfield Preservation Trust, which purchased the building in 1994, representatives of two chain retailers -- Yankee Candle of Deerfield, Mass., and Eddie Bauer of Redmond, Wash. -- have inquired about leasing stores on the green.
And on March 15th, opening day at Talbots, employees greeted a steady stream of shoppers and the curious. "It was as if the whole town came out to welcome us," said Margie Brandfon, a Talbots spokeswoman.
John and Mary Kenny of Goshen, she an occasional Talbots catalogue shopper, were there. "I thought it looked lovely," said Mrs. Kenny, but she bought nothing. Perhaps when a sale is in progress, she said.
"It blends in very well with the rest of the block," John Kenny said. "And I think it's something that Litchfield has needed."
But Susan Levine, the elected warden for the borough, warned that "if they do very well, rents will go up everywhere." Parking could become a problem, too, she said.
The rent question is a worry just now for Janus Nelson, the owner of The Workshop for 25 years. Her store sells women's clothing and home accessories, and her lease is coming up for renewal this summer. "I can't help but be a little apprehensive," she said.
Ms. Nelson and a friend went down to Talbots' opening to say hello and ogle the store, with the antiques scattered among the merchandise. "I certainly would like to be able to do what they did," she said.
Among those who skipped the opening were Michel and Ellie Robert, the Litchfield couple who spent more than $12,000 last summer for advertising, warning that one chain store inevitably leads to more.
"Chain stores on the green are primarily for the benefit of tourists, not the residents," Mr. Robert said in a meeting at his home, a historic mansion near the green. "Residents are not going to shop at Talbots. If you want to grow a neighborhood, you need to have the kinds of stores that cause the residents to interact with each other."
Although Mr. Robert had threatened to file a lawsuit against the trust if it signed a lease with Talbots, he has abandoned that approach, calling it too time-consuming. In January, he set up a nonprofit group called Friends of the Green to offer financial and marketing assistance to local merchants opening shops on the green. So far, 36 people have joined the group, which has raised $70,000, most of it donated by Mr. Robert, a management consultant, and taken its first new merchant under its wing.
Last December, Steffie Wilcox was thinking about selling her hair salon and retiring after 22 years on South Street when she was approached several times by Yankee Candle. "But I refused everything," she said, "because I still was bound and determined for it to be a hair salon."
Friends of the Green offered to pay the difference between Ms. Wilcox's $25,000 asking price and offers other hair stylists might make. "Within a matter of days, we had three candidates," Mr. Robert said. The group decided on Margaret Cznera of Torrington, paid Ms. Wilcox $15,000 and gave Ms. Cznera a $25,000 low-interest loan for renovations. Margo's Hair Design is expected to open in April.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the opening of a Talbots store on the Litchfield green quoted incompletely from Michel Robert, an opponent of the store. Contending that chain stores on the green benefited primarily tourists, not residents, Mr. Robert said, "Residents are not going to shop at Talbots every day or even once a week or once a month."

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
THEY were among the real estate industry's household names in the 80's, the ones on the buy or build side of almost every New York City deal. And then the recession came, and the old-time entrepreneurs -- dealmakers like Francis Greenburger, Dick Berry, Joe Newman, Larry Silverstein, Joe Bernstein, and his brother, Ralph -- seemed to simply stop doing deals here.
Some, like Joseph Newman, lost the real estate empires they had so painstakingly built over the prior decades. Others, like Stephen Green, held onto what they had, but turned their energies to lower-profile activities like third-party management. Others, like Bernard Mendik, spent most of their time refinancing and refurbishing buildings. Still others, like Richard Berry, set their sights outside of beleaguered New York, and snapped up land in the Sun Belt, in Philadelphia, even overseas. 
 And now, slowly, they -- or their sons and daughters -- are coming back. They are putting flesh on the skeletal plans to convert downtown's obsolete office buildings to residential use, building shopping centers in the under-stored parts of New York, even laying foundations for new buildings. "In the last six months we've seen people we haven't heard from for at least five years," said John D. Busi, director of Cushman & Wakefield's New York appraisal division.
Sales brokers are noticing the same thing. "The people who have sat on the sidelines for years are jumping back in with both feet," said Daun Paris, president of Eastern Consolidated Properties.
Few of their deals are big and splashy. But the types of buildings they are buying, the prices they are paying and the speed with which they are moving are having an impact on the real estate market -- and on the New York economy -- that is far greater than the deals alone would indicate.
For the returnees were, and again are, the industry's risk takers (albeit this time around, most are risking other people's money). Institutions, for the most part, buy buildings for the cash flow they already provide. Entrepreneurs buy buildings that they feel they can turn into winners.
"The institutions buy what looks good on the cover of a brochure," said Mr. Mendik, who just formed a joint venture with RB Realty, the financier Robert Bass's company, to buy New York office buildings. "We buy what will eventually look good on a brochure."
This is no minor distinction. The return of the old-timers to the market has made long-standing plans to revitalize neighborhoods doable, and swaths of buildings saleable.
"Two years ago, when I had a building to sell, I'd go to insurance companies, pension funds or foreign investors," said Michael Myers, chairman of the brokerage Corporate Realty Partners. "Today, I'd go straight to the New York entrepreneurs."
In fact, many of those entrepreneurs are going to the brokers. "I call every broker every week, asking if they have something for me," said Norman Sturner, whose Murray Hill Properties bought 1140 Avenue of the Americas, at 44th Street, and 225 East 43d Street, as the recession was ending.
The impact is particularly noticeable in lower Manhattan, where real estate experts have for decades suggested that obsolete office buildings be converted to residential use.
Indeed, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's much-heralded downtown plan includes juicy tax abatements to spur investors to undertake such conversions.
Institutions, leery of the risk involved whenever a building's use is changed, are not scrambling to get with the program. In contrast, Mr. Greenburger, whose Time Equities company lost several buildings to lenders in the recession, is about a month away from completing the conversion to residential of 47 West Street, a commercial building he held onto at Rector Street. In November he bought 56 Beaver Street with the same plan in mind.
Rockrose Development, the corporate name under which the Elghanayan family operates, bought 127 John Street for the same reason, and is eyeing several other Wall Street area properties. Joe Newman's Broadway Management and several others are looking for properties to convert.
They are moving fast when they find them. "I looked at 56 Beaver, and in half an hour told my broker I wanted it," said Mr. Greenburger, who paid $2.9 million for the building. "It was a beautiful building in excellent condition, and the price was right. This was an easy decision to make."
In fact, another buyer outbid Mr. Greenburger for the building, but that buyer's financing fell through. When that happened, Mr. Greenburger had a deal and financing in 72 hours, from a lender he says he dealt with extensively in the 80's. "It was a relationship loan to me," he said.
Such stories do not surprise Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "Tax problems are not the only reason we don't have REITs in New York," he said, referring to the Wall Street mechanism by which many owners take their buildings public. "Entrepreneurs make decisions fast. They don't want to deal with boards of directors, or to cede the power to run buildings their way."
WHILE most of the action is in the residential arena, Manhattan's office buildings are getting their share of attention, too. Louis Feil's organization recently bought 250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street. Donald Trump now owns 40 Wall Street. The Bernstein brothers have bought land adjacent to Heron Tower, at 70 East 55th Street.
Douglas Durst, the late developer Seymour Durst's son, says he is ready to build an office tower on Times Square. Arthur Zeckendorf Jr. and his brother William have been assembling land on Eighth Avenue, not far from their massive office and apartment complex at 50th Street, and in July, along with several partners, bought 770 Lexington Avenue, an 18-story office building at 60th Street.
Harold A. Fetner, the 35-year-old son of the late developer Sidney Fetner, is most excited about the two apartment houses he is about to build on the Upper East Side. But he is buying two office buildings, too.
"We've never owned office buildings in Manhattan, but we have some foreign investors who say this is what they want," Mr. Fetner said.
Mr. Newman is converting 820 Second Avenue, the 44th Street building he recently bought, to commercial condominiums. He paid about $110 a square foot for the building; he has sold most of it to the Government of Syria for $225 a square foot.
"We knew the proximity to the U.N. would make this feasible," he said. Now he is looking for other commercial buildings, either to convert or manage traditionally. "We want buildings that were selling for $200 million in the 1980's and are asking maybe $60 million now," he said.
Nor is the activity limited to Manhattan. After a several-year hiatus, Forest City Ratner, Bruce Ratner's company, has resumed building new office towers at Metrotech, his huge office complex in downtown Brooklyn. He has also committed $180 million to retail development in the boroughs outside of Manhattan, and says he has identified another $180 million worth of developable sites. "We are doing more retail development now than we have in our entire history," he said.
The Queens-based developer Joshua Muss is looking for apartment buildings in neighborhoods like Flushing, where rents are fairly high. He is even considering selected sites for new office buildings.
"The boroughs are sadly underbuilt for first-class space," he said.
But what brings these people back now?
A myriad reasons. Many cite confidence in Mayor Giuliani's policies, particularly his tax abatement and revitalization programs. Many cite the low vacancy rate for rental housing. Many cite the availability of bargains. And many cite a light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel mentality.
Rockrose, for one, spent much of the recession scrambling for tenants for the then-vacant and debt-ridden Carnegie Hall Tower, on West 57th Street. Now the building is fairly well leased, and in no danger of foreclosure, so the Elghanayans are back in buying mode.
"It is hard for someone like me to let a good opportunity go by," said H. Henry Elghanayan, Rockrose's chief executive. "But I couldn't start a new project when Carnegie Hall tower was still unleased."
Other entrepreneurs say they saw that tunnel light several years ago. "It took me two years to catch my breath, to realize that, even in the worst real estate depression I'd ever witnessed, our buildings were leasing," said Stephen L. Green, who says he is about to close on two Manhattan office buildings. "If money had been available, I would have started buying again in 1992."
And some developers are simply resuming projects that had been on indefinite hold. The Rudin family recently converted 55 Broad Street, the vacant downtown office building they have long owned, into a center for fledgling interactive technology companies. This year, Mr. Muss expects to finally build Renaissance Plaza, the office-and-hotel complex in downtown Brooklyn that he has tried to finance for 13 years. He is expanding a shopping center he owns in Jackson Heights, Queens, and adding 30,000 square feet to an office building in Flushing.
"I'm working with lots of properties we've owned for a while," he said.
Similarly, for nearly a dozen years Larry Silverstein, who lately has done most of his property buying in Washington, D.C., and Michigan, has wanted to build rental housing on the square block he owns that spans 11th to 12th Avenues and 41st to 42d Streets. First, there were zoning problems, then there were legal problems, then the recession hit. This year, finally, he expects to "get the shovels in the ground" for two 40-story apartment houses, with 900 units each.
But the biggest factor drawing the entrepreneurs back to market is that the lenders have finally loosened their purse strings, even for people who could not pay their debts in the recession.
"Many of them could have worked through their problems if the Fed had not clamped down on the banks," said Benjamin V. Lambert, chairman of Eastdil Realty, a real estate investment bank. "These people still have an enormous amount of intangible equity: their track records from the 70's and 80's."
Moreover, a new set of lenders have come to town: venture capital funds like Tiger, Odyssey and the like. Unlike the more traditional lenders, they are willing to buy buildings that are in less than tiptop shape.
"These funds will invest or lend money on their perception of how well a building can do in the future, because that's the only way they'll get their 20 percent returns," said Joel G. Shapiro, a real estate partner at the accounting firm BDO Seidman.
INCREASINGLY, the funds are partnering up with people who have long track records in turning buildings around. For example, under Mr. Mendik's arrangement with RB Realty, RB will provide most of the capital. Mr. Mendik will scout out and renovate the buildings. "We are talking about buildings that need substantial work, and that's where our talent comes in," Mr. Mendik said.
On the surface, all the hustle and bustle may sound like the 80's redux. It is not. Most of the entrepreneurs learned from their mistakes and those of others, and know what to avoid this time around.
"I won't put up another condo," said Donald Zucker, whose last major condominium building, the Fortune in Murray Hill, hit the market in early 1992, and still has not sold out completely. "With a condo, interest rates eat you up alive, and once you've sold the units, the building is gone. With a rental, even if you have to take low rents in a terrible market, you can usually hang on until the market turns around."
Mr. Zucker, who spent the last few years building houses in Smithtown, L.I., now is putting up a 12-story, 195-unit rental building at Houston and Elizabeth Street.
Many others say that this time, they are less likely to go it alone. "In the 80's the banks were so forthcoming and our own business generated so much money that we didn't need outside funds," said Mr. Greenburger. "Now we look for outside equity."
And many have learned to set a ceiling on what they will pay, even for a property they really want. Mr. Newman, who spent the past few years laboring under a staggering $1.75 billion in debt -- and lost his entire portfolio of 12 million square feet -- recently partnered with C.S. First Boston to buy Cityspire, the infamous "whistling building" at 156 West 56th Street. He says he had been interested in the building for more than a year, but balked at the owner's asking price of $50 million.
"It just wasn't worth it," said Mr. Newman, who got the building for $38 million.
How long the New York entrepreneurs will keep buying and building is anyone's guess. An imminent building boom a la the 1980's is unlikely. That kind of money is not available, and even if it were, land prices and construction costs are still too high to make much new construction feasible.
Mr. Zucker, for one, would love to put up more rental housing, but the numbers just don't work. "I can't find a piece of land in a location that will give me the kinds of rentals I need to support the cost of construction," he said.
Competition for existing buildings is intense, as would-be investors who are not well-versed in real estate follow the old-timers' lead.
"When experienced investors come back into an area, it is a good indication of a trend," said Rosina K. Abramson, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who has several clients who are looking for New York property. "They see so much money chasing deals in New York that they are interested, too."
The influx of new buyers is already driving prices up. "Every building I'm bidding on has five other bidders," Mr. Newman said. He should know: Mr. Myers was pretty sure he could get Cityspire for his clients for $34 million; Henry Elghanayan bid on it, too; only after topping their prices did Joe Newman and First Boston get the building.
Such tales are echoed all over town. Mr. Silverstein bid on Financial Square, a downtown building, but lost it to Germany's Paramount Group last year. Paramount paid $135 million. "Even $115 million would have been pushing it," Mr. Silverstein said.
Mr. Myers offered a portfolio of 14 Greenwich Village properties to about 80 people, and got 29 offers. The portfolio went for $14 million, nearly 40 percent more than Mr. Myers had anticipated. "Two years ago I'd have brought it to half the people, gotten maybe 5 or 10 offers, and sold it for $10 million or $11 million, tops," he said.
As happy as the uptick is making sellers, it is scaring the would-be buyers. Hal Fetner bid $22 million for 345 Park Avenue South, near 25th Street; another investor group got it for $24 million. "You're definitely seeing prices go up, and it's making me nervous," Mr. Fetner said. "Too many people are showing up with foreign investors in tow, who don't care about returns. I can't compete against them."
INDEED, some of the local entrepreneurs already are walking away from deals. Mr. Sturner was about to pay $65 million for 850 Third Avenue, at 51st Street, when the Chicago financier Sam Zell made a last-minute $70 million bid. Mr. Sturner refused to meet it.
"One thing we've decided not to do, which we did in the 80's, is chase deals," he said. "Back then, you paid anything because you knew someone else would pay you more."
Still, even if prices keep climbing, it is unlikely the New York entrepreneurs will move back to the sidelines any time soon. They just seem too delighted to be wheeling and dealing in their hometown again.
F. Anthony Zunino and Richard Berry (hence the name ZuBerry, their corporate entity) bailed out of almost all of their New York properties in 1986. They spent most of the recession developing garden apartments in Houston. They loved how easy it was to get approvals to build or alter, and they certainly made money, but the culture shock got them.
"Out there you send tenants cards on birthdays, people move if you raise your rent a nickel, and the amenity that excites them is a huge TV in a club room where they can watch Monday night football," Mr. Berry said. "It is just hard to work outside of New York when you have New York blood in your veins."
Since 1994, ZuBerry has sold most of its Houston property. It has taken a big equity share in 641 Avenue of the Americas, a 20th Street building with a lot of architects, public relations firms and other service-company tenants. It bought 116 West 14th Street, a small office building that it has converted to loft apartments and four floors of commercial space. And it bought a handful of other small commercial buildings, many with off-beat tenants, that the partners will operate as is.
"It is good to operate in the hip world again, where the people you deal with have interesting things to say," Mr. Berry said.
Others note that nothing beats being able to reach out and touch their buildings. When Sidney Fetner died eight years ago, his son decided to branch out of New York. He built a 50,000-square-foot warehouse in Springfield, Va., and has a warehouse project going in Dayton, Ohio, right now.
"I felt with computers and airplanes, I could manage," Hal Fetner said.
Manage he did -- but, he discovered, the psychological oomph was gone.
"I realize now how much I enjoy driving by my property and smiling, or taking my friends, or even my bankers, to my building, and saying, 'This is mine,' " he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about developers who are returning to the real estate market misspelled the surname of the man who recently purchased Cityspire. He is Joseph Neumann, not Newman.

HEADLINE: The Smart Way to Ease Big Cities' Crush

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman's March 20 column, "Bangkok Bogs Down," captures well the unsustainability of urban growth patterns in the developing world, but gets the prescribed cure wrong: "Big Government." 
 Big Government in the United States and everywhere else has solved urban congestion problems by building more road capacity. This has led to more congestion, not less.
What is required is "smart government." The sustainable solution to Bangkok's congestion does require more mass transit and some road improvements, but above all it requires a market in tradable vehicle-use permits like the one we developed to attack Mexico City's congestion and air pollution problems. This market would allocate the available "ecological budget" in an equitable and cost-effective manner.
Without such ecological limits, the world's large cities are destined to become like Bangkok, and several, such as Mexico City and Sao Paulo in this hemisphere, are well on their way.

HEADLINE: The Downsizing Myth

BYLINE: By H. Erich Heinemann; H. Erich Heinemann is head of Heinemann Economic Research, a division of Brimberg & Company, an institutional brokerage.

 BODY:
The United States is not downsizing. It is upsizing. The economy is not growing as fast as some economists wish it would, but it is expanding.
Although you might not know it from the media reports, the current expansion is five years old. In that time, companies have been hiring steadily. Since March 1991, the total number of civilian workers has risen about eight million. And contrary to the reports about managerial downsizing, half the new jobs have been classified as managerial or professional. 
 Of course, cutbacks at large companies like AT&T are painful. But the overall job market may actually be more stable than earlier in the postwar period. For instance, layoffs as a percentage of employment -- measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance -- have averaged 18 percent thus far in the 1990's, close to a 50-year low.
Blue collar workers haven't benefited from this upsizing in the job market, but they haven't been hurt either. The number of production jobs in manufacturing has held steady at about 12.6 million -- almost the same number as in 1946.
And real wages? Pundits claim that salaries have gone down. But they use figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that are misleading, because its calculations exclude benefits and bonuses, the fastest-growing parts of workers' compensation. When they are included, the average real compensation is now about $16.75 an hour (in 1992 dollars), up more than 2 percent from last year.
Real consumer spending for goods and services per hour worked -- the mirror image of compensation -- has risen at a rate of about 1 percent per year since the mid-1970's.
Of course, deap anxiety exists. But the change in the economy is what is causing the problem: Jobs have been moving from Fortune 500 companies to small business, the engine of expansion. And women, who have won almost two of every three new jobs in the last 30 years, have displaced men, especially older men.
This transition is painful, but it is the slow growth in living standards that is the country's main economic problem. The only reliable solution to the slow pace of upsizing is more investment and more productivity. That's what the politicians should be be working on.

HEADLINE: A Look at Europe's Future

 BODY:
The 1991 Treaty on European Union set out an ambitious plan for political, economic and monetary union by the end of this decade. With the decade more than half over, much of that agenda remains wishful. Europe's governance structures are unwieldy. Its quest for a common foreign and security policy stumbled badly in Bosnia. Only 3 of the European Union's 15 countries now meet the deficit target for the single currency.
This week, the 15 member governments open what amounts to a yearlong constitutional convention with a mandate to revise the treaty. The conference agenda is ostensibly open, but participants have already agreed to focus on procedural issues like faster decision making, unanimous versus majority voting and increased cooperation in law enforcement. These are important, but Europe also needs to address the larger questions and should consider scaling back, or at least delaying, some of its unrealistic goals. 
 The clearest example is the commitment to launch a common currency by 1999. Germany and France are wedded to this goal as the embodiment of true union, even though neither would now meet the stringent economic standards for participation. Among other criteria, countries must reduce their deficits to 3 percent or less of gross domestic product. Germany's deficit stands at 3.6 percent, France's at 5 percent. Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal are even further from the target.
While it is theoretically possible for countries like Germany and even France to reach the target next year, it makes little sense. Both should be reducing their double-digit unemployment rates, not chasing arbitrary monetary and fiscal targets. France's Government triggered widespread labor unrest last year with its initial plans for budgetary austerity. Unemployment rates and budget deficits are even higher elsewhere in the European Union.
Creating a common European currency would be a convenience to international businesses and would force close coordination of economic policies. But it is not a necessity for continued union.
Forging common European foreign and defense policies is an admirable goal and one that could ease the burden on the United States to intervene directly in places like Bosnia. But the plan, which will be reviewed at the conference, needs more careful groundwork. As Bosnia showed, European countries are not yet prepared to take difficult decisions, submerge national interests or deploy troops effectively. France's recent decision to seek European defense coordination within NATO might make more effective European military cooperation possible in the near future.
The dream of European unity has achieved much in the last four decades. As it evolved from a narrow coal and steel community to a broad political and economic union, it has overcome the traumas caused by German aggression in two world wars and built a remarkably close partnership between Germany and France, long bitter rivals. It has brought increased trade and prosperity to Europe and America alike.
A realistic retreat now on currency targets will not shatter the European dream. On the contrary, it will conserve strength for the expanding challenges of the future.

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Is Gripping Smaller Cities of New York

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y.

 BODY:
This pretty, rusting city beside the Mohawk River is going broke. A few months ago, it used $3 million set aside for a new courthouse and other construction projects to pay bills. This month, it managed to pay its employees only because the state speeded up a chunk of aid.
And so, facing a deficit said to exceed 10 percent of Utica's $36 million budget, Mayor Edward A. Hanna proposed the unthinkable. He proposed eliminating spending on the Utica Public Library, the zoo and the children's museum. Even worse, to many here, he proposed laying off police officers and firefighters. 
 The Mayor's prescription provoked such a storm of outrage that the city's Common Council basically ignored it and, last week, rolled back the cuts -- without, as even the Council president acknowledged, resolving the lurking deficit.
"By August, we're going to be absolutely broke," the Mayor said after the Council's vote, voicing a fear his opponents say is exaggerated but one supported by fiscal monitors such as the state's Comptroller, H. Carl McCall.
And Utica may not be alone. A fiscal crisis, like the one that racked New York City in the 1970's, has gripped the state's smaller cities, making this city's convulsions far from extraordinary.
With alarming frequency, cities like Utica, Rome, Schenectady and Niagara Falls have found themselves staggering under the crush of budget deficits. In the last two years, the finances of Troy and Newburgh degenerated so badly that the state stepped in, creating fiscal oversight agencies like the ones that have monitored New York City and Yonkers for two decades.
The crisis, simply, reflects the fact that the cost of providing municipal services has risen as rapidly as revenue from taxes and state and Federal aid has fallen.
More broadly, however, it reflects the gnawing decline of the state's urban cores, as the economy lurches along, property values fall and companies, jobs and finally people pack up for the suburbs or other states. And that, according to the cities' advocates, threatens to erode the state's overall economic viability.
"It's not just an isolated problem in a few cities," said Peter A. Baynes, the deputy director of the New York State Conference of Mayors in Albany. "It's really something that's happening across the state."
The crisis has forced many cities to raise taxes, despite the prevailing antitax climate, or to make cuts in core services once thought politically untouchable. In some cases, they have done both, causing considerable voter anguish while barely denting the problem.
Schenectady raised property taxes 4 percent and laid off 19 firefighters earlier this year. Last week, the new Mayor of Troy, Mark P. Pattison, let go eight police officers, including the entire mounted unit, despite having raised property taxes 21 percent and water rates 38 percent. And Troy still faces a deficit.
 
Cities' Declines Worse Than State's
In a survey of 25 of New York's cities, released last Friday, Moody's Investors Service found that "most are struggling to maintain fiscal balance" and concluded that would continue.
"While the state's economic growth has lagged behind that of the nation, cities' declines have been greater and more extensive than the state's," the credit-rating agency said in its weekly report, "Credit Perspectives." And, the report said, "New York cities will likely continue to function under a high level of stress for at least the next several years."
The scope of the crisis seems small compared with the more prominent woes of the state's larger cities, particularly New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has had to wrestle down annual budget gaps of $2 billion to $3 billion. In many ways, however, the solutions are more elusive.
While the crisis predates the current budget impasses in Washington and Albany, today's political realities have all but erased hope for a bailout from above. Nor is there much hope that the state's economy will turn around soon. According to budget experts, the fiscal troubles in the smaller cities may hamper a recovery by forcing out more jobs and people.
"That's really the fear," Mr. McCall said. "As you increase taxes and depress services, then you lose population. The downward spiral continues."
New York's cities, like those throughout the Northeast, have been struggling for decades, of course, as urban ills have spread and the middle class has fled. But the new crisis stems from two specific, related events in the early 1990's.
First, the state, under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, began to cut its aid to local governments, which relied heavily on it to supplement their budgets. The aid, known as revenue sharing, has fallen by nearly half since 1989, to slightly more than $500 million this year.
At the same time, the state's economy fell into a recession from which it has not yet recovered. That has eroded property values, the major source of tax revenues, especially for smaller cities. It has also driven out factories and businesses, further cutting tax revenues by shrinking the tax base.
 
64% of Cities Had Property-Value Fall
In a report last month, the Conference of Mayors found that 64 percent of the state's cities had a decline in property values in the last year alone, accelerating the trend that began in the early 1990's.
Edward C. Farrell, the group's executive director, said the erosion had forced cities to raise property taxes on the properties that remained to keep the same revenue level. With the reductions in state aid, he said, the cities can no longer raise enough to pay the rising cost of basic services, like garbage collection and public safety.
Even with rising taxes and budget cutting, some cities have not been able to keep up. In the last five years, six cities -- Gloversville, Jamestown, Newburgh, Rome, Troy and Utica -- have had to borrow money to cover operating deficits. Deficit financing, which requires approval from the State Legislature, provides an infusion of cash but at future costs and thus, to fiscal monitors, reflects grave instability.
Gov. George E. Pataki's new budget proposal offers little prospect of immediate help for the cities, although for a second year the Governor did not cut revenue sharing any further. Instead of aid, he proposed easing state mandates on things like construction projects and union arbitration. Those proposals, however, face opposition in the Legislature and, even if passed, might not produce significant savings quickly.
The Governor's budget did include $25 million in emergency aid for "distressed" local governments, but he reduced it to $10 million when revising his budget this month. And it remains unclear which cities would get it. "All of our members," Mr. Farrell said, "assume they qualify as distressed."
Utica's troubles are not unlike those facing most of the state's Rust Belt cities, the hubs that had thrived on industry since the 19th century. Since 1970, however, Utica has lost nearly 60 percent of its manufacturing jobs, according to the Moody's report, as well as 20,000 or so residents, leaving it with 68,000 today.
 
Buildings Are Empty On a Main Street
The outward signs of Utica's decline are everywhere. Along its commercial spine, Genesee Street, buildings stand empty, including the downtown's 14-story pride, the Bankers Trust Building. The city has 300 abandoned buildings, many in need of demolition.
Since the recession began, according to the Conference of Mayors, the city's property tax base has eroded 7.2 percent. The result, city officials said, was a $2.6 million drop in property tax revenue, to around $15 million a year.
All the while, the cost of services has continued to rise, mainly driven by salaries and benefits for unionized employees, including those for firefighters and police officers, which are mandated by the state's binding arbitration process.
Utica's fiscal problems, brewing for years, became more public last November, with the election of Mr. Hanna, an iconoclastic 73-year-old businessman who won a three-way race for Mayor as an independent.
After taking office in January, he declared the city on the brink of bankruptcy and proposed his painful budget for the fiscal year beginning in April, cutting the city's spending by $1.5 million in all.
"Listen, a city is not a city without the library," Mr. Hanna said, referring to his plan to eliminate city support for the library on Genesee Street, cutting $483,000 of its $700,000 budget. "But that's how broke we are."
Mr. Hanna's budget shocked almost everyone. Angry protests arose. A campaign to save the library began. A petition to save the Utica Zoo went around. More important, the unions lobbied the Common Council to reverse proposed layoffs of nearly 100 of the city's 600 employees.
"The condition of the city is not great," said Anthony F. Zumpano, the president of the Utica Professional Firefighters Association. "But it's not time to throw in the towel yet."
By the time it voted at a crowded meeting last Wednesday night, the Council had restored most of the Mayor's cuts. (The library still lost a little money and announced it would close its two neighborhood branches.) The Council did so by doubling parking fines to $20, hoping to raise $200,000, and by tapping Federal grants set aside for community development.
In approving the budget, however, Council members acknowledged that they had still neither covered a $1 million deficit left from this fiscal year nor repaid the $3 million taken from the capital fund. What is more, the new budget did not take into account at least $1 million in expenses expected in the coming year.
"We are human beings," Councilman Roger F. Amodio, a Republican, said, explaining the Council's reluctance to cut so drastically, even if holes remained. "We've done the very best we could with a bad budget."
It may not be enough. Unless Utica soon finds a way to cover its deficit, it may run out of cash to pay its bills, including those for the construction of its courthouse, for two new fire trucks to be delivered this spring and even for the payroll.
Utica's scramble raises the specter of a state takeover, like the one in Troy last year. That city, on the Hudson near Albany, had run up deficits for six straight years until it accumulated a $12 million deficit, more than a quarter of its budget, and risked defaulting on its bonds.
Two years ago, the Legislature created a board, headed by the State Comptroller, to review Troy's finances. Last year, with little improvement apparent, the board's powers were expanded to give it near-veto power, forcing the Mayor and Council to face up to the city's problems.
With the creation of the Troy Municipal Assistance Corporation, like the one that bailed out New York City in the 1970's when it could no longer borrow money to pay its bills, the city may manage to avoid a default. But it is not out of the woods. More cuts and higher taxes are likely.
"I don't think people have a real sense of the depth of the crisis," said Mr. Pattison, a Democrat who became Mayor in January.
Trying to avoid a repeat of Troy's near-collapse, the Comptroller has proposed legislation that would create a more uniform process for reviewing cities' finances, rather than leaving it to the Legislature to address case by case. Mr. McCall has said he hopes the process would identify crises in the making, like Utica's, and provide help before cities reach the brink.

Sunlight And Shadow

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
California, land of the possible. So it used to be: the state where optimism was policy and the policy worked. Not today.
Two Republican Governors 50 years apart define the change. Earl Warren was an optimist whose political method was to appeal to the best in human nature. He himself had risen from poverty by way of the University of California -- which had nominal tuition then for state students -- and he worked to make that kind of opportunity available to all Californians. He was a tough prosecutor before he was Governor, but he also sought to reduce crime by easing social inequalities. 
 Pete Wilson first made his political mark as a progressive Mayor of San Diego. As Governor, he has increasingly turned to the politics of division, appealing to the anger of voters on such issues as immigration and affirmative action. His three-strikes law is making California the world capital of incarceration.
Education was a key aspect of California's spectacular growth in the decades after World War II. Governor Warren built large numbers of schools, enough to keep up with the rapid rise in the state's population. The rich sent their children to public schools.
Today California is near the bottom of state school rankings by average number of pupils per teacher. In spending per student, by 1992 it had fallen to 36th among the states. Private schools are booming.
Higher education was also a priority of Governor Warren and his successor, Democrat Pat Brown. The many campuses of the University of California and California State made up the best public system in the country. And it was all virtually free.
In the last five years, fees have quadrupled in the state system, so it is no longer the same ladder of upward mobility. Despite the higher costs to students, the university is pinched for funds because state support has been severely limited.
The growth industry in California is prisons. As recently as 15 years ago the state spent six times as much on higher education as on prisons. Last year the prison budget was larger -- and the disparity is going to grow.
It now takes about 10 percent of the state budget to operate the prisons. According to a study by the Rand Corporation, it will be 18 percent six years from now. Given mandatory spending for other things under state budget rules, that will leave just 1 percent for the universities.
Prison guards, who have a powerful union, now earn more than public school teachers. In fact, a guard at San Quentin has the same annual salary, about $45,000, as an assistant professor at the University of California.
Seventeen new prisons have been built in the last 15 years. Fifteen more will be needed by the year 2000, to house among others the flood of inmates serving 25 years to life under the three-strikes law. The construction cost will be around $5 billion.
You could not have a starker statement of a society's outlook than the figures for education and prisons in California. Of course crime is a serious problem. But political leaders worth the name would be thinking, urgently, about ways to deal with the problem other than incarcerating nonviolent criminals and holding convicts through harmless old age.
A study by the California Higher Education Policy Center, published last year by the Public Agenda Foundation, quoted a California businessman.
"In the 1950's and 60's," he said, "California had the greatest educational system that had ever existed on the face of the earth. Today I will pay more tuition for my child to go to third grade in private school than I paid for college and law school combined. I personally don't care because I am rich. I got a chance to be rich because education was available at virtually no cost. But what about the family that is situated today the way mine was? You create a lack of promise that has widespread implications."
The downgrading of education is dangerous for a reason beyond the effect on class divisions. Education is the crucial element for success in the new world economy. For California to fall behind the Asian states that make education a priority is to blight its future.
What happens in California, it used to be said, is a preview of what will happen to all of America. We have to hope that that is no longer true.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
A Nostalgia For Death And Taxes

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
The year is 2000. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, having eliminated term limits, is looking ahead to his next campaign, and Gov. George E. Pataki, halfway through his second term, is planning ahead, too.
Each has a team of advisers who meet weekly to plot strategy. They are all looking for the same thing: salable issues and slogans to satisfy the public mood. But they are having a hard time. What used to be so easy is no longer. A few things have changed in recent years. The old campaign promises have been kept too well. 
 Congress killed the biggest campaign issue. It pushed through that constitutional amendment, quickly approved by the states, mandating the death penalty for the killing of any law enforcement agent -- Federal, state or local. Prosecutors would no longer have any discretion in the most sensitive and highly publicized capital cases. Which meant candidates had been robbed of a no-lose campaign issue.
"The death penalty did it for us twice," recalled Arthur J. Finkelstein, Mr. Pataki's top campaign adviser. "Remember that D.A. from the Bronx? I'll always believe he re-elected George single-handedly." Mr. Finkelstein sighed when he thought about Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney who objected to capital punishment, even in the death of a police officer. "A gift," said the nostalgic strategist.
Michael C. Finnegan, the Governor's counsel, bemoaned the loss of another issue. "We can't take on judges anymore, either," he said. "No more 'junk justice.' " The rage of the mid-1990's collapsed when both Congress and the New York State Legislature approved mandatory sentences across the board. Even mandatory bail. Now, sitting on the bench is about as challenging, and discretionary, as being Vanna White on "Wheel of Fortune 2000."
Of course, these laws have put many more people behind bars, even street peddlers and marijuana users. The state is still building more prisons and the city has added more police officers, so many that no mayoral candidate can promise "more cops" anymore.
"O.K., forget the bench," said former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. "What about welfare cheats?" At Gracie Mansion, Mr. Giuliani was asking his welfare expert, Richard Schwartz, the same thing. Probably nothing there, Mr. Schwartz said. "We've really eliminated welfare as we knew it."
The whole country stole that issue. First, the states cracked down, led by former Gov. John Engler of Michigan, now the Vice President. Then Congress followed, turning welfare grants into block grants to the states and letting the states compete at reducing benefits. First, they put recipients of Home Relief -- childless, single adults -- into workfare programs; then, they eliminated Home Relief altogether and turned to women with children.
In New York City by 1999, 73.2 percent of the work-eligible women on welfare were in workfare programs. Mostly, they clean parks and municipal restrooms, replacing the city employees whom Mr. Giuliani dispensed with in his drastic downsizing. This has put a drag on the economy and reduced the city's population. "But the parks have never looked so good," the evergreen Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, attests.
Mr. D'Amato grew wistful about taxes. "From Reagan on, that was always an easy one, wasn't it -- cut, cut, cut," said the former lawmaker, who concluded his Whitewater investigation late in 1998 and surprised everyone by retiring to a house with a pool in Island Park, L.I.
Before he left Washington, Mr. D'Amato saw Congress make off with the tax-cut issue: having bid down all income taxes, the politicians had no alternative but to raise revenue with a European-style VAT -- Federal, state and local value-added taxes on every sales transaction. Taxes are now so well hidden it doesn't pay to attack them.
Mr. Pataki turned out to be one of the last leaders elected with promises to cut income taxes. Many services declined, fares and tolls shot up and public schools suffered. But he kept his word, and New Yorkers, especially those rich enough to avoid subways and pay for private schools, were appreciative.
"We could promise better education," said Peter J. Powers, the First Deputy Mayor. "Or better transportation and health care."
"No money," Mr. Giuliani said.
"We could promise a better state university," Mr. Finnegan said. "Or a revamped hospital system and revinvestment in our infrastructure."
"No money," the Governor said. "Prisons are all the structure we can afford."
"Yeah," Mr. D'Amato said. "Besides, how are you going to put a 'better curriculum at the State University of New York' in a 30-second commercial? Or 'reinvestment in our infrastructure'? Forget about it."
They sighed. Oh for the days of stubborn prosecutors and independent judges. Oh for the return of death and taxes.

HEADLINE: Public Radio Being Pressed to Turn Its Success Into Independence

BYLINE: By ROBIN D. SCHATZ 

 BODY:
Deep in Appalachia, the residents of hardscrabble Pocahontas County, W. Va., (Pop. 9,000) do not think twice about where to tune their radio dials for country music, local news and helpful announcements about funerals, lost hunting dogs and school lunch menus.
Their favorite station is also their only local station: WVMR-AM of Dunmore, a public radio station where one of the most popular disk jockeys is Virginia Sheets, or Grandma Ginny, a 75-year-old livestock farmer who reads children's books on the air and is the host of the "Senior Power Hour." When a blizzard and subsequent floods ravaged the region in January, WVMR became the county's emergency command center. 
 "We're not alternative radio; we're primary radio," said Gibbs Kinderman, the general manager, who gets by with a mostly volunteer staff and an annual budget of about $100,000.
At WXPN-FM in Philadelphia, the public radio station licensed to the University of Pennsylvania, the acting general manager, Vincent Curren, faces problems that appear very different from those of Mr. Kinderman. Operating in an intensely competitive environment in a city of 4.5 million people who have access to 50 different AM and FM stations, Mr. Curren, who has a $2.2 million budget this year, must make his contemporary popular music station stand out. One creative solution: He is cooperating with the city's two other public radio stations in an experiment to promote one another's programs.
From struggling rural stations to big city-slicker stations that command healthy audience shares and generous donations, the success of public radio -- the 627 stations that receive support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting -- has been one of the industry's best-kept secrets.
Public radio's dependence on Federal financing has been steadily declining in the last 15 years as many stations have improved their operations and attracted more money from businesses and listeners. Federal financing now accounts for an average of 14 percent of the budgets of public radio stations, compared with more than 30 percent in 1980.
"Public radio is very much a growth enterprise," said Tom Thomas, a consultant to the Station Resource Group, a research group in suburban Washington serving the public radio community. "In terms of numbers of people listening, the quantity of original programming being produced and the investments of communities through the public and private sector, we're doing better this year than last year and have been on a long-term, sustained period of growth."
But pressures are mounting for both large and small stations to increase their self-sufficiency and better serve their communities in the face of an increasingly inhospitable political climate, according to Mr. Thomas and other experts.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the federally financed nonprofit organization that helps finance programming and operations for public radio and television, has been under fire by Republicans in Congress who question whether public broadcasting should be supported by taxpayer dollars.
In the last three years, Congress has rescinded $100 million in appropriated funds, according to the corporation and has proposed more cuts. The corporation, which currently gives about $275 million to public radio and television (about three-quarters of the money goes to television), is awaiting reauthorization by Congress, but its survival is no longer taken for granted.
As a result, public radio station managers are becoming shrewd business operators, starting entrepreneurial ventures to raise funds, reaching out for corporate underwriting dollars and considering consolidation and other cost-sharing moves with other public stations.
"I believe in a few years there will be little or no public funding," said Mr. Curren of WXPN, which has lost half a million dollars in Federal appropriations during the last three years. "That's what I'm using as a planning scenario."
Public television, with much bigger budgets and audiences, tends to dominate the debate over public broadcasting. But public radio is growing faster than the more mature public television sector, which is facing a barrage of competition within the television industry and from other forms of entertainment.
The recent boom in public radio has been impressive: according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, financial support for public radio from businesses grew about 69 percent from 1989 to 1994, to $76 million, while support from subscribers grew about 68 percent, to $101 million. During the same period, business support for public television grew about 15 percent, listener support 13 percent.
In the last 10 years, the audience for public radio has doubled, from 9.8 million in 1985 to 19.7 million last year, while that of public television has been relatively flat, growing from 92.8 million to 95.2 million.
"Radio provides a medium that's accessible even as you're going about your daily life," Mr. Thomas said. Listeners are increasingly tuning into public radio's magazine-style programs, like "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered," for analysis of national and global events, not to mention high-quality locally produced programming.
But public radio stations have already glimpsed the future. Regulations just passed by the corporation require the 403 grant recipients, which operate the 627 stations, to demonstrate that they really matter to their communities. By the year 2000, roughly 60 of those receiving grants will have to increase either their listening audiences or the percentage of their support from businesses and listeners to retain their eligibility for Federal financing, according to Rick Madden, director of radio projects and programming at the corporation.
Clearly, according to that criteria, public radio is doing something right. Besides doubling its listening audience in 10 years, consultants and station managers note that public radio is getting a highly educated, affluent audience with a high percentage of males 25 to 54 years old, the kind of listener most commercial stations "would give their eye teeth for," said Kurt Hanson, president of Accuratings, a Chicago-based rating service. Many public radio stations are now going to corporations armed with such demographic data to entice them to underwrite programs.
In Seattle, for example, the two public radio stations, KUOW-FM and KPLU-FM, have begun a joint underwriting program offering corporate sponsors a chance to reach the station's pooled audiences.
Last fall, Accuratings found that public radio was one of the fastest growing formats in a survey of eight major urban markets, including Boston, the home of WBUR, a real Horatio Alger of public radio. When Jane Christo became general manager at the tiny Boston University station in 1979, it had only about 70,000 listeners a week and an annual budget of $350,000 a year.
By focusing its format tightly on news and information and creating strong local programming, Ms. Christo increased the station's weekly audience to 414,000 in 1995, according to data from Arbitron, the leading ratings service. She also weaned it of university support and pumped its budget up to $6.5 million, of which only 10 percent comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Arbitron says the station is now the leader in the 25- to 54-year-old age group during several key time periods.
Business innovations abound elsewhere, too. In St. Paul, the highly successful 29-station Minnesota Public Radio network, which produces the popular "Prairie Home Companion," raises about $150 million a year from its mail-order business, which it reinvests in station purchases and other activities. Aggressive fund-raising by the network includes an emphasis on direct mail solicitations.
Even though the largest stations could manage to survive without Federal support, a loss of Federal support could put smaller and less prosperous stations like Mr. Kinderman's "at a substantial risk," Mr. Madden of the corporation said.
Still, some say public accountability is long overdue. Even Mr. Kinderman of WVMR, which gets about one-third of its budget from the Government and which cannot eke out much more from its depressed county, thinks it is healthy "to question the established verities and say what are the things that are worthy of public support."
"We struggle here economically," he added, "but that's appropriate because everyone else in our community is struggling, too."
Sometimes, when Mr. Kinderman is driving past the scenic landscape that drew him to Pocahontas County and hears an inexperienced disk jockey playing a "not very good" country tune on his station, he questions his commitment to public radio.
"But when the blizzards and the floods come, you know why you're doing it," he said.

HEADLINE: Nature Groups Say Foes Bear Friendly Names

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Northwesterners for More Fish. The words conjure up visions of earth-shoed activists and leaping trout joined in battle against the greedy pillagers of the land.
That is just the kind of image a group of Washington consultants had in mind when they named this "grassroots coalition" for their new clients: big utilities and other companies in the Northwest under attack by environmental groups for depleting the fish population. 
 To environmentalists, Northwesterners for More Fish is just the latest example of "greenscamming," the increasingly common practice of giving environmentally friendly names to groups whose agendas have little to do with the welfare of the environment.
Examples of such groups abound. In Riverside County, Calif., a public relations firm organized Friends of Eagle Mountain on behalf of a mining company that wants to create the world's largest landfill in an abandoned iron ore pit. The National Wetlands Coalition was formed to fight the Endangered Species Act.
And a measure on the California ballot this Tuesday pits the Californians for Balanced Wildlife Management against the California Wildlife Protection Coalition over the hunting of mountain lions. The first group wants to kill them and the second wants to save them.
Even as the public has become disillusioned with large corporations, government and other American institutions, the environmental movement has remained widely popular. The widespread use of environmentally friendly names is industry's grudging tribute to the environmental movement.
A Gallup Poll last year showed that 63 percent of Americans considered themselves "environmentalists," while 34 percent did not. Sixty-two percent said they would give priority to the environment over economic growth while 32 percent said they would give economic growth priority over the environment.
"No one wants to dance with the devil, so they try to come up with a name that's not too devilish," said Bennett Beach, a spokesman for the Wilderness Society. "I suspect that as the country's becoming more and more environmentally sensitive, it's more difficult to be burdened with a name that speaks the truth about your intentions."
One nemesis of the Wilderness Society is the National Wilderness Institute, a group formed in recent years to roll back wetlands regulation in the Endangered Species Act. Though groups like this one assert that environmental regulations are overly burdensome and unnecessary, they recognize the value of an environmentally friendly name.
Other groups that environmentalists consider foes are the Wilderness Impact Research Foundation, a Nevada organization that represents logging, ranching and related interests; the American Environmental Foundation, a Florida property-rights group; the Abundant Wildlife Society of North America, which advocates for hunters, loggers and miners, and the Global Climate Coalition, an association of corporations concerned about regulations to control global warming.
"People sometimes create groups that try to fudge a little bit about what their goals are," said Hal Dash, the president of Cerrell Associates, a public relations firm in Los Angeles that has represented clients with environmental problems. "They want to create a patina of good guy-ness."
Mr. Dash, who represents the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said he "fiddled with a lot of names" that he might have used for his client in a California campaign regarding requirements for electric cars.
"But we decided in our case it was silly, and the best thing to do was be the American Automobile Manufacturers Association," he said. "The press has spent less time worrying about a front group and more focusing on the issue."
In the case of Northwesterners for More Fish, the organization is barely three months old, and environmentalists are trying to "out" it.
One of its chief organizers is Eddie Mahe Jr., a veteran Washington political strategist and former deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Mahe and five other Washington insiders developed a plan several months ago to organize the groups as a grass-roots coalition in the Northwest, according to a planning memorandum given to The Times by environmentalists.
Its aim is to defeat environmentalists who say that utilities, aluminum companies and the timber industry are destroying fish habitats on the Columbia and other rivers. Chief among the environmental groups is Trout Unlimited, perhaps the inspiration for the new group's name.
Northwesterners for More Fish has a budget of $2.6 million for the next year to pay for the costs of establishing itself "as a credible group supporting positive solutions to enhancing fish populations," according to the memorandum. The group aims to limit Federal efforts to protect endangered fish species if the efforts might interfere with industries that rely on the river.
The budget includes $800,000 for television and radio advertisements and $100,000 to influence members of the news media. "The goal of this operation will be to identify supportive media and feed them information to complement and reinforce the paid media effort," the memorandum said.
"While the public can and should be swayed by having the facts on the issue, the message must also appeal at a gut, emotional level," the memorandum said.
Mr. Mahe's office referred calls about the group to a consultant in the Seattle area, Kay Gabriel, who said that she was not free to say what companies were paying the bills for the group. She said the group advocates "barging" fish around dams.
The Washington Water and Power Company provided a luncheon buffet for an organizing meeting of Northwesterners for More Fish in Spokane on Feb. 16 that followed a briefing by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. Also present was an aide to Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho.
It could not be learned who attended the session, but the list of invitees included mostly representatives of aluminum, chemical, mining, oil, power and timber companies.
"They don't give a damn about fish," said Glen Spain, the Northwest regional director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. "This is an ersatz organization. It's like a Styrofoam dummy; it has no relationship to anything but the industries and their vested Federal coffer porkbarrel products."
Mr. Spain said his organization was actually a federation of fishermen's associations.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Buy Fast Computer From Japan

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
A Japanese computer maker may be on the verge of achieving what had previously been unthinkable in this country: selling a supercomputer to a United States Government laboratory.
Two of the three finalists now bidding to supply a $13 million to $35 million supercomputer to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, are Japanese electronics giants: Fujitsu Ltd. and the NEC Corporation. 
 According to several people familiar with the contract review, Fujitsu and NEC are seriously challenging the United States leader in the field, Cray Research Inc., which was recently acquired by Silicon Graphics Inc.
The impending announcement of a winner has piqued interest by both the United States and Japanese Governments, because supercomputers have long been symbols of national technical prowess and have remained at the heart of bitter trade disputes between the two nations.
In Japan, there are more than 100 United States-designed supercomputers in Government-financed laboratories. But a Federal agency has never turned to Japan for a supercomputer and NCAR has seldom strayed from a Cray -- of which it now has five. So an award of the contract to a Japanese computer maker could establish a beachhead in territory that for three decades has been the unassailable property of American computer makers.
The director of the center, Robert Serafin, said that precedents and trade politics would take a back seat to computing performance as the evaluation proceeded. "We have undertaken the equivalent of an international procurement," said Mr. Serafin, who declined to handicap the contestants. "We're playing it straight as far as the technical and scientific factors are concerned."
The Colorado-based laboratory is preparing to buy a new computer to do advanced global climate modeling into the next century.
The award, which will be made next month or in early May, will come after a yearlong review in which NCAR scientists have put dozens of supercomputers through painstaking performance tests. Because of the political sensitivity of the contract, NCAR has been unusually diligent in its testing procedures, industry experts said.
Cray has long dominated the market for weather-forecasting supercomputers, but its status was shaken last year after the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting in Berkshire, England, bought a $40 million system from Fujitsu. The European market is believed by many industry executives to be less biased by national political issues and a better gauge of pure technical factors.
The supercomputing business of the American national laboratories like NCAR has been the sole province of American companies -- beginning in the mid-1960's with the Control Data Corporation and then Cray Research, and more recently with start-up companies like Thinking Machines and Maspar.
And trade politics has long played a role. In 1987, for example, the United States Government successfully pressed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology not to buy a computer from NEC.
In 1990, Japan and the United States signed a trade agreement declaring that each nation would open its supercomputer market to the other. But even after that, in September 1990, an indication by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory that it might evaluate a Japanese machine drew such criticism from Congress that lab officials backed down.
Since then, the inability of Japanese computer makers to sell even a single supercomputer to a United States research laboratory or university -- despite building many of the world's fastest machines -- has remained a sore point for the Japanese. And they, in turn, have routinely been accused by American corporate executives and Government officials of maintaining their own market restrictions.
Now, the impending NCAR supercomputer award comes as high-technology trade frictions between the United States and Japan are again heating up. Cray Research recently, and quietly, urged the Clinton Administration to put new pressure on the Japanese in the wake of the company's loss of two bids in the Japanese Government market, according to the newsletter Inside U.S. Trade. The publication reported that of 18 contracts for Japanese supercomputers in the last year, only 4 were awarded to United States companies.
"I have to say it feels like it has become tougher to do business in the public institutions in Japan," said Robert Ewald, president and chief operating officer of Cray Research.
But both Mr. Ewald and his Japanese competitors said they saw no evidence that political issues had played a role in the decision-making process at NCAR up to this point.
"We're in the hunt," said Tom Miller, sales and marketing vice president for Fujitsu's American subsidiary. "We feel that if this in fact turns out to be a truly open procurement, it's a tremendous opportunity for us."
Despite trailing in the market for the world's fastest computers, the Japanese have inexorably closed in on the speed advantage of American companies like Cray, I.B.M., and Intel. Today, the world's fastest supercomputer, according to a measuring system maintained by Jack Dongarra at the University of Tennessee, is a supercomputer made by Fujitsu that was installed at the National Aerospace Laboratory in Japan in 1993.
Moreover, 9 of the top 20 spots on Mr. Dongarra's list of the world's 500 fastest computers are now held by either NEC or Fujitsu. Currently, massively parallel supercomputers made by the Intel Corporation occupy the No. 2 and No. 3 positions on the list.
Fujitsu is now the world leader in absolute speed because the company has designed the world's fastest single processor, capable of 2.2 billion mathematical calculations a second.
Measuring computer speed is a tricky proposition, however. Mr. Dongarra's numbers measure pure calculating speed, akin to measuring the performance of a dragster, designed to go down a race-car track in a straight line as quickly as possible. Some computer experts argue that true performance is better measured by a balanced set of factors, more like a Formula One racing car that can also go through turns quickly.
That would mean that despite trailing on pure speed, Cray may still be able to win the contest based on its software and other factors.
"I think that NCAR could safely go with Cray on the basis of the numbers alone," said C. Gordon Bell, a veteran computer designer.

HEADLINE: Haitians at Center of Montreal Election

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, March 24

 BODY:
Gilles Solomcariotte, a 40-year-old textile worker who emigrated from Haiti two years ago, is waiting for a bus on gritty Papineau Street, in a working-class district of northeast Montreal, the site of a fiercely contested election for a seat in the House of Commons.
Among the wooden-frame row houses strewn with "for rent" and "for sale" signs, posters hang from lampposts every few hundred yards to urge support for Pierre S. Pettigrew, the new Minister of International Cooperation. The battle in the Papineau-St. Michel district is the most important of six to be decided on Monday. 
 Mr. Pettigrew, recruited by Prime Minister Jean Chretien as part of a strategy to give his Cabinet greater French-speaking strength, is fighting to represent a district with the largest concentration of Haitians.
While Mr. Solomcariotte paces in the bus shelter, Mr. Pettigrew is in another part of the city as the host of the President of Haiti, Rene Preval. In his first official trip abroad, after stops in the Dominican Republic and the United States, Mr. Preval is making a celebratory visit to Montreal's Haitian population of 60,000. About a fifth of them are in Papineau-St. Michel.
Ever since announcement of the election in January, the welfare of Haiti has assumed an overarching importance in Canadian foreign policy, a fact that has not displeased Mr. Preval, though it has led some of the Ottawa Government's political opponents to cry foul.
Mr. Pettigrew, for instance, has already announced that Canada will spend $3 million on two new aid projects in Haiti. The Chretien Government has also in effect rescued a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti by sending 700 troops there, at a cost of $22 million over the next four months, to support a contingent of 1,200 international troops that is to replace a force led by the United States.
"These are political strategems that we well understand," Mr. Solomcariotte, the textile worker, said in French, eyes brightening, lips breaking into a grin. "The candidate needs votes."
Mr. Solomcariotte said he missed Mr. Preval when he toured the district Saturday afternoon, but would see him Saturday evening when the President was to be guest of honor at a celebration featuring 2,500 supporters, Haitian singers, dancers and comedians in traditional costume.
"For me," the Haitian worker emphasized, "this visit comes at exactly the right time. I am a federalist for Pettigrew."
The Chretien Government says it is a "coincidence" that the visit comes the weekend before the tight electoral contest, in which Mr. Pettigrew, 44, an alumnus of the University of Quebec at Trois Rivieres and Baliol College, Oxford, is being challenged chiefly by Daniel Turp, 42, a University of Montreal constitutional lawyer and political adviser to the Bloc Quebecois.
The Bloc is a grouping of members of Parliament from Quebec who want the province to achieve independence, which almost became a reality upon the separatists' narrow defeat in a referendum on Oct. 30.
A victory for the Bloc would be a serious blow to Mr. Chretien, who is a Quebecer himself but who has fought the separatists throughout his long political career and who is now desperately trying to keep Canada together.
Dismissing suggestions of a plot to sway the election, Mr. Chretien told reporters in Ottawa last week, "If the President decided to come this weekend, we would not tell him to go back home until after the election."
Alain Gagnon, a political scientist at McGill University, is among many who think the Prime Minister may be a little disingenuous.
"Canada and Quebec both want to be associated with improvement in Haiti," he said. "So Mr. Chretien has certainly encouraged Mr. Pettigrew, as minister responsible for international aid, to make this visit now. If we didn't have such a major Haitian community, Canada would be much more discreet and much less forthcoming in its support to Haiti."
Amid all the talk of coincidence, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said wryly, "It's amazing how these things work out."
Mr. Preval, 53, a trained agronomist who once operated a bakery in Port-au-Prince and had been close to the man he replaced, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has voiced annoyance at the suggestions that he is being used in Canada's political games.
"The Canadian Government respects Haitian sovereignty," he said a little testily in Montreal on Saturday, "and I keep myself from mixing in Canadian political affairs."
Papineau-St. Michel has been hard hit by Montreal's lingering recession. Mr. Solomcariotte is far luckier than many of the residents, about a third of whom are jobless or collecting welfare. His wife also works, to make sure his two children stay in school.
"Aristide got some of his education here," he said. "Good schooling is terribly important."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: FOCUS ON JOBS;
House Debate Hits Home on Jobs Program

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Workers and Training

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, March 24

 BODY:
The Job Training Partnership, a Federally financed program to retrain dislocated workers, is widely respected here by Republicans and Democrats, business, labor and educational leaders.
Managers at local companies including the Timken Company, the Detroit Diesel Corporation, Park Farms and Morton Salt, praise the skills of the retrained workers. "Pleased? You bet," says David Smith, a research supervisor at Timken, the largest local employer. Last year he hired four men and women who had been retrained on computer-run milling and lathing machines. "They had been exposed to state-of-the-art machinery," he said. 
 At his inauguration last year, Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, lauded Canton's "Chicken College," another of the job agency's programs, which trained a primarily minority, unemployed group of 18- to 21-year-olds for jobs processing chickens at Park Farms.
Both Ohio Senators, Mike DeWine, a Republican, and John Glenn, a Democrat, were part of a recent bipartisan 84-to-16 Senate vote to maintain current financing levels for job training, a measure supported by the Clinton Administration.
But so far, the more conservative Republican House leadership is not going along. The House leaders want to reduce money for job training by 30 percent, and eliminate some programs altogether, including one that provides 600,000 summer jobs for youth. They have put moderate House Republicans, like Ralph Regula, the local Congressman who has long supported such legislation, in a tight spot.
Mr. Regula is one of three dozen moderate Republican Congressmen being targeted for lobbying by groups like the National Association of Counties and the American Association of Community Colleges, which favor the higher financing level.
"I called his office," said Dr. John McGrath, president of Stark Technical College. The college helps run the computerized machine operator training program here in partnership with the Federal agency. "I know Ralph is a strong proponent of this kind of technical training," Dr. McGrath said. "Ralph Regula helped bring our college into existence, he's the father of our college."
"I did call his office," said Daniel Sciury, president of the Greater Canton A.F.L.-C.I.O. Council. "I have never heard Ralph once ever indicate anything but praise for this program."
But whether that will translate into a vote this time around is another question. Since Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, even 25-year Congressional veterans like Mr. Regula have had to toe the line. For his part, Mr. Regula says he is still making up his mind. "It's not an easy answer, 'Yes the Senate level of funding is better,' or 'Yes the House level,' " he said.
Stark County in northeastern Ohio is a good reflection of the nation when it comes to voting patterns and the economy. While unemployment here is several points below what it was during the last Presidential election, there is still much economic turbulence. Many workers' lives have been touched by downsizing and outsourcing, mergers and acquisitions, and while new jobs can be found here, they often do not pay as well as the jobs that were lost.
The experiences of Chris Suteu, 33, Linda Olinger, 41, and Lee Andrews, 32, all dislocated workers being retrained by the job agency here, are not unusual. All three were longtime workers for Controlled Power Corporation, a locally owned manufacturer of switch gear equipment for transit systems. They made $11 to $15 an hour and said that until 1989 it was a good place to work.
Then, Controlled Power was acquired by a large Chicago company, Henry Crown and Company. The workers say Crown ran the company into the ground and Dan Marchak, a vice president who has been with Controlled Power for 14 years, agrees. "I attribute it to this age of outside acquisitions and mergers in the 1980's," Mr. Marchak said. "They bought a company that they didn't understand."
By 1995, Controlled Power had gone from a high of 410 workers to 150 and was on the verge of closing. Mr. Andrews recalls the engineering department misreading blueprints and having workers build a switching system backward, losing two weeks of work. Ms. Olinger said: "Everything we did, we had to redo to meet quality standards. They had to pay tons of overtime."
In 1995, the original owner James Owens, repurchased Controlled Power. "We had a meeting," Mr. Andrews said, "and Mr. Owens said Crown should have just let everyone stay at home and mail them their checks, they would have lost less money that way." There was no union, and by last fall, many top paid workers were let go, including Mr. Suteu, Ms. Olinger and Mr. Andrews.
The Controlled Power vice president, Mr. Marchak, said that to compete, "we have to get into less skilled, lower wage jobs." (Crown officials did not respond to an interview request.)
After being laid off from his $15-an-hour industrial painting job, Mr. Suteu says he could not find anything for half that wage. He, Ms. Olinger and Mr. Andrews are among 20 dislocated workers now being retrained as computerized machine operators in an eight-hour-a-day, five-day-a-week, five-month program created by the Job Training Partnership.
The idea came from the council of local businesses that advises the Federal agency here. Through the years the council has been headed by managers from the biggest local companies, including Timken, Hoover and Diebold. They have not been able to find enough operators qualified to run computerized lathing and milling machine and so the Job Training agency created the intensive course in cooperation with Stark Technical College, which provides the state-of-the art equipment and classroom space.
More than 100 people have applied for each class. For the first class last year, 20 were enrolled, 18 completed the course and 16 got jobs at an average wage of $8.18 per hour; in the second class, 17 enrolled, 14 completed and 13 were placed at $7.46 an hour on average. "You have to be obsessed to pass this," Ms. Olinger said. "It's demanding -- we started with six weeks of remedial math."
Job Training has created similar programs for garbage and recycling truck drivers (10 of 14 placed in the first class at an $8-an-hour average) and chicken processors (at $7 to $8 an hour) at Park Farms. Workers trained by the jobs agency have a retention rate three times higher at Park Farms than those hired off the street.
In an interview on Thursday, Congressman Regula, who began his working life as a teacher and principal, agreed that the Job Training program for dislocated workers was effective here, but carefully paired any positive comments with cautions. "I think Stark County has done an exceptionally good job," he said, then added, "I'm not sure that is the case of job training everywhere." Asked about the summer job program for youth, he said, "I suspect it's done well in Stark County," then added "but in a lot of cities, it's just buying peace." He said he was "supportive" of the higher budgeting level for job training in the Senate, but added that he agreed with the House leadership's emphasis on balancing the budget and finding offsetting cuts for any "addbacks."
There are some here like Mr. Sciury, the labor leader, who criticize Mr. Regula for "being in lockstep with Newt." They say he and his fellow moderates are being trampled by the freshman Republicans. Last week, after the Senate voted for the extra job training money, several of those freshman Republicans marched into the office of Dick Armey, the majority leader, and demanded that the House hold the spending line.
But there are others who believe that moderates like Mr. Regula, a gentleman farmer who gets elected by large majorities without taking PAC money, whose views are at the heart of Ohio Republicanism, may have something up their sleeves on this one.
That scenario goes like this: The reason the Senate Republicans got so enthusiastic about job training was that their majority leader, Bob Dole, was hurt in the primaries by Patrick J. Buchanan's hammering on worker and job issues and Mr. Dole does not want a repeat of that against President Clinton in the fall. They point out that Mr. Gingrich has promised to defer to Senator Dole to help his bid for the White House. They predict that when the House and Senate versions of the job training bills are hammered out in conference next week, it will be the conservative Republican freshmen who come out squirming, not the moderates.
Mr. Regula hinted as much. "The press has tended to treat the House freshmen as a monolithic group," he said, "but that may get a lot less so as the election gets closer."
"A lot of freshmen," he added, "may discover they have good Job Training Partnerships in their districts."

HEADLINE: Benjamin Franklin Bills Ready to Become Hot Item

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve will release new $100 bills with off-center likenesses of Benjamin Franklin on Monday, and, based on past experience, most of them will soon be abroad.
The bills are technologically advanced to combat increasingly sophisticated counterfeiters, but the United States Treasury Department said it would not immediately replace the existing $100 bills. They will be replaced as they wear out, so it could take several years to replace them all. 
 The new bills will be available only on a limited basis at first, but they will be in wide use by next month at financial capitals around the world. New bills worth about $80 billion have been printed, which represents about one-third of all $100 bills in use.
Currently, the total amount of American currency outstanding is $380 billion, which would be almost $4,000, on average, for every household in the United States. But studies show that Americans hold far less cash than that per household.
Where has the money gone? To countries like Russia, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, where it forms the underpinnings of underground economies.
Some American currency is used abroad for transactions, both legal and illegal. But foreigners also hoard $100 bills because they worry about the value of their local currency.
Almost two-thirds of the currency in circulation here and abroad, measured in terms of value, is in $100 bills. That has not always been the case. Twenty-five years ago, $100 bills represented only one-fifth of the value of all currency, according to Federal Reserve data.
Counterfeiters in the Middle East have turned out exceptionally high-quality $100 bills in recent years, prompting the newly designed bill. The United States Secret Service came across a new, far more sophisticated fake note in Lebanon about six years ago. It was dubbed the Superdollar. About $10 million worth of the counterfeit bills have been confiscated, although officials do not know the extent of the problem.
In the United States, domestic counterfeiting has been made easier and cheaper as a result of new personal computer technology. Because of these counterfeiting successes, there are plans to redesign other bills.
This is the first time since 1929 that the United States has significantly changed the design of its currency. The new $100 bills incorporate a variety of small changes intended to thwart counterfeiters. For that reason, the Treasury Department, citing security concerns, has refused to disclose all of the changes. But it gave one example, saying that the words "United States of America" are printed in tiny letters on Benjamin Franklin's coat.
More American currency held abroad seems to be winding up in more official channels.
In the last year, foreign central banks have increased their holdings of United States Treasury notes by 25 percent, to $524 billion from $414 billion, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This means that foreigners are increasingly exchanging dollars for those nations' local currencies. The American dollars wind up in those countries' central banks, which then use them to buy United States notes, said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, who is completing a book on banking.
Mr. Mayer also said that the Federal Reserve branch in Los Angeles had recently built new vaults to hold all the cash that has been brought back into this country as a result of the Latin American drug trade, which is often transacted with $100 bills.

HEADLINE: CHINA IS OFFERING HIGH-LEVEL TALKS TO TAIWAN LEADER

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 24

 BODY:
In a gesture of conciliation to President Lee Teng-hui after his resounding election victory in Taiwan, China called today for a meeting between Mr. Lee and its own President, Jiang Zemin, and for opening direct air, shipping and mail links across the Taiwan Strait.
"The door is open," said Shen Guofang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. "The obstacles today lie with the Taiwan authorities." 
 In Taipei, Prime Minister Lien Chan responded by saying Taiwan's leaders wanted to explore both a "peace agreement" and a long-term policy of "detente" with China.
Whether the upbeat remarks signaled a turning point in China's struggle with Taiwan, or simply an optimistic rewording of each side's still-divergent positions on Taiwan's future, will only become clear in the coming weeks. Beijing has raised the possibility of a top-level meeting before, though the two sides' leaders have never met.
Yet today's comments appeared to reflect a willingness by leaders in both countries to reduce the chance of military conflict, which has hovered ominously in recent weeks. On a day when each side was watching the other carefully, it suddenly seemed conceivable that Beijing and Taipei could resume the discussions about expanding civilian ties. The talks were suspended nearly a year ago, and new talks seemed impossible just a few days ago.
Beijing has been raining insults on Mr. Lee for weeks, casting his efforts to raise Taiwan's international profile as strivings for independence. It has called him, among other epithets, a two-faced autocrat and a sponsor of organized crime. But today Beijing cut the invective.
Neither Mr. Shen, who was quoted by a Beijing-controlled newspaper in Hong Kong, nor a commentary by the official New China News Agency criticized Mr. Lee. Instead, they tacitly accepted his victory, which was also reported today in several Chinese Government-controlled newspapers.
There was no mention of a third round of the war games that Beijing has recently carried out near Taiwan in an explicit attempt to intimidate its voters and that were scheduled to end on Monday.
Mr. Lee had hinted that after the election he would make a visit that could surprise everyone -- to a world capital. It was not clear if he referred to Beijing, or to Washington, or to somewhere else.
A meeting with Mr. Jiang, should it ever materialize, would mark a greater policy change for Taiwan than for China. Beijing has long encouraged closer official contacts with Taiwan, though few mainlanders are allowed to visit there. Taiwan limits official contacts, but hundreds of thousands of Taiwan's residents visit China each year.
Today's comments by officials of China and Taiwan, while decidedly friendly in tone, offered no substantive change in either side's positions.
Mr. Shen warned pointedly that China would not drop its option of invading Taiwan should the island's authorities move toward greater independence from mainland China, and away from the concept of "one China." Both the Communist and Nationalist Governments hew to that concept, even though they have lived apart as rivals since their civil war ended in 1949 and the Nationalists took refuge on Taiwan.
Whether tensions now ease, Mr. Shen said, will hinge on whether Taiwan's authorities pursue or reject a policy of independence. Beijing will not be satisfied with conciliatory statements, he said, but only with conciliatory acts.
Although he did not request specific actions, Chinese leaders have been infuriated by Mr. Lee's attempts to secure a seat for Taiwan in the United Nations and by his visit to the United States last year. A promise not to do either again would certainly be on China's list.
In Taiwan, Prime Minister Lien, who was Mr. Lee's running mate to become Vice President, did not raise any specific proposals either and took a cautiously optimistic approach toward China's offer.
"On the question of a peace agreement, we are interested in seriously thinking about it," Mr. Lien said in Taipei. "A lot of preparations need to be done for that.
"We should pursue a policy of detente. I am basically optimistic, but I think it will take time."
Mr. Shen renewed a proposal made by President Jiang in 1995 that urged Taiwan to lift its ban on direct trade, air and shipping ties across the Taiwan Strait, as part of China's efforts to increase Taiwan's contact with the mainland.
"We have never had a positive reaction from the Taiwan side," Mr. Shen said.
In the same way that he blamed the recent tension between the mainland and Taiwan squarely on Taipei, Mr. Shen added that the strain in Chinese-American relations was entirely the fault of Washington.
Two American aircraft carriers, dispatched to the western Pacific near Taiwan, have already provoked objections from Chinese officials that they represented meddling in China's internal affairs. The Americans maintain that they are free to move in international waters.
Mr. Shen urged Washington to take a "a more stable, more wise policy" toward China and said its recent actions were interpreted by Taiwan as a sign that the United States supports "separatist" activities on the island.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who returned to Washington late Saturday from Europe, had no immediate reaction to the prospect of improved relations between China and Taiwan. Administration officials said they were watching to see if China carried out additional military exercises near Taiwan.
On Friday, the Administration called off the visit of China's Defense Minister, saying it was "not appropriate in the current climate" between Beijing and Washington. The Clinton Administration has criticized China's human rights record, its sale of nuclear-related technology to Pakistan and the pirating of American movies, software and music, as well as the war games.
But Administration officials said Mr. Christopher still plans to meet with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on April 21 in The Hague.
A New China News Agency report issued late tonight put a positive spin on the election, declaring that the low vote tally for Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party showed that China's efforts to stop the "Taiwan independence movement" had succeeded.
"Almost all Taiwan people now focus their attention on whether the winners of the election will try to develop relations across the Taiwan Strait," the agency said. "Taiwan residents share the view that the only way out for Taiwan is to develop relations across the Taiwan Strait."
The report quoted business people, journalists and academics from Taiwan as saying that Mr. Lee, whom China has accused of changing his mind too often, should "cease to be self-willed or make self-contradictory remarks."
"They maintain that the first thing the newly elected Taiwan leaders must do is to further cross-strait relations," it said.
Mr. Shen said the election would not change China's position that Taiwan is simply part of China and that Taiwan's leader was equivalent to the leader of one of China's 30 provinces.
He added that China's "one country two systems" formula, devised for Hong Kong -- whose capitalist economy China has promised to leave intact after it resumes sovereignty next year -- is appropriate for Taiwan as well.
"It is the most realistic and the most feasible way to realize peaceful reunification," Mr. Shen said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
G.M. has begun telling analysts it can't offset lost production.

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AS the General Motors Corporation struggles to reopen its assembly plants after a 17-day brake-factory strike, the bad news for the company, for its shareholders and for the American economy is that much of the lost weeks of production may never be made up. And that disrupts G.M.'s planning for the third quarter, when it will shut many plants as it prepares to introduce many new models, its most ambitious retooling in years.
G.M. had built up unusually large inventories over the winter, anticipating limited production in the third quarter. But now a large chunk of that inventory is being sold and could be hard to replace. 
 G.M. officials have quietly begun telling Wall Street analysts that they cannot increase production enough during the rest of this year to offset the estimated 240,000 cars and trucks that should have been built over the last three weeks and were not because of the strike, which ended on Friday.
By early Saturday afternoon, a rainbow sea of workers' cars and trucks surrounded the yellow brick walls of the main brake factory in Dayton, Ohio. A steady plume of steam rose from the southern end of the four-block-long building as brake production moved into high gear. G.M. officials said they hoped to reopen all assembly plants by Thursday. But with the exception of a few car plants that build unpopular models, G.M. will have trouble making up for lost production.
"I spoke to the company at length about this on Friday, and they said they'd be lucky to get 50 percent of it back," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Brothers. Mr. Kirnan estimated that G.M.'s first-quarter profits after taxes would be $850 million lower than previously expected.
That would reduce earnings per share by $1.15, leaving G.M. with only 90 cents to $1 a share in profits for the quarter, Mr. Kirnan said. Only 40 percent of the loss can be made up in later quarters this year, he predicted. Nonetheless, he is maintaining a "strong hold" rating on the stock so long as the American economy remains strong.
Some auto industry experts are gloomier. Scott F. Merlis, an independent analyst in Westport, Conn., predicted that the G.M. would be unable to recoup any of its losses in later quarters. He put those losses slightly lower than Mr. Kirnan, estimating that after-tax earnings would be $780 million lower in the first quarter because of the strike, or $1.04 per share. The pretax loss to G.M. is around $1.2 billion, he said.
Should G.M. not catch up on lost production, it would be bad news for the American economy. Economists estimate that the strike trimmed $5 billion to $7 billion from economic output in the first quarter, shaving three-tenths of 1 percent from the annualized growth rate in gross domestic product. But economists have been uncertain how much of the lost output would be recovered in the second quarter through extra production at G.M.
G.M. officials may be talking to auto analysts, but they have been much less willing to commit themselves in public to figures on their plans to recoup lost production. Tom Klipstine, a company spokesman, said yesterday that the company's first signal of those plans was likely to come on April 1, when G.M. plans to release its production schedule for the month.
G.M.'s pessimism with the analysts about recovering lost production is the latest indication that the strike hurt the world's largest auto maker financially. What remains unclear is whether G.M. will recoup these losses in national negotiations this summer with the United Automobile Workers, which was also bloodied by the strike. The brake-plant strike might also benefit G.M. if it discourages the U.A.W. from calling other local strikes before the national negotiations
Shares in G.M. held up fairly well during the strike. The stock closed at $52.25 on March 4, the day before the strike began, and closed at $53.375 on Friday, up $1.125 for the length of the strike.
Mr. Kirnan said the apparently improving American economy helped the stock, because the auto industry is strongly cyclical and produces large profits during times of prosperity. Investors have also applauded the auto maker's willingness to stand up to the U.A.W. and the workers in Dayton, who earn an average of $69,000 a year by putting in six- and seven-day weeks.
The strike in Dayton ended with a compromise that made no changes in G.M.'s overall ability to farm out the production of auto parts to nonunion companies. But the company agreed to hire at least 417 workers, most of them over the next two years and slightly more than the number of workers expected to retire or leave the factory for various reasons over that period.
Union locals at assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Janesville, Wis., and Oklahoma City have been preparing for strikes, auto industry experts said. The clearest signal of whether the U.A.W. has been frightened by G.M.'s tough stance in Dayton will be whether strikes flare elsewhere in the next several months.
While the U.A.W. has not released any precise figures, the Dayton strike appears to have cost it about $1.2 million in strike benefits for 3,000 workers there. But if the strike had gone on much longer, it could have cost the union as much as $36 million a week.
The reason for the potentially higher cost is that G.M. had taken legal steps to block unemployment benefits for U.A.W. workers laid off elsewhere because of the strike in Dayton. In the days before the strike was settled, G.M.'s action put tremendous pressure on the U.A.W. to begin paying strike benefits to more than 100,000 laid-off union members. While union members are supposed to refund these strike benefits if they eventually receive unemployment benefits, many union workers have not done so in the past.
An unsuccessful strike last year against Caterpillar Inc. has depleted the union's strike fund, which now has no more than $700 million, union officials say. Whether that will affect U.A.W. strategy remains a key question for G.M. and its shareholders.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: FACING THE ECONOMY;
Recycled Ideas Echo Forbes and Buchanan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Steve Forbes might be out of the race and Patrick J. Buchanan relegated to the sidelines, but some of their economic ideas, reformulated or toned down, live on in the campaigns of Senator Bob Dole and President Clinton.
Just last week in Wisconsin, Mr. Dole volunteered that "Steve Forbes had a good idea" when he proposed the 17 percent flat tax, a plan the Senate majority leader was bashing a month ago for its failure to preserve deductions for home mortgages, charitable contributions and state and local income taxes. 
 And President Clinton has lately refined his economic pitch to reflect some of the anxieties tapped into by Mr. Buchanan, including calls for corporate responsibility and tougher enforcement of trade agreements.
Some of Mr. Buchanan's and Mr. Forbes's more improbable ideas are dying a quick death. No one is repeating Mr. Buchanan's calls for big tariffs on Asian imports or for a huge wall to keep out Mexicans. But to listen to the talk out of Dole and Clinton headquarters about flat taxes, trade and economic growth is to hear familiar echoes.
Mr. Dole is now talking about a flat tax, something his aides hint he would have announced sooner if Mr. Forbes had not grabbed the issue first. No one in Mr. Dole's camp wanted to get too specific because keeping popular deductions would mean a tax rate far above the 17 percent that Mr. Forbes proposed.
"You're not likely to be hearing any numbers," warned one Dole adviser, who insisted on anonymity.
And when Mr. Dole mentions Mr. Buchanan these days, he usually acknowledges Mr. Buchanan's diagnosis of economic ills, even while stepping around his protectionist solutions. "Pat Buchanan has touched a nerve when it comes to people concerned about their jobs," Mr. Dole said recently, changing the subject before saying what to do about those concerns. His aides are trying to figure out how they might hit the same nerve themselves, without rejecting the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, two free-trade accords Mr. Dole backed.
The Dole camp, acknowledging that their candidate was something less than a font of original economic thinking during the primaries, is unapologetic about borrowing liberally from former rivals. "If we are skillful about it," said Vin Weber, the co-chairman of Mr. Dole's campaign, "some of the economic growth message of Forbes becomes the essence of the appeal to the distressed workers who went to Buchanan. But the fact is that we are just at the beginning of developing a package that addresses the concerns of those 'at risk' working families."
Of course, Mr. Clinton is angling for those same voters. He has begun sampling a campaign-speech brew that is one part economic growth, one part tax breaks for the middle class, and -- as the Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg called it recently -- one part "aggressive free trade, which sells very differently than just free trade."
The growth part of Mr. Clinton's agenda is hardly new, but it closely parallels Mr. Forbes's insistence that the American economy can grow far faster than a crawl-along 2.3 percent a year that the White House and Congress forecast as an average for the next seven years.
A month ago, as Mr. Forbes's campaign was peaking, Mr. Clinton used the renomination of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve to question whether the traditional assumptions about how fast the economy can grow are too conservative. "There are a lot of people," he said, "including Republican executives in the manufacturing sector," who believe that far higher growth rates are possible without inflation.
One Cabinet member noted recently that Mr. Forbes "showed that you can go a long way with an optimistic economic message, and it plays right into our pitch about how the economy has created 8.4 million jobs since we came to office, and how we now lead the world in key industries."
The argument inside the White House, however, has focused on how much to temper that optimism with an acknowledgment that the growth has been very uneven, widening the divide between the rich and the middle class. So without dwelling on the growing division, Mr. Clinton is using events like the release of the 1997 Federal budget last week to portray himself anew as the advocate of the middle class, pressing for a $500 tax deduction for every child under the age of 13 and a $10,000 deduction for college tuition.
The political key, White House officials said, is the education deduction, which has strong support in the polls and allows Mr. Clinton to make the case that the Government should help America invest in future workers just as it currently helps companies buy new factory equipment.
But the biggest challenge for the Administration, which pushed through Nafta and gave birth to the World Trade Organization, is to make the case that foreign trade benefits American workers. While the Buchanan campaign has exploited the widespread perception that the United States has been played for a sucker by many of its trading partners, Mr. Clinton is openly putting a foot in both camps, talking about "trade that is both free and fair."
The phrase is the work of Mr. Clinton's former campaign chief, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. Mr. Kantor says free trade sells only if trading partners are visibly pushed into opening markets. After three years of facing off against Japan, he is going after Mexico, Canada and China.
"If you hear the debate you would think there are only two choices," Mr. Clinton said in New Orleans last week: wall America off from countries "that pay people wages we couldn't live on," or naively press ahead with "pure open trade in which our markets are open to others, and we hope that they'll open their markets to us."
Instead, he is talking weekly now about "truly open, two-way trade," code words for the argument that the United States should keep its markets open only to trading partners who reciprocate. That seems partly intended to head off Mr. Dole, who has argued that the United States has all the right trade agreements, it just needs to enforce them. But Mr. Dole himself, notes Robert B. Zoellick, the former Under Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, "has been a free-trader all of his life, and there is a lot of risk if he tries to run away from his record."
Mr. Kantor is going to extraordinary lengths to inoculate Mr. Clinton against complaints that the Administration has, in Mr. Buchanan's oft-repeated phrase, "sacrificed American workers on the altar of free trade."
In early January, the Administration outraged Mexico by declining to open the border, despite the trade agreement, to increased Mexican trucking. The Administration cited safety problems and drug smuggling aboard the trucks, but clearly there was also some concern about the image of the border being thrown open in the vital states of Texas and California. Mr. Kantor is also challenging Canada over trade restrictions and is battling a World Trade Organization ruling that would require changes in the Clean Air Act.
"You only build a constituency for free trade if you show you will stand up at every chance for American workers," Mr. Kantor said recently. "So that's what we're going to do."

HEADLINE: Proposed Cuts to College Aid Protested as Hardship for Poor Students

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The poor college student is romanticized in popular culture as a young person leading a sort of bohemian life style: wearing vintage clothing and living off campus, waiting tables or selling books between classes, struggling to remain in school and, eventually, reach the middle class.
But in reality, at the City University of New York, many poor college students are older, shouldering the responsibilities of a job and family as well as homework and grades. They are often laid-off workers or welfare parents studying to find a good job, also struggling to remain in school and, eventually, reach the middle class. 
 Take Linda C. Carberry, a nursing student at the College of Staten Island, who works as a building superintendent in Brooklyn so she and her two daughters will not need to pay rent. Or Leonard Zeiger, an English major at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, who already owes almost $10,000 in student loans and rotates his credit cards to buy food and other necessities. Or Juan Gonzalez Hernandez, a student in human services at La Guardia Community College who sometimes begs for money to pay his train fare to Queens from Red Hook, Brooklyn.
These students and thousands more are struggling even though they receive financial aid. But college aid may be cut sharply under a proposal by Gov. George E. Pataki.
About 90,000 students in the City and State University of New York systems receive money from the state's Tuition Assistance Program to cover tuition, as well as money from the Federal Government called Pell grants, which are distributed based on need and intended to be used for college-related expenses.
Under the Governor's proposal, half of the Federal aid a student received would instead be applied to tuition, and the state would provide the difference. So students at CUNY would still receive enough aid to cover the tuition of $3,200 a year at four-year colleges, $2,500 at community colleges. But the Federal money available for extra costs including fees, books and transportation would be reduced by half.
The state would give SUNY and CUNY $10 million each to use as they choose to help students facing cuts in aid, but that would clearly not match the $51 million they estimate students would lose under the proposal.
Students and college administrators are lobbying state legislators to ease the proposed cuts. The heads of the higher education committees in both the Assembly and the Senate have said they want to restore at least some of the money cut from the Tuition Assistance Program.
But given the uncertainty surrounding the state budget this year, some college administrators are worried that even if the money is restored, it will not come in time to help students and their families. Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds of the City University and Chancellor Thomas A. Bartlett of the State University have sent a joint letter to legislative leaders asking them to make a commitment to TAP.
"If the state budget is not adopted by April 1," the letter read, "we strongly urge that an agreement be reached and announced as soon as possible on TAP restorations so that potential applicants can be informed and plan accordingly for college."
The Governor's proposed cuts are part of a larger effort by his administration to streamline government and lower taxes to encourage economic growth in the state. Administration officials have said New York will still have the most generous financial aid program in the country.
But the proposed cuts are toughest on the state's poorest students, since those who qualify for more Federal money will have more to cut. They will affect students at SUNY and CUNY, young people trying to improve their lot through education, or older people who have lost jobs and are looking for education and re-training.
Many of those poor students attend the City University of New York, where half the 200,000 students come from households with income under $22,000. About one-tenth receive some form of welfare. Two-thirds work at least part time. CUNY officials estimate that the proposed cuts in state aid will affect 57,800 of their students, who will lose $654 to $1,029 a year.
For many students, the cuts will mean following one of three options: borrowing more money, taking on new jobs and going to school part time, or dropping out altogether. "I can't live the way I live anymore," Ms. Carberry said. "I want my kids to get a good education, and I can't give it to them unless I finish school."
Members of the Pataki administration say they do not believe students will drop out if the cuts are made, because tuition will still be covered. Students can manage other expenses that Federal money has covered by budgeting their money better, the officials say. "I know I used to buy used books or borrow books from a friend of mine versus buying new books," one official said.
Ms. Carberry's budget is too tight to stretch much further. As a superintendent living rent free in her building in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, she scrubs hallways and answers complaints. She and her daughters, Kate, 15, and Tara, 12, also get food stamps.
Ms. Carberry, 42, is enrolled in the selective nursing program at the College of Staten Island and does not have time to take another job. She is about halfway through the program and hopes to take her nursing exams in another year.
Ms. Carberry pays for college with TAP and Pell money and has about $600 left over each semester for other expenses. Books cost about $100 each semester. Transportation on the three buses it takes to get to school costs $9 a day. She usually takes a sandwich from home but buys a soda.
She views college as a way to find a job and stop depending on food stamps. "Most of the people in my program and other programs are striving for something," she said. "They don't feel like they're taking something because they're going to be giving back. If I didn't go to school, I'd still be poor and getting assistance."
Juan Gonzalez Hernandez also hopes college will launch him out of Red Hook. Sometimes he has to stand on a corner in his neighborhood, asking for train fare to get to La Guardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens.
TAP and Pell pay Mr. Hernandez's tuition and leave about $250 a semester to buy books, pay for transportation, buy food and cover other expenses. He also works part time for a recycling program on campus.
He is loud in his anger at the proposed cuts and helped to organize a recent protest march with a university-wide group called Student Liberation Action Movement, or SLAM! "Students at CUNY are not educated about what's being done to them," he said. "If they were, we would have already had a riot."
Mr. Hernandez grew up in the Red Hook projects, dropped out of John Jay High School and was in and out of jail. But he finished high school in a special program and enrolled at La Guardia three years ago.
"I'm one of those numbers that wasn't supposed to make it," he said. "I am the first generation to ever go to college in my family. And if it wasn't for financial aid, I wouldn't be in school at all."
Mr. Hernandez is trying to avoid going into debt so he does not take out student loans. He is already applying for grants and scholarships in case his financial aid is cut.
Leonard Zeiger, on the other hand, relies heavily on debt, not only student loans but also credit cards, to finance his education at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn.
Mr. Zeiger has lived on his own since he was 18. Now, at 23, he hopes to transfer next year to a four-year college so he can become an English teacher. He maintains a 4.0 average and runs one of the student councils on campus.
More than $200 of the $900 he receives each year from Pell goes to supplement his tuition assistance. The room he rents in the shadow of the Cyclone in Coney Island, Brooklyn, costs $200 a month. Transportation to and from the campus in Manhattan Beach costs $3 a day, four days a week during the 12-week semester.
A separate $250 from the College Discovery/SEEK program pays for Mr. Zeiger's books each semester. If that is not enough, he uses more Pell money to pay the book bill.
Mr. Zeiger works as much as he can, during a two-month winter break and summer vacation. In a good year, he makes $3,000. And this year he has taken out a $3,500 loan, bringing his total student-loan debt close to $10,000.
But none of that is enough. "I start the semester with a healthy bank account and by the end I usually owe money on my credit cards," he said. "Honestly, if it wasn't for this wonderful benefit of credit cards, I wouldn't be surviving."

A Crisis for Smaller Cities
A fiscal crisis, like the one that racked New York City in the 1970's, has gripped the state's smaller cities. With alarming frequency, cities like Utica, Rome, Schenectady and Niagara Falls have found themselves staggering under the crush of budget deficits. The crisis, simply, reflects the fact that the cost of providing municipal services has risen as rapidly as revenue from taxes and state and Federal aid has fallen. More broadly, it reflects the gnawing decline of the state's urban cores. And that, say the cities' advocates, threatens to erode the state's economic viability. [Page A1.]
Seeking a Share of the Riches
 Days after Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield received New York State approval to establish a for-profit subsidiary, legislative and consumer watchdog groups raised the question of a lucrative public payoff as part of the package. [A1.]
Cardinal Opposes Execution
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, voiced his deep personal opposition to capital punishment, warning that it has tended to single out certain groups and offers a deceptively simple approach to wider problems. Although the Cardinal has spoken out against capital punishment before, the timing and audience of his sermon gave his remarks a special resonance. The homily was delivered before hundreds of police officers who attended a special annual Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. [B1.]
Battle Brews Over a Park
With the exception of a patch of struggling grass, little is blossoming at Hunters Point Community Park in Long Island City. The park is a virtual wonderland of concrete. Although the park has won awards -- from the Concrete Industry Board and the American Institute of Architects -- neighbors say the park satisfies everybody but the people who are supposed to use it.

Bratton's Job Hunt Is Official
Mayor Giuliani said that William J. Bratton will step down as New York City's Police Commissioner as soon as he finds the right job. Responding to months of speculation about Mr. Bratton's future in the administration, the Mayor said that Mr. Bratton has advised him that he plans to leave. [B1.]
Burglar Assaults a Priest
A burglar burst into a Franciscan monastery in Brooklyn and, when he found nothing to steal, he smashed stained-glass windows, hurled lamps, desks and picture frames and beat a 76-year-old priest bloody before fleeing empty-handed. What the burglar had found was not a church wealthy in gold, silver or ready cash, but a place rich in art, culture and history, the heart of what was once Brooklyn's thriving Lithuanian refugee population. [B3.]
Finally, the Warmth of the Sun
Yesterday was a day that finally felt like spring: sunny, comfortable, inviting. Only a meteorological curmudgeon would have realized that it was not the warmest day of the year. Does anyone remember that the temperature climbed past 50 four times in January, nine times in February and seven times this month? Yesterday was a day when spring was more than just a far-off promise. [B3.]
Lobbying for Tuition Assistance
At the City University of New York, many poor college students are struggling even though they receive financial aid. They are older students who are shouldering the responsibilities of a job and family as well as homework and grades. But college aid may be cut sharply under a proposal by Governor Pataki.

Two teen-agers were killed and a third was critically wounded when an argument between two men in a Bronx apartment building erupted in gunfire, the police said. Neighbors said the graffiti-strewn building in the Bedford Park section had long been known as a crack house, but neighbors and relatives of the victims also said that they were not known as drug dealers or criminals, and said that the youths did not spend time in the building.

Chile Says Its Spraying Has Suppressed Medfly

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
Chile has declared victory over the Mediterranean fruit fly in a persistent, 30-year battle that included such tough tactics as spraying pesticides over heavily populated areas and confiscating all organic material entering the country.
The Agriculture Ministry said its latest round of inspections at the end of 1995 showed that all regions of Chile except one in the extreme north were free of the Medfly, one of the world's most dreaded agricultural pests, which lays eggs in fruit and vegetables and causes them to rot. 
 Chilean agricultural officials said that eradication of the Medfly would allow the country to start exporting apples, grapes, avocados, kiwis and other fruit to Asian markets where it is currently banned or subject to strict fumigation and quarantines.
With the pestilence eliminated, the officials estimated that Chile's agricultural exports, currently worth $1 billion annually, could increase by $500 million a year by the end of the decade.
"By freeing ourselves of this plague, our country has overcome a major barrier to our fruit exports," Agriculture Minister Emiliano Ortega told local news organizations. "We've opened up China to our apples and kiwis."
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's field office in Santiago verified Chile's victory, saying that the country "had done an excellent job" in combating the Medfly and was "in good shape" to start exporting fruits and vegetables to countries free of the pest, notably Japan and South Korea.
However, several agricultural experts cautioned that the pest was known to reappear after months of absence and said that to maintain control, Chile must continue its strict campaign of eradication or face a new outbreak.
Chile's victory over the Medfly contrasts with the situation in California. Faced with threats of quarantines from several Asian countries, the state is still struggling to control the pest after a 20-year campaign that has cost upward of $300 million.
California state officials and growers said the main reason the Medfly thrived in their state was the arrival of infected fruit and vegetables, typically in the luggage of travelers.
State agriculture officials regularly confiscate fruit from passengers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport, but their random inspection system is lax next to Chile's.
James R. Carey, an entomology professor at the University of California at Davis, said that California could not eradicate the Medfly because of public opposition to aerial spraying of malathion and other insecticides and the size and complexity of the California landscape.
"California is just a hog heaven for Medflies," Mr. Carey said. "Los Angeles is a mosaic of 2,500 backyards per square mile with lots of fruit trees that Medflies come into contact with at different times of the year." The professor said he doubted that Chile had completely eradicated the Medfly but that Chile had made more progress than California because it had not informed its people about the use of insecticides.
Indeed, while Chilean environmental groups have criticized aerial spraying of pesticides over heavily populated areas as a potential health threat, the Government has largely ignored their complaints and continued such fumigations, saying they are necessary to control the Medfly.
"These emergency fumigations are not justified because the health of the people should come first and the economy second," said Maria Isabel Manzur, an investigator for the National Committee for the Defense of Flora and Fauna, a well-known environmental organization. "These sprayings violate human rights because they are fumigating people."
Further, Chile is perhaps the only country in the world where the baggage of every arriving airline passenger is checked for organic material that could contain insects, parasites or viruses harmful to the country's agricultural industry. Chile seizes more than 1,300 pounds of organic material at its airports each week, including all leftover food from arriving aircraft.
In its $50 million battle against the Medfly, Chile has used border controls and introduced sterile fruit flies. Chile has also conducted an educational campaign, distributing handouts and posters asking Chileans not to bring fruit into the country from abroad and to report any sign of the pest.
Leopoldo Sanchez Grunert, national director for the Agricultural Ministry's livestock and agricultural service, said that the Chilean public had been very responsive to the campaign and provided information on the spread of the fly.
"I think the public realized just how important it was to Chile to eradicate this pest," Mr. Sanchez said. "Everyone stands to benefit from this success."
Agriculture is vital to Chile's $44 billion economy, employing 400,000 of the country's 13 million people. More than 200 agricultural products can serve as host for the Medfly, including oranges, grapefruit, avocados, strawberries, peaches, plums, nectarines, table and wine grapes and dates.
In its battle against the Medfly, Chile benefited greatly from its geographic isolation. Chile's borders are framed by the Pacific Ocean, the Andean Mountain region, a vast desert, and the South Pole, making it difficult for the Medfly to proliferate.
While the Medfly first appeared in South America in 1901, it did not reach Chile until 1962, where it was detected in the northern border city of Arica. The fly spread as far south to the capital Santiago within three years and threatened to contaminate all of Chile's fruit crop.
But agricultural officials undertook what was perhaps the most determined of all fumigations: they sprayed the entire city of Santiago.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Surge 6.5% In Rush to Beat Rising Rates

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Fears of rising mortgage rates spurred a surprising increase in sales of existing homes last month despite severe winter weather, the National Association of Realtors said today.
Sales of existing homes climbed 6.5 percent, to an annual rate of 3.96 million, seasonally adjusted. That followed a revised January decline of 3.9 percent. 
 February was the first monthly rise since October.
The rebound not only was contrary to expectations but also demonstrated the resilience of the housing sector, which recorded stronger rates of home building as well as sales last month.
But analysts cautioned that the industry was unlikely to keep February's pace for long because of rising inventories of new and used homes on the market and costlier mortgages.
"Higher mortgage rates to some degree may spur people to buy now in anticipation of rates being even higher," said Paul Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. But "we may have seen the last of the positive effects of lower mortgage rates," he added. "A lot of people will be priced out of the market."
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said average rates for a 30-year mortgage rose to 7.08 percent in February from 7.03 percent in January. That was still below the rate in February 1995, when 30-year loans averaged 8.77 percent.
More homes were sold in every region of the country in February than was the case in January, when a blizzard lashed the East Coast and much of the country suffered bitter cold.
Art Godi, president of the realtors association, said February's relatively brisk sales pace -- the strongest since a four-million-a-year rate in November last year -- was a "pleasant surprise."
Sales of existing homes in February were a strong 12.5 percent above the rate a year earlier, when they were running at 3.52 million a year.
Regionally, the strongest rise in business was in the West -- including California -- where sales increased 11 percent during February to an annual rate of 910,000. In the South, the country's largest sales region, sales rose 9.4 percent, to 1.51 million a year.
There were smaller monthly gains during February of 3.6 percent in the Northeast to 580,000 a year and in the Midwest, a 1.1 percent rise from January to 960,000 a year.
While sales were up, the median sales price for used homes fell in February to $113,900 from $114,800. The median represents a midway point, with half the homes selling above that price and half selling below it.

HEADLINE: Agua Prieta Journal;
Border Patrol vs. 'Illegals': Now, the Desert War

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: AGUA PRIETA, Mexico, March 21

 BODY:
Raul Gutierrez had put in much of a day's work by the time he sat down for lunch in the Yolanda Cafe near the international border station here, so he ordered a T-bone steak.
And since his mother was not around, Raul, who is 14, seized the steak in his hands and gnawed the meat right off the bone. Then he wiped his fingers with a tortilla, peeled a $20 bill from a wad of cash to pay the bill and rode his bike back to work along the tattered cyclone fence dividing Agua Prieta from Douglas, Ariz. 
 Thousands of Mexicans hoping to enter the United States are streaming into this watering hole in the Sonoran desert every week, jamming hotels and sidewalks, and Raul is cashing in on his knowledge of the local topography by leading groups through the fence and along back alleys and drainage ditches 10 blocks north into downtown Douglas. At $20 a head, he earned $280 before lunch on this day, but business has been so lucrative recently that he found this take disappointing.
"I had five more clients, but another boy took them away," Raul said.
Raul works in a cottage industry that has blossomed here in recent months as United States crackdowns south of San Diego and El Paso have made Agua Prieta one of the most popular crossing points for illegal immigrants to the United States.
So many migrants poured across here in January and February that the Border Patrol detained nearly 35,000 people, more than six times as many as in the same period last year. Along the whole border from Texas to California, 146,000 illegal crossers were detained during January and February, up by 24 percent from 1995.
No one can say for sure that the increase in detentions reflects more than the recent addition of hundreds of new Border Patrol agents. But many demographers believe that Mexico's economic crisis, combined with strong American job growth, is persuading more Mexicans to travel illegally into the United States.
Robert Bach, director of policy research at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, sees the thousands of Mexicans streaming into Agua Prieta as a triumph for Washington's get-tough policies. "We're restructuring the flow, squeezing people into Arizona, and that's favorable terrain for us," Mr. Bach said. The difficulty of crossing the Arizona desert has forced most migrants to hire smugglers to get across, driving up costs and discouraging others from making the trip, he said.
Douglas Massey, a University of Pennsylvania demographer, said there was no evidence yet that the northward flow had slowed. "But if the I.N.S. puts enough resources into it, maybe they can raise the probability of apprehension high enough to persuade people not to try," he said.
And so Agua Prieta is the new immigration battleground. Time was when the only news here was when a pack of wild dogs would move into town and start howling. And the Border Patrol used to be a sleepy outfit. When George Lopez, second in command of the local border station, was first assigned to Douglas about 15 years ago, there were just two agents.
Today Mr. Lopez commands 127 officers equipped with ground sensors, tower-mounted cameras, night-vision scopes and helicopters, but the Douglas station still seems overwhelmed at times. At least a dozen smuggling organizations are operating here, and many migrants are detouring hundreds of miles to cross at Agua Prieta, Mr. Lopez said.
Thirteen young men from Baja California, for instance, who had crossed illegally for several years at Tijuana on their way to jobs in Naperville, Ill., crossed through Agua Prieta this week. One of the men, Gerardo Cordero, a 28-year-old dishwasher who returned to Mexico to see his family at Christmas, said the group hired a smuggler after a woman at the Agua Prieta bus terminal offered them a package deal: the migrants would be spirited north into Douglas, ferried to Phoenix, and driven on to Chicago in the back of a rental van. The price, Mr. Cordero said, was $800 a head.
The group's first crossing attempt ended in frustration last week, when Border Patrol agents chased them into a cul-de-sac near the Douglas airport, detaining and expelling all 13 back to Mexico.
But two days later, the 13 were assigned a new guide: Raul Gutierrez. His mission, he said, was to get them to the McClain's Hotel in Douglas, a popular migrant way station, where a van would be waiting for them. Because he is a minor, Raul does not worry about criminal prosecution, though he said he had been detained many times in Douglas. Once, he said, a Border Patrol agent got one handcuff on him before he broke free and sprinted back to Mexico.
"I paid a Mexican policeman 20 pesos to unlock the cuff," Raul said.
The sun was setting, and at the Hotel Yolanda two blocks south of the border, Raul's 13 clients were stuffing their belongings into plastic bags and pulling on sweat shirts and high-top sneakers. Minutes later, they were at the fence along the border, where Raul was staring at a Border Patrol jeep moving along a line of warehouses on the United States side. Raul positioned the 13 men near a hole in the fence underneath a tower supporting one of the Border Patrol's powerful video cameras, making surveillance difficult.
"Let's go!" he said, and the men ducked through the fence and raced north past the warehouses. Minutes later, however, they came huffing back, scooting through the fence just as a Border Patrol van roared into a defensive position opposite them.
"I told you to stay together," Raul yelled at the men, most of whom were twice his age. "Now keep down and wait." Minutes passed, an I.N.S. helicopter clattered overhead, peering downward with a searchlight, and the Border Patrol van eventually moved off.
Then Raul ordered a new advance. The migrants and their teen-age guide sprinted past a line of buildings and disappeared into the cool desert air.

HEADLINE: Problems Schools Can't Solve

BYLINE: By Stephen O'Connor; Stephen O'Connor is the author of the forthcoming "Will My Name Be Shouted Out? Reaching Inner City Children Through the Power of Writing."

 BODY:
One of my students wrote a short story in which he recounted how he watched as his father was shot and killed inside their apartment building. Another student was neglected so badly that at age 7 she lost all her hair from malnutrition; at 14, she still had to wear diapers to school. Yet another student was walking to the grocery store with her best friend when gang members started firing at one another; her best friend was killed. And just the other day, a 9-year-old boy in one of my classes wrote:
"I am afraid I might die before I'm 11 . . .
 I hate myself because I'm dumb. 
 I like guns because I'm bad and ugly as the guns."
I have taught creative writing for eight years in New York City and San Francisco public schools, and these are only a few of the scores of stories that I could tell about my students. The stories are especially horrifying because they are so common.
Virtually every teacher in the United States can tell similar tales about abused children who come to school too depressed or angry to learn, who disrupt lessons, get into fights with classmates or simply spend their days with their heads on their desks.
President Clinton, several business leaders and most of our nation's governors are meeting today and tomorrow for the Second National Education Summit, in Palisades, N.Y. But social problems are not on their agenda; higher curriculum standards and technology are.
For the past decade and a half, our leaders have primarily chosen to treat the education crisis as if it was a simple matter of inadequate standards and mind-numbing bureaucracy.
This is safe politics. Nobody can deny that less red tape and more stringent and precise standards would help students and teachers alike, and perhaps have the additional benefit of saving money. What is wrong with such initiatives is that they completely fail to address the most severe problems in our schools.
The single factor that most frustrates any teacher in reaching his or her goals is the relentless intrusion of social problems into the classroom. Teachers, no matter how talented or dedicated, cannot combat poverty, broken or single parent families, violence, AIDS, homelessness, child abuse and racism.
The public schools offer perhaps the clearest picture of our nation's economic and social health. President Clinton and other leaders are often heard worrying about the poor performance of American students, especially compared to students in other industrialized countries. But they must remember that this poor performance is and always has been partly a symptom of our neglect of the many social crises that afflict our nation.
No amount of tinkering with curriculum will enable schools to combat these problems on their own. Unless our leaders develop the resolve to deal realistically with them, American students -- and American business -- will continue to lose ground to foreign competition. Higher standards and a computer in every classroom are important, but they won't begin to address the crisis in our schools or our nation.

HEADLINE: Seeking Indigent-Care Plan, Hospitals Send Trenton Bill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 25

 BODY:
Seeking to put pressure on the state to come up with a plan to pay for hospital care for the poor, the heads of several New Jersey hospitals today left a $96 million bill on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's desk and vowed to begin doing business with only those companies providing health insurance for their employees.
Since Jan. 1, Governor Whitman and the State Legislature have been unable to agree on a new financing plan to repay 84 acute-care hospitals for the estimated $384 million in charity care that they provide each year. 
 The state has missed two payments since the beginning of the year, and some hospital officials say they have been forced to delay payments to vendors and draw up contingency plans that include laying off hospital workers and closing wards.
"I know of no requirement that restaurants are required to feed the hungry," said Sister Jane Frances Brady, the president of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson. "I know of no requirement that Macy's is required to clothe the naked or that builders build housing. But the hospitals are required to provide any kind of care to all comers, and we feel that it is an impossible situation."
At the urging of the New Jersey Hospital Association, which represents most of the state's private hospitals, Sister Brady and other hospital presidents said they would begin to review contracts with their vendors and seek to do business only with companies providing health insurance for their employees.
Dr. Jonathan M. Metsch, the president of the Jersey City Medical Center, said he had asked hospital lawyers to help determine what contracts could be terminated with vendors who do not offer health insurance.
To put more pressure on Governor Whitman and lawmakers to find a solution, the hospital association said it would file a lawsuit within 30 days if the $96 million bill -- which includes the cost of charity care through March 31 and interest -- remained unpaid. "The state requires hospitals by law to provide a service, and they haven't paid for it," said Gary Carter, the president of the hospital association.
Becky Taylor, a spokesman for Governor Whitman, said the Governor's proposals have been unable to win legislative approval. "We are unable to do it unilaterally," she said.
The State Legislature has rejected numerous proposals, including increasing the cigarette tax and taking money from the state's unemployment insurance fund. Both organized labor and businesses object to continuing to take money out of the fund. The state has used $1.6 billion from the fund to pay for charity care for the last three years and promised to find alternatives. Robert A. DeSando, a spokesman for Jack Collins, Speaker of the Assembly, said lawmakers were working on a plan that would be able to win approval in both houses and the Governor's signature. The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices to Review Effort to Make English Official Language

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Turning the constitutional spotlight on the growing number of state laws declaring English to be the official language, the Supreme Court today agreed to review an Arizona effort to require public employees to conduct government business only in English.
At the same time, the Court indicated doubt about whether it would actually rule on the merits of the case, in which two lower Federal courts found that the English-only amendment to Arizona's Constitution violated the First Amendment right of public employees to speak the language of their choice. 
 The state itself is not defending the amendment, which was narrowly adopted in a voter referendum in 1988. Since the Federal District Court in Phoenix struck down the amendment in 1990, the case has been carried forward by the private group that sponsored the referendum, Arizonans for Official English. Rose Mofford, Arizona's Governor at the time, opposed the amendment and refused to appeal the district court's ruling. In accepting the appeal today, the Justices asked for briefs on the question of whether the private group had standing to defend the law.
The Court's unusual order raised the prospect that a case that had been seen as an important test case for the English-only movement might instead produce a ruling on the ability of private citizens' groups to appear in court to defend laws that state officials choose not to defend.
With state ballots showing voter initiatives on subjects from gay rights to lawyers' fees to affirmative action, the question of who has standing to defend the measures if they become law is significant in itself.
Twenty-one states have recently acted to make English the official language, with most provisions being essentially symbolic. Arizona's constitutional amendment, which was approved by 50.5 percent of the voters, is one of the more sweeping, and it was challenged shortly after adoption by a bilingual state employee, Maria-Kelley F. Yniquez, who processed medical malpractice claims. Ms. Yniquez spoke Spanish and drafted documents in Spanish when dealing with Spanish-speaking Arizonans.
When the amendment, known as Article 28, took effect, Ms. Yniquez stopped speaking Spanish on the job and filed a lawsuit. She later left her state job, and the Court's order today also suggested that her interest in the case may now be moot.
In a 6-to-5 ruling last October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the amendment placed an unconstitutional burden on the free-speech rights not only of the public employees, but also of the people they served. The amendment "obstructs the free flow of information and adversely affects the rights of many private persons by requiring the incomprehensible to replace the intelligible," Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the majority.
In the dissenting opinion, Judge Alex Kozinski said the majority was ignoring the principle that "government employees have no personal stake in what they say in the course of employment because that speech is the government's, not theirs." The majority's approach, Judge Kozinski said, would give "bureaucrats the right to turn every policy disagreement into a Federal lawsuit."
The appeal, Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, No. 95-974, which comes from an earlier stage of the case, argues that the First Amendment implications of Article 28 are minimal because the choice of what language to use is an aspect of conduct, not speech. The Ninth Circuit majority had rejected a similar argument.
"Speech in any language is still speech, and the decision to speak in another language is a decision involving speech alone," Judge Reinhardt said.
There were also these developments at the Court today:
 
Endangered Species
The Court agreed to decide whether people can sue the Federal Government under the Endangered Species Act to argue not that an endangered species is being inadequately protected -- as is nearly always the allegation in such lawsuits -- but that it is being overprotected.
There is a "citizen suit" provision of the Endangered Species Act that permits "any person" to file a lawsuit charging that Federal officials failed to carry out the law properly.
In this case, a group of ranchers and Oregon irrigation districts sued to set aside a finding by the Fish and Wildlife Service that more water must be kept in reservoirs of the Kalmath Irrigation Project in Oregon to protect the environment of two endangered fish, the Lost River sucker and the shortnose sucker. The plaintiffs argued this would unnecessarily hurt the economy by decreasing water for irrigation.
The Federal District Court in Eugene, Ore., in a decision upheld last year by the Ninth Circuit, dismissed the lawsuit on the ground that the citizen suit provision did not apply to suits seeking to lower rather than increase the level of environmental protection.
The ranchers and irrigation districts "seek only a greater share of the water and do not contend that compliance with the Act will improve the fish's lot," Judge Reinhardt said in his opinion for the appeals court. Rather than serving the purpose of the law, "they claim a competing interest," he said of the plaintiffs.
In their appeal, Bennett v. Plenert, No. 95-813, the plaintiffs argue that the Ninth Circuit has misinterpreted the intent of Congress to make citizen suits available to "any person" rather than only to "one apparently favored group."
 
Punitive Damages
The Court agreed to decide whether punitive damages awarded in a personal injury suit are taxable.
The Internal Revenue Code excludes from its otherwise sweeping definition of gross income any damages received "on account of personal injuries or sickness."
The lower Federal courts, as well as the Internal Revenue Service itself, have interpreted this provision inconsistently in various contexts. The Supreme Court has ruled in two recent cases that the provision cannot be used to exclude from taxable income the money received from successful suits for employment discrimination.
In the new case, O'Gilvie v. United States, No. 95-966, is an appeal by the husband and children of a woman who died of toxic shock syndrome in 1983. The family won a $10 million punitive-damage award in a products liability suit against International Playtex, Inc., the manufacturer of the tampons the woman, Betty O'Gilvie, had used.
The family members reported the award as personal income, paid taxes and filed a claim for a refund on the ground that the money should have been excluded as damages received "on account of personal injuries." They lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, which joined four other appeals courts in finding that punitive damages were not excludable from taxable income.

HEADLINE: Curbing Central America's Generals

 BODY:
Since the cold war ended, the small countries of Central America have been trying to recover from an era of military dictatorship. Guatemala, home of Central America's most brutal military -- installed with the help of a C.I.A.-backed coup in 1954 -- is having the hardest time. A succession of presidents have tried, with small success, to bring the soldiers under control.
Guatemala's new President, Alvaro Arzu, inaugurated in January, has acted to diminish the power of the corrupt military. He has removed some of the worst human rights abusers, including 11 generals and several colonels, among them Col. Julio Alpirez, who is said to have been involved in the killings of Michael DeVine, an American innkeeper, and Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, the husband of an American lawyer. 
 Honduras was never directly involved in the kinds of guerrilla conflicts that battered civilian life in Guatemala and El Salvador. But Honduras became a staging ground for American operations in the region. Its military gained inordinate power during this period and brutally suppressed dissent. Hundreds of people "disappeared," victims of elite army units whose leaders were trained by the C.I.A.
Now Honduras's elected civilian Government has taken some courageous steps, including the prosecution of military men responsible for the worst abuses during the 80's. President Carlos Reina has abolished the draft, separated the civilian police from the military and rejected the military high command's choice of defense minister.
In El Salvador, the process of reining in the military is a qualified success, helped by a large United Nations presence in the early days of peace between the guerrillas and the Government.
The United States could do more in all these countries to encourage the establishment of civilian authority. Programs that give the military a role in economic development projects, especially in places like Guatemala, are questionable investments. Commercial arms sales to these countries also need to be reconsidered. In fiscal 1995, the United States licensed $22 million in arms sales to Guatemala, a country already awash in weaponry. Similar amounts were licensed to El Salvador and Honduras.
The United States has a long, ignoble history of supporting repressive military leaders in Central America. For a change, it would be nice if Washington helped the vulnerable civilian leaders who are trying to bring the generals under control.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE UNIONS;
Labor Movement Endorses the President

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The nation's labor movement has set aside its anger over President Clinton's trade policy and endorsed him today for re-election. Just 2 of the 78 unions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- the teamsters and the longshoremen's union in San Francisco -- dissented, saying they wanted more time to consider their action.
The labor federation, under new leadership for the first time in 16 years and bursting with the symbols of change and newly found solidarity, also unanimously approved the assessment of special dues to provide $25 million of a $35 million fund to promote the union agenda during this election year in an effort to rout the Republican majorities in Congress. 
 Speaking of those lawmakers, the federation's president, John J. Sweeney, told about 500 exuberant delegates at a special convention here: "They want to get off on the cheap. We're going to take our jobs back. We're going to take the Congress back, and we're going to take our country back."
John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, shouted to the delegates, "We intend to be in their faces and on their cases."
In the past, unions have sometimes complained about the caution of the Clinton Administration on some issues, including raising the minimum wage and protecting the jobs of striking workers. In addition, they were furious about its support of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Congress approved in late 1993. But today Vice President Al Gore, who addressed the meeting after the votes, was unequivocal in backing every important item on the unions' agenda.
To chants, cheers and the strains of folk songs, Mr. Gore pumped his fists in the air, gave a bear hug to the federation's secretary-treasurer, Richard L. Trumka, and thanked the unions for their support. He told them, "One group with a conscience connected to working families can overpower hundreds or thousands of interests working against the interests of working families."
Republicans were quick to criticize the federation's political endorsement. "Bill Clinton has been tight with Washington union bosses for some time," said Cheri Jacobus, spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. 'And they're eager to use $35 million to put liberals back in Congress."
Ms. Jacobus noted that in the 1992 Presidential election, 40 percent of union members voted Republican -- suggesting a division between union officers and the rank and file. But today, the federation released a poll by Peter D. Hart Research Associates showing an upswing in support for the Administration.
Interviews with 829 union members and retirees from March 12 to 14 showed that 67 percent would vote for Mr. Clinton in a head-to-head election against Senator Bob Dole, the likely Republican nominee. That figure was up from 54 percent in April last year and 60 percent last November.
Mr. Sweeney was elected president of the 13.1-million-member federation last October after leading a coup against the leadership of Lane Kirkland, and the federation considered the gathering here an important statement of new energy. It was the first special convention in the 41 years since the A.F.L. merged with the C.I.O., and it was also the first vote to raise money to support the labor agenda in national elections.
But the tone of the meeting was at least as noteworthy because of a sense that the long decline in membership is over and that workers are rallying to unions as the wages of average workers continue to fall.
And as speaker after speaker stepped to the microphones to endorse the Democratic ticket as well as the additional dues -- 15 cents a month per member for a year -- it was clear that the face of the federation's leadership was changing from middle-aged white men to women, blacks, Hispanic Americans and young workers.
"The truth of the matter is, we're all in lockstep," said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
George Becker, president of the 481,000-member United Steelworkers of America shouted that President Clinton "showed us there really is a difference between Republicans and Democrats."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Advance in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in light volume yesterday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting today. Economic fundamentals were unchanged and trading was confined to technical factors and short-covering by speculators.
Sales of existing homes rose in February more than was expected, according to a report yesterday from the National Association of Realtors, but by and large the market ignored the news, since traders had expected some kind of rebound. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets today to discuss monetary policy, but few market participants expect the Fed to ease its policy. 
 By late yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 26/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 92 19/32 . The yield -- which moves in the opposite direction from price -- fell to 6.57 percent, from 6.64 percent on Friday.
Traders said that another factor giving prices a short-term boost was the likelihood that the Treasury's supply of new securities would tighten a bit. In fact, last evening the Treasury Department did postpone this week's auctions of $30.25 billion of two-year and five-year note sales because Congress has failed to lift the debt ceiling. The Treasury did not say what it was planning to do about plans to sell $18.75 billion of one-year bills on Thursday.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said that although a variety of economic reports were due out this week, the focus of the market would likely remain on today's Fed meeting.
Yesterday's lone economic release was February's existing-home sales report. It showed a rise in sales to 3.96 million units at an annual rate from 3.72 million units in January. Analysts said it was noteworthy that unsold inventory increased despite the increase in sales.
Mr. Delaney said the fixed-income markets would continue to be dogged by conflicting economic crosscurrents. "In such an environment," he said, "especially confronted by new supply, the odds favor lower prices in the short term" and higher yields. He added, "Although we may not see it this week, we still think it's possible for yield levels of 6 percent for a 2-year note and near 7 percent for 30-year bonds to be reached, before a significant rebound develops."
Scott Bleier, vice president of market strategy at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, agreed there was confusion in the market with regard to the economy and what it meant to bonds.
"There are a couple of reasons for that," he said. "The numbers coming from the Government, for one, are unreliable and skewed because of the Government shutdowns and the harsh winter that affected business activity. We not clear yet on how strong or weak the economy is."
Mr. Bleier also noted a number of currents affecting interest rates, including commodity prices "that may or may not be perceived as inflationary." But, he continued, "since they are regarded as harbingers of inflation the market does become concerned; while oil prices and real estate prices to date have been stable, they are two of the largest inflators in the economy."
He added: "The Fed needs to see a clearer picture with unskewed numbers, and must see a trend. I think the economy is still lackluster at best even with all the skewed data."
Consumer prices, producer prices and employment numbers remain the most important focus of attention as investors wait for a clearer trend to appear without the seasonal anomalies and weather-related prices. Mr. Bleier expects the yield on the long bond to remain between 6.25 percent and 6.75 percent.
At the regular weekly bill auction of new three- and six-month paper, the average rate for a three-month maturity fell three basis points and a six-month issue fell nine basis points, to 4.99 percent and 4.97 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts said that retail demand was decent for the six-month issue, but below average for the three-month bills.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	 3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills	 	 	Average Price	98.739	97.487	Discounted Rate	4.99%	4.97%	Coupon Yield	5.12%	5.17%	High Price	98.746	97.492	Discounted Rate	4.96%	4.96%	Coupon Yield	5.09%	5.16%	Low Price	98.739	97.487	Discounted Rate	4.99%	4.97%	Coupon Yield	5.12%	5.17%	Accepted at low price	45%	54%	Total applied for	$42,464,780	$50,914,122	Accepted	$13,596,030	$13,519,389	Noncompetitive	$1,389,983	$1,258,132	
 
Both issues are dated March 28, 1996. The three-month bills mature on June 27, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 26, 1996.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE TRAIL;
Focusing On Issues To Shape The Future

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash., March 25

 BODY:
For a last campaign swing through two Western states today, Patrick J. Buchanan chartered an airplane to travel in style as he delivered another version of his list of demands on the Republican Party.
But the plane was mostly empty, leaving Mr. Buchanan's dwindling campaign caravan looking like one of the "lost tribes" he keeps saying the Republican Party needs to bring home. 
 And on the eve of the primaries here and in California, where polls suggest that Mr. Buchanan will fare poorly, the questions and answers at news conferences today had less to do with the campaign at hand than with his recurring threat to bolt the party.
"I am not coming to this convention in San Diego to walk out," Mr. Buchanan said this morning at a briefing in San Diego in the building where the Republican National Convention will be held in August. "But we are not ruling anything out."
Mr. Buchanan said that after conferring with top advisers at his headquarters in McLean, Va., on Thursday about a possible independent bid, he would begin writing an outline of his vision for the party, which he called his "McLean Manifesto." But he said he would not start a third party campaign before the Republican convention, and might not do so at all.
Mr. Buchanan, who later held a news conference in Sacramento, Calif., before flying to a Spokane rally tonight, has begun traveling to journalists, because few journalists are traveling with him. He was accompanied today by more flight attendants -- three -- than newspaper reporters.
Including network crews, the disheveled journalists following Mr. Buchanan outnumber the crisply dressed secret services officers narrowly, by 11 to 9. Counting campaign staff members and candidate, 25 of 90 airplane seats were filled today.
Mr. Buchanan is still developing his list of desired positions for the Republican Party. In San Diego today, he named three main demands: that the party remain anti-abortion; that it address the economic anxieties of working- and middle-class people, and that it aggressively oppose illegal immigration.
But in Sacramento, he emphasized that those were not the only issues destined for the McLean Manifesto. "I have in mind a variety of issues that will be addressed in this in much more specificity and depth than you can do right here at a press conference," Mr. Buchanan said.
Even on a subject close to his heart, trade, Mr. Buchanan said today that he remained uncertain what to ask for. "I have not formulated exactly anything on that," he said in San Diego.
Mr. Buchanan said he intended to express a broad vision in the manifesto for Republicans caught up in "an arid economics that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
"If this party doesn't find a heart and soul to go along with its economic ideas," he said, "then it's not going to have a future in this country."
Mr. Buchanan said: "You know, we've denounced welfare queens over the recent years, and we've got to start talking as well about these corporate butchers, and some of these leveraged buyout folks."
While he is still working out his economic positions, Mr. Buchanan has lost none of his trademark specificity on social issues. In Sacramento, he was asked what he thought of a marriage of homosexuals conducted today by San Francisco's Mayor.
"That's a phony wedding," he said. "I think that's a mockery of traditional marriage. It's a manifestation of societal decline when political leaders stand up and lend their prestige and, if you will, give a secular benediction to that kind of travesty."

HEADLINE: Ford Shifts Leadership at Lincoln-Mercury Unit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., March 25

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced today that James G. O'Connor, executive director of export operations, had been selected to try to reverse the sagging sales of Lincoln and Mercury cars.
Mr. O'Connor replaces Keith G. Magee, who was general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury division for two years. Mr. Magee will head Ford's European sales efforts. The changes are effective immediately. 
Although Ford, like many auto makers in Europe, is struggling against the weak economy, some analysts see Mr. Magee's transfer as a vote of confidence. Many of the auto maker's top echelon, including the chief executive, Alex Trotman, did tours in Europe.
Sales of Mercurys, which include the Tracer and Sable, fell about 7 percent last year, while Lincolns, including the Continental and Mark VIII, fell about 16 percent.
Ford is trying to reposition its cars in the marketplace and will be introducing the Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicle this fall and Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle in 1997.
"Mercury's role in the marketplace needs a little more definition, while Lincoln has long-run potential, but right now is struggling," said Michael Schmall, director of automotive forecasting for J. D. Power & Associates. "With the right product, Lincoln could do extremely well."
The division has been criticized for missing the mark with its new vehicles, as well as for relying too much on sales to rental companies.
Lincoln-Mercury has lost market share to the General Motors Corporation, which is also trying to reposition its brands, as well as to Japanese auto makers. Lincoln-Mercury controls 3.7 percent of the auto market in the United States, down from 4.2 percent last year, according to the Autodata Corporation.
Mr. O'Connor will be succeeded by Richard N. Beattie, former executive director of rental and leasing operations. James F. Gwaltney, executive director of strategic planning and external affairs for the financial services group, will succeed Mr. Beattie.
Donald Cook, who was in charge of Ford's European marketing and sales, will return to the United States to a new position as head of customer loyalty, communication and training.

HEADLINE: It's a New Season For the Economy;
Some of Winter's Worries Linger But Growth Is on the Rebound

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Beverly B. Miller, president of a company that manufactures packaging equipment, first noticed the change in late February. Calls to her sales force surged unexpectedly, and one large customer, Hallmark Cards Inc., increased its orders for the automated machinery that packages the cards and party favors it makes.
But Ms. Miller, the president of Miller/Bevco Inc., in Kansas City, Mo., is hardly getting her hopes up for a booming year. The way she sees it, customers are loosening their purse strings only slowly and reluctantly. "Many companies were taking a wait-and-see attitude, and now they are taking less of a wait-and-see attitude," she said. "Demand has backed up, and they have to do something." 
 After stumbling in December and January, the American economy is bouncing back -- not strongly, but enough to be noticeable. Fears of a recession, evident in February, have faded. All but a handful of prominent forecasters expect this Presidential election year to be one of growth.
The growth that is emerging, however, is turning out to be too mild to give President Clinton any assurance that he can run successfully on economic growth alone. The recent signs of revival are probably strong enough, however, to keep the Federal Reserve from pushing down interest rates at its policy meeting today.
As for business executives like Ms. Miller, they say that a recession has probably been averted, but they are not yet breaking out the champagne. Stephen R. Hardis, chairman of the Eaton Corporation in Cleveland, for example, finds small comfort in the rising backlog of orders for the truck transmissions and axles that his company makes.
"I don't think the economy has a clear-cut direction yet," Mr. Hardis said. "You can say it isn't falling, which was what people were worried about. We always thought 1996 would be a year that would be flat or a little up, and it seems to be a little up."
The signs of revival, however lacking in vigor, show up in the almost daily release of new statistics. Retail sales are marginally stronger. Home construction has picked up. Job creation is more robust. Rising stock prices are increasing the wealth and the buying power of millions of people. And inventories of unsold goods are beginning to dwindle, which should make merchants increasingly willing to order and restock.
 The problem is that for nearly every ray of sunshine in the economic data, there is a troubling shadow. Home construction starts, for example, jumped in February to well above last fall's level, but permits to break ground for more construction in the months ahead have not risen. Auto and truck sales, another major source of economic growth, are also rebounding from a winter dip, but auto manufacturers are offering more discounts and incentives to maintain sales.
Capital spending on machinery, computers, trucks and buildings -- the tools needed to run a business -- was an important component of economic growth in 1994 and early 1995, and still is. But while this spending once rose briskly, the outlays are rising more modestly today. Similarly, while retail sales have risen gradually, so have personal bankruptcy filings and the level of consumer installment credit as a percentage of disposable income -- two indicators that Americans may be pressed for cash.
"All these factors are producing a high degree of uncertainty about the future direction of the economy," said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at the Commerce Department.
Jerrold Abell, the business manager of the Rogers Corporation in Rogers, Conn., a manufacturer of materials used in electronic circuitry, says he is certainly getting mixed signals. "Competition is very fierce right now," Mr. Abell said. "Our customers are postponing orders, not quite certain what will happen."
Motorola is a Rogers customer, purchasing material for the circuitry that goes into telephone beepers. "Motorola's orders aren't dropping off," Mr. Abell said, "but they are not increasing at the rate we thought they would."
Such hanging back inevitably is reflected in the forecasts of what will happen in the seven months to Election Day. Even the most optimistic forecasters do not expect gross domestic product -- the value of all that the nation produces in goods and services in a given year -- to grow by more than 2.3 percent this year, compared with 2.7 percent in 1992. That was the year that Bill Clinton wrested the Presidency from George Bush, promising to reinvigorate his rival's sluggish economy.
Senator Bob Dole, who has locked up the Republican nomination, has not yet tried to exploit this political irony. But Senator Connie Mack of Florida, the Republican chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, is beginning to. "As the candidate in 1992, Mr. Clinton portrayed the economy as the weakest in 50 years," the Senator said, "and now he is talking about a weaker economy in 1996 as the strongest in three decades."
Administration officials are already developing a pre-emptive defense against such attacks. They are arguing that whatever its shortcomings, today's economy is of far higher "quality" than in the last year of Mr. Bush's term. The unemployment rate, for example, is 5.5 percent, compared with 7.4 percent in 1992, "which means that if you get downsized, you are able to get another job more quickly," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The two election years are indeed different. In 1992, the nation was still shaking off the effects of a nine-month recession that had ended in the spring of 1991. Economic growth normally spurts in the first year after a recession, but most of the statistics available at the time suggested that the economy was still in the doldrums. Not only was the unemployment rate significantly higher, but the work force had shrunk during the recession, and by Election Day the number of Americans holding jobs was no greater than it had been when Mr. Bush took office in 1989 -- a setback that Mr. Clinton exploited by promising to create eight million jobs during his first term in office.
And that did happen. Still, whatever positive spin Mr. Clinton tries to put on this job growth, the economy is turning out to be distinctly weaker in the second half of his Administration than in the first half. In 1995, G.D.P. growth fell to just 1.3 percent, from an annualized rate of 3.5 percent for the period from the summer of 1993 through all of 1994.
The decline came largely in response to rising interest rates for mortgages, cars, home-equity loans and the like. Rates had been raised by the Federal Reserve out of concern that an overheated economy would push up the inflation rate.
With the economy weakening, the Fed changed course last July, and has been lowering rates slightly over the last eight months. But growth has remained sluggish in the first quarter of 1996, which ends Sunday, held back in part by winter storms, which depressed construction and discouraged shopping, and by a strike at a General Motors parts plant.
The ripple effect from the strike almost halted production at the giant auto manufacturer. Economists at the Federal Reserve have calculated that as much as three-tenths of a percentage point could be shaved off the growth rate in the first quarter as a result of the auto and truck production lost during the strike, which ended late last week. By most estimates, that would reduce the G.D.P. growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of only 1 percent.
This lost three-tenths will almost certainly be restored in the second quarter, as production recovers its old level, most economists say. But even so, growth in all of 1996 is not likely to exceed 2.2 percent. Fifty prominent forecasters surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, are predicting 1996 growth of about 2 percent, or a bit higher.
The Administration does not challenge this estimate, and neither do most economists.
"I doubt that home construction and motor vehicles, which are very important in driving the economy, can get much better than they are right now," said Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. "You would really have to see much stronger consumer demand and greater demand for our exports to raise the growth rate significantly."
A few forecasters see a recession ahead. They would blame the Federal Reserve for failing to lower interest rates more quickly and the Clinton Administration for cutting back Government spending too precipitously, thus depriving the economy of the stimulus that such spending produces. "The President may have precipitated a recession," said Erich Heinemann, chief economist of Heinemann Economic Research. "That would be ironic."
At the other extreme, some economists on Wall Street, also in the minority, see in the latest statistics the beginnings of inflationary economic growth. They are urging the Fed to delay further cuts in interest rates.
The majority of economists fall in the middle, sharing the view of Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. "The odds of a recession have gone way down, to practically zero, in recent weeks," he said. "We are going to have growth, perhaps a surprising amount. That is my gut feeling, but no one can really know how much. There are still too many unknowns."

HEADLINE: After Life of Notoriety and Pain, Son Tries to Solve His Mother's Murder

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, March 23

 BODY:
He slept right through it, that terrible night more than 40 years ago when his mother, Marilyn Sheppard, was bludgeoned to death in her bedroom.
Sam Reese Sheppard was only 7 years old when his uncle woke him the next morning and hustled him downstairs, past the policeman standing outside the blood-spattered room where his mother lay dead. It was July 4, 1954, and his father, Dr. Sam Sheppard, was in the Cuyahoga County Jail in Cleveland, about to become the defendant in a murder case that transfixed the nation. 
 Although Dr. Sheppard said he had been overpowered by a "bushy-haired" intruder that night, he was convicted of second-degree murder and sent to prison for life. Twelve years later the Supreme Court declared the trial had been a "carnival" in which reporters and television cameras trampled on his rights, and ordered a retrial at which, , with a young lawyer named F. Lee Bailey at his side, Dr. Sheppard was acquitted. Over the decades, the Sheppard drama never went away, inspiring the television series and movie "The Fugitive." But nobody was ever brought to justice for the murder and many in Cleveland still think Dr. Sheppard did it.
Now, Sam Reese Sheppard, 48 years old, believes that with the latest forensic methods, newly revealed evidence and a fresh suspect, he can finally solve the mystery.
And the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office, which had fought for Dr. Sheppard's conviction, now thinks his son may be right -- but may never be able to prove it.
Under a court order obtained by Mr. Sheppard, the prosecutor's office earlier this month took a blood sample from Richard Eberling, the Sheppard's window washer, who is in prison for the 1989 murder of an elderly woman. Tuesday, also under the court order, the county coroner's office is to give the prosecutor and an attorney for Sam Reese Sheppard an inventory of evidence it holds on Mrs. Sheppard's killing.
Among the items Sam Reese Sheppard hopes the coroner's office still has are scrapings from under his mother's fingernails, hairs from the murder scene, a piece of a rocking chair from her bedroom, and several wood chips with blood on them, taken from stairs in the house.
None of the blood was tested at the time, so it is not known whether it was Mrs. Sheppard's or her killer's.
Together with a spot of blood from a wood chip that Dr. Sheppard managed to retrieve from the coroner's office before his own death in 1970, Sam Reese Sheppard hopes these slivers of evidence can provide enough material to conduct DNA tests that will prove Mr. Eberling was the real killer.
Carmen Marino, the first assistant county prosecutor, said, "I don't think Sam Sheppard killed his wife. There should have been more of an investigation at the time."
But now, so many years later, with many of the principals in the case dead and the files of both the Cleveland police and the county prosecutor missing, it may be impossible to finally settle the mystery. "It seems far-fetched to me now that Sam did it," Mr. Marino said. "But I don't know that there will be enough evidence to declare him innocent or convict anyone else."
The outcome of the new investigation is critical to Sam Reese Sheppard, an unemployed dental hygienist from Oakland, Calif.
"The murder destroyed my family," he said in a telephone interview.
Not only was his mother beaten to death with 35 blows, but his father drank heavily after being freed and died of liver disease, and two of his grandparents, distraught over the slaying, shot themselves to death.
Out of fear of publicity, Sam Reese Sheppard lived for years like "The Fugitive," not revealing his past.
But since 1989, Mr. Sheppard, has worked with a writer, Cynthia L. Cooper -- with whom he has published "Mockery of Justice; The True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case" (Northeastern University Press,1995) -- and private investigators to reverse the verdict of fate. Under an Ohio law, he is suing the state for wrongfully imprisoning his father for 10 years.
To win, Mr. Sheppard must first get a local judge to declare his father innocent and then he can seek damages in state court. Under the law, Mr. Sheppard could win $25,000 plus interest for each of the 10 years his father was incarcerated. And he might be able to claim the financial losses his father suffered from losing his practice as a prominent osteopathic surgeon. The total could run to more than $1 million.
But Mr. Marino is skeptical that Mr. Sheppard will prevail. First there is the issue of whether Sam Reese Sheppard has legal standing to sue. The Ohio law on wrongful imprisonment was designed simply as "conscience money" to be paid to the victim, Mr. Marino said, not to his descendants. Then there is also the question of how long the statute of limitations lasts.
Terry Gilbert, Mr. Sheppard's lawyer in Cleveland, acknowledges that the effort to win any actual monetary settlement may be protracted because the legal issues are unusual. But, Mr. Gilbert said, "We are thankful we have gotten this far, with even the prosecutor now believing Dr. Sheppard is innocent."
Mr. Eberling, now a 65-year-old state prison inmate confined to a wheelchair, denied through his lawyer that he murdered Mrs. Sheppard. "This is much ado about nothing," said David Doughten, Mr. Eberling's attorney. "Richard is the last living suspect, and in America this is how it is done," Mr. Doughten said. "With due respect to O.J. Simpson, Sam Sheppard is the holy grail of crime detection, and there is always going to be somebody coming up with a new theory."
In the original case, according to the vague version Dr. Sheppard gave to the police, he had fallen asleep on a day bed downstairs in the family's Dutch Colonial house on a bluff above Lake Erie. He awoke to his wife's screaming, "Sam, Sam." He ran upstairs, he said, and was attacked from behind and knocked unconscious.
When he came to, there was blood everywhere and his wife lay with no pulse, her pajamas pulled below her knees and above her breasts. Hearing a noise, he ran outside down some steps to the lake, where he got a brief glimpse of a tall man with a large head before being overpowered again.
Dr. Sheppard's story seemed suspicious. There were no signs of forced entry, the police said. And Dr. Sheppard was a poor witness, denying that he and his wife had any marital problems. But the police soon found Susan Hayes, a lab technician who recounted having sex with the doctor in his Jaguar.
But Sam Reese Sheppard and Ms. Cooper have now found that the police withheld vital evidence. Henry Dombrowski, a police officer, discovered pry marks on the basement door, and there was a trail of more than 30 blood spots from the bedroom down to the cellar. Two of Mrs. Sheppard's teeth were broken outwards, suggesting that she bit her assailant and that the blood trail was left by the killer. Dr. Sheppard had no cuts.
Mr. Eberling first came under suspicion as early as 1959 when he was arrested for burglary and a ring belonging to Mrs. Sheppard was found in his house. He told the police that he had been working at the Sheppard home two days before the murder and had cut himself, bleeding all over the house. He had a prominent scar on his left wrist.
In 1989 Mr. Eberling was convicted of murdering Ethel May Durdin, a 90 year-old for whom he had worked as a caretaker, and forging her will, which left him most of her $750,000 estate. A few years earlier, her sister, who had not liked Mr. Eberling, was found beaten to death in her bed, much like Mrs. Sheppard. That murder has never been solved.
Since he has been imprisoned, Mr. Eberling has made a number of tantalizing statements to Mr. Sheppard and Ms. Cooper. "Sam, yes, I do know the entire story," he wrote in one letter. Another time he drew an accurate diagram of the interior of the Sheppard's house.
Based on information obtained by Ms. Cooper, Mr. Sheppard believes Mr. Eberling was a troubled man who "was jealous of our family as the ideal family he didn't have."
Mr. Sheppard hopes DNA testing will confirm his hunch.
While denying the murder, Mr. Eberling has written: "The Sheppard answer is in front of the entire world. Nobody bothered to look."

HEADLINE: Tucson H.M.O.'s May Offer Model for Medicare's Future

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
"Partners for Seniors has expanded its pharmacy benefit!" a newspaper ad proclaims to Tucson's big retirement community. "Enjoy free health club benefits," promises Intergroup of Arizona. "Do you know," touts FHP Health Care, "how your health plan stacks up against FHP's? You tell us. $0 plan premium. $0 deductibles."
Tucson's health maintenance organizations offer free hospital stays, free annual physical exams, free X-rays, free mammograms, free laboratory tests, $26 eyeglasses, $5 and $10 doctors' appointments, free rides to get to them and this year's newest offering: $7 for a three-month supply of any of 300 prescription drugs. 
 The juices of unbridled competition are bubbling in Tucson's medical community. Lured by the payments the Government gives for medical care for each Medicare patient, four private H.M.O.'s are vying for the business of the elderly and stirring a stampede from the conventional Medicare system by offering new services, lower prices and more preventive care. This is not charity, they say. By keeping people healthier, the companies say, they hold down costs and fatten their profits.
In response to the companies' appeals, 42 percent of the people 65 and older in Tucson's Pima County, or six times the national average, have fled the standard, more costly Medicare program to enroll in the programs for the elderly offered by the four competing H.M.O.'s: Partners Health Plan, Intergroup, FHP and Cigna Health Care of Arizona. In only a few other cities so far, including Riverside, Calif., San Diego and Portland, Ore., have such organizations captured more than 40 percent of the Medicare-aged population.
For lawmakers, the health organizations' success in enrolling the elderly makes Tucson a test case for ways to cut fat from the health care system and curb the rise in Medicare spending. While both Democrats and Republicans support greater use of H.M.O.'s, they differ on how to achieve that goal. Last year, the Republicans proposed financial incentives for the elderly to leave their traditional plans; President Clinton halted the proposal, calling it coercive.
The rush of the elderly into H.M.O.'s in Tucson runs counter to the more common image of H.M.O.'s as ferocious cost-cutters that employers hire to provide health care for their workers. In programs for the elderly, the patient, not an employer, is the customer.
The environment is so competitive here for the business of the elderly that H.M.O.'s are behaving like banks giving away toasters. Customers who do not see enough to like can stick with conventional Medicare, which serves most of the nation's elderly.
"It's been sort of a price war in Tucson," said Chris Herstam, director of the Arizona Department of Insurance in Phoenix, which oversees the financial condition of the H.M.O.'s. "And that's great for consumers."
But Stewart Grabel, ombudsman for the Pima County Council, calls the H.M.O.'s a mixed blessing. "So far, the H.M.O.'s' emphasis has been on cutting costs," he said. "There are serious quality-of-care issues that we see in terms of discharges from hospitals and nursing homes, in terms of getting things approved that would be readily approved under traditional Medicare and in terms of rights of appeal."
Such advocates for the aging accuse these H.M.O.'s of the same shortcomings that have been ascribed to many of those serving younger people: reducing services to the sickest and having a cost-cutting mentality that obstructs access to specialists, delays surgical operations and shoves patients out of hospitals prematurely.
 
Lower Costs, Less Red Tape
But Government analyses also show that only 1.2 percent of the organizations' patients in Arizona quit the plans each month to return to conventional, fee-for-service Medicare. And in a state poll for the Arizona Hospital and Health Care Organization last November, the Gallup Organization found that the elderly in H.M.O. programs were more satisfied than health care consumers in all other types of programs, including fee-for-service Medicare, employer-financed H.M.O.'s and employer-financed insurance programs that permit workers an unrestricted choice of doctors.
Herman and Catherine Manus, who retired here from Queens in 1979 after bringing up four children, report that FHP has provided generally satisfactory care, though they have had complaints.
In the last five years, Mr. Manus, 85, has had surgery to his hip, both knees and his prostate. Mrs. Manus, 74, has had a hysterectomy, angioplasty to clear out her arteries and two hernia operations; now she has another hernia.
In the middle of these medical problems, FHP assigned the Manuses a new primary-care doctor, the gatekeeper that H.M.O.'s use to supervise patients and control costs.
"I had sharp pains in my side," Mrs. Manus said, "so I went to see her. She told me it was bursitis. My daughter, who's a nurse in New York, said, 'Mom, get rid of her.' " So the Manuses complained, and FHP let them select a new doctor. "He tells me what it was," she said. "A hernia."
It was a small price, Mrs. Manus said, for all the money they have saved. "We can't believe we don't have to pay anything," she said. "Except for the fee to see the doctor. That was $10 a visit; now it's $5. And we don't get all the paper work."
Like the Manuses, many of Tucson's elderly are swayed by the simple arithmetic of joining H.M.O.'s., and by the prospect of being liberated from Government forms, insurance forms and other assorted paper work. Under standard, fee-for-service Medicare, an individual pays $716 for each hospital admission, pays for all medications and pays a $46.10 monthly premium to cover 80 percent of the cost of physician and outpatient services. Many also buy insurance costing $200 or $300 a month to cover the charges that Medicare does not.
 
H.M.O.'s Reaping Medicare Profits
H.M.O.'s finance their services through grants from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration. It pays them 95 percent of what it would typically pay to care for a beneficiary.
The grants are based on local health care costs; in Tucson, H.M.O.'s get $438.58 per month per patient. That income and the money saved through tight cost controls are expected to leave the organizations room enough to offer cheap prescriptions and many additional services, like free physical exams, while still making a profit. The companies say profits range from 2 to 5 percent in Arizona.
The success of the H.M.O.'s here is built upon the state's early start in managed care, particularly its unique approach to Medicaid, the Federally financed health care program for the poor. The Medicaid program has given Arizona experience in dealing with managed care, and it has given the state's H.M.O.'s experience in dealing with clusters of patients.
Fourteen years ago, the state got a waiver from Federal regulations and began requiring all Medicaid beneficiaries to join an H.M.O. Arizona now invites H.M.O.'s to bid for the business every three years, and the state tries to insure competent care by attaching high priorities to the accessibility of care centers and the quality of their service.
Numerous studies of the state program say the result has been to keep Medicaid costs lower in Arizona than in most states and to provide better care. Many other states have now established Medicaid managed-care programs, but no others have reached Arizona's level of patient coverage, which is close to 100 percent.
Now Tucson's experience with H.M.O.'s for the elderly is offering policymakers insights into how to curb the growth in Medicare spending so its trust fund does not run dry early in the next century, as many economists predict.
In their 1996 budget proposal to keep Medicare afloat, Republicans in Congress have proposed a $270 billion reduction in projected spending through 2002 for Medicare, which cost $175 billion last year. They would do that by reducing the growth in spending to 6 percent a year from 10 percent. President Clinton favors a smaller cut, $89 billion.
The H.M.O.'s here argue that there is plenty of room for cuts that would still leave them with adequate profits. "That's nothing, $270 billion," said Dr. Bill Buchsbaum, vice president of medical affairs for Partners Health Plan.
But no one can yet claim that H.M.O.'s would make a dent in Federal spending for Medicare, however much they might save their patients. "The way the Medicare-H.M.O. program is currently constructed, we're not saving any money," said Bruce C. Vladeck, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare.
The reason, Mr. Vladeck said, is that the H.M.O.'s appear to be subtly attracting the youngest and healthiest among the elderly, who can be served for less than 95 percent of the average cost for Medicare patients. That gives them enough left over to offer services that conventional Medicare cannot match, Mr. Vladeck said.
The H.M.O.'s deny that. "I've never seen any analysis to support that," said Thomas Lescault, vice president for government programs at Intergroup.
The health agency's statistics are inconclusive as to whether the H.M.O.'s are serving a healthier population than Medicare as a whole. They show that 9 percent of the H.M.O. patients are 85 or older, compared with 10 percent of those in conventional fee-for-service programs. But the data also show that 24 percent of the H.M.O. patients are in the presumably healthier group of 65- to 69-year-olds -- a lower proportion than the 26 percent in that group on the fee-for-service rolls.
Other analyses show that H.M.O.'s can drive down all Medicare spending, as fee-for-service physicians keep their fees down to compete with the companies. And while many physicians here work exclusively for H.M.O.'s, many others work on contract for H.M.O.'s while also taking fee-for-service clients. In many cases, they adopt cost-saving H.M.O. practices, leading to what economists call a spillover effect.
 
Study Predicts More Savings
In a study last September for the industry's trade group, the Group Health Association of America, Jack Rogers, chief health economist at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, reported that a 10 percentage-point increase in the proportion of the elderly using H.M.O.'s would spill over to reduce the Government's fee-for-service Medicare spending by 2.8 to 7.6 percent.
And if H.M.O.'s nationwide raised their enrollment of Medicare patients, now 7 percent, to 40 percent, or close to the Tucson level, the study said, all Medicare spending would drop by 21 percent, just about enough to achieve the Republicans' projected reduction of $270 billion.
Despite the free services that H.M.O.'s offer in Tucson, the issue of choice discourages many retirees from signing on.
"That's the primary thing," said Nancy Menth, 78, a widow and former high school English and French teacher who has osteoporosis. "I don't want to be restricted to the doctors in the H.M.O."
But the appeal of fee-for-service care is evaporating as the influence of the H.M.O.'s becomes pervasive here.
"The doctor I go to happens to also be an H.M.O. doctor," Mrs. Menth said. "Even though I have freedom of choice, his backlog of people interferes with accessibility. The volume of the whole thing -- it's just about impossible to get in on a phone line."
State Senator Ann Day of Tucson, chairwoman of the Senate Health Committee, is leading an effort in Phoenix to tighten regulatory control of H.M.O.'s by requiring them to disclose more information. "I think it's a fairly young industry and still evolving," she said. "It seems to be evolving more toward the cost-cutting end."
Walker W. Wilson, 86, an FHP enrollee who worked until a year or two ago as a carpenter refurbishing mobile homes, has few complaints.
Around Christmas, he recalled at a recent appointment, he started having trouble breathing. On Jan. 3, he went to see Dr. Thomas Eyler, who has a contract to serve FHP patients. Dr. Eyler listened to his chest. "He said, 'There's something there I haven't heard before,' " Mr. Wilson said. Dr. Eyler found that he had pneumonia and something else. The doctor dispatched him that day to a cardiologist, and the cardiologist immediately put him into the hospital.
"The cardiologist said with that heart valve the way it was, he'd be gone in six months," said Alice Wilson, 81, Mr. Wilson's wife of 62 years. Mr. Wilson had the aortic valve replaced with a pig's valve and was in the hospital for three weeks. "To this day," she said, "we've never gotten a bill."

HEADLINE: In Bosnia, Securing a Peaceful Future Now Depends on Roads, Refugees and Elections

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, March 22

 BODY:
"You want to see my graph of the future?" asks Carl Bildt, the former Prime Minister of Sweden who is in charge of carrying out all provisions of the peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina except for the work of the 60,000 NATO peacekeepers who keep the belligerents apart.
His graph is a time line, five arrows beginning with NATO's arrival last Dec. 14 and pointing toward a huge question mark for the period after NATO is to leave at the end of this year. 
 The future is a shaky one, compared with the vision painted in the Dayton accords -- that of a peaceful Bosnia with ethnically integrated cities, awash in international donations to rebuild what war had torn down, a country equipped to conduct the free elections vital to its survival.
"The popular perception is that after the elections, we go home because it's all over," said Mr. Bildt.
But on the civilian side, work has barely begun on the hardest tasks -- organizing elections, rebuilding shattered homes, roads and power lines, and overseeing the return of 2.2 million refugees. And unless there are signs of success soon, Mr. Bildt and others warned of the danger of resumed fighting after the NATO force leaves, a prospect that would make all the billions of dollars spent on the operation money down the drain.
"We need money," Mr. Bildt said. "We don't have the money. The election is not funded. Refugee returns are not funded. There are an estimated 3 million uncleared land mines scattered all across the country. More than 60 percent of all housing units are damaged, and 18 percent are destroyed.
"All of these problems will take many years and a lot of money to solve, and I don't see where it's coming from," he said.
The World Bank and other international agencies estimated last year that $5.1 billion in foreign aid would be needed during the next three to four years to get a recovery started, $1.8 billion of it this year alone.
But, according to Mr. Bildt, donor countries have actually contributed only about $358 million of the $550 million they have pledged, including $84.9 million for "quick impact" relief from the United States and $45 million from the World Bank for emergency recovery projects.
Even the $1.8-billion goal for this year does not include the cost of getting refugees to begin returning to their home towns, or of housing them. And it seems a small sum compared with the devastation of the country's roads and bridges and the money needed to get moving again a national economy that is flat on its back.
NATO officials and critics in the United States blame some problems on what they see as Mr. Bildt's slowness off the mark. But European officials, particularly in France, say that the Americans gutted his job of any real authority by excluding him from the NATO command, to avoid repeating the civilian-military disagreements that had paralyzed United Nations forces during the war.
Yet even as he insists that securing lasting peace will take years of effort, and probably a residual NATO military presence beyond the projected pullout date, Mr. Bildt, 46, says that he intends to leave his post of civilian High Representative in Bosnia at the end of the year.
He has not looked for an apartment here, but instead has a $165-a-night room at the Hotel Bosnia. His operation, of about 50 people, is squeezed into a single bullet-pocked office floor in downtown Sarajevo.
"I see this as a one-year thing," he said. "The local authorities have to take their own responsibilities."
What happens then depends on whether other countries are prepared to put as much time, effort and resources into encouraging the former belligerents into getting together as NATO has put into keeping the cease-fire alive.
So far, it does not seem that they are.
"I think the military side is going to be okay," Adm. Leighton W. Smith Jr., the American commander of the NATO force, told reporters recently. "But if the civilian side goes belly-up, the possibility of peace in here diminishes dramatically."
Local authorities on all sides of the conflict have complied with the military provisions but brazenly ignored many of the civilian ones, with no effective sanctions from Mr. Bildt or Admiral Smith.
Bosnian Serb authorities coerced tens of thousands of Serbs in Sarajevo and its suburbs into leaving when their neighborhoods were turned over to the Bosnian Government in recent weeks. The Government did little to persuade them to stay.
Mr. Bildt criticized the factions after the fact, but could not effectively bash Bosnian Serb and Muslim heads together in time to stop the exodus.
NATO forces chased down and arrested only a handful of arsonists, arguing that maintaining civil order was a civilian police responsibility, but the international police force as yet has in place less than half the 1,721 officers provided for in the peace accords.
Instead of the ethnic mix of residents protected and policed by forces carefully composed to reflect the ethnic breakdown of the original population of neighborhoods, Sarajevo is largely a Muslim city now, with little prospect that Serbian refugees will return soon.
Police of all sides have brazenly violated the peace agreement by keeping checkpoints on roads that members of all Bosnian nationalities are supposed to be able to travel freely. Muslims and Croats, supposedly members of one federation recognized in the peace agreement, have clashed openly in Mostar, and many Croats in western Bosnia consider that a part of Croatia.
A new high-level conference of donors is scheduled to take place in Brussels from April 12 to 13, with a goal of raising $1.2 to $1.3 billion for reconstruction this year.
[Foreign ministers of five countries closely monitoring compliance with the peace agreements have threatened to cancel the conference unless all sides release prisoners still held in violation of the peace accords.]
Hasan Muratovic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, told a group of prospective donors here last week that just the physical destruction done by the war would cost $80 billion to repair, with $16 billion in foreign aid needed to get private money flowing.
"You might be prepared to ask: Why the world?" he said. "Because nothing had been done to prevent this hell, to which you are all now witnesses, from happening. Therefore we believe that the world has an obligation to help us."
Mr. Muratovic is a Muslim, and his remarks make it doubtful that he was referring to the need to help repair the devastation in Serbian-controlled areas. But in any case, according to an American official at the conference, the statement had the effect of alienating many of those in his audience.
NATO forces have done some repair work to the infrastructure despite their American commanders' fear of "mission creep."
American military engineers and Hungarian contractors will complete a bridge to Croatian territory over the Sava River near Brcko by the end of this month, and German Army engineering units were repairing blown-up bridges on the road between Sarajevo and Tuzla.
But Sarajevo is still a national capital without a civilian airport.
Less than six months from the elections prescribed by the peace agreement, which are expected to take place around Sept. 1, the pre-war census list that is to be used for voter registration has not yet been found, according to officials here.
"The peace agreement provides for refugees to have the right to vote for candidates in the districts they lived in before the war, but they are scattered all over Europe," one of Mr. Bildt's aides said. "The lists will have to be distributed to them and they have to register to vote either there or in other districts. All of this work hasn't even been started, and it will all have to be completed very soon."
Nor has funding yet been provided for the hundreds or even thousands of international monitors needed to insure a fair election.
The elections are to establish a national parliament divided among members of Bosnia's three main ethnic groups, a rotating national presidency, and separate parliaments for the Croat-Muslim federation and the Bosnian Serb republic within Bosnia. But to many diplomats here, it is beginning to look as if real power will be held by nationalists determined to keep Muslims, Croats and Serbs living separately.
"If things keep going the way they are," one international civil servant warned, "it will be impossible for refugees to return to areas not controlled by their own ethnic group."
All these problems -- displaced people, demobilized soldiers with no jobs, and simmering political tensions -- could mean a return to limited war next year if the NATO peacekeepers all leave before civilian part of the accord takes hold, Mr. Bildt and other officials warn.
Of particular concern is the north of Bosnia near Brcko, where a territorial dispute between the federation and the Bosnian Serbs has yet to be mediated.
"The military bit's gone fine, but the civilian and reconstruction bit isn't going fine, largely because the federation is in trouble and the political guys on both sides cannot agree to sit down and come up with a tri-entity solution," said Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael J. D. Walker, the British deputy of Admiral Smith who commands NATO ground forces here.
"If that isn't going to be the case, it is a widely held view that one solution might have to be some sort of follow-on force," he said, but NATO has not even begun to consider one.
Making peace among themselves is primarily a task of the parties, Mr. Bildt tells them during the frequent meetings between them that he presides over. But the level of mistrust is still so great that NATO peacekeepers had to escort Bosnian Serb delegates into Sarajevo when they last met here on March 16.
A day earlier, Mr. Bildt got a taste of the mistrust himself when he went for a stroll in the Sarajevo district of Grbavica just before it was turned over to the Government.
Blond and over six feet tall, he was recognized instantly.
"Look at this identity card," said a man who had come from Serbia, handing it to Mr. Bildt at a Bosnian Serb police checkpoint. The man had been told that the Government probably would not let him cross the street into their territory. "Can I visit my relatives on the other side with this card?" he asked.
"Yes," Mr. Bildt answered.
"Who will guarantee it?" the man pressed.
"That's a good question," was all Mr. Bildt could answer.

HEADLINE: STUDY CRITICIZES FEDERAL RESERVE AS LAX MANAGER

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
In a rare independent examination of the Federal Reserve's operations, a Congressional report issued today criticized management by the secretive central bank of its own finances, suggesting that it could spend less and return billions of dollars to the Treasury.
The report by the General Accounting Office was released by two Democratic Senators a day before the Senate Banking Committee is to take up nomination of the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a third term. While it contains no direct criticism of Mr. Greenspan and does not address the monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve under his leadership, the report provides an unusually detailed look inside an institution with enormous power and, critics contend, insufficient accountability. 
 The report found that the central bank's spending rose from 1988 to 1994, the period it studied, at a higher rate than overall Federal Government spending. It said the Federal Reserve did not always seek fully competitive bids for services it buys.
The report also said that the Federal Reserve, which operates with no oversight of its internal finances, had accumulated, with little justification, a $3.7 billion contingency fund out of money that would otherwise have been returned to the Treasury, with $1.6 billion of the fund put aside since 1988, the year Mr. Greenspan became chairman. Each year, the Federal Reserve returns $16 billion to $24 billion in profits from its own operations.
More broadly, the report -- a draft that is expected to become final within a few months -- questioned whether the Federal Reserve was being managed properly to prepare it for a rapidly changing financial world.
The report seems likely to raise eyebrows among political leaders, from President Clinton down, who have heard Mr. Greenspan lecture repeatedly on the need to make painful choices to reduce the Federal budget deficit, and among ordinary citizens, whose mortgage rates, credit card bills and savings accounts are all influenced by the central bank.
There has long been a tug-of-war between members of Congress who want greater oversight of the Federal Reserve, and the central bank, which jealously guards its independence as a bulwark against political meddling in the sensitive area of interest rate policy. Although the G.A.O. has undertaken smaller studies of the Federal Reserve's operations, this one, which took two years, was its most comprehensive.
The Federal Reserve's policy- making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, is also to meet on Tuesday. The committee is not expected to change interest rates, given recent data suggesting that the economy is growing at a faster pace than at the end of last year.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve, Joseph R. Coyne, said the central bank had been given a copy of the report for formal comment, and would have no public statement until it had drafted its reply.
The Federal Reserve does not receive any Congressional appropriation but instead finances itself through interest earned on Treasury securities and fees charged to the financial services industry. It returns to the Treasury each year the difference between its revenues and its expenditures.
Specifically, the report made these points:
*From 1988 to 1994, operating expenses for the Federal Reserve Board and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the country increased 50 percent, to $2 billion, twice the rate of inflation and nearly three times the rate of growth in overall Federal discretionary spending. (The rate of growth in Federal Reserve expenditures for the period was about the same as for Federal spending when the effects of declining military spending were factored out.)
*Contracting and procurement practices at some of the Reserve Banks "favored certain sources over others, despite systemwide guidance that prohibits this," the report said. "Such practices raise questions about conflicts of interest and favoritism and whether the system is receiving the most favorable prices." The report provided few details.
*The size of the staff rose 4 percent from 1988 to 1994, to 25,745, but total compensation costs rose 53 percent in the same period, to more than $1.3 billion. Much of the increase was in benefits, which vary among the Reserve Banks but "are generous compared to those of Federal financial regulatory agencies with similar personnel requirements," the report said. During the six-year period, benefit costs in the Federal Reserve rose 91 percent for each employee, while the increase for Federal Government employees generally was 62 percent.
*The $3.7 billion contingency fund kept by the Federal Reserve, which has grown sharply in recent years, "could safely be reduced or returned to the Treasury," the report said. "Although the surplus account is intended to absorb possible losses, the Federal Reserve has recorded substantial net profits for 79 consecutive years," the report said. "Even though the likelihood of the system's incurring losses exceeding its revenues appears remote, the total surplus increased 79 percent in the 1988-1994 period."
* The Federal Reserve and Congress should consider a number of changes, including possible mergers of the 12 Federal Reserve banks and their 25 branches.
While the most visible role of the Federal Reserve is setting monetary policy, it has a host of other responsibilities, including banking regulation, that have grown ever more complex. The report said the largest increase in personnel came in bank supervision and regulation.
The report noted that the Federal Reserve paid to the Treasury $16 billion to $24 billion a year in profits in each of the six years studied. Most of the profits come from interest paid by the Government on Treasury securities held by the Reserve Banks as collateral, with some coming from fees charged by the Federal Reserve for check clearing and other functions.
It also said that the central bank had begun to show that it could work to address its problems. But it made clear that the G.A.O. believed the problems were serious.
"With the current budgetary climate, the Federal Reserve could do more to increase its cost-consciousness and insure that it is operating as efficiently as possible in its day-to-day operations," the report said.
Urging the Federal Reserve to undertake a broad re-examination of its mission and structure, the report said: "The need for such a re-examination is underscored by a number of major legislative, technological and marketplace developments that could profoundly affect the nature, size and distribution of the Federal Reserve's activities and resources."
The question of Federal Reserve secrecy and accountability have long been debated outside the institution, and increasingly within it. Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, who asked the G.A.O. to do the report and released it today, have sought unsuccessfully for years to pry more information from the central bank and to interest their Congressional colleagues in legislation to create more oversight without impinging on its power to set monetary policy.
"This is the kind of thing that goes on behind closed doors that taxpayers ought to know about," Mr. Dorgan said.
The central bank has always jealously guarded its independence, fearing outside pressure to manipulate interest rates. Still, some insiders, notably Alan S. Blinder, who resigned recently as vice chairman, have argued for greater openness, at least in disclosing the reasoning behind monetary policy decisions.

HEADLINE: Benefits Fund Could Grow In the Market, Panel Advises

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Members of a Federal advisory panel told Congress today that a portion of Social Security payroll taxes should be invested in the stock market, and several senators expressed cautious support for the idea.
The proposal, which represents a radical change in Social Security policy, survived its first test on Capitol Hill without criticism from any member of Congress or any of the experts on pension policy who testified before a Senate subcommittee. 
 Details of the proposal have not been worked out, and Congress is not expected to take action this year.
Still, lawmakers were clearly intrigued with the possibility that Social Security could earn a higher rate of return by investing some of its trust fund assets in common stocks and mutual funds. Since creation of the Social Security program in 1935, the money obtained from payroll taxes and not immediately needed for benefits has been invested in Government securities.
Members of the advisory panel said stocks had outperformed bonds over long periods. The return on Government securities, while relatively low, is guaranteed. The panel acknowledged that stock investments would entail a slight increase in risk for Social Security, but said the risk was manageable.
After hearing from 3 of the 13 members of the panel, the Advisory Council on Social Security, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said: "There is agreement that the trust fund could be invested in equities. The question is, Who controls those investments?"
The hearing today was held by the Finance Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, headed by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming. The council, appointed in June 1994 by Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes business executives, union leaders and pension experts chosen to represent self-employed workers and consumers in general.
Some council members said that Social Security payroll taxes should be kept in one big pool, and that a portion should be invested by Federal officials or their agents in a broad selection of stocks intended to mirror the overall performance of the market. Other council members want to create an investment account for each person covered by Social Security. Workers could then decide for themselves how the money should be invested, though the Government would still provide some basic Social Security benefits.
Edith U. Fierst, a member of the advisory panel, testified: "All members of the advisory council favor private investments. That's a very significant change. The difference among us is whether investments in equities should be made by individual workers or by the trust fund."
Mrs. Fierst said she believed that the money should be invested by the trust fund because many workers had no experience in the stock market and could not make sophisticated investment decisions. In addition, she said, private investment options would be more vulnerable to scandals and swindles than the current Social Security system.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he was surprised and pleased that council members, though divided on details, were "unified in support of the principle that some portion of the retirement system should go into private investment."
"I represent New York City," the home of many stockbrokers, investment advisers and mutual funds, said Mr. Moynihan, a longtime student of Social Security. Mr. Moynihan said he was not shocked, but delighted and surprised by the broad support for the recommendations among council members.
Senator Breaux said, "If we can encourage investment in equities, it's a good idea, but we also want maximum protection" for Social Security beneficiaries.
The Social Security trust fund now takes in more money in taxes and interest than it pays out in benefits. But Federal officials say the program will not be able to pay all the benefits earned by members of the baby-boom generation because, under the latest estimates, outlays will exceed income starting in 2020, and the trust fund will be depleted in 2030.
Mr. Simpson said: "A yawning chasm is not far down the road. The sooner we address this problem, the less painful the solution will be."
Mr. Moynihan said Congress could alleviate the problem by slowing the growth of Social Security benefits paid to 43 million people. He said the Government could reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in such benefits because the current formula overstated inflation.

Fed's Finances Criticized In Congressional Report
A Congressional report criticized the Federal Reserve's management of its finances, suggesting the central bank could spend less and return billions of dollars to taxpayers.
The report by the General Accounting Office cited in particular a $3.7 billion contingency fund the Fed has accumulated. It was released by two Democratic Senators a day before the Senate Banking Committee is to take up the nomination of the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a third term. He was not criticized in the report. [Page A1.]
 
Russia Drops Planned Tariff Rise,
Clearing the Way for an I.M.F. Loan
Russia dropped a plan for a sharp across-the-board increase in tariffs, clearing the way for a $10.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Western economists said. In another conciliatory move, Russia dropped its ban on American poultry imports, the Clinton Administration announced. [A1.]
 
Mad Cows Strain European Union
The European Union moved to ban British beef as unsafe, even as the British Government was telling consumers at home that no further steps were necessary to protect them from exposure to so-called mad cow disease. The consumer scare is destroying Britain's $6.5 billion beef industry, and the standoff is straining the 15-country European alliance. [A3.]
 
Rate Fears Increase Home Sales
Fears of rising mortgage rates resulted in an unexpected 6.5 percent increase in sales of existing homes last month, to an annual rate of 3.96 million, seasonally adjusted, the National Association of Realtors said. It was the first monthly rise since October. [D5.]
 
Stocks Mixed in Slow Trading
Stocks were mixed in slow trading. The Dow Jones industrials rose 7.22 points, to 5,643.86, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 15.13 points, to 1,087.09. [D12.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose with the 30-year bond up 26/32 of a percentage point, to 92 19/32; its yield fell to 6.57 percent from 6.64 percent on Friday. [D19.]
 
Ford Selects Lincoln-Mercury Head
Ford Motor appointed James G. O'Connor, executive director of export operations, to try to reverse the sagging sales of its Lincoln and Mercury cars. He replaces Keith G. Magee, who will head Ford's European sales. [D4.]
 
Time to Sell Preferred Shares
Time Warner said that it planned to sell $1 billion in preferred shares with a 20-year maturity linked to its Time Warner Entertainment venture, and use the proceeds to ease its debt. [D4.]
 
N.A.S.D. Bans Frank Wolf
Frank N. Wolf, former president and owner of F. N. Wolf & Company, was ordered to repay $7.9 million to hundreds of investors because they were not warned that his firm sold them risky penny stocks. He was also banned from the industry and fined $250,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers. [D10.]
 
Chile Declares Victory Over Medfly
Chile has declared victory over the Mediterranean fruit fly in a persistent, 30-year battle that included such tough tactics as spraying pesticides over heavily populated areas and confiscating all organic material entering the country. Chilean agricultural officials forecast that agricultural exports, currently $1 billion a year, could rise by $500 million a year by the end of the decade. [D6.]
 
Melville to Sell Kay-Bee Toys
The Melville Corporation agreed to sell its Kay-Bee Toys chain, the second-largest toy retailer after Toys "R" Us, to Consolidated Stores, a deep discounter, for $315 million. The sale of the 1,000-unit chain is expected to heat up competition among toy stores. [D9.]
 
Finalists for Magazine Ad Awards
Among the finalist agencies in the annual Magazine Publishers of America Kelly Awards competition for creative excellence in magazine advertising, Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland are tied for the lead. Each has five campaigns. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D11.]

HEADLINE: Russia Drops Big Tariff Increase, Clearing Way for an I.M.F. Loan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 25

 BODY:
Russia has dropped a plan for a sharp across-the-board increase in import tariffs, clearing the way for a $10.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Western economists said tonight.
The election-year loan had been thrown into doubt earlier this month after Russia's Finance Minister, Vladimir G. Panskov, proposed a 20 percent increase in the tariffs, contradicting previous assurances to the I.M.F. 
 But a senior Western economist said tonight that Russia has now met almost all of the conditions and that the fund's staff has prepared a confidential analysis recommending that the loan go forward.
The fund's 24-member executive board is scheduled to take up the loan on Tuesday, and formal approval is now virtually assured.
The huge loan, which the United States has strongly supported, is linked to a comprehensive plan to proceed with market reforms and is expected to give President Boris N. Yeltsin an important election-year boost.
Mr. Yeltsin has been gaining ground in the polls against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist candidate. One of Mr. Yeltsin's selling points has been his ability to secure Western financial assistance.
Under a quickened schedule, an initial disbursement of $340 million could come as early as this month and more than $1 billion would be available before the elections in June.
That will provide Mr. Yeltsin with a badly needed infusion of money at a time when he is trying to win votes by making good on his promise to see that back wages are paid and social spending is increased.
On a related economic dispute, the Clinton Administration announced tonight that Russia has finally dropped its ban on American poultry imports. But negotiations on Moscow's decision to increase tariffs on those imports are just beginning.
The basic terms of the International Monetary Fund loan were set in February when Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, met with Russian officials. But only a week later, Mr. Panskov, the Finance Minister, proposed the average 20 percent increase in tariffs to raise revenue for increased social spending this year.
In another move that worried the West, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin promised beleaguered farmers and ailing industries protectionist measures to help safeguard them from foreign competition.
That was a particular problem because Russia had promised the monetary fund that it would reduce the average import tariff by 1998. It also pledged that the average tariff would not increase before then.
The European Union sharply criticized Russia's talk of protectionism, a move that also worried the United States. The Clinton Administration was also distressed over the protectionist measures that blocked American exports of frozen chicken. In an effort to boost Mr. Yeltsin's standing with the voters, Mr. Clinton had endorsed the fund loan before negotiations were even complete.
But weeks of intensive consultations between the fund and Russian officials, as well as the I.M.F.'s explicit threat to withhold the loan, forced the Russians to modify their plans for the generally higher tariffs.
That does not mean that Russia's protectionist impulses have been completely checked.
According to Western economists, the average Russian tariff has still been increased 5 to 10 percent. But the monetary fund's staff says it does not believe that the politically important loan should be held up because of those increases.
Specifically, the fund's staff believes that Russia should be given more time to reduce the average tariff by, for example, lowering tariffs on equipment and machinery.
The I.M.F. itself has complicated Russia's task by insisting that quick steps be taken to impose modest tariffs on previously exempt goods. The fund urged action to encourage a more uniform system of tariffs.
Moreover, the fund's staff has concluded that Russia has made good on almost all of its other key promises. Moscow has eliminated the tax-exempt "stabilization fund" of Gazprom, the world's largest producer of natural gas. The fund insisted that such a step be taken to eliminate a huge tax loophole for a rich company with powerful friends in the Government, particularly Mr. Chernomyrdin.
At the behest of the monetary fund, Russia has moved to phase out export tariffs on oil and gas. The fund says those tariffs have produced artifically low energy prices in Russia, distorting investment decisions at home.
At the fund's suggestion, Russia is moving to introduce new excise taxes on electricity and fuel in order to make up the lost revenue from export tariffs.
Still, potential problems loom. In addition to the tariff issue, there is the problem of raising revenues, which have fallen drastically.
Russia's goal last year was to raise revenue to 12.5 percent of Russia's gross national product. Instead, revenue declined to 10 percent. It has since dropped further and is now running at a worrisome 8.5 percent of gross domestic product.
As a result, Russia's budget deficit has grown considerably, though it remains within limits set by the monetary fund.
To raise funds for the cash-strapped Government, tax loopholes favoring vested interests will have to be closed. Raising revenue is crucial because the Government needs money to ease the pain of transition to a free-market economy and reduce popular resistance to reforms.
Despite a new agreement to restore import licenses, the dispute between the United States and Russia over American chicken exports still persists.
Under the new agreement, Russians will begin issuing new import licenses for the more than $500 million a year in American poultry exports. In return, the Russians will be able to conduct spot checks of American poultry plants and a small sample of each American poultry shipment will be checked for bacteria and disease.
But American and Russian officials are still at odds over Russia's decision to increase tariffs on frozen poultry, which could effectively be doubled.

HEADLINE: Old Problems Surface Between China and Taiwan

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 26

 BODY:
With the dust-up between China and Taiwan settling down, their officials began grappling in public today with the obstacles that remain before the two sides can even begin talking about delivering mail to each other, much less about a meeting between their leaders.
Blunt comments by officials in China and Taiwan have demonstrated that despite the euphoria over receding military tensions in recent days, major differences remain. 
 Shen Guofang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said flatly that Beijing would not consider reopening talks about establishing mail, air and shipping links until Taiwan's leaders stopped seeking a higher diplomatic profile around the world, which China interprets as moves toward independence.
In Taiwan, Premier Lien Chan stridently asked China to renounce its threat to use force to retake the island before sitting down for talks.
"I call on the Chinese Communist authorities to thoroughly abandon the flawed strategy of the possible use of force to resolve cross-strait problems," Mr. Lien said, speaking on state television. "When the two sides consider that the time is right, we are willing to hold talks aimed at a peace accord."
The remarks on each side, while keeping to previously set positions, were tougher in tone than the conciliatory gestures made immediately after Saturday's presidential election, which President Lee Teng-hui won decisively.
For years, China has urged the opening of direct air, shipping and mail links with Taiwan, where many residents have relatives on the mainland with whom contact had been broken off until tensions eased in the mid-1980's. Taiwan officials hesitated, but eventually agreed to a series of meetings on the topic, which were suspended last summer after President Lee's trip to the United States infuriated leaders in Beijing.
Chinese leaders have argued that greater contact with Taiwan will speed an eventual reunification on China's terms, even though the mainland restricts the flow of both information and ordinary citizens more than Taiwan does.
Since 1949, when Nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan, all travel, mail and trade -- each of which has grown sharply in the last five years -- has been through Hong Kong, the British colony that reverts to Chinese rule next year.
China has promised the same "one country, two systems" approach for both Hong Kong and Taiwan, theoretically allowing them to keep independent judiciaries and governments and capitalist economies. China plans to handle Hong Kong's foreign affairs and defense, but has said it would allow Taiwan to keep its own army.
Yet many doubt China's ability to keep from meddling, and just this week Beijing made final a decision to abolish Hong Kong's existing legislature on July 1, 1997. Chinese officials objected strongly to the way some members were chosen in Hong Kong last year -- though democratic elections.
A day after China announced the end of a third round of military exercises that it had conducted near Taiwan over the last three weeks, a Beijing-controlled newspaper in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Po, quoted Chinese military officers today as saying that they might hold another round.

HEADLINE: Business Consultant To Study Broadway

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
In hopes of bringing more original work to Broadway, New York City and a group representing theater producers, landlords and unions have hired a management consultant to look at how Broadway operates and explore the creation of a foundation to finance new plays and musicals.
The hiring of Bain & Company, of Boston, a consulting concern frequently called on to analyze troubled industries, is a first step in the establishment of what city and theater leaders said they hoped would be a long-term plan to stimulate Broadway. Part of that plan is the proposed creation of a Theater Trust, a permanent foundation that would award grants or perhaps make loans to producers and theaters. 
 The decision by the city and the Broadway Initiatives Working Group, a coalition formed two years ago to consider the future of Broadway, to participate in the study is in itself considered a breakthrough. For years, theater leaders have discussed the dearth of new productions on Broadway. But addressing it has been stymied by the age-old feuds among theater owners, producers and the craft unions.
"The reason for doing all this is that it's very clear that the No. 1 draw for the city is the Broadway theater and other live presentations," said John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. "Considering how many different interests there are, and the ancient and even slightly tedious disagreements among them, I think they're working very well together on this."
The city is providing half the money for the $100,000 study, with the rest coming from private donors, said Jack Goldstein, the coordinator of the working group and assistant to Ron Silver, president of Actors' Equity.
Analysts from Bain & Company, who began their research about three weeks ago, are examining financial documents from various Broadway productions and talking to people in the industry to develop a portrait of how Broadway does business. Their analysis is expected in about a month.
Increasingly, Broadway has been relinquishing its role as an incubator for new work, especially straight plays. While the so-called mega-musicals, the multimillion-dollar productions created by the likes of Cameron Mackintosh and Andrew Lloyd Webber, are thriving, the straight play, once a Broadway staple, has all but vanished. This season, for instance, only eight new plays will have opened on Broadway by the season's end on May 1. Broadway faces other problems, like competition from other forms of entertainment and rising costs. In those ways, it shares the concerns of larger industries in transition, like car manufacturing, airlines and steel, said Patrick F. Graham, director of Bain & Company.
"Broadway has many of the characteristics of a turbulent industry," he said. "The issue here before us is, is there a way for a trust to be established to help this group move forward and grow and prosper?" The Bain analysts have also been asked to recommend ways the trust fund itself could be financed.
"We have a desperate need for producers in the theater, and it is very hard for them to get money and find investors for new plays," said Arthur Laurents, the director and playwright. With the composer Stephen Sondheim, he has long been agitating for a concerted effort by Broadway to devote resources to developing plays.
The Broadway Initiatives Working Group was organized after the city decided to grant subsidies to the Walt Disney Company for its plans to rehabilitate the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street. The group -- comprised of Broadway's big three landlords; the League of American Theaters and Producers; the Dramatists Guild, and the unions representing actors, directors, stagehands and press agents -- came up with the notion of a trust fund, to be administered by a standing board. But the tricky question of where the money would come from has not been settled.
"There are two big challenges," said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the theater league. "How should the trust be structured and what should its objectives be, and secondly, how should it be funded?"
One proposal under consideration would be to use some of the revenue from the sale of air rights over Broadway theaters for the trust fund. Privately, however, theater executives say that all parties, including the unions, would have to contribute to the theater trust in order for the theater owners to give money to the fund.
Barbara B. Hauptman, executive director of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, and a member of the working group, said the financing of the study itself was a reassuring sign that the city recognized Broadway's importance.
"The theater trust could be a catalyst for bringing back a creative environment to this area," she said. "We talk about the talent leaving us. If that creative environment could be rejuvenated around here, that wouldn't be an issue any more."

HEADLINE: Conference Board Survey Shows Dip in Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence was little changed in March following a sharp rise in February, an important index showed, amid indications that the economy is gaining steam.
The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence was 97.7 for March, slightly less than February's revised reading of 98.0 but much more than the 88.4 it hit in January. Analysts had expected the index to be unchanged or slightly higher. 
 "We did not give back any of the bounce we saw in February," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "It suggests the economy is holding up fine."
As the index was released at midmorning, Federal Reserve officials were meeting in Washington to set interest-rate policy. They decided later in the day to leave rates unchanged.
The Fed had been easing rates to stimulate the economy, since lower rates translate into cheaper borrowing costs that tend to increase investment, hiring and economic activity over all. Recent data, though, have suggested that the economy is already strengthening.
Three weeks ago, a report that the economy created 705,000 jobs in February caught economists and others by surprise. Since then, signs of strength in the housing market have also suggested improvement.
The consumer confidence index is based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households in the United States.
Results of the survey suggested that despite the recent data, consumers remain somewhat concerned about job prospects. In March, 26.5 percent of respondents said jobs were hard to get, compared with 23.4 percent the month before.
"The improvement in employment conditions reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for February has not been translated into a less apprehensive outlook about jobs," Edgar R. Fiedler, the economic counselor at the Conference Board, said.
That, however, contrasts with another measure in which those surveyed rated business conditions as good. That figure rose to 23.5 percent, from 22.3 percent in February.
The confidence index produced by the Conference Board is considered an important barometer of consumers' willingness to borrow and spend, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity in the United States.
Its results for March, which fell somewhat below the level a year earlier of 100.2, provided little reason to believe any major change in consumer behavior was in the offing.
"There's no buying binge," Mr. Roach said, "but there's certainly no collapse of consumer demand."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German's Hint of a Rate Cut, And Fed's Refusal, Spurs Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday after the head of Germany's central bank hinted at interest-rate cuts there while the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged in the United States.
Since interest-rate cuts make a country's assets and currency less attractive to investors, the combination of German and American developments helped the dollar move up against the mark, which was followed upward by the yen. 
 Comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, helped bolster the dollar. Testifying before a Senate panel considering his renomination for a third term, Mr. Greenspan said that the economy appeared to be running at a "reasonably good clip."
Tom O'Malley, a senior foreign exchange analyst for Technical Data in Boston, remarked that "comments from two central bank chiefs should be taken in a supportive fashion for the U.S. currency."
In New York trading last yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4785 marks, up from 1.4781 marks on Monday. The dollar rose to 106.47 yen, from 106.16 yen.
Market participants had expected the Fed not to lower rates, given recent economic data hinting at some economic growth.
Analysts said the market also reacted to remarks by Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, that the dollar was likely to strengthen at the same time the German money supply was slowing. Strong growth in the German money supply earlier had dampened expectations for a rate cut because of fear that such a move would stir inflationary pressure.
"There are a host of reasons for interest-rate cuts, none of which escapes Tietmeyer," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
Bolstering that view yesterday were comments by the German Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, who said that the country's gross domestic product was flat in the first quarter of 1996. In last year's fourth quarter, output decreased by five-tenths of 1 percent from the previous quarter.
The Bundesbank's policy-making committee meets tomorrow, and the currency market is not anticipating a rate cut that soon. "But it is clear that German rates will come lower some time in the near future," Mr. O'Malley of Technical Data said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Drought Sends Wheat Prices Up; April Gold Climbs to $400.50

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Wheat futures soared yesterday amid concern that a five-month drought affecting winter wheat fields was unlikely to ease soon.
Gold prices also gained. April gold rose $1.50, to $400.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division -- its highest price since March 1 -- amid signs that the economy may be strong enough to generate stronger inflation. 
 The rally lifted the Commodity Research Bureau index 0.22 point, to 252.66, its highest since July 25, 1988.
United States home resales surged by 6.5 percent in February, their first rise since October. And a recent jump in commodity prices is a traditional early warning of a rising inflation rate, traders said.
"Investor focus has settled on inflation again," Daniel McEvoy, trader at Credit Suisse in New York, said. "Concerns are creeping back that inflation will rise."
As for wheat, the National Weather Service predicted below-normal rainfall for the major wheat-growing states in its latest extended forecast.
"We are going to continue to see tight markets," Brian Doyle, president of the King Milling Company in Lowell, Mich., said, even after this year's harvest, which begins in May and lasts through July.
Agricultural officials in Kansas rated 43 percent of wheat fields in poor to very poor shape. In Oklahoma, 60 percent of wheat fields are in poor or very poor shape, while 66 percent of Texas fields are in such condition, state officials said. Those states produced 21 percent of last year's wheat crop.
Hard red winter wheat, the variety grown in the Plains, for May delivery surged 14.75 cents, to $5.19 a bushel at the Kansas City Board of Trade.
"The crop is waiting for a drink of water, and we are running out of time," said Joe Christopher, a trader with the Linnco Futures Group at the Kansas City Board of Trade.
Gasoline retreated from Monday's four-year high after a 13 percent rally in prices in the last two weeks that was based on speculation that refinery inventories were too low to meet a seasonal surge in demand. April unleaded gasoline fell 0.75 cent, to 66.25 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Hold Steady

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in thin trading yesterday, as the Federal Reserve held its monetary policy meeting without changing short-term interest rates.
The Fed's decision had little impact on the bond market, as it had long been expected, especially after a surprisingly strong employment report earlier this month crushed any remaining hopes that rates would be lowered yesterday. Indeed, some market participants expect the central bank will refrain from lowering rates at its next policy-making meeting, on May 21, unless it has evidence that the economy is as weak as it appeared at the beginning of the year. 
 "There was no data today which would have caused a fundamental shift in market psychology," said P. Christopher Leary, senior vice president and portfolio manager of SunAmerica Asset Management.
Bond prices were held down in part by speculation that the Labor Department would revise upward the surprisingly strong February payroll number when the agency reports on March employment on April 5. More than 700,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in February, and the number prompted sharp selloffs in the bond and stock markets on March 8. Some traders speculated yesterday that the number could be revised to as high as one million new jobs.
Still, prices largely held on to their gains of the last few days. The price of the 30-year bond settled unchanged yesterday at 92 17/32, leaving its yield also unchanged, at 6.57 percent.
"I think over all the rally we've seen over the past week or so represents a corrective bounce after a 12-point decline in the long Treasury bond futures contract," Mr. Leary said. "What we've seen over the last couple of days was exaggerated volatility based on the lack of liquidity, with small trades making big moves."
"Part of the rally," he said, "really has been anchored by the better performance of the short end of the market, which has rallied on the lack of supply with the postponement of the two-year and five-year auctions this week. However, this can be quickly reversed once the auctions are announced or if we do not get a coupon pass by the Fed, which has been widely expected for sometime this week." A coupon pass occurs when the Fed adds money to the banking system by becoming a buyer of various Treasury issues.
The market had little reaction to a report showing consumer confidence in March slightly lower than it was in February. The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said its index of consumer confidence was 97.7 for March, compared with February's revised reading of 98.0
"Rather than the current trend of confidence showing improvement, it is merely maintaining last year's levels," said Bruce Steinberg, manager of Macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch, "and given weak income growth and high indebtedness, we look for confidence to gradually fall during the first half of 1996."
In the municipal market, the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority sold $1.08 billion of tax-exempt securities yesterday through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The Puerto Rico agency had originally planned to sell the bonds two weeks ago, but a surge in rates -- and borrowing costs -- that followed the March 8 release of the February employment report prompted the sale to be postponed.
Municipal bond yields, as measured by the Bond Buyer index of 40 municipal issues, were at 5.90 percent, or 17 basis points lower than the recent high of 6.07 on March 18. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Puerto Rico offering consists of $886.4 million in bonds to raise new money and $193.3 million in refunding bonds.
Underwriters initially priced the new money portion of the deal to yield a maximum 6.05 percent for an uninsured bond due in 2026, with yields on uninsured serial bonds ranging from 4.1 percent for one due in 1997 to 6 percent for one due in 2018. These uninsured bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's.
For the $193.3 million insured portion of the financing, the maximum yield is 5.675 percent, with the yield on the serials ranging from 4 percent in 1996 to 5.60 percent in 2015.

Bullying: who picks on whom, and why?

SERIES: First of two articles on bullying in childhood.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
A SMALL group of young teen-age boys decided it was "fun" to turn a quiet classmate into a human plaything. They forced him to give them money, swallow weeds, drink milk mixed with detergent and allow himself to be led around on a leash.
A 10-year-old girl was bribed into doing homework and running errands for a classmate who told her she would not be allowed into "the club" unless she complied. 
 A third-grade boy woke up three school days in a row with a stomachache and refused to go to school after three fifth-grade boys surrounded him, taunted him, smeared him with animal excrement and then called him names.
The stories of bullies and their victims have a familiar ring to almost everyone. Most people have seen bullies in action and, in fact, most children are victimized by bullies at least once. According to Dr. Carla Garrity, a child psychologist in Denver with a special interest in bullies, "approximately 10 percent of all children attending school are afraid through much of the school day." Some of these children avoid lunch, recess and playtime out of fear that they will be humiliated or picked on by bullies, she said.
However, few people in authority respond to bullying with the appropriate degree of concern or with an appreciation for its potentially serious consequences for both the bully and his or her victims. Nor do most parents, teachers or school authorities know how best to put a stop to this destructive behavior.
 
The Making of a Bully
Myths abound about why some children become bullies and others victims. Contrary to popular belief, bullies are not inwardly anxious, insecure children with a desperate need to boost themselves up by making others afraid of them. Rather, when tested, bullies tend to score high in self-esteem. Nor are most bullies academic failures or loners without friends. Rather, studies have shown that bullies learn their aggressive, intimidating tactics from others, especially from parents or caretakers who rely on severe and often capricious physical discipline to get their way.
"Bullies are not born that way," said Dr. Leonard Eron, a research psychologist at the University of Michigan who has been studying aggressive behavior in children for decades."They learn that being aggressive and physically coercive is a way to get other people to do what they want and to increase their status and self-esteem. They learn this long before school age, from television as well as from parents. They see cartoon characters using physical force to acquire things, vent their frustrations and get their way, and they think the damage isn't permanent. The cartoon characters blow up and then come back."
Dr. John Lochman, a psychologist who studies aggression in children at Duke University, agrees that bullies "come to believe that aggressive behavior will work for them" and says "bullies place a high value on being in control and dominating others."
"Bullying is a way to make a child feel important," Dr. Lochman said.
 
A Bleak Future
Bullying often does not stop in childhood. Bullies are at greatly increased risk of becoming first, juvenile delinquents and later, criminals. Dr. Dan Olweus, a psychologist at the University of Bergen in Norway, followed thousands of boys from grade school to adulthood. He found that 65 percent of the boys identified as bullies in the second grade had felony convictions by 24.
As Dr. Garrity put it, "If nobody helps these children, they get worse and worse."
In an article in the current issue of Contemporary Pediatrics, Dr. Garrity and Dr. Mitchell A. Baris, a psychologist in Boulder, summarized Dr. Olweus's findings: "Bullies are at risk for conduct disorder and delinquency in adolescence, and for serious antisocial and criminal behavior in adulthood. Most remain bullies throughout their lives, enjoying their power and the control over others that their behavior evokes. They often drop out of school, have difficulty holding jobs and fail to sustain close, intimate relationships."
Dr. Eron has followed bullies in the Chicago area for 22 years, has found finding that they achieve less academically, socially, economically and occupationally than their nonbullying peers of comparable intelligence. He said, "They have more arrests for felonies and more convictions for serious crimes, are more abusive toward their spouses and are more likely to have highly aggressive kids."
 
Who Becomes a Victim?
Dr. Olweus's research also showed that most victims of bullies do not have external characteristics that set them apart. Children who were overweight, wore glasses or spoke with an accent were not more likely to be victimized than other children. Rather, it was mainly psychosocial characteristics that set them apart.
Victims tend to be anxious, insecure and lacking in social skills, Dr. Olweus found. These "passive victims" are often emotionally vulnerable and physically weak , easy targets who do not fight back.
A second, less common type of victim is the restless, irritable child who teases and provokes others. These "provocative victims" do fight back when attacked, but are not adept enough to win. Many are thought to have attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with poor impulse control.
Dr. Olweus's long-term studies showed that, as with bullies, the propensity to remain a victim is relatively stable over time unless something is done to help the child develop new ways of thinking and behaving. Although systematic long-term studies of victims have not been done, Dr. Garrity and Dr. Baris wrote that their counseling experience indicates that "victims of bullying suffer from low self-esteem, fear and anxiety, disrupted academic performance, lack of interest in school, a lack of trust and difficulty in establishing and sustaining friendships."
Dr. Garrity reports that girls are as likely as boys to be the victims of bullies, but the way girls are bullied tends to differ. Boys are primarily bullied by other boys who use swift and effective physical aggression, like tripping victims in the lunch line, shutting them up in lockers or elbowing them in the stomach as they pass in the hall.
Girls may be bullied by girls, boys or both, and the methods used are less physical, primarily social alienation and intimidation. A girl might be teased about her appearance or clothing or be made the target of malicious gossip. She may be the victim of extortion, for example, promised membership in a group if she participates in a cruel or humiliating prank. Or she may find intimidating notes.

HEADLINE: Prosperity In New Chile Nourishes Drug Trade

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
For the last decade, Chile has served as the model for economic growth and stability in Latin America, after opening its doors to foreign investment and shifting from military dictatorship to democracy.
But like a rising star with a dirty little secret, this enterprising country of 13 million people, nestled on a narrow strip of land between the Andean Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, has also become a major center for drug trafficking and money laundering. 
 Because of Chile's proximity to cocaine producing countries and miles of unprotected borders, it has become an important transit route for drugs from neighboring Bolivia and Peru to the United States, Europe and Asia, according to a report issued this month by the United States State Department.
The report found that Chile's open and thriving economy and its bank secrecy laws have made it an easy place to launder drug money and that drug use within Chile is rising sharply, especially among the upper classes and young people and in the workplace.
Stepped-up drug enforcement efforts in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia, including the shooting down of drug cartel planes by the military, have forced drug barons to establish new transit routes through the southern part of Latin America, namely Chile, State Department officials said.
"There have been incidents of substantial money flows that cannot be accounted for," said a State Department official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "I'm talking about large bank deposits from companies that do not appear to have the means to generate that type of cash."
Drug experts said domestic drug consumption was also rising.
"We are like the United States in the 1980's in terms of our drug consumption," said Maria Pia Guzman, manager of Paz Ciudadana, a nongovernmental drug organization. "New freedom and new wealth as well as a breakdown in social norms are contributors to the problem."
Chile was the first Latin American country to undertake market economic reforms, including privitizing most state enterprises, eliminating tariffs and opening its markets to foreign investment.
A result has been 12 years of uninterrupted growth at an average of 7 percent, and record low inflation and unemployment that have positioned Chile to become the next member of the North American free-trade bloc.
Responding to the findings of the State Department report, Chilean Undersecretary of the Interior Belisario Velasco said simply, "In Chile, money has been and is laundered."
But Pablo Lagos Puccio, a lawyer for the National Committee for the Control of Drugs, a Government agency, said it would be a mistake to conclude that Chile is becoming a major world center for drug trafficking and money laundering.
"We are a country that is growing and changing very rapidly, and we acknowledge that there is a drug- and money-laundering problem here as there is throughout the world," Mr. Lagos said. "But we are taking the necessary steps to deal with these problems."
State Department officials said that while the Chilean Government has taken steps to address the drug problem, including increased enforcement and a new narcotics law that makes laundering of drug money illegal and obliges banks to report suspicious deposits to authorities, more work still needs to be done, especially to close loopholes in the new law.
"We believe that the Chileans are very sincere in trying to address this problem," a senior State Department official said. Referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, he added, "They understand that if they are next on the list to be admitted to Nafta, they have to deal very strongly with drugs."
Last year, police drug seizures increased by 100 percent in Chile to 760 pounds of refined cocaine, 2.5 metric tons of cocaine base and 95.9 metric tons of marijuana, law enforcement officials said.
Most of the cocaine enters Chile on the backs of Indian runners who pass through its northern border with Bolivia in the town of Arica. From there it is carried by car to southern Chile for refining and then shipped abroad from Chile's thousands of miles of border and coastline.
The Government's anti-drug efforts suffered a major setback last year when President Eduardo Frei freed Angel Vargas Parga, a drug dealer who was convicted in 1989 for helping to smuggle half a ton of cocaine into Chile. Mr. Frei said he ordered Mr. Vargas's release because he showed good conduct in jail.
But the fact that Mr. Vargas has relatives who are officials in Mr. Frei's Christian Democratic Party brought widespread criticism of his pardon at a time when the Government was launching a nationwide campaign against drug use.

HEADLINE: $10.2 Billion Loan To Russia Approved

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it had approved a $10.2 billion loan for Russia. The move is expected to be helpful to President Boris N. Yeltsin in the presidential election in June.
The three-year loan is the fund's second biggest, after a $17.8 billion credit granted to Mexico last year. It is designed to help Russia along the road from Communism to capitalism. 
 To qualify for the loan, Russia agreed to far-reaching changes in its economy, including cuts in its budget deficit and more liberal trade policies. On Monday, Russia dropped plans for a sharp across-the-board increase in import tariffs. The plan for the tariffs had threatened the approval of the loan.
The credit is a vote of confidence in Mr. Yeltsin and his economic policies. He has been lagging well behind Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, in opinion polls 12 weeks before the election.
The United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said today that he welcomed the fund's decision and said that the loan should help Russia as long as it vigorously carried out the promised reforms.
An initial disbursement of $340 million of the loan could come as early as this month, and as much as $1 billion could come by the time of the Russian presidential election.
The money will help Mr. Yeltsin carry through on commitments to increase social spending and to pay back wages, both of which will be helpful to him in winning votes.

A state agency takes charge of the commercial redevelopment of a Massachusetts military base.

BYLINE: By Susan Diesenhouse 

DATELINE: AYER, Mass.

 BODY:
A NEWLY formed Massachusetts state agency is moving forward with its first major project, a $1.5 billion redevelopment of half of the Fort Devens Military Reservation, which spans four towns 35 miles northwest of Boston.
The Army base is being transformed into a mixed-use industrial park with as much as 8.4 million square feet of space. The project, the Devens Commerce Center, has already signed its first major commercial tenant, the Gillette Company, to a long-term lease. 
 A 410,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center, with 200,000 square feet of expansion space available, will be built expressly for Gillette, which is based in Boston. Site preparation is already under way. Gillette will be consolidating operations currently in the Massachusetts towns of Andover, Wilmington and Lynnfield.
The new agency, the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency, plans to take title to 4,480 acres, about half the total area of the 79-year-old Army base. Negotiations on the terms of the purchase have not been completed, but the agency will begin managing the property soon, even if the sale terms have not been concluded, agency officials said. The Army will retain the land that is not sold to the agency.
The agency, in addition to being the landowner, will become the lead developer, local governing authority and a major source of financing for the Devens redevelopment -- the first time that a single agency has assumed all these roles. The executive director is Michael P. Hogan, formerly the Mayor of Marlborough.
A redevelopment plan for the property was approved in 1994 by the four towns through which the base runs: Ayer, Shirley, Lancaster and Harvard. The agency will sell or lease existing buildings and land for the development of offices, light industrial use, research and development space, community recreational areas, retail stores and housing.
The agency will have the authority to assess taxes or fees; issue tax-exempt bonds; extend loans from a $150 million fund; sell or lease property and issue all permits. It also has the responsibility to provide for the public safety and deliver services like utilities, snow and trash removal, and schools, if residential development occurs.
The Massachusetts Development Finance Agency was formed to enable the state to be more active in commercial and industrial development projects. It was created through the affiliation of a state financing agency, the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency, with a land development agency, the Massachusetts Government Land Bank, which was set up in the 1970's to convert old military bases to civilian use.
A former deputy director of the Industrial Finance Agency, Theodore S. Chandler, said the new agency "brings a phenomenal new dynamic to the development process." In the past, one agency had control over land and development while the other had the financial resources. To have both land and capital accessible through one source makes it possible to do large-scale development projects, he said.
If the four towns had independently reclaimed the land they ceded to the Federal Government in 1917, they would not have had the technical or financial resources to develop it, said Stephen M. Slarsky, a selectman in the town of Ayer. "It's necessary to have a larger body to drive the process," he said. The town has 7,000 residents.
Over all, Mr. Hogan, the executive director of the project, said, it will cost about $1.5 billion to upgrade and install basic services like roads and pipes; renovate two million square feet of space in 70 commercial buildings and 280 houses that had been officers' quarters, and build about 6.5 million square feet of new commercial space.
The state and Federal governments will provide about half the financing and private developers are expected to arrange about $750 million worth, Mr. Hogan said.
Since last autumn, the state has offered low prices to entice the first developers and tenants. Taxes have been cut to 35 cents a square foot from 40 cents. Rents including taxes are $2.30 to $8 a square foot, and land has been sold for $20,000 an acre, about half price, Mr. Hogan said.
This year, 1.2 million square feet of construction, valued at about $127 million, is scheduled to begin.
Two Federal projects are already under construction: a $75 million, 400,000-square-foot prison hospital and a $20 million, 176,000-square-foot residential job training institute.
Last week, old buildings were demolished on the 25-acre site of the $18 million Gillette warehouse. The developer, the Campanelli Companies of Braintree, will close on the land by the end of May and start construction then.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Calls the Fed 'Extraordinarily Well Run'

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Responding to a Congressional report that was critical of the Federal Reserve's management of its finances, Alan Greenspan today defended his record as chairman of the central bank at a Senate hearing on his nomination to a third term, calling the Federal Reserve "an extraordinarily well-run organization."
On a day in which the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged, Mr. Greenspan also gave a relatively upbeat though brief assessment of the economy, saying it was operating at a "reasonably good clip" with unemployment "lower than it's been at any time in the recent past." 
And Mr. Greenspan, a strong advocate of making inflation the Federal Reserve's overriding concern, heard President Clinton's nominees to two vacant Federal Reserve seats say that while price stability would be their top priority, they would also focus on jobs and economic growth. President Clinton and many other Democrats have questioned whether the Federal Reserve, by fighting inflation so aggressively in recent years, has kept the economy from growing at its full capacity.
Mr. Greenspan and the two other nominees to the seven-member Federal Reserve Board, Alice M. Rivlin, the White House budget director, and Laurence B. Meyer, a prominent economist at Washington University in St. Louis, were all praised by Republicans and Democrats alike on the committee, and seemed assured of confirmation.
But Mr. Greenspan, who is normally treated with considerable deference when he appears before Congress, came in for sharper-than-usual questioning about the Congressional report on the Federal Reserve, which was compiled over the last two years by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office and issued Monday by two Democratic Senators, Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Harry Reid of Nevada.
The Senators have both sought ways to require more accountability from the Federal Reserve, which at its founding in 1913 was granted the freedom to operate with no direct oversight from Congress as a means of insuring its independence in setting interest-rate policy. Although Mr. Dorgan acknowledged he was critical of monetary policy under Mr. Greenspan, both Senators said their intention in releasing the draft report one day before Mr. Greenspan's confirmation hearing was to promote debate on how better to monitor the nonmonetary policy aspects of the Federal Reserve's activities.
The report said that the Federal Reserve had not kept sufficiently tight control over its expenses, which grew at twice the rate of inflation from 1988 to 1994. It questioned the need for a $3.7 billion contingency fund amassed by the Federal Reserve. And it urged the Federal Reserve to undertake a sweeping re-examination of its structure and mission.
While strongly opposing any attempt to restrict the Federal Reserve's independence in monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Reserve, like any organization, could learn things from outside evaluations, and that the G.A.O. report had some valuable suggestions.
But he said the overall tone of the report, in portraying the Federal Reserve as lax in imposing budget discipline, was wrong. The Federal Reserve does not receive appropriations from Congress. Instead, it finances its operations itself with the interest it receives on Treasury securities held by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and with the fees it charges banks. It sets its own budgets and returns to the Treasury each year the difference between its revenues and its expenses, an amount typically in the range of $20 billion.
"My experience with the Federal Reserve in a little over eight years has led me to conclude that this is an extraordinarily well-run organization," Mr. Greenspan said.
The G.A.O. report "has a number of useful things and indeed I commend them for some of their insights," Mr. Greenspan said. "Nonetheless, the general thrust of the report that somehow the Federal Reserve has been profligate in the use of taxpayer funds, I find wholly contrary to the facts."
Mr. Greenspan said much of the rise in personnel costs, for example, resulted from a shift in the composition of the Federal Reserve's work force. The Federal Reserve's employees, he said, had turned during the period from traditional tasks like check clearing to regulating an ever-more complex financial world during a period that included the savings and loan crisis, rapid consolidation among banks and an increase in the interdependence in the global economy.
"Unless we are extremely scrupulous in our budget activities, there is nobody beyond us to protect the taxpayer," Mr. Greenspan said. "As a consequence of that, certainly since I've been there and from what I can judge with my predecessors as well, we have been extraordinarily concerned about what our budgets look like. I have been working very hard to restrain the budget, as all of my colleagues have."
A separate report by the G.A.O. of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas also found weaknesses in the bank's accounting procedures. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, said he was seeking hearings on the Federal Reserve's operations.
Mr. Greenspan testified after a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. The committee's decision not to change interest rates had been widely expected after a spate of data suggesting that the economy, while hardly robust, was growing at a sufficient rate that it did not currently need the stimulus of lower interest rates. The committee is to meet again on May 21.
At today's Senate hearing, the primary topic of debate after the Congressional report was the extent to which the Federal Reserve should concentrate on defeating inflation rather than giving equal weight to its other mandated tasks of promoting full employment and maximum sustainable growth.
"The single most important thing in the long run is protecting the value of the dollar, price stability, containing inflation," Mr. Meyer said. But he added that he did not view his duties as a Federal Reserve governor ending there.
"I care deeply about whether or not this economy is at full employment," he said.
Ms. Rivlin was less outspoken on the subject, but suggested that inflation was part of a mix of factors to be considered in setting short-term interest rates.
"The goal of economic policy, of monetary policy, fiscal policy, all other kinds of policy, should be the maximum sustainable rate of growth in the economy," she said. "There are several things that could make growth unsustainable. One of them, obviously, is inflation."

HEADLINE: With Plenty of Jobs, Nebraska Goes to Lengths to Lure Skilled Labor

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: OMAHA, Neb.

 BODY:
Laurianne Kobzeff squealed with delight as dollar bills and discount coupons swirled around her in the plexiglass booth known as the "Money Machine." Before her 14-second stint ended she had scooped up $32 as a job bonus, breaking two nails in the frenzy.
It was all in a day's work because Ms. Kobzeff, a telemarketer from California, decided that her work would be in Nebraska, a state whose record employment levels have added a new dimension, and appeal, to the notion of migrant labor. 
 Actually, Nebraska's annual unemployment rate has been the lowest in the nation for the last three years, a result of flat population growth that has left the number of Nebraskans hovering around 1.3 million since World War II and a robust economy in which industries like telemarketing, food and data processing are expanding. Last year, an average of 2.3 percent of adult Nebraskans were jobless, less than half the national average of 5.5 percent.
Such stratospheric levels of gainful employment have left employee-starved businesses here fighting over workers the way most companies fight over customers.
Their targets are skilled laborers from out of state and youths at home who are new to the job market.
Their recruitment techniques are varied, sometimes novel: CD-ROMs and Internet Web sites proclaiming the attractions of life in Nebraska and in Omaha, its largest city; toll-free job-lines through which potential workers can dictate job applications, and bounties paid to anyone who brings 'em back alive. Then there is the flying Omaha job booth, which roams the nation, following news of major corporate layoffs in an effort to scoop up the newly unemployed and redeploy them here.
"I came out here because the job market was good, unemployment was low," said Ms. Kobzeff, 31, pulling dollar bills from under her fuschia sweater. It did not hurt to have half a dozen telemarketing companies offering lucrative employment packages and benefits.
To an extent Nebraska, and indeed, the entire Midwestern Plains region, which has a chronically low jobless rate, is living through the sequel to the farm crisis of the early 1980's. When family farms failed, people abandoned the region. With the economy growing again, Nebraska is finding itself short-handed.
"For plants, employees are the fuel," said Ernest Goss, who moved from Georgia to teach economics at Creighton University, a private college here. "We've depopulated the rural areas. Now, we are out of fuel."
Replenishing the supply has been difficult. Many of the state's young people have left for climes warmer than Nebraska and cities bigger than Omaha. In the late 1980's, net migration deprived the state of 5 percent of its residents in their 20's, about 10,000 people, according to the University of Nebraska's Center for Public Affairs Research.
Nebraska only recently started to reverse these trends. Over the last five years, the state's population increased 3.7 percent.
But still, too few Laurianne Kobzeffs are abandoning the nation's coasts for its center. In Nebraska, wages are higher while living costs and crime rates are lower than the national averages. But modern American migrants are holding out for beaches, mountains and big-city cultural attractions.
Recruiting employees "is a struggle for all of us in Omaha," said Rodger Jensen, personnel director for Miss Kobzeff's employer, Oriental Trading Company.
The weather -- brutal, according to the National Weather Service in Omaha, which logged 46 snow days and 8 days with sub-zero temperatures last year -- has not helped. The average temperature for December, January and February over the last 30 years was 24 degrees, the Weather Service said.
"It's easy to get people to move from North to South," said Peggy Noll, vice president of the Noll employment agency here, but the reverse is hard.
Help wanted advertising has increased 59 percent since 1993 at The Omaha World-Herald, the largest selling newspaper. "Three years ago, you could go to work for Wendy's for $5 an hour," said Dale Harris, the classified advertising manager. "Now you get $7 to $8 an hour, plus some incentives."
With the Money Machine passe after a year, Mr. Jensen plans to fill $6.50-an-hour positions at his catalogue company by setting up mobile booths at local shopping centers to recruit workers.
Advertising on television for employees is only a first step for Nebraska Furniture Mart, a mammoth housewares mall that employs 1,100 people. The company begs for workers through billboards, banners, credit card bills, sales slips and posters placed in churches.
When the mart has a major furniture sale, customers are channeled past job booths staffed with interviewers. A job-line (402-255-MART) allows job hunters to tap a list of openings, then dictate their applications.
"For people jumping ship, we want to make it as convenient to fill out an application as possible," said Ruth McCully, the company's promotions coordinator.
Furniture Mart and other companies are even turning employees into headhunters, paying cash bonuses for each referral hired. For more competitive professions, like systems analyst, companies pay hiring bonuses as high as $5,000.
"Raiding companies will offer 50 percent raises if you go work for them," said Jan Isom, information systems recruiting manager for Noll. "Then, the employers come back with counteroffers: more money, new job titles, bonuses, free parking, an extra week of vacation."
Half the 3,000 local companies polled last December by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce said they planned to increase employment through 1997. The labor market here is expected to tighten, pushing up the average Nebraskan's income $1,000 a year through 1997, Mr. Goss, the economist said.
In the last five years, salaries for carpenters, plumbers and electricians have increased by 5 percent a year, hitting the national average last year of $40,000. This spring, labor shortages are stretching construction times by one-third.
Another of the state's attractions is the cost of living, about 8 percent below the national average. "When I moved here from New Jersey, the housing market seemed like a candy store," Ms. Isom said. A decade ago, she said, she traded a three-bedroom house in New Jersey for a four-bedroom house in Omaha for roughly the same price, $200,000.
To lure workers, Bob Bell, president of the local chamber of commerce, talks of "mining California" and "ambulance chasing" after company layoffs in New York.
Mounted at job fairs, the traveling "Omaha" booth offers company information, a CD-ROM on the delights of Omaha, free tickets to Omaha arts events and copies of The Sunday World-Herald's help wanted section. CareerLink, a Web site offers information about technical jobs in Omaha.
For executives moving here, the chamber offers a package of free tickets to Omaha's symphony, ballet, opera and playhouse.
To keep young Nebraskans here, companies work with high schools to match training with job needs. Aiming at college students, the Labor Availability Council, a business group, holds a job fair during the Christmas holidays.
Every year, the council identifies 12 top performing high school seniors. Once in college, these young Nebraskans are flown to Omaha free of charge for a weekend of wining and dining with local executives.
While some Americans snub Nebraska as "Cornville," the term does not seem to have been translated into Spanish. Last year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested 704 illegal aliens in Nebraska -- double the number of the year before. Many of the illegal Mexicans seek work in the low-wage, nonunion beef packing plants that have opened in the state's interior in recent years.
In many of the nation's cities, the state unemployment office can be an abused building, frequented by lines of sullen people facing equally sullen bureaucrats. In Omaha, a visitor is greeted by wall-to-wall carpeting, hushed tones, and an invitation to talk in a semi-private cubicle with a job placement adviser.
Nebraska pays a maximum of $184 a week for an unemployment claim -- the 45th lowest level in the nation. A proposal to raise the maximum to $261 by the end of 1998, provoked The World-Herald last week to warn: "Too much too soon."
Judging by interviews on a recent morning, most of Omaha's unemployed see the center as a free employment agency. "I'll have a job in a month," John Falck, a 42-year-old computer hardware worker predicted confidently as he left the center.
Shelly Sullivan, a 27-year-old home care helper, was working at two jobs. But she stopped by the office to see if she could land a better paying one.
Asked if it was hard to find work, this Nebraska native laughed. "If someone doesn't have a job in Omaha," she said, "they don't want one."

HEADLINE: The Master Builder of Malaysia;
He Thrives With a Little Help From His Friends

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
It isn't often that across-the-board rejection by swaggering American and European investment banks warms a developer's heart. But Francis Yeoh Sock Ping acts as if it is the best thing that has ever happened.
Refusing to capitulate to the foreign bankers' terms for financing his 1,200-megawatt power project, Mr. Yeoh (pronounced YEOW) instead found a way to borrow the $1.1 billion through Malaysian institutions. As a result, he said, he saved the project money and provided power for 25 percent less. 
 "You should use resources from your own country," Mr. Yeoh said. "The net result is better for the people."
Such self-reliance, shot through with a strong dose of nationalism, is a hallmark of Mr. Yeoh, who heads one of Malaysia's largest project-development conglomerates, the YTL Corporation. With interests in power projects, property development, manufacturing and hotels and resorts, the company, named for Yeoh Tiong Lay, Mr. Yeoh's father, is at the heart of Malaysia's economic boom.
In his climb to the top ranks of Malaysia's corporate giants, Mr. Yeoh has weathered restrictive government policies, cold shoulders from global banks and the threat of guerrilla war and has earned a reputation as an innovative and risk-defying tycoon. Despite being an ethnic Chinese Christian in a predominantly Muslim, Malay chauvinist state, he has managed to thrive. Indeed, like virtually every successful corporate heavyweight here, he is a familiar presence in the halls of political power, and is an intimate of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
That symbiosis of political power and entrepreneurial energy is a phenomenon that has spread through much of Southeast Asia and helps explain the region's economic dynamism. While acknowledging the potential for corruption, some analysts say that such alliances of mutual advantage are well suited to Asia's authoritarian tradition.
Governments in the area rarely live up to the human-rights ideals espoused by the United States and Europe, but they embrace Western-style capitalism with passion.
Indeed, many Southeast Asian politicians view the success of their business proteges as the key to holding power. In Indonesia, for example, the Suharto family's involvement in government contracts and concessions is blamed for increasing the cost of goods and services and delaying projects. Meantime, the relationship between the Indonesian military and the country's leading ethnic Chinese businessmen has benefited both parties, giving the generals access to capital and the capitalists protection against the threat of anti-Chinese violence.
Jim Rohwer, the chief economist at CS First Boston in Hong Kong, said that while cronyism flourishes throughout much of Southeast Asia, "it is very hard to take the position it has held these countries back." He added, "If it doesn't go too far, it can act as a lubricant for the economy."
Mr. Yeoh, though worth more than $2 billion, is more of a foothill next to some of Malaysia's Everests of tycoons. Robert Kuok's vast holdings in Malaysia and across Asia -- hotels, newspapers, real estate, commodity trading, plantations, wood processing -- had their roots in a small grocery store begun by his father, an immigrant from China's Fujian province. Today, he is one of the globe's wealthiest men.
Likewise, Quek Leng Chan, head of a vast conglomerate including steel, motorcycle manufacturing and banking, comes from a family that migrated from Fujian to Singapore and Malaysia in the 1920's.
Nevertheless, the growth of Mr. Yeoh's business empire shows how fast even the lowliest entrepreneurs can rise if they learn how to pull the right levers. YTL originated as a small construction company started by his grandfather, who fled to Malaysia from China as the flames of World War II were dying down.
The founder's son, Yeoh Tiong Lay, wrangled the first significant contracts for the tiny company in 1955 to build ammunition depots and garrisons for the British colonial army. Two years later, when Malaysia gained independence, YTL continued building army compounds while expanding into other areas.
When anti-Chinese riots swept Malaysia in 1969, the elder Mr. Yeoh kept a low profile and kept building even as the Government enacted laws to grant special economic and social benefits to the native Malays.
"My grandfather came here and was willing to stick with it," said Mr. Yeoh, 42. "We rode the storm until we became what we are today."
Slouched in a brass-studded, burgundy leather chair and wearing a crisp gray suit, Mr. Yeoh presents a sartorial vision of conservatism. But he waves aside suggestions that favoritism is corrupting him or Malaysia's economic performance.
"In Malaysia, businessmen and Government work hand in hand, and it seems to smack of crony capitalism," he said. But in reality, he said, "the Government must choose performance, people who have a good track record." As for excluding big foreign companies from some big Malaysian construction projects, he said, in some cases the Government has no choice because against such deep-pocketed competition, "Malaysians would never have a chance to do it themselves."
Perhaps no other project solidified Mr. Yeoh's position as the building and financing of two power plants in the towns of Paka and Pasir Gudang on the Malay Peninsula. Two years ago, with Malaysia facing serious power shortages, the Government turned to the private sector for a solution. But, as in much of the privatization process here, there was no bidding. The first two licenses were handed to Mr. Yeoh's company, an act of favoritism that angered some critics of the Government.
His defenders point out that Mr. Yeoh completed the power stations, both of which began operating late last year, seven months ahead of schedule. "It's a very well-run company," said Lucy Chuah, the deputy head of research at TA Securities here. "Francis will tell you he'll be the next G.E." Of course, she added, "People see he's very well connected to Mahathir," the Prime Minister.
Getting the power permits was no guarantee that YTL could find financing for the $1.1 billion project, designed to supply 15 percent of the country's power needs. First, Mr. Yeoh turned to international partners and bankers. It was sobering.
"They would not give any loan beyond 10 years because of Malaysia's political risk. This was 1993. Can you imagine? I have a wall in front of me. I want a 15-year loan, and I get stopped at 10. It's a nonstarter from day one. So that didn't work. And thank God for that."
Though local capital markets had never entered the complex arena of project finance, Mr. Yeoh persuaded the state-run Employee Provident Fund, a social security savings fund, to lend the entire amount for 15 years at 10 percent, a substantially lower interest rate than the banks had proposed. His main negotiating weapon with fund managers was an agreement he had wrung from the state power utility to buy nearly three-quarters of YTL's power, whether or not the utility needed it.
Because of the lower interest rates, Mr. Yeoh said that he could produce power at 6 cents a kilowatt- hour, 2 cents less than projects elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
YTL's bottom line shows the results of Mr. Yeoh's negotiating skills. Profits for the fiscal year ended June 30 were more than 160 percent above those of a year earlier, rising to 273.5 million ringgit, or $112 million under exchange rates at the time, from 104 million ringgit, or $40 million, a year earlier. Sales in 1995 were 1.03 billion ringgit, or nearly $421 million. The Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, on which YTL was listed in 1985, values the company at $2.3 billion, of which the Yeoh family controls 49 percent.
In recent years, as Malaysia's economy has boomed, YTL has prospered by winning a steady stream of government contracts, ranging from a low-cost housing and commercial development in Ipoh and a million-ton cement plant in BukitSagu to a luxury condominium project in Johor and one of Asia's grandest resorts, in Pangkor Laut.
"There's no real tendering on key projects," an economist for a foreign bank said. "Mahathir sits on a committee for key projects. If he thinks you can deliver, he gives it to you."
Having established YTL's links to power, Mr. Yeoh, as managing director, has widened the company's reach, recently expanding into exclusive resorts. He began a super-luxury train service from Singapore to Bangkok -- the Eastern and Orient Express -- which trundles at a leisurely pace up the peninsula.
Now, he is scouting investment opportunities in Cambodia. That nation may be hurtling away from democracy, with press freedom stifled, the justice system in shambles and fire-fights flaring between Government troops and Khmer Rouge rebels, but Mr. Yeoh actually thinks things are looking up.
"How much worse can it get than the killing fields?" he asks.
Mr. Yeoh especially sees the tourism potential in the Angkor Wat ruins, which date from the 10th century and spread over nearly 70 square miles.
Last October, he won a 99-year lease from the Cambodian Government to develop 2,700 acres near the most spectacular complex of the Angkor temples. There, in the drowsy town of Siem Reap, he will invest $80 million of his own money.
"This is a phenomenal site," he said. "This is not the artificial castles of Disneyland. It's a U.N. world heritage site. I can bring all the great hotels and create a beautiful archeo-econological tourism product. No gambling. No go-go dancing. If I can do that, and it's a challenge, the world will come."

HEADLINE: Oil and Technology Stocks Lead Modest Rise in Market

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market rose broadly yesterday, helped by a recovery in technology issues and a surge in oil shares.
The gains came on a day when Federal Reserve policy makers left short-term interest rates unchanged, as expected. 
 "The Federal Open Market Committee came through exactly as expected," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers. "It was a day of marking time."
The Dow Jones industrial average increased 26.74 points, to 5,670.60. The advance was led by I.B.M., which gained 2, to 110 3/4, after falling 5 1/2 on Monday. Increases in the shares of Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies also drove the Dow, as investors bet that a recent rise in the price of crude oil would lift the companies' earnings.
Among the broader market gauges, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks advanced 2.93 points, to 652.97, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.26 points, to 1,088.35.
Advances narrowly outnumbered declines, 1,235 to 1,116, on the New York Stock Exchange. The volume on the Big Board rose to 404.3 million shares, from 337.1 million shares on Monday.
With yesterday's activity, the total value of issues traded this year on the Big Board has exceeded $1 trillion -- the earliest that this mark has been topped in any year. The $1 trillion level was reached 32 trading days later last year.
The shares of many computer and software companies recovered from declines that had followed an article in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that raised concerns that corporate demand for their products was weakening. Intel rose 1 15/64, to 56 1/8, and Microsoft gained 2 7/8, to 102 3/4.
Among the rising oil stocks, Exxon advanced 2 3/8, to 86; Chevron rose 1 1/4, to 57 1/8, and ARCO increased 2 1/2, to 118 3/4. Triton Energy, which announced a major oil discovery in Colombia, climbed 8 1/4, to 59 3/4.
Drug stocks rose amid speculation that Glaxo Wellcome would merge with Pfizer. The American depository receipts of Glaxo rose 5/8, to 25 1/2, while Pfizer gained 1, to 68 3/4. Each A.D.R. of Glaxo represents two shares of the company, which is based in Britain. Other gainers included Warner-Lambert, up 1 3/8, to 105 5/8, and Merck, up 1 5/8, to 64 1/8.
The shares of gold companies also moved upward, in keeping with the advance in the price of the metal. Barrick closed at 31 1/2, up 1 1/4; Placer Dome closed at 29 3/8, up 1, and Newmont Mining closed at 59 3/4, up 2 5/8. The Standard & Poor's gold index jumped 2.93 points, to 652.97.
But retail stocks dropped after the Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim sales report was released, showing that volume at stores open at least a year declined 1 percent last week. J. C. Penney closed at 49 3/8, down 1 5/8; Nordstrom closed at 45 7/8, down 2 5/8; May Department Stores closed at 48 1/8, down 1 5/8, and Mercantile Stores closed at 61 1/4, down 1.
The shares of computer networking companies also turned lower, after Compaq Computer introduced a line of computer networking equipment. Bay Networks dropped 4 1/2, to 28 1/2; Newbridge Networks slid 5/8, to 49 1/2, and Cabletron Systems fell 1 3/8, to 66 1/2.
Lund International, which warned that its revenue in the most recent quarter would be lower than expected, declined 1 5/8, to 11 7/8. And Progress Software, which said that earnings in the first quarter would not meet Wall Street expectations, fell 5 1/16, to 14 15/16.

HEADLINE: Wireless Bidder Drops His Push

 BODY:
John Dolan, who bid more than $900 million in the Federal Government's auction for new wireless communications licenses, dropped out of the competition yesterday, saying the bidding had gone too high.
Mr. Dolan, the nephew of Charles F. Dolan, the cable television billionaire, said he had been outbid by Nextwave Communications for a license to serve the New York area. Nextwave bid $994 million.
Mr. Dolan had been the most surprising figure in an auction in which prices offered for wireless telephone licenses soared far higher than industry executives had seen before. He had focused virtually his entire effort on New York, bidding $936 million and fending off rivals.
Mr. Dolan also generated controversy. Nextwave, which is based in San Diego, asserted that his company, North Coast Mobile Communications Inc. of Huntington, L.I., was a possible front for his uncle's company, the Cablevision Systems Corporation of Woodbury, L.I. 
 In a statement announcing his decision, Mr. Dolan said, "After counseling with Charles Dolan and other financial sources, we have concluded that the bidding had reached a level of speculative excess which we could not economically support."

HEADLINE: In a U.N. Success Story, Guatemalan Abuses Fall

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: FINCA LOS CERROS, Guatemala

 BODY:
One afternoon not long ago, dozens of farm workers faced off against a platoon of military policemen in the cool coffee groves of this mountainside plantation in a tense labor dispute.
The police never fired their rifles. United Nations human rights observers arrived in the midst of the showdown and persuaded the police to leave and the coffee pickers to lay down their machetes. Unlike many similar confrontations in Guatemala in the last three decades, the episode ended without killing. 
 Worldwide, the prestige of the United Nations as a peacemaker is at an ebb. It is practically broke and fighting to recover from costly failures in Bosnia and Somalia. In the United States, many conservatives are calling for ending support of an organization that they say is spendthrift and ineffective.
But in Guatemala the United Nations has made a big difference, becoming the catalyst for a new tolerance for political dissent and protest about human rights violations. For the first time in a 34-year conflict in which more than 100,000 people have been killed, the United Nations is providing a neutral place where Guatemalans can go to recount the abuses they have suffered.
United Nations negotiators in two-year-old peace talks here have also been coaxing the Government and guerrillas toward a final armistice. [In a reflection of the optimism both sides feel about progress in the talks, the rebels on March 20 declared a temporary cease-fire, which the Government joined the next day.]
At the same time, the presence of United Nations observers in faraway corners like this coffee farm in western Guatemala has defused explosive situations and averted violence by the security forces.
The United Nations was called into Guatemala in November 1994 to monitor compliance with a partial peace accord in which the two sides committed themselves to improving respect for human rights. The United Nations mission here costs $20 million a year and has a staff of 416, including 50 police advisers, from 39 countries.
The United Nations is succeeding in Guatemala because it has not tried to do too much. It has not tried to impose peace or serve as a shadow government, as it did in Somalia. And in contrast to its role in Bosnia, it came to Guatemala with no peacekeeping troops at a moment when the people had shown they were ready for a change from war.
Over time, more and more Guatemalans have come to consider the United Nations office a sort of haven where they can report rights violations and even personal problems like neighborhood feuds. According to a Feb. 24 report, the mission received nearly 3,000 complaints between August and December 1995. The people found in the simple United Nations waiting rooms range from journalists threatened because of their reports to Indian farmers who need their stories translated into Spanish.
The violations are summarized in blunt quarterly reports that speak loudly in a country where many military commanders still regard the pursuit of human rights as an enemy act.
The United Nations has said the army is harboring car-theft and kidnapping gangs in its barracks, something Guatemalans knew but were terrified to say. Emboldened by the United Nations reports, the Guatemalan press has begun to investigate military corruption.
"We made it possible to say inside Guatemala what everyone was saying outside Guatemala," said Cecilia Olmos, a Chilean who heads the United Nations operations in Quetzaltenango, a western city.
Rodrigo Asturias, the commander of one rebel faction, said in an interview in Mexico City: "Three years ago, human rights was a subversive topic -- you could be killed for mentioning it. The United Nations turned it into a priority topic on the national agenda."
After the United Nations criticized the army for dragooning young men into its ranks at gunpoint off streets and buses, forced conscription stopped. In response to United Nations demands, the guerrillas ceased bombing bridges and the electrical grid.
United Nations officials regularly communicate with and often see military commanders on both sides, a change from years when Guatemalans were slain by Government forces simply on the suspicion that they had contact with the rebels. Ms. Olmos, while teaching human rights classes to army cadets, has traveled to the secret mountain stronghold of Mr. Asturias's guerrilla forces.
Political killings have decreased since the mission arrived. But gross abuses still occur, and the United Nations has no power to punish the offenders. United Nations officials acknowledge that most abuses in their reports have not been investigated or prosecuted by Guatemalan authorities.
"Impunity is the swamp that swallows everything in this country," said the head of the United Nations mission, Leonardo Franco of Argentina. "We have created a large opening for expression. But we haven't had an effect yet in the daily lives of the victims."
Last Oct. 5 a massacre took place that could have put the mission's effectiveness into doubt. Eleven Indian peasants were gunned down by soldiers in a refugee resettlement camp called Xaman in the rain forest in central Guatemala.
Instead, the killings showed how the United Nations could be useful. The army immediately asserted that the Indians were armed and had attacked first. But within two hours, while the bodies were still strewn about the camp, United Nations observers reached Xaman.
"At first the people were stunned and couldn't say anything," said Goran Fejic, an exiled Bosnian who is the United Nations official in charge of the region where the massacre took place. "We stayed and waited."
But the United Nations observers determined that the villagers had no weapons. They airlifted the wounded to a hospital in Guatemala City, where they talked to the press the same day, breaking the usual silence that surrounds such incidents.
On Oct. 10 the United Nations issued a report debunking the military version. The Defense Minister, Gen. Mario Enriquez, resigned.
Conflicts like the one at Finca Los Cerros remain difficult for the United Nations. The plantation changed hands several years ago and a new absentee landowner is seeking to drive 80 coffee pickers and their families off the farm. But they were born on the plantation and worked all their lives here. They came to the brink of violence out of frustration after local judicial authorities consistently favored the landowner.
"We have a deep feeling that we don't want to leave," said Julio Cesar Archila Miranda, the secretary general of a union the coffee pickers tried to form.
The United Nations has no mandate to intervene in land struggles. But its officials could respond to calls from both the police and the farm workers to come to the scene of a clash on Feb. 13. In a sign that the United Nations has persuaded Guatemalans of its neutral protection, the farm manager -- the man most hated by the laborers -- wrapped himself for several hours around a United Nations observer, Kenneth Ward, an American, to shield himself from attack by the peasants while the United Nations officials were calming things down.
United Nations officials also organized negotiations in the capital to resolve the issue. And Nelida Augier, the United Nations observer from Argentina who handled the case, did not back down in response to pressure by local officials. "This problem just shows how justice works faster here for economic powers than for workers," she said.
But the ultimate test for the United Nations is whether it can bring a long overdue peace. The talks wandered, then gained new momentum when President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen took office in January. In February he became the first President to meet with rebel leaders since the fighting began.
"We couldn't have kept it alive among Guatemalans," Mr. Asturias said. "Without the persistence of the United Nations the peace process would have been impossible."

Greenspan Defends Fed As Its Efficiency Is Assailed
Alan Greenspan defended the Federal Reserve against criticism of the management of its finances by the General Accounting Office of Congress. At a hearing on his nomination to a third term as chairman, he called the Fed "an extraordinarily well-run organization." On a day that the Fed's policy committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged, Mr. Greenspan also gave a relatively upbeat if brief assessment of the economy, saying it was operating at a "reasonably good clip."
Mr. Greenspan and the two other nominees to the board, Alice M. Rivlin and Laurence B. Meyer, were praised by Republicans and Democrats. [Page D4.]
 
Dole Blocks Higher Minimum Pay
Senator Bob Dole blocked a Democratic effort to vote on raising the minimum wage, to $5.15 an hour from $4.25. Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been promising to offer the wage increase as an amendment to some bill for several weeks, and got his chance. Mr. Dole, the apparent Republican nominee for President, said a raise would cost many young people their jobs. [A1.]
 
$3 Trillion in Mutual Funds
 For the first time, the value of mutual funds has exceeded $3 trillion, a trade group said. But the headlong rush by investors into stock funds seems to be slowing, if only a bit. After two record-breaking months, during which investors poured $50.8 billion into stock funds, some fund managers say the flows have ebbed in March. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D8.]
 
Consumer Confidence Is Steady
Consumer confidence was generally steady in March after a sharp rise in February, the Conference Board reported. One economist said: "We did not give back any of the bounce we saw in February. It suggests the economy is holding up fine." [D4.]
 
Chrysler Sues Class-Action Lawyers
Chrysler entered suits against lawyers in Seattle and St. Louis, saying they had filed frivolous class-action lawsuits. [A14.]
 
Change Stirs Cellular Industry
Cellular phone companies are coming off another year of soaring revenues, but changes are in the air, as shown by Sprint's success in Washington. In just three months, it lined up 60,000 customers for a new type of wireless services. Sprint offers free features, including caller ID and voice mail. [D2.]
 
Technology Stocks Improve
Stocks rose, helped by something of an improvement in technology issues and a surge in oil shares. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 26.74 points, to 5,670.60, led by I.B.M., which gained 2, and Exxon, which rose 2 3/8. [D8.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in thin trading as the Federal Reserve's policy committee met without changing interest rates. [D18.]
 
Hilton Expands Guest Plan
The Hilton Hotels' frequent-guest program allows travelers to exchange hotel points for airline miles and miles for points, and to transfer mileage from one airline program to another. And now it has become even more flexible, adding Trans World Airlines and Midwest Express to its roster of partners. Business Travel. [D5.]
 
Tobacco Lobby Fights New York City
The tobacco and restaurant lobbies are again active in Albany, pushing for a weaker statewide smoking law that would override New York City's strict limits on smoking in restaurants. [B6.]
 
John Hancock's New Pitch
John Hancock, after a decade of offering what was described as "real answers" for "real life," will now tackle a real challenge: persuading consumers to sign their own John Hancocks to fewer credit-card receipts and more investment contracts. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]
 
Wheat Futures Soar
Wheat futures soared amid concern that a five-month drought affecting winter wheat fields was unlikely to ease soon. [D15.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE HOMETOWN;
With Dole Rising, His Hometown Looks Ahead

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RUSSELL, Kan., March 26

 BODY:
For Bob Dole, it is a point of pride that he has not used his influence in Washington to bring home the bacon.
"That speaks well for me," Senator Dole said yesterday as he flew here for a brief visit to his hometown, on the eve of a California primary victory that would give him the Republican Presidential nomination. "I don't deal in pork. I represent Kansas." 
 This town of 4,800 can attest to that. Aside from the farm subsidies that all such areas receive, Washington largesse is as nonexistent here as it is bountiful in, say, West Virginia, where just about every major highway and many Government buildings are named for the man often called the Senate's King of Pork, Robert C. Byrd.
Here, apart from the multitude of promotional signs for Mr. Dole's candidacy, and a landmark grain elevator that has his name painted on the side, the only official nod to him is a small, two-block lane that the City Council renamed Bob Dole Drive last year -- and not because he provided any money for it. It runs by the V.F.W. hall, which raised cash in cigar boxes a half-century ago for Mr. Dole's medical care when he returned wounded from World War II. Mr. Dole does not even maintain an office here.
But now, with Russell's favorite son the inevitable Republican nominee for President, many people here are hoping that his prominence, not to mention his election in November, will spark the economy in this 19th Century town whose population peaked at 6,700 in the mid-1950's.
Russell is already talking about a Dole Presidential library, a complex that could provide for Russell the kind of economic miracle that the Dwight D. Eisenhower library provided for Abilene, 110 miles to the east, one of the biggest tourist draws in the state.
A library might seem like an odd tribute to Mr. Dole, who frequently notes that he was never much of a student. Talking the other day about his best friend in childhood, Phil Ruppenthall, who died many years ago, Mr. Dole said, "I think he read every book in the Russell Library. And I watched him."
But a hometown library is now de rigueur for modern American Presidents, and people here, most of whom revere Mr. Dole and do not see how President Clinton could possibly beat him, are starting to count the benefits.
"There would be one more Presidential library in the state of Kansas, and tourism would jump," said Daron Woelk, who helps run his family's jewelry store on Main Street. Mr. Woelk, 31, is an exception to the rule in Russell, where most young people leave to find work. He said that of the 92 students who graduated with him from Russell High School in 1983, only a third still lived here.
The three biggest employers in Russell are the governmental: the school district (with 270 people), the county government and the county hospital. The biggest private employer, King of the Road, which makes recreational vehicles, employs about 119 people.
Eugene Davidson, a chiropractor and chairman of the local Republican Party, suggested that having a Presidential library might set off a chain reaction, not only bringing in tourists but also prompting other businesses to notice the quality of the labor force here.
"People will sit up and look at the example we have in Bob Dole," he said. "We have a good work ethic, and if we're paid a dollar, we'll earn that dollar."
Russell's biggest selling points are the same ones that Mr. Dole touts about himself in his Presidential campaign -- basic values of honesty and decency and self-reliance, said Russell Townsley, 76, the former publisher of The Russell Daily News and Russell Record. Still, it is hard to compete with states that boast of water and mountains.
But with a Presidential library, he suggested, Russell could compete with Abilene. A couple of years ago, Russell Stover, the candy maker, which has no relation to the town, relocated in Abiline after considering Russell.
Simply being the home of a leading Presidential candidate has started to pay off, with tourists already dropping in off the two major roadways that intersect here, Interstate 70 and U.S. 281, which is a main route between Canada and Mexico.
"The most popular site is his home," said Susan NeuPoth Cadoret, director of the Russell Area Chamber of Commerce. "But you can't go in," she added. "It is his private residence and is not open to the public."
This is the one-story red-brick home at 1035 North Maple Street. Still attached to the garage is the homemade systemof pulleys and four rusting window weights, that Mr. Dole used a half-century ago to regain his strength as he recovered from his war wounds. The tiny house where he was born in 1923 was torn down several years ago after he rejected a offer of $17,000 for it.
With visions of a Presidential library already dancing in the heads of local business owners, the town elders are talking about research trips to Abilene, to Independence, Mo., home of former President Harry Truman, and to Hope, Ark., home of President Clinton.
"In our minds we're looking at them, and they may start doing some physical visits," said Ms. Cadoret. "You prepare for it. How did they handle it? What points do you like, which ones don't you like as far as how they deal with tourists and public attractions?"
Everett Dumler, 76, the former manager of the chamber, said he was hoping for a library but did not want to jinx Mr. Dole's campaign by talking about it too early. "And," he added, "we haven't picked out a site yet because someone would buy up the land."

Since most here do not see how he can lose in November, they are already talking about the economic lift a Dole Presidential Library would give the area. (Charlie Riedel for The New York Times)

 BODY:
He challenged residents to mow their lawns and clean their alleys, business leaders to create more jobs. He implored the District of Columbia Council to protect his summer jobs program, Congress to pass the District's 1996 appropriation bill.
In his first State of the City address since regaining office in 1994, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. deliveredan impassioned plea on Monday night that the nation's capital be protected from financial, physical and spiritual ruin. 
 But today, the head of the city's financial control board said in an interview that there was one crucial figure who was not doing his part to help the city recover: Mr. Barry.
"I saw promises and the reiteration of promises, but I don't see a display of any means of achieving them," Andrew F. Brimmer, the economist appointed by President Clinton last year to lead the District into financial stability, said in an interview today, referring to newspaper accounts of Mr. Barry's speech, which Mr. Brimmer did not attend. "Even when the Mayor makes substantial commitments, I don't see any determination to stick with them."
The speech was Mr. Barry's most wide-ranging assessment of the city since its financial ills became apparent. He hammered away at two themes, calling for more public service by citizens and less "District bashing" by critics. He also strived to convince listeners that even with the city's appropriation stalled in Congress, many of the steps to return the city to sound financial footing, including the cutting of thousands of government jobs, were well under way at his direction.
"Let me report," he said, "that this government has not just been standing around, waiting for a financial ambulance or cash transfusion. We have worked every day to meet our challenges with whatever resources, skills, friends or ingenuity we could find."
He also took pride in pointing out that the District had reduced spending this year by a record $151 million.
But Mr. Brimmer, whose board has authority over all fiscal matters and who has frequently expressed such concerns, said he was not yet convinced that Mr. Barry was earnest in his efforts to reach a balanced budget by 1999, as required by the law that created the five-member board. Mr. Brimmer said he felt that Mr. Barry, whose political success has largely been built upon job creation, was using the board "as a foil" to preserve his base by passing blame for tough decisions, like cutting jobs.
"I'm not optimistic," Mr. Brimmer said. "Some of my colleagues are more optimistic than I am. They believe there has been a major sea change in the Mayor's behavior. I do not see that sea change."
Mr. Brimmer cited several recent examples of actions by Mr. Barry that leave him unconvinced. One involved Mr. Barry's veto of a measure passed by the City Council that would have forced the school system to cut 1,500 jobs. Mr. Barry had previously supported the cuts but changed his mind under pressure from teacher unions and the National Education Association.
"That is the latest illustration of the Mayor's ambivalence," Mr. Brimmer said. "The lack of commitment to achieve these goals, I find that very troublesome."
Mr. Brimmer also cited Mr. Barry's comments to students from the University of the District of Columbia who blocked a major street for 14 hours, protesting a perceived cut in the school's budget.
Anthony Williams, city's chief financial officer who was appointed by Mr. Barry but is answerable only to the control board, notified all city agencies that had overspent their budgets, including the university, that 10 percent of their current appropriation would be held up until he was certain they would not overspend again.
In addressing the students, Mr. Barry told them to blame Mr. Williams, not school officials, for any cuts.
"That disappointed me," Mr. Brimmer said.
Beyond those incidents, Mr. Brimmer cited a variety of other issues that he said worried him, including Mr. Barry's proposed budget for 1997 that estimates an increase in overspending by $102 million, after a $54 million increase this year. Adding the carry-over debt of $335 million from Mr. Barry's predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, the new increase would leave the city with overall debt of $544 million by next year.
Mr. Brimmer said the city's indebtedness had grown to such an enormous problem that he almost daily encountered city contractors who plead with him to help them get their money.
"My voice mail at home is clogged with calls from contractors and vendors, telling me their difficulties with the city," he said, adding:.
"I can't accommodate any of them. I refer them to the chief financial officer. That's all I can do."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
California Voting Leaves Dole Claiming G.O.P. Nomination

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 26

 BODY:
Declaring that "we are now just one election away from restoring America's leadership," Senator Bob Dole today capped two dozen straight Republican primary victories with a triumph in California, the largest state of all, surveys of voters at the polls show.
"I am so confident that I am going to declare right now that I am the Republican nominee," Mr. Dole said flatly, repeating his now familiar ritual of a Tuesday night victory party in a Washington hotel ballroom. He proclaimed that he now had amassed enough delegates to propel him to the nomination. 
 With 24 percent of the vote tallied in California, the Kansas Senator had drawn 67 percent, crushing Patrick J. Buchanan by more than a 3-1 margin. Alan Keyes, a radio talk-show host, was well behind Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Dole also glided to resounding victories in primaries in Nevada and Washington. In Nevada, with all of the vote counted, the publisher Steve Forbes led Mr. Buchanan, 19 percent to 15 percent.
While Mr. Dole's victory was never in doubt, the apparently wide margins today reinforced the Senator's base in the state with by far the largest delegate prize, as well as the largest cache of electoral votes: 54. It is a state that White House officials say the President must carry to win re-election.
"The battle for the Republican nomination is over," Mr. Dole said. "And the battle for America's future is beginning tonight."
About 50 friends and family members were celebrating tonight in Mr. Dole's hometown of Russell, Kan. His daughter, Robin, addressed the group by speaker phone, saying, "I've never been so proud of my father."
By contrast, Mr. Buchanan looked downcast at a rally tonight in Costa Mesa, Calif., in Orange County. "We all have to concede a certain reality tonight," he said. "There is no doubt about it that Senator Dole is going to go over the top in terms of the delegate count." The crowd, about 250 people, started booing, but Mr. Buchanan continued: "He will be the Republican nominee, and we have to congratulate him on his victory."
But Mr. Buchanan repeated his pledge to press forward until the Republican National Convention in San Diego in August.
Mr. Dole's apparent victory led Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, to end months of neutrality and officially put the party apparatus behind the Senator. "As of today, the Republican National Committee will treat Senator Dole as our party's nominee," Mr. Barbour said in an interview. "We have up until now not taken sides because the nomination is determined by millions of Republican primary voters around the country."
The Dole campaign is nearly out of money, and the Republican Party plans to help the campaign endure the months before the party convention in August by paying for generic advertising and other costs.
Mr. Barbour also insisted that despite President Clinton's edge in polls here, the party would not abandon California in the fall, as did President George Bush's campaign four years ago. "The Bush campaign's decision to write off California was inexplicable and indefensible," he said. "The effect was that in 1992, we won fewer Congressional seats, fewer legislative seats and probably cost ourselves a United States Senate seat."
By prevailing in this winner-take-all state with 165 delegates -- "the big enchilada" -- Mr. Dole, the 72-year-old majority leader, was expected to move easily across the threshold of 996 needed for the nomination. Some news organizations had declared Mr. Dole the victor after last week's primaries in the Midwest.
But Mr. Dole waited until tonight to proclaim victory, in part because campaign officials wanted to generate whatever suspense they could in a primary process that has struck many Republicans as pointless since it became clear weeks ago that Mr. Dole would win.
Even though Mr. Dole celebrated tonight, he was preparing for trouble ahead. He made one last effort today to discourage Ross Perot not to stage a bid in November through his third-party organization, the Reform Party. "I would hope Ross Perot -- and I know him quite well -- understands that we are the reform party," Mr. Dole told reporters in Washington. "The Republican Party is the reform party."
The survey of voters leaving the polls today showed other worries for Mr. Dole. A third of the voters say they expect Mr. Dole to lose to Mr. Clinton in November. And most voters were not satisfied with the Republican field; more than half indicated that they would have liked to see someone else run.
In addition, many California Republicans are divided on controversial issues that could be important here in the general election. Almost three-fifths of the Republicans polled today favor doing away with affirmative-action programs entirely. Three in 10 would like to see those programs changed, and only one-eighth favor the idea of leaving affirmative action programs as they are now.
Republican voters in this state are also split on immigration. About half say that the United States should continue to welcome some immigrants. Four in 10 say the country cannot afford any new immigrants. Immigration ranked as a more important issue to Republicans in California than in other states. While almost 20 percent of Republicans here cited it as the issue that mattered most in their voting today, in many other states the issue was only cited by 4 or 5 percent of the voters.
Men and women in California have widely divergent views on the issue. Three-fifths of male voters endorse a policy of welcoming new immigrants, while more than half of the female voters say the country cannot afford new immigration.
Republican voters were also divided on trade. Almost half view foreign trade as beneficial to California. But nearly 4 in 10 consider it harmful.
As in other states, economic issues mattered most to the Republicans who voted today. The economy and jobs, taxes or the deficit were cited by more than half as the issue most affecting their vote. Half of the California voters say the standard of living for the average person will fall in the next 10 years, while almost as many say they expect it to rise.
Weighing in on Mr. Dole's quest for a running mate, more than half of the Republican voters say they would prefer Gen. Colin L. Powell, Gov. Pete Wilson of California or Dan Lungren, the state's Attorney General, but each drew the support of only one-sixth of the Republican voters. Republicans in the state are also split over whether the No. 2 spot on the ticket should go to a candidate who supports or opposes abortion.
The big news here this week was the Academy Awards, not the Presidential primary. Even Governor Wilson conceded that the voting today did not mean much. "I don't think it will have much bearing on what I expect to be a very hotly fought contest in California that will conclude with Bob Dole the victor," Mr. Wilson said in an interview.
The voting here marked the official end of a extraordinary year for Mr. Dole. A year ago, he viewed Senator Phil Gramm of Texas as his most formidable rival. But the road to the nomination has been far more complicated than that: Mr. Dole survived a possible bid by General Powell. Then he had to contend with Mr. Gramm, Mr. Buchanan and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, only to be faced by the most unexpected contender of all, Mr. Forbes, who showered the airwaves in important states with attack commercials about Mr. Dole.
Yet the Senator managed to turn things around quickly. Beginning with the South Carolina primary on March 2 and going into today's voting, Mr. Dole won 21 primaries.
Before the polls closed today, Mr. Buchanan told reporters that if Mr. Dole were to offer him the Vice Presidential slot, he would consider it "to unite all the disparate forces."
Mr. Barbour said he would not call on Mr. Buchanan to withdraw. Asked if he had plans to press Mr. Buchanan privately, he said, "Not that I want to announce in a newspaper."

HEADLINE: ON THE SET WITH/The 'Seinfeld' Steinbrenner;
The Head Yankee, Deconstructed

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

DATELINE: STUDIO CITY, Calif.

 BODY:
YANKEES fans may not always find George Steinbrenner a bundle of laughs, but a hefty slice of America does. For the last two years, a character in the guise of the Yankees' principal owner has emerged as one of the funnier aspects of "Seinfeld," the hit sitcom.
While the real George Steinbrenner -- known as The Boss to his minions and to tabloid headline writers -- spends most of his time barking orders from various command posts around the country, the "Seinfeld" Steinbrenner can usually be found behind a big desk in his imperial office in Yankee Stadium. He always sits with his back to a camera on the set on Stage Nine in the CBS Studio Center lot here, and neither the face nor the profile of the Top Banana is ever seen by viewers. 
 There is only his broad back, a large, graying head and the occasional manic flinging of arms and hands, like a man drowning. His speech pattern is arresting -- a kind of tyrant staccato. As observed in a recent run-through for the show to be aired April 25, The Boss describes to an underling, George Costanza, his lunch routine.
Costanza: "So tomorrow, Mr. Steinbrenner, I was thinking how 'bout we try some corned beef."
Steinbrenner: "Corned beef? Ah, it's a little fatty don't you think?"
Costanza: "I love it. I could have it every day."
Steinbrenner: "No, we'll stick with the calzone."
Costanza: "It's just that a little variety might be nice."
Steinbrenner: "Nope. I find something I like, I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch every day: turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl, George. You'd eat the chili, then you'd eat the bowl. Nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and just seeing a table."
Who is this Steinbrenner? It may come as no surprise to baseball followers to learn that the "Seinfeld" version has a dual personality: two people must play him simultaneously.
Steinbrenner, the body, doesn't speak; he merely flails. Sitting a few feet behind him, in a slightly elevated director's chair and out of camera range, is the prattling voice itself, contained in the slender body of Larry David, the show's 47-year-old executive producer, co-creator, writer, onetime stand-up comic and passionate, lifelong Yankees fan.
"I grew up in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, and I've always loved the Yankees," said David as he moved among the actors and camera crew on the set of the show recently. "It was a kid's fantasy that if you couldn't play center field for the Yankees -- and I was a huge Mickey Mantle fan -- well, maybe you could work for them in some capacity." And when the George Costanza character, who is based on David and played by Jason Alexander, needed a job after being unemployed for two years, David hit upon the Yankees. "It's a chaotic place and I thought George would fit in perfectly," he said.
So the comic possibilities were inherent there. But for David, so is the pain. "Being a Yankees fan with Steinbrenner as the owner is so frustrating," he said. "I was the kind of fan who even followed the minor leaguers in the system! I knew all the players coming up. But when Steinbrenner became the owner, they usually didn't come up. He traded them. Nobody would make it to the team.
"And then when he'd have good players like Rijo and Drabek and Buhner, he'd trade them! And the free agents he'd get -- the Dave LaPoint types -- were usually disasters. You just knew you could run the team better than he did."
Viewer response has been enthusiastic since Steinbrenner's first appearance on the show. The Yankees even report that George Costanza gets fan mail delivered to Yankee Stadium.
While the "Seinfeld" Steinbrenner may be impetuous, irascible and despotic, he can also be generous and warmhearted in his impetuous, irascible and despotic style.
The voice was inspired by Steinbrenner himself. "I don't know the man," David said, "but from seeing him interviewed on television and seeing his quotes in newspaper stories, I came up with this version of the way he speaks, the going on and on on subjects, and going from one topic to another almost without stopping for a breath."
Jerry Seinfeld, leaning against the couch in his apartment on the set, said: "Larry wanted to get an actor to say the lines on the show, but when I heard his interpretation, I said: 'This is great. It's funny. You read the lines.' And the guy who plays him now? Excellent. He has a very gifted back of the head. I guess all that is needed to play George Steinbrenner is the back half."
Seinfeld and David had called Steinbrenner to ask permission to use his name and the Yankees for their show. "At first he was confused," Seinfeld said. "He thought that the George character played by Jason was supposed to be him. I told him, no, that we'd had that character in the show for five years. But he gave us the permission, and I think it's a credit to him. A lot of people take themselves so seriously that they have refused to allow us to portray them on the show."
One of the show's writers, Jeff Schaffer, said that the Steinbrenner character is Every Boss. "He can fire you on a whim," he said. "And this one is the Renaissance man of mindless things."
Another writer, Alec Berg, said: "Actually, the less we know about Steinbrenner the better. We can do or say just about anything to caricature him."
What does Steinbrenner's body have to say for itself? And by the way, whose body is it?
When the head of Steinbrenner the Body turns around, the broad face of one Lee Baer, an actor, is revealed.
And where did he come from?
"From central casting," Baer said. Of course. Where else would you expect George Steinbrenner to come from?
"I got a call that they were looking for a Steinbrenner look-alike," Baer said. "I don't know anything about George Steinbrenner other than that he owned the Yankees. I don't follow baseball. I don't really follow sports. I like old cars."
Baer is a large man, 59, and there the relative similarity with The Boss ends.
He speaks with all the animation one expects from an undertaker, not the perfervid Steinbrenner. "I used to do a little stand-up comedy," he said. "Deadpan. Dry humor."
Actually, Baer is a relatively new Steinbrenner. Another extra had done it, and when he couldn't make it for a show, Baer was brought in.
"We liked his mannerisms, like the crazy way of pointing in the air," David said, giving a loony impersonation, "and decided to keep him."
But it is David who delivers such Steinbrenner lines as the one to George Costanza when he shows up after being presumed dead and finds out he didn't get the promotion he expected. "Well, once you were dead," Steinbrenner says, "we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to move."
Or when Costanza tries to get his secretary a raise and tells Steinbrenner that she supports an entire family, including a sick mother, and that she can't afford to go out to lunch so she goes to a nearby school cafeteria and pretends to be a teacher. Steinbrenner commiserates. "You know," he says as he reaches for a ringing phone, "she'd be better off making a sandwich and bringing it in."
On a show last December, Steinbrenner said: "Sure, I like a cupcake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside. It's a surprise. That's good. Plus the chocolate ones are good, too. Sometimes I just can't even make up my mind. A lot of times I'll mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge. . . ."
Speaking by telephone from his office in the Yankees' spring training complex in Tampa, Fla., the real George Michael Steinbrenner 3d said: "Sweets are one of my weaknesses -- I can't deny it. I like chocolate, I like doughnuts. My favorite doughnuts are the glazed from Krispy Kreme. I'm a freak for glazed doughnuts. And I like the jelly ones from Dunkin' Donuts, too. People around here know I like them, and when I make a talk or an appearance at some place, someone usually brings over a box of a dozen doughnuts for me."
Steinbrenner said he had seen only a couple of "Seinfeld" shows. "They're very good, very funny, very well written," he said. "It's amazing how popular the show is. And my grandchildren love it. My oldest is 9 years old, and he thinks being on that show is the greatest thing I've ever accomplished in my life. The writers are terrific. I'm impressed with the detail, even down to the names in the Yankees' parking lot. I was prepared not to like the show, but I came away laughing my head off."
"Hey, if you can't laugh at yourself, you're in bad shape," he continued. "We need more laughs today. I go to too many funerals and not enough birthday parties.
"And yes, I've come to be called The Boss. Nobody loves The Boss, especially a hard-nosed Boss. I am a tough boss, no question about it, but I don't demand anything from the people who work for me that I don't demand from myself. Maybe that comes across on the show, too.
"My favorite episode on the show? That was the funeral scene where I go to the home of a grieving family and the father sees me and he's hardly concerned that his son is no longer with us. He hollers at me, 'How could you trade Buhner?' "
Steinbrenner laughed. "It was sick," he said, "but hilarious."

Capitalism's Future, Seismic If Not Apocalyptic

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM
How Today's Economic Forces Shape Tomorrow's World
By Lester C. Thurow
385 pages. William Morrow & Company. $25.
Be brave! Lester C. Thurow exhorts the reader at the end of his engrossing new book, "The Future of Capitalism: How Today's Economic Forces Shape Tomorrow's World." Imagine yourself Columbus on a voyage into the economic future, and sail with "similar persistence and willingness to attempt the unknown." 
 The trouble is, by this point Mr. Thurow has made you feel so sick about the future that you dare not even get out of bed, let alone set out to sea. The very ground is dangerous, he has argued, extending his geographical metaphor. Beneath the surface, five tectonic plates are relentlessly shifting, so that at any moment new conditions could arise to send us the way of dinosaurs.
The first of these crustal plates is "the end of Communism," with the attendant loss of a focusing threat to the non-Communist world, as well as the liberation of new sources of raw materials and an educated low-wage work force. Capitalism has no more rivals. The second plate Mr. Thurow calls "a technological shift to an era dominated by man-made brainpower industries," where geography and natural resources no longer matter so much and human skills are the "only source of long-run sustainable competitive advantage."
The third of Mr. Thurow's mighty plates he describes as "a demography never before seen," in which the world's population is growing in size, moving from poor countries to rich ones and getting older. This last shift has produced "a very large group of elderly, relatively affluent people, most of whom do not work, and who are dependent upon government social welfare payments for much of their income."
The fourth plate is "a global economy," meaning that countries have splintered, regional trading blocs have grown, the world's economies have become ever more interconnected and "a substantial disconnect" has arisen "between global business firms with a world view and national governments that focus on the welfare of 'their' voters." And the fifth plate is "an era where there is no dominant economic, political or military power," with a result that no country will be strong enough to coordinate economies or impose trading rules.
As if these subterranean forces weren't earth-shaking enough, what Mr. Thurow perceives as "remaking the economic surface of earth" is also imposing. A combination of a "skill-intensive shift in technology" and the tendency in a global economy of wages to equalize is producing greater unemployment in the leading industrial nations, driving down the real wages of nonsupervisory labor and giving rise to surging inequality.
Leaders in Europe and the United States are damagingly preoccupied with the "extinct volcano" of inflation, he insists. And a major fault line dominates global trade, "with Japanese trade surpluses on one side and American trade deficits on the other side."
This fissure is widened, he says, by the trade surpluses with America accumulated by the successful Pacific Rim countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea), which they use to pay for their even bigger trade deficit with Japan. Mr. Thurow writes: "When conditions have existed for a long period of time and nothing has happened, humans, being human, begin to believe that it is possible to defy economic gravity forever. People begin to act as if the United States can run a trade deficit forever and the patterns of trade they now see can go on forever."
But they can't, he maintains. "At some point the United States will lose its ability to finance its trade deficit." And "when the end comes, the economic pain in Japan, the United States and the rest of the world will be extreme." For this country, a flight from the dollar will occur, and Americans will have to work much harder to achieve a dramatically lower standard of living.
Can all these hazards possibly be avoided? Mr. Thurow seems to doubt it. To do so would require change, something that human beings don't like to do unless they have to. Japan is too closed-minded, he writes. Europe is too fragmented. As for the United States: without the threat of Communism the country lacks the motivation to transcend itself, because the nature of pure capitalism is such that its short-term need to maximize consumption contravenes its long-term need to invest in research and development, in education and in other vital public projects.
Does Mr. Thurow offer any hope? He suggests that Americans develop "a builder's mentality" and compete with the Japanese and Europeans to develop "the best intercity high-speed rail network in the world," as well as "the most skilled and best-educated labor force." But such a suggestion seems a little feeble in the face of his blockbusting geological metaphors.
Those metaphors serve him well overall to make a highly abstract subject seem concrete and dramatic. But they eventually take on a counterproductive life of their own. At the end of his book he tries to cheer us up by comparing social change to "waves hitting rocky cliffs on the Maine coast." His point is that while the rocks of present conditions prevail in the short run, in the long run the waves of social change will pound the rocks into "bits of sand."
But he has just spent some 300 pages walking the reader over a terrifying continent. When you finally reach the coast, you are much too drained of hope to plunge into any waters of social change. You feel more like that pounded rock. As for sailing into the economic future with Columbus: no way. He's surely going to fall off the world.

Misery Has Company Among the Final Four

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THERE is something wrong with a man who can't enjoy a free extended weekend in East Rutherford, N.J.
Yet Rick Pitino wants no distractions, Richard Williams prefers no questions and Jim Boeheim is accepting no congratulations. 
 I wish these guys would lighten up already. They are college basketball coaches, not Middle East statesmen trying to preserve a fragile peace accord. They have high-paying jobs and appear to be in no danger of being downsized. Life for them could be much worse. They could be spending this week in New York.
Actually, there ought to be some kind of humility amendment to N.C.A.A. bylaws, requiring every power-broker coach to dance in the National Invitation Tournament once every few years. Then they would not have to worry about the national sports media that will infest the Meadowlands this weekend.
Having spent last weekend at the Southeast Regional, I have to say that if I had a dollar for every time a coach sneered and told some poor schnook with a notepad that he knew nothing about basketball, I'd have a down payment on scalping tickets to Saturday's semifinals.
At the N.I.T. on Tuesday night, the coaches were in much better moods, genuinely grateful to be playing in half-empty, circus-smelling Madison Square Garden for a championship that would earn them a modicum of prestige and a negligible cash prize of roughly $150,000.
"How happy are we to be playing in the N.I.T.?" said Phil Martelli, the St. Joseph's coach whose team will play Nebraska for the title tonight. "We would've been willing to play outdoors."
That is in sharp contrast with three of the Final Four coaches, who would prefer that this year's championship be settled in secrecy.
Kentucky's Pitino, asked last weekend to name the one thing he would change about the tournament, didn't say that he thought the players should receive spending money from the millions of dollars in television revenue, or that the schools should be allowed to fly parents in to watch their children play. After careful consideration, he said there were too many reporters covering the games. Sorry. Wrong answer. Let's try social science for $80.
Mississippi State's Williams, meanwhile, was crabbing his way through the most triumphant weekend of his career. Why didn't we know more about him and his upstart team? What exactly did we mean that his shooting guard has an unconventional hitch in his jump shot? What did it say that the official Final Four caps had Mississippi printed on the back and not Mississippi St.?
Williams had a chip on the shoulder the size of a bowling ball, much like Syracuse's Boeheim, who believes all-Americans over the age of 12 sit around 365 nights a year picking apart his matchup zone.
If he thinks he has it so bad, he should call up Brian Mahoney and find out what the recently discharged St. John's coach will be doing next season. Or go to the Garden tonight and introduce himself to Jimmy Williams, a 48-year-old Nebraska assistant who has been waiting for a quarter of a century for a head coaching job.
Williams spent 15 years at the University of Minnesota, where he made various head coaches look good by reeling in gems such as Ray Williams, Mychal Thompson and Kevin McHale. He discovered Dave Winfield playing in college intramurals.
"It's still a goal of mine to be a head coach," he said. But he is an African-American and the historical percentages say his chances are not good.
At the University of Illinois last week, another popular black assistant and crack recruiter, Jimmy Collins, was passed over for Lou Henson's vacated position. The job went to Florida's Lon Kruger instead. Florida has hired 30-year-old Billy Donovan, a Pitino protege. Who would be surprised if Uncle Rick put in a call, the way he did to help John Calipari land at Massachusetts, Pitino's alma mater?
Sometimes the coaching fraternity reminds you of a closed union shop, its members as delusional with conceit as some of the players they churn out.
My friend Stanton of Westchester maintains there is only one way to stop this runaway inflation of coaching egos: ban game coaching. If basketball is part of the "student-athlete" curriculum, he asks, then why are they allowed to be coached in what amounts to their exams?
Remove the coaches from the sidelines, and that will stop the endless television posturing for endorsement riches. No one would know or care who they were.
Maybe that would make Jim Boeheim happy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Strict Controls on Chemical Exports to Colombia

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
In a strategy intended to cripple the manufacture of Colombian cocaine, the United States is imposing stringent new controls on chemicals exported to Colombia by American companies that could be used to refine the illegal drug.
The controls, which are to be announced in the Federal Register today, were instituted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, after it could not vouch for the disposition of 6,000 metric tons of solvents and related chemicals sold annually by American companies to Colombia. 
 The counternarcotics agency reported that American sales of such solvents had jumped 57 percent since 1990, prompting officials to suspect that some Colombian drug cartels had been using some, if not most, of the chemicals to extract cocaine's crystalline powder from raw coca leaves and paste, often in clandestine jungle laboratories.
The chemicals listed include M.E.K. (methyl ethyl ketone), acetone, toluene potassium permanganate and ethyl ether, which all have legitimate industrial uses but are also used in cocaine processing.
Starting today, an American company exporting the listed chemicals to Colombia must notify the Drug Enforcement Administration in writing at least 15 days in advance. Until now, the notification could be made as late as the date of shipment.
Potentially more important, the exporter must show that the chemicals will have a legitimate use in Colombia, a demonstration that involves identifying the company receiving the chemicals and its officers.
"I think this really will change the situation radically," said Gene R. Haislip, a deputy administrator of the drug agency who heads its office of diversion control in Washington. "This is about as strong a step as we can take here to make sure our chemicals don't get to the traffickers."
The new controls on chemical exports follow the exclusion of Colombia from an annual list of drug-producing or transit nations that are trying to stem the flow of narcotics. Preident Clinton issued the list on March 1.
Colombia's decertification disqualifies it from most American economic assistance.
Law-enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the new controls had been adopted because of fears that rampant corruption within the Colombian Government had tainted its National Directorate of Dangerous Drugs, which has licensed and controlled chemical imports. Its top officials trusted by Washington have been transferred or assigned to other duties, an American official said.
As a rule, it takes 12 kilos of solvents to process 1 kilo of cocaine. Under this formula, the 6,000 metric tons of American solvents imported by Colombia are sufficient to produce up to 500 metric tons of cocaine.
Mr. Haislip said that the Drug Enforcement Administration had briefed American companies about the new controls and that "we've had a pretty good response from them." Two of the largest companies, Pecten, a Shell subsidiary, and Exxon Chemical, had been very cooperative, he said.
"Although the new regulations involve additional work for our employees, we fully support the D.E.A.'s efforts," said Kitty Borah, a spokeswoman for Shell Oil Company and its subsidiaries.
Colombian drug cartels could seek suppliers in Europe and Latin America. But Mr. Haislip said European countries were cooperating to prevent the diversion of chemicals, and Brazil passed legislation a year ago controlling the shipment of solvents to Colombia.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher in Quiet Trading On Hope of a German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar moved slightly higher in quiet trading yesterday on heightened expectations of an interest rate cut in Germany.
Remarks by a German monetary official yesterday bolstered other recent comments suggesting that the Bundesbank would consider cutting rates when it meets today. 
 "At least it made it closer to a 50-50 proposition," Dave Glowacki, a senior trader at the NBD Bank in Detroit, said of the officials' statements.
The prospect of lower rates often prompts selling of a currency because they reduce the value of investments denominated in that currency.
There were no firm trends in yen trading as many Japanese traders took a break from the market during the last few days of that country's fiscal year, which ends Sunday.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4845 German marks from 1.4785 marks on Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 106.55 Japanese yen, up from 106.47 yen.
Hans-Jurgen Krupp, the head of a regional central bank in Hamburg, was quoted in a magazine report yesterday as saying there were good reasons to cut rates in Germany.
Mr. Krupp said a report last week showing a surge in money supply should not bar a cut in rates
Hopes for lower rates had dimmed on the money supply report. With more money in the financial system, a rate cut would add to the supply and risk inflation. But inflation appears under control and other economic signs suggest there is room for the Bundesbank to stage at least one more rate cut, economists say.
The dollar also benefited slightly from weakness in the British pound, which fell as the European Union banned British beef exports worldwide Tuesday to contain "mad cow" disease.
The pound fell to $1.5200 from $1.5225.

HEADLINE: Orders in Transportation Fell Sharply Last Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
The United States economy gained strength last month even though a midwinter lull in aircraft purchases caused factory orders to fall by the largest percentage in 10 months, the Commerce Department reported today.
While overall orders dropped 2.5 percent in February -- as demand for passenger jets weakened -- analysts pointed to a seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in orders excluding transportation equipment as a sign that a spring rebound for the economy was likely. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, sounded a similar note in renomination testimony before Congress today. "The current economic expansion seems to have exhibited staying power," he said to the House Budget Committee.
The Commerce Department's report showed that demand rose for industrial machinery and primary metals in February. And unfilled orders for durable goods, a gauge of pent-up demand, increased two-tenths of 1 percent, the sixth monthly increase.
The drop in aviation orders appeared to be short-lived, said Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
The Boeing Company, for example, said last week that it was increasing production of its 737, 757 and wide-body 747 commercial jets next year, expecting a surge in orders. "In recent months aircraft orders have been very strong," Mr. Stone said. "You took five steps forward and last month one step back."
In his testimony, the second of two days, Mr. Greenspan said that businesses had nearly finished whittling down their supplies of unsold goods. "Much, but perhaps not all, of the needed inventory correction already has been accomplished," he said.
Some analysts, though, said the economy was hardly out of the woods. Leonard Katz, who manages $300 million at the Fixed Income Management Group in Garden City, L.I., pointed to an increase in consumer-loan delinquencies and to continuing corporate job cuts, like one today in which the Northrop Grumman Corporation said it would eliminate 2,100 jobs by the end of the year.
"Everything points to a slow-growth economy," Mr. Katz said. "There is a possibility of recession."
Before the Commerce Department report, analysts had expected a three-tenths of 1 percent decline in durable-goods orders for February, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Economists caution against reading too much into any single monthly durable-goods report. Orders tend to be volatile from month to month because of the erratic pattern of orders for commercial jets and military hardware.
Not counting military hardware, orders decreased 1.3 percent last month, the largest loss since July 1995, the Commerce Department said.
Among major industries, transportation orders fell 11.6 percent in February, the biggest drop since last October; electrical-equipment orders fell 1.1 percent, and military capital-goods orders dropped 26.5 percent.
But orders for industrial equipment rose 2.8 percent; primary-metals orders were up five-tenths of 1 percent, and capital-goods orders excluding aircraft increased 3.7 percent.
Shipments of durable goods, a gauge of current demand, rose 1.3 percent, the third gain in four months.
The release of the report comes a day after a meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy committee, which chose not to lower interest rates after other recent economic indicators showed strength in housing and labor markets, including a big gain of jobs in February.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Show A Sharp Decline in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, after comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and a report on durable goods suggested that mounting econonic growth could stave off further cuts in interest rates.
"The market showed its true colors," said Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston. "People were waiting for an opportunity to sell, and they chose Wednesday to do it."
The price of the 30-year bond fell 1 8/32 yesterday, to 91 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.68 percent, from 6.57 percent on Tuesday. The yield is at its highest since March 19, when it was 6.71 percent. Bondholders lost about $12.50 for every $1,000 invested.
Bond prices were pressured early on after the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- products from washing machines to aircraft -- fell 2.5 percent, the largest drop since April 1995. While the main number would ordinarilly have encouraged the market, the report also showed that the drop was largely a result of sharp declines in aircraft and military orders -- categories noted for month-to- month volatility.
Bond prices managed to bounce back off their lows only to weaken again after Mr. Greenspan, speaking before the House Budget Committee, said that "the current economic expansion seems to have exhibited staying power." Mr. Greenspan also said that a period of slow real wage growth might be coming to an end.
Traders said Mr. Greenspan's comments poured cold water on hopes that Fed policy makers will lower short-term interest rates when they next meet, on May 21.
A slump in the Treasury futures market also pressured prices. In addition, hedge fund selling of some intermediate and long maturities added volatility to the day's decline.
"It was very much a futures-led market, with the cash market thin," said Louis Brein, a financial analyst at Finacor Vendome Inc., a brokerage firm in Chicago. "A lot of people tried to buy the market earlier, but gave up later in the day, and it appears that it snowballed at the close of futures trading."
As the market looks for further clues to the direction of the economy and of interest rates Mr. Brein noted that "a Fed that cuts rates at a time when the market is unsure of the level at which the economy is operating leads to uncertainty, which in turns lead to liquidation."
"Every time the Fed eases, it lifts the lift of a Pandora's box just a little more and tempts letting inflation slip out." Mr. Brein said. "Therefore, unless a rate cut simply reaffirms something about the economy that bond traders were already sure of, a rate cut risks a market selloff. It is better to anticipate a rate cut based on economic conditions than it is to actually get one."
The Treasury announced yesterday that it had postponed its sale of new one-year bills that was planned for today, saying that if Congresss passed a debt ceiling extension, the sale of the bills would probably take place next Tuesday. A two-year note auction that had been scheduled for Tuesday and five-year note sale scheduled for yesterday had already been postponed.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges State Action on Education

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: PALISADES, N.Y., March 27

 BODY:
President Clinton urged the nation's governors today to enforce their push for rigorous classroom standards with state competency tests, saying there should be "no more social promotions, no more free passes" for students.
At an education conference of governors and business leaders, Mr. Clinton cited as a model his home state of Arkansas, where as governor he made education issues a priority. Under his stewardship, Arkansas began requiring students to pass a minimum performance test in eighth grade to be promoted into high school. 
 If a state enacts "meaningful standards that you have confidence in," Mr. Clinton said, "you shouldn't be afraid to find out" if the students are learning and performing up to the standard. "And you shouldn't be deterred by people saying this is cruel, this is unfair or whatever they say," the President added. "The worst thing you can do is send people all the way through school with a diploma they can't read."
Several hours after Mr. Clinton spoke the governors wound up their two-day meeting with corporate leaders and education experts by issuing a policy statement committing themselves to developing "internationally competitive academic standards" in their states and the tests to assess whether they were working.
The leaders of some of the nation's most powerful corporations also agreed to work to improve public education, to emphasize student scholastic records in their hiring and to consider academic standards when making decisions on business sites.
Some of the governors seemed less than delighted with the President's scene-stealing appearance at a conference at which many of them emphasized the local -- not Federal -- nature of education policy.
"President Clinton is a supporter of the status quo in public education," said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican. "He thinks things are fine, and all you need to do is test a few folks. He's coming to tell this group something we've been talking about not just for the past two days but for a couple of years. That's hardly revolutionary, hardly leadership, hardly ahead of the curve."
And Governor Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, another Republican, characterized the President's speech as simply a "good summation of what we've been discussing for the past day."
Mr. Clinton's speech here was another in a series of exhortations he has made at appearances in which he has tried to use the bully pulpit of the Presidency since the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994. He has spelled out his vision for the nation without proposing action that could be defeated by a hostile Congress.
The speeches have also allowed the President to move into the Republican arena of cultural issues and position himself as a social moderate in this election year. He has particularly focused on issues affecting children, calling for school uniforms, anti-drug efforts, a battle against teen-age smoking and curbs on violence in children's television. His strong stand today against unjustified promotions to higher grades was another part of that effort.
The "education summit" held in the cloistered confines of an International Business Machines conference center came seven years after President Bush summoned the nation's governors to Charlottesville, Va., for a similar meeting. There, officials outlined broad national goals for schools and set in motion federally financed efforts to create voluntary national guidelines in core subject areas.
At that time Mr. Clinton, then a governor who played a major role in the summit, praised its recommendations, saying, "This is the first time in the history of this country that we have ever thought enough of education and ever understood its significance to our economic future enough to commit ourselves to national performance goals."
But his comments today were an indication of how the political climate has changed, as he made only passing references to a Federal role in education. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the effort to draw up national standards for schools had been, "I think it's fair to say, less than successful."
And he singled out history and English standards as efforts that "did not succeed." The recently released English standards have come under wide criticism as imprecise, and the national history standard was repudiated by the Senate last year by a vote of 99 to 1.
Mr. Clinton echoed the governors' contentions that setting standards in education should be up to the states. "I accept your premise," he said.
"We can only do better with tougher standards and better assessment, and you should set the standards."
The President cautioned that while states should establish their own standards and their own testing system "being promoted ought to mean more or less the same thing in Pasadena, Calif., that it does in Palisades, N.N."
Mr. Clinton also called for governors to put in place a system that "rewards and inspires and demands higher standards of teachers."
Mr. Clinton called for more "charter schools," under which educators and parents get charters to create and manage innovative public schools that only remain open if they do a good job. And sounding much like Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor of New York City, he said administrative costs in the nation's school systems should be cut. "If it is true that New York City spends $8,000 a student on education, but only $44 goes to books and other classroom materials that's a disgrace," he said. "That's wrong."

HEADLINE: California Homes Are Selling Again

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: PERRIS, Calif., March 27

 BODY:
Beth Combee could hardly contain her excitement. After worrying about their jobs during the recent recession, she and her husband just received unexpected promotions and took a step she said they had only dreamed of during the years of economic uncertainty: they bought a handsome $104,000 house in a new development here known as May Ranch, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, in Riverside County.
"It's going to be empty for a while," said Mrs. Combee, 25, a supervisor in a pharmaceutical plant, as she explained that they would be moving from a one-bedroom mobile home to a three-bedroom house but would not be buying a lot of furniture right away. "We were thinking about this for about four years, but we just weren't sure about our jobs or that we could finance it until now." 
 The Combees are harbingers of an important economic development in Southern California. The housing market plunged into deep distress when California's economy first stalled in 1990, and it has been the last major industry in the state to begin to recover.
But finally, economists say, housing sales and construction are showing signs of a solid rebound, one of the strongest pieces of evidence that California's incipient recovery is slowly turning into a sustained expansion -- particularly in Southern California.
Moreover, the signs indicate that California's growth is likely to exceed the national recovery over the next few years in critical areas like job and income gains.
"This year looks like the transition to real sustainable growth," said Tom K. Lieser, associate director of the economic-forecasting project at the University of California at Los Angeles. "Until now, housing had been a real enigma to us. But the problem was that the uncertainty had been high. Every segment of the public had some anxiety. That's why the new signs in the housing area are so important."
U.C.L.A. is projecting employment growth in California this year of 3 percent, compared with 1.3 percent nationwide, and 2.8 percent next year, higher than an expected national increase in jobs of 1.5 percent.
Jeffrey Meyers, head of a real estate consulting business in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, added: "Just 90 days into the year, you don't want to hold your breath, but this appears to be a strong recovery. Builders are telling us this is the strongest they've seen the market in six years, and some of the figures prove it."
Existing-home sales rose 24.7 percent in February from the year earlier, according to the California Association of Realtors. In Los Angeles County, the median sales price of a single-family home fell 4 percent from the year earlier, to $170,210. But in Orange County, it rose 5.3 percent, to $212,130.
"These are the best sales we've seen since 1988," said Roland Osgood, a senior executive of the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation of Los Angeles, the developer of the May Ranch project, where the Combees had bought their home. "It's continuing. More jobs are being created in this area than we expected."
Kaufman & Broad's sales in what is known in this region as the Inland Empire -- Riverside and San Bernadino Counties -- are expected to rise to 11,000 units this year, from 8,800 last year. And Mr. Osgood said sales in Orange and Los Angeles Counties were expected to rise to about 9,000 homes this year, from 7,200 last year. Those homes are in the $180,000-to-$250,000 range.
Donna Cox, the senior sales agent at May Ranch, said the project had buyers for 22 of the 27 homes that had been put on the market since the opening on Feb. 3. She added that one of the more important shifts was that more of the customers, because they had better jobs, now qualified for mortgages. Two years ago, she said, nearly half the deals fell through at another Kaufman & Broad development where she worked because the customers could not get credit.
The improvement is evident, too, in northern Los Angeles County, as well, another area hard hit by the recession. Thomas L. Lee, chief executive of Newhall Land and Farming Company, one of the largest landowners and home builders in the Santa Clarita Valley, said his company's sales of new homes had risen 39 percent so far this year from 1995 and that prices were moving upward for the first time in six years.
"This has been a long recession -- I mean, we've been in this thing for a good five years," Mr. Lee said. "There have been a lot of people who postponed decisions. Now there's a lot of pent-up demand."
Housing sales and housing starts remain well below those in the peak years of the late 1980's, when booming economic growth was still built into the California dream. And the experts say that the current rebound, while strong, is unlikely to bring the housing industry back to those levels.
But the recovery is being built on a new California economy, one less dependent on manufacturing and more on service industries, like entertainment. And there is now significantly less inflation, which had given an artificial boost to housing.
"Before, inflation covered up a lot of mistakes," said Bruce Karatz, Kaufman & Broad's chairman. "The industry is now operating well without that inflation. We're a better company today than we were seven years ago."
Even sales of luxury homes are starting to show some life. Joe W. Stemmer, an independent builder in Palm Springs, said he had built 8 houses last year, and expects to increase that to 10 this year. Those are 3,000-square-foot homes that will cost $350,000 and more.
The sales are "not like it was before," he said, "but this is an improvement. "Things are moving."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The rich are getting richer, etc., and it's likely to remain that way.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE rich are getting richer, the poor, poorer and the middle class is barely hanging on. But not to worry: it's not nearly as bad as the numbers look.
That has long been the word from Republican conservatives, who view the current handwringing over inequality of income as a distraction from the issue of getting the economy into higher gear. That view is likely to be embraced in the Presidential campaign by Bob Dole, if only because he cannot afford to alienate the "growth is everything" wing of his party. But new research is making the rationale for neglecting inequality harder to sustain. 
 Lynn Karoly, an economist with the Rand Corporation, has found that the trend toward inequality appears to have accelerated in the 1990's, dashing hopes that the 1980's were an aberration. Moshe Buchinsky and Jennifer Hunt of Yale University tested the premise that the prospect of moving up the income ladder has offset widening disparities in earnings and found it wanting. For while mobility does soften the blow, the probability of changing economic class was actually lower in 1990 than in 1980.
Ms. Karoly, writing in the current issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, slices and dices income trends between 1973 and 1993 in every imaginable way. As has been widely reported, average family income adjusted for inflation fell by 11 percent across the two decades. But since the average family size also fell, there was actually a modest gain in the average living standard.
At the same time, however, the gap between the top and bottom widened sharply. An American at the 10th percentile of the economic pecking order suffered a 21 percent decline in income, while an American in the 90th percentile enjoyed a 22 percent gain.
These numbers won't surprise the economically literate. What may shock, though, are the data for the last few years, which have only recently become available. Average (50th percentile) and poor (10th percentile) individuals both lost ground during the 1990 recession and never gained it back in the recovery. Again using the poverty line as the benchmark, the average American was 8 percent worse off in 1993 than in 1989 while the poor were 14 percent worse off.
Such snapshots of the income distribution offer no clear sense of who is poor and for how long. For example, "we don't worry about college students who are voluntarily poor," explains Rebecca Blank, an economist at Northwestern University.
What one really would like to know is the distribution of long-term incomes, which factor out the brief ups and downs as workers change jobs, recover from illness, raise children and so forth. And even that statistic would be an imperfect measure of economic welfare. Many Americans, it is safe to say, would trade a guarantee of a modest income for substantial opportunity to strike it rich through personal initiative.
That's where the research Mr. Buchinsky and Ms. Hunt, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, fits in. They extend the time horizon for measuring wage income from one year to four and found, as expected, that inequality is reduced by as much as 26 percent.
But the story does not end there. Real mobility might be defined as the prospects of changing economic class -- in this case, arbitrarily but plausibly represented by the chance of moving from one-fifth of the income distribution to another in any given year. And here, the two researchers offer little comfort to the champions of capitalism in the era of downsizing.
In 1980, they calculate, a high school graduate with six years of work experience had a 17 percent chance of jumping to another fifth of the wage distribution. An elementary school graduate with six years' experience had a 17 percent chance of changing economic class. In 1990 a high school graduate with six years' experience had just a 10 percent chance of moving, while a high school dropout's probability of changing class fell to just 11 percent.
Taken separately, the trends in inequality and mobility are distressing; together, they are kindling for social conflagration. Is there any hope that the labor market will reverse course on its own?
In the 1980's, notes Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton University, there was hope that the widening wage gap would spur college enrollment and reduce the wage premium paid to college graduates. But enrollment rates have been slow to respond, and other factors driving the wedge in the income distribution -- technology, international trade, formation of single-parent families -- march on.
"There's little doubt," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution: "Permanent inequality is going up."

HEADLINE: New Custody Rules Complicate the Task of Judges

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
To a divorced parent with custody of the children -- usually the mother -- moving to a new area often promised a fresh start with a new spouse, a new job, or with old friends and family. But to the parent with visitation rights, usually the father, such a move augured a kind of parenting death by deprivation. And it was up to the judge to decide: should she stay or should she go?
These relocation cases are among the most difficult Solomonic calls a judge has to make, said Lewis R. Friedman, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan. "Whatever the judge decides is a disaster," he said. "There are no good results, and no one comes out ahead." 
 On Tuesday, the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, made the judge's task in these cases even more difficult. The court struck down a narrowly defined test that placed a heavy burden on the relocating spouse to justify the move and instead told judges to reach whatever conclusion would best serve the interests of the children, not the parents. Simply put, the court told judges that from now on, they had to use common sense.
"This is more difficult, from a judge's point of view," said Justice Friedman, "The old rule was easy to follow; the new rule is, 'Do the best you can.' "
Judges who preside over domestic cases, whether in Family Court or State Supreme Court, have almost unlimited authority to shape the lives of a family in distress. That prospect unnerves lawyers and divorcing parents, particularly those who perceive themselves to be on the losing end. The earlier test for coming up with relocation decisions, developed in the 1980's, was an attempt both to acknowledge the importance of a noncustodial father's impact on his children's lives, and to clip a judge's power to make those decisions without direction.
Now, the court has essentially returned to judges an extraordinary amount of discretion by giving them a range of factors to consider in arriving at that amorphous phrase, "the best interests of the child." Such factors may include whether the parent requesting or opposing the move is doing so in good faith; the child's relationship with each parent; the potential for the parent without custody to maintain contact with the child after the move; the impact of the move on the child's relationship with extended family members on both sides, and the hostility between the parents.
"Children are not chattel," wrote Judge Vito J. Titone, "and custody and visitation decisions should be made with a view toward what best serves their interests, not what would reward or penalize a purportedly 'innocent' or 'blameworthy' parent."
The Court of Appeals said that it was returning such discretion to judges because the old rule created mechanical solutions that ignored the volatile details of individual cases.
Under the old rule -- among the most restrictive in the nation and a beacon of the fathers' rights movement -- a parent without custody had to demonstrate that the other parent's anticipated move would interfere meaningfully with visitation. If a judge agreed, then the move could only go forward if the parent demonstrated "exceptional circumstances."
New York appellate courts were stringent in their view of such explanations. The mother had to show that she was taking a job in a new area because of economic "necessity," not merely to better her condition. A remarriage alone did not suffice. And she couldn't just move to a new state hoping to meet a new man or find a new job.
And if she persisted with her desire to move, the courts said she certainly could do so, but she would have to give up custody of the children to their father.
The hurdle was so high that lawyers often advised clients to either forgo the move or to give up custody. One judge said that lawyers often used the threat of the guidelines as a club to broker new support agreements: the husband might offer not to contest the move in exchange for the wife accepting lower child support payments and alimony.
Not surprisingly, the new rule has prompted howls of anguish from fathers without custody like Andrew S. Kenward, 44, a White Plains accountant who tried to prevent his ex-wife from moving 130 miles away to Pittsfield, Mass., with their 9-year-old son. Mr. Kenward, whose case was one of two that were considered and rejected by the Court of Appeals, predicted that the new guidelines would be a boon to lawyers and mental health experts, and harmful to fathers and children.
"If a mother decides she wants to pick up and leave, that should be her problem," said Mr. Kenward, who added that until his former wife's move, he had 12 overnight visits each month with his son. "The court says that the children's rights are the most important thing to look at, but their reasoning is specious and false. They're really saying that women's rights should prevail over the best interests of the children and, it goes without saying, fathers."
But Kathleen Donelli, a White Plains lawyer who represented Mr. Kenward's ex-wife, Jacqueline Browner, said the decision should not be read as endorsing the traditional view of custody disputes that a mother should always triumph.
"More and more fathers are gaining custody of their children," Ms. Donelli said, pointing to a 1993 Court of Appeals decision that blocked a father with custody from moving to New Jersey with his new wife to ease their commute to their jobs. "Now there is less of a burden for a custodial parent to gain permission to relocate," she added.
Joan L. Ellenbogen, a Manhattan matrimonial lawyer, says that her advice to clients who want to relocate will change as a result of the ruling. "I'll tell them, 'You still have to have a damn good reason for moving, but it's worth going to court over it,' " she said.
Noting the opacity of the guidelines, she said that predicting outcomes for her clients would be very difficult. "It all depends on which judge you get," she added.
In fact lawyers and judges said yesterday that the ruling would be an invitation for many divorced parents who would have otherwise not tried to move to now request hearings. "And there may be judges who would have wanted to give permission to a move and felt constrained until now," said Myrna Felder, a Manhattan matrimonial lawyer.
Although some judges said they felt uneasy about the additional burden of decision making placed on them by the new rule, they emphasized that the philosophy embedded in the old rule remains. "I think parents still have to be cautioned to understand that a child's best interest is served by having the love and attention of both parents," said Justice Jacqueline W. Silbermann, a State Supreme Court justice who hears divorce cases in Manhattan.
And Judge Michael Gage, the administrative judge of the city's family courts, said that the decision is a return to the mainstream of thinking about children in family disputes. The best interests of the child inquiry, she noted, is the direction that New York judges must take in assessing challenges over adoption, custody and foster care.
"Once you have to make a best-interests finding, your ruling becomes very specific to the case," Judge Gage said. "In family law, that's the way it should be."

HEADLINE: Sports Agency Suggested to Handle Yankees

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
As the Yankees get ready to decide where to play when their Yankee Stadium lease expires in 2002, New York State is contemplating the creation of a sports authority that might give it an edge on its chief rival, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
New York State's top economic official has suggested the establishment of such an authority to finance stadium renovations or the construction of a new ball park. 
 By April 9, a study paid for by the state, New York City and the Yankees is expected to determine which is the best site among four being considered: Yankee Stadium, Manhattan's West Side, and two other Bronx locations, Van Cortlandt Park and Pelham Bay Park.
Creating an authority to pay for the stadium through bond issues means that state and local governments do not have to finance the project directly. Often, an authority ceases to exist once financing is complete, unless it becomes the equivalent of a state agency, like the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, or New Jersey's sports authority, which runs Giants Stadium, the Continental Arena, the Meadowlands Race Track and the Atlantic City Convention Center.
How the state and city propose to finance a stadium is not the Yankees' primary interest, since the team is not putting up any money for construction.
The chief goal of George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, is to increase revenues sharply wherever the team is based after the 2002 season.
"I don't know if it's an enormous economic advantage to create an authority," said Charles A. Gargano, the state's Commissioner for Economic Development. "Technically, it's still a state and city debt. But it identifies it as a political need and might get people more excited."
Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner, said, "We haven't evaluated the sports authority idea."
To reduce the amount the state and city would have to finance, Mr. Gargano is looking to raise money by the advance sale of luxury suites and club seats, personal seat licenses and the rights to name the stadium.
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- who proposed in 1993 that a West Side stadium be built over the Pennsylvania rail yards -- said that proposing a sports authority represented a positive step.
"Their intent is to do anything to make this happen," Mr. Cuomo said. "If you believe the Yankees should stay, it's a good sign."
Discussing the practicality of creating a sports authority, the former Governor added: "Theoretically and practically, the state can borrow the money. But politically, when you present your budget, you don't have to say, 'I borrowed $800 million for a stadium. The authority did.' It's off-budget."
He added that he believed the stadium study would identify the West Side location, south of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, as the best one. Community opposition is expected, but Mr. Cuomo said he expected that it could be overcome.
Three years ago, the cost of building a stadium on the West Side, along with an adjacent garage, was placed at $307 million, plus $223 million to erect concrete platforms over the Long Island Rail Road storage yards.
Mr. Gargano said the cost of renovating Yankee Stadium, and adding garages, highway ramps and a bridge across the Harlem River, would come to $745 million. But Mr. Steinbrenner has rejected 13 stadium renovation plans.
New Jersey's Sports and Exposition Authority is said to have a stadium plan in place for attracting the Yankees. But Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has said the state will await Mr. Steinbrenner's decision and not raid New York for the team. She has also said the state will not use taxpayer money to pay for a new stadium.

HEADLINE: Sensible Health Reform, for Now

 BODY:
The House is expected to vote today on two versions of health-care reform -- a sensible if limited Democratic bill and a harmful Republican version. The Democrats have also embraced a bipartisan bill now pending in the Senate that would make it easier for workers who lose their jobs to buy health coverage. That is of critical importance in this era of downsizing and job shifts. House Republicans have embraced these provisions but have added to their bill amendments that are not only bad health policy but could delay passage of any useful health-care reform this year.
The Senate bill, written by Nancy Kassebaum and Ted Kennedy, would require insurance companies to sell policies to workers who leave their jobs but have been continuously covered by their employers. The bill would also limit the length of time that insurers could refuse to cover an applicant's pre-existing medical problem and forbid insurers to drop chronically ill enrollees. 
 These modest measures, which were approved unanimously by the Senate Labor Committee, would give some peace of mind to workers who are dismissed or want to find better jobs. The bill is crafted so that enrollees will not be hit with steep premium hikes. Because most of its guarantees apply only to already insured workers, they would not encourage healthy individuals to drop coverage or subject insurers to waves of applications from chronically ill unemployed people.
House Republicans know that if they venture much beyond the Senate bill they will lose bipartisan support. Yet their bill would create tax-favored medical savings accounts, which would allow people who buy only catastrophic health policies to sequester funds to pay their ordinary medical bills. This is a bad idea that is almost certain to be rejected by the Senate. Medical savings accounts would appeal primarily to healthy people, because they would not need to tap most of the money in the tax-advantaged savings account. That would leave less healthy people to buy ordinary medical coverage at elevated prices.
The goal of health reform ought to be the opposite -- to standardize policies so that everyone buys the same basic package. That way health plans would be forced to compete by offering better treatment, rather than by tailoring coverage to attract only applicants unlikely to need treatment.
The House G.O.P. bill would provide unwarranted protection to doctors and hospitals from malpractice suits, depriving injured patients of full redress. It would also allow small employers to band together to buy coverage for their workers -- a good idea -- but would needlessly exempt these associations from state taxation. States that need to raise money to pay for care of the uninsured, for example, often resort to taxes on insurance premiums. If Congress puts more health plans out of reach of state tax authorities, it makes state reform of health care substantially harder.
The House G.O.P. bill would make it more difficult to find common ground with the Senate. If no bill passes, health care reform will get pushed off once again into the indefinite future. If the House Republicans are serious about protecting workers who lose or leave their jobs, they will vote for Kassebaum-Kennedy and nothing else.

HEADLINE: Justices Curb Federal Power To Subject States to Lawsuits

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Escalating its profound and divisive debate over the relationship between the states and the Federal Government, the Supreme Court today bolstered state power by sharply curbing the authority of Congress to subject states to suits in Federal court.
The 5-to-4 ruling came in a case challenging the constitutionality of a 1988 law permitting Indian tribes to sue states in Federal court for failing to negotiate in good faith over the operation of gambling casinos on tribal land. In an opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court ruled today that this portion of the law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, was an unconstitutional incursion on state sovereignty. 
 But the significance of today's decision extends far beyond the particular context of the case, raising questions about whether individuals can use the courts to force states to abide by a variety of Federal laws.
With respect to Indian gambling, the decision left unanswered many important questions, which the Justices may soon address in related cases awaiting Court action. But the paradoxical effect may be that even though an Indian tribe was nominally the loser in the case, it will now be easier for tribes to open casinos by getting authorization directly from the Interior Department rather than dealing with the states at all.
And at the broadest level, the decision made it stunningly clear that last term's ruling in United States v. Lopez that Congress lacked authority to ban possession of guns near schools was not an aberrant decision, as some thought then.
It is evident now that the Lopez decision was a signal that the current majority is in the process of revisiting some long-settled assumptions about the structure of the Federal Government and the constitutional allocation of authority between Washington and the states.
The lineup in the two cases was the same: Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority, joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, while dissenting votes were cast by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
The subject of the case today was the 11th Amendment, which bars jurisdiction in the Federal courts to hear suits against a state by citizens of another state. An 1890 Supreme Court decision, Hans v. Louisiana, gave the amendment the broader interpretation of generally barring Federal court suits against states without their consent, whether by their own residents or residents of other states.
The significance of Hans v. Louisiana as a precedent had been watered down over the years, as the Court permitted suits against states in Federal court to enforce a variety of Federal laws, most recently, in a 1989 decision, the Federal Superfund environmental law. The Court today overruled that decision, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, declaring that laws enacted by Congress in the exercise of its authority to regulate interstate commerce were not enforceable against states in Federal court.
Also overruled, by implication, was a series of recent decisions holding that the 11th Amendment required only that Congress make clear its intention to subject the states to suits in Federal court to enforce particular laws. If the Federal law was clear enough, these cases held, the states' 11th Amendment immunity would be abrogated. Chief Justice Rehnquist said today that although Congress had made its intention to subject the states to suit by Indian tribes "absolutely clear," the 11th Amendment barred the suits anyway.
The practical significance of the decision is far from clear. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens cited Federal copyright, bankruptcy and antitrust laws as among those that would "have no remedy" for state violations, an assertion that Chief Justice Rehnquist disputed in his majority opinion.
The full scope of the ruling will have to be filled out in future cases. Some limits on the decision are clear. Suits may still be brought against states to enforce the right to equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, which Chief Justice Rehnquist noted was adopted "well after" the adoption of the 11th Amendment and which "operated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and Federal power."
Suits may also be brought by the Federal Government against states, and by individuals against state officials for injunctions to prohibit future illegal actions. The principal effect of the decision will be to limit suits to enforce rights granted by Congress within its authority under the Commerce Clause, which encompasses much of modern Federal regulation.
That was the area addressed in the Union Gas case in 1989, in which the Court held that a Federal court could order a state to pay environmental cleanup costs. In declaring today that the Union Gas precedent was overruled, Chief Justice Rehnquist said it was a "deeply fractured" ruling, unsupported by a majority opinion, that had "created confusion among the lower courts" and "deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence.
Regardless of the immediate practical effects, the breadth of the debate was clear from the vigor of the language on both sides.
Justice Stevens and Justice Souter both filed dissenting opinions; Justice Souter's 92-page dissent (compared with 31 pages for the majority opinion) was also signed by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer.
Justice Stevens, disputing the Chief Justice's assertion that the Court was simply restoring a long-dominant view of federalism, called the decision a "sharp break with the past." He referred to "the shocking character of the majority's affront to a co-equal branch of our Government," meaning Congress, and said the decision was "profoundly misguided."
Justice Souter attacked the majority opinion on both broad theoretical grounds and specific legal analysis. He said the majority was endorsing and giving constitutional status to a notion of state sovereignty that was incompatible with the Federal Government that the Constitution had established.
He said the ratification of the Constitution "demonstrated that state governments were subject to a superior regime of law in a judicial system established, not by the state, but by the people through a specific delegation of their sovereign power to a national government that was paramount within its delegated sphere."
He added, "Given the framers' general concern with curbing abuses by state governments, it would be amazing if the scheme of delegated powers embodied in the Constitution had left the national government powerless to render the states judicially accountable for violations of Federal rights." Justice Souter said the Court was making the same mistake it made at "the nadir of its competence" early in this century, when it applied common-law concepts of property rights and contract to overrule Congressional economic regulation.
Chief Justice Rehnquist dismissed Justice Souter's opinion by saying it "disregards our case law in favor of a theory cobbled together from law review articles and its own version of historical events."
The decision, Seminole Tribe v. Florida, No. 94-12, upheld a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. That court ruled in 1994 that the 11th Amendment barred a suit by the Seminole Tribe under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to force Florida to negotiate the terms of a tribal-state compact to open a casino on Seminole land.
The Indian gaming act set up a complex procedure under which a tribe, if frustrated by a state, can take its request to the Secretary of the Interior. Under the appeals court's analysis, that option remains now that tribes can no longer sue the states.
Gambling in reservation casinos is now a $4-billion a year business, with 200 tribes operating 126 casinos in 24 states. The decision today may enhance the prospects in Congress for an overall review of the situation.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, where the Atlantic City casinos are strongly opposed to gambling on Indian reservations, said today that Congress should hold hearings to assess the decision and "must enact comprehensive reform to redefine the playing field."
It is quite possible the Court has not yet said its final word on the Indian gaming act. The Justices will act soon on a challenge to the law brought by Oklahoma, which is attacking not only the lawsuit provision the Court struck down today but the ultimate authority of the Federal Government under the 10th Amendment to require unwilling states to accept tribal casinos. That further question was not before the Court today. The Court has not yet agreed to hear the Oklahoma case, Oklahoma v. Ponca Tribe, No. 94-1029, but today's majority may not be able to resist the opportunity.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Surge, but Strike is Cited

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The number of new claims for jobless benefits surged by 43,000 last week to the highest level in nearly four years, lifted by applications from workers affected by the General Motors Corporation strike, which has been settled.
The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 429,000, up from 386,000 in the week ended March 16 and the highest since July 25, 1992. 
 Many analysts had expected an increase of just 11,000.
A Labor Department spokeswoman attributed the increase in part to the 17-day strike at two G.M. brake-parts plants, but was unable to say to what extent. The 34,000 increase in the week ended March 16 was also attributed in part to the strike, which idled about 175,000 workers.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims increased by 17,750, to 382,500, the highest since Feb. 10, 1996.

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Peter Marks 

 BODY:

Love, Valour, Deja Vu
The phone call immediately got Joe Mantello's attention. It was from an actor he knew who had attended a production of "Love! Valour! Compassion!," in Boca Raton, Fla. "I think you might want to look into seeing this," the actor said.
Mr. Mantello, who directed the Tony-winning production of "Love! Valour!" at the Walter Kerr Theater, hopped on a plane. Sitting in the audience at the Caldwell Theater Company in Boca Raton, he felt a sense of deja vu. "It was a 90 to 95 percent replication of the staging that we had done," he asserted. "If you squinted, you actually felt that you were in the Walter Kerr." 
 In the script, Mr. Mantello says, Terrence McNally provides the barest of stage directions. At Caldwell, he says, everything from the staging of the opening tableau to the deployment of props was identical to Mr. Mantello's. On Broadway, a doll house sat on a green mound onstage as the audience entered. At Caldwell, he noted in a four-page letter outlining similarities, "Doll house sits alone on green mound as audience enters."
Enter the lawyers. Ronald Shechtman, lawyer for the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, wrote to Michael Hall, Caldwell's artistic director (and director of the production, which runs through Sunday), demanding that Mr. Hall "cease and desist any further unauthorized use of Mr. Mantello's work" until an acknowledgment was made of the direction's origin and licensing arrangements negotiated.
William McCarthy, development director and lawyer for the 20-year-old nonprofit Caldwell, declined to address Mr. Mantello's claims, but added that Caldwell is "in discussions" with the directors' union. "We are optimistic we will be able to resolve this situation," he said.
A director's work is a gray area in copyright law. Lawyers familiar with intellectual property law say copyrighted work must be in some recorded form; dance notation, for example, is a method of copyrighting choreography. Barbara Hauptman, the union's executive director, says the union is becoming more aggressive. Recently, she said, Gerald Gutierrez won a settlement with a theater in Illinois involving his direction of "The Most Happy Fella" on Broadway.
 
 
 
So Much for the Heartland
 "State Fair," the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical about life at the Iowa State Fair, opened Wednesday to mixed-to-negative reviews. There was more bad news: the show's tour was a total financial failure.
In a March 13 letter to the tour's investors, the show's chief producers, Philip Langner and Robert Franz of the Theater Guild, reported that the six-month pre-Broadway tour lost its entire investment, $2.25 million. While the show made money in big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, they wrote, it lost money in all of the smaller cities it played.
 
 
 
Detective and King
 God for Harry, England and the Delacorte: Andre Braugher, who plays the dogged Det. Frank Pembleton on NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street," has the title role in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of "Henry V" in Central Park, beginning June 18.
"Henry V" will be the 31st play in the Shakespeare marathon's cycle of 36 productions. Clarifying an earlier report on the final marathon plays, the festival says they will be "Antony and Cleopatra," "Timon of Athens," "Henry VIII" and the three parts of "Henry VI" made into two.
 
 
 
Whither 'Floyd Collins'?
 You stage a musical for six and a half weeks off Broadway. Industry people show up in droves. Nonesuch Records makes the cast album. Many reviews are encouraging. What happens next?
That is what Adam Guettel is trying to determine. Mr. Guettel, grandson of Richard Rodgers and composer of "Floyd Collins," which closed on Sunday at Playwrights Horizons, says he is talking to regional theaters about productions of the musical. (Steppenwolf is among them.)
"We weren't surprised that it didn't get moved," Mr. Guettel said, voicing the eternal Off Broadway hope. "But we were disappointed."
Playwrights Horizons also had hopes for it beyond its scheduled run. Tim Sanford, the artistic director, says the musical is about faith, and "the climate is a bit cynical around here."
Mr. Guettel says the Playwrights production convinced him that he should try writing a musical again. "It was kind of a graduate school for me," he said.
 
 
 
Sam Shepard Blitz
 Atlanta may have the Olympics this year, but New York has Sam Shepard. His "Buried Child" comes to Broadway next month; the Signature Theater Company is doing an entire season of his work this fall. Second Stage is the newest venue, presenting "The Tooth of Crime" in partnership with Signature in September.
The 1972 play, set in the world of rock music, will have a reworked script by Mr. Shepard and a new score, by T-Bone Burnett, to replace one Mr. Shepard wrote.
In other twists in the theater world:
*Chubby Checker, of all people, gyrates into the cast of "Grease!" on April 29, replacing Al Jarreau as the Teen Angel.
*The playwrights Lynn Nottage, Tom Donaghy, Christopher Kyle, Doug Wright and Wendy MacLeod are the second group of recipients of Steven Spielberg's $10,000 Amblin Playwriting Commissions, awarded by Playwrights Horizons.
*"Sabina," Willy Holtzman's well-received drama about Sabina Spielrein, a patient and later colleague of Carl Jung, has been extended at Primary Stages on West 45th Street. It is directed by Melia Bensussen, and runs until April 21.
 
 
 
Slam the Door, Serve the Cocoa
 For months, Jennifer Smith has been one of the unsung heroes of "Victor/Victoria." Night after night, hunched over so far her face is hidden, she plays gnarled Madame Roget, who serves Julie Andrews cocoa at Chez Lui, a Paris nightclub.
It's a performance of economy and ingenuity. And just as important, it always gets a laugh. "All I can see is the floor," Ms. Smith said. "I'm always afraid of spilling something on Julie."
Ms. Smith, who became an actress after training as a dancer at Texas Tech, has a second strong turn as a hotel chambermaid in the farcical door-slamming scene in the second act.
They are the kind of moments actors in smaller parts dream of, and Ms. Smith is grateful for them. But she is, she says, under no illusions about how much attention she can reasonably expect. "It is not, after all, called 'Victor and Friends,' " she said.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Making of an Anti

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
"The dictatorship of the Communist Party is maintained by recourse to every form of violence."
Leon Trotsky wrote that in 1924, when he was a leader of the Soviet party. He knew; he was a commander of party terrorism before and during the revolution until he became its victim, causing few to weep. 
 In the Soviet Union, and everywhere else a Communist party came to power, violence was the bedrock of its power. Now the Chinese Communist party stays in power through the unceasing use of violence against its people -- torture, imprisonment and slave labor. Outside its borders, it used the ultimate violence of military invasion to occupy Tibet and for the half-century since to massacre its people and civilization.
But as Chinese missiles were dropping off Taiwan -- the violence of international terrorism -- U.S. China specialists were heard urging a policy that has never worked against any dictatorship, Communist, Fascist, theological or military: persuasion unsupported by political, economic or military sanction.
"Rather than stigmatizing and sanctioning China, the United States should assist those on the mainland who are working to change things" was one example. Michel Oksenberg, a prominent academic on Asia, wrote that in Newsweek and identified those people -- "many" Chinese leaders now in power.
Let's state clearly what is rarely said and often covered up. Attitudes about dealing with dictatorships do not spring full-born from the problem of the moment. They germinate -- from personal background, political leanings, motivation, experience, and above all from beliefs about what is good or evil.
That is true of scholars, officials, businessmen and commentators like myself. None are acting simply as reporters, trying to convey data and present cool analysis. We are advocates for our visions of morality.
We believe one set of attitudes toward dictatorships to be moral and another evil. We do not often say so, possibly for fear of being considered appeasement-soft or warmonger-hard. Americans who advocate persuasion without penalty can speak for their values themselves.
Mine come from the belief that all dictatorships are based on violence and therefore dangerous and despicable. By instinct and experience I am not a non-Communist but an anti.
For me, the question becomes how can we use our economic and political pressure to weaken dictatorships. The corollary is that even if we cannot drastically weaken them, it is a sin to enrich or empower them, synonyms really. I will not buy anything made in China.
No dictatorship was ever wheedled out of violence. The Soviet Union collapsed because of internal rot, economic isolation, increasing American military power preventing expansion of the empire, and dissidents heard abroad, with the help of America's Lane Kirklands.
President Clinton did well in the crisis China manufactured out of fear of democracy on Taiwan -- although Beijing pointedly has not renounced future missile use. But the overall Clinton policy remains to exact no price for the indecencies inflicted on Chinese and Tibetans, and instead to encourage American businesses and officials to push trade with China, including its armed forces. The policy has failed, except to strengthen the dictatorship.
Short of war the U.S. cannot destroy the dictatorship; the Chinese people will do that. But the President can take steps that at least would not shamefully bolster it. Among them:
* Tying tariffs to proven elimination of torture and military action, against the people of China, Tibet and Taiwan.
* Prohibiting export of any U.S. product or technology that would strengthen China's armed forces.
* Eliminating credit or guaranteed U.S. loans for such suicidal trade. (During World War II Americans said sardonically that U.S. scrap iron sold to Japan was dropped on Pearl Harbor; with China it's gone high-tech.)
* Invoking against China the severest penalties available by law for selling nuclear-weapon material to Pakistan or any country.
Similar steps -- plus constancy -- helped end the Soviet dictatorship. They can bring closer the end of its Chinese successor. That goal is in the best interests of the people screaming in the torture cells, of America's security and its morality.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS -- Advertising;
Americans over 50 but under 65 may finally be getting some attention from Madison Avenue.

BYLINE: By Jon Nordheimer 

 BODY:
AMERICANS between the ages of 50 and 64 may finally be getting something their considerable spending power previously couldn't buy: a little respect from Madison Avenue.
Caught in relative demographic obscurity between their more famous Depression-era parents and the ubiquitous baby boomers, this graying but active generation has been largely ignored by advertisers or else lumped with the geriatric set. And many of them are annoyed at getting such short shrift. 
 "Ads on television directed at people my age are only about incontinence or constipation," grumbled Dick Samartin, a 62-year old former Boston investment counselor who lives in suburban Harvard, Mass. "And I am offended that someone trying to sell me a car shows commercials with kids racing around accompanied by a rock 'n' roll sound track."
Lately, though, there are indications Madison Avenue is belatedly recognizing Americans born in the Depression and war years as a distinct economic target, deserving the same attention other age groups get. And while it hasn't come up with a clearly defined message for them quite yet, it is at least wrestling with the problem.
"If you aim a television program for a younger audience, you still reach people in their 50's who are attracted to prime time shows," said Arnie Semsky, executive vice president and worldwide media director for BBDO New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group. "But the reverse doesn't hold true. Younger audiences won't watch programs aimed at older people."
That may be changing, however, Mr. Semsky and other advertising executives said, as the oldest of the boomers turn 50 and ally themselves with their slightly older peers in demanding more sophisticated adult entertainment. Mr. Semsky cited the recent success of films that cut across generations like "Apollo 13," "Sense and Sensibility" and "Grumpy Old Men."
For advertisers, the most compelling attribute of late-middle-agers is probably their pocketbooks. The 24.4 million American adults between 50 and 59 have the highest average discretionary income -- $21,357 -- of any age group ranked by decade, according to the United States Census Bureau. That is 9 percent more than people in their 40's take home, 27 percent more than those in their 30's earn and almost twice the $11,885 average after-tax pay of the under-30 youth market that advertisers lust after so publicly.
And they aren't afraid to spend it. For a cross-country road trip this year, Mr. Samartin and his second wife, Elaine, a landscape designer in her mid-50's, said they would pay cash for a new Chrysler Town & Country mini-van with a sticker price of $23,000. They also recently paid cash for a personal computer and software used in running Mrs. Samartin's business accounts, and they like to lavish gifts on Mr. Samartin's six grandchildren from a previous marriage.
In another sign of 50-to-64-year-olds' growing influence, the American Association of Retired People, a formidable lobbying group with 20.7 million members, is pushing advertisers to make a bigger effort to cater to that group's values and tastes.
Steve Alexander, vice publisher of Modern Maturity, the association's magazine, believes advertisers are clinging to outmoded stereotypes of middle-aged people. "They take this market for granted and don't realize how individuals have changed because of the tremendous social changes that have occurred in the past 30 years," Mr. Alexander said.
Indeed, a recent study commissioned by Modern Maturity showed that people in their 50's experience a far greater range of "life events" -- divorce, remarriage, starting families, switching jobs, providing for aging parents or adult children and the like -- than their parents did or other current generations do.
"These changes have market implications," said Cary Silvers, Modern Maturity's research director. They point to unusual turbulence at a stage of life that many advertisers falsely assumed was settled and predictable, he said, and thus they create untapped marketing opportunities.
"Advertisers lump this age group in with people in their 70's, which is a very short-sighted mistake," Mr. Silvers added.
A lot of Americans in their 50's lead lives more akin to Generation X's fast pace than to the over-the-hill image so often attached to them. Jack Mulroy, a 58-year old bachelor in Chicago who just lost a sales job at AT&T, for example, is using his severance pay to start a new career as a pre-retirement counselor.
"Starting over at this age should be scary but I find it very liberating," Mr. Mulroy said in a telephone interview before heading for a daily workout at his health club. "I don't consider myself old. I feel like I'm 35 or, at most, 40."
Or take Ron and Barbara Stutzman of Cape Cod, Mass., both 59. Married for 40 years, they have taken in stride the disruptive "life events" that A.A.R.P. talks about. Mr. Stutzman lost his job as vice president of human resources at a Boston company before taking on a similar job at another concern. But that didn't stop the couple from spending money; they are currently building a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath house in Falmouth, the first step toward their dream of operating a bed-and-breakfast and antique shop, Mrs. Stutzman said.
"We are very much in a consuming mode with a long list of purchases we have to make of furnishings, rugs and whatever it takes to have a high-quality place," she said with a laugh. She said Cape Cod was filling up with couples 45 or older -- some in a second marriage -- who were opening shops, starting new careers or living in semiretirement, all with the means to travel or pursue new interests.
And taking in a divorced daughter and her child until the daughter could find a job and her own apartment didn't overwhelm them, either. "It has taken a lot of juggling to hold things together," Mrs. Stutzman said. "But we feel we have the energy and zest for life to keep things going."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German Rates Left Unchanged And Dollar Falls Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark after the Bundesbank left German interest rates unchanged.
Many currency traders had been betting that the central bank would cut short-term interest rates at its policy committee meeting yesterday. Several Bundesbank officials in recent weeks suggested that the central bank might have to reason to cut rates to help revive the flagging German economy.
Indeed, as recently as Wednesday, a Bundesbank official was quoted as saying there was room to cut rates despite a report this month of a growing money supply. The day before, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said much the same. But the Bundesbank took no action yesterday. 
 "I guess it's kind of surprising given the comments by Tietmeyer and his boys over the last week or two," said Kevin Lawrie, a currency vice president at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Lower German interest rates would diminish the return on mark-based investments, reducing demand for the currency.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4739 German marks from 1.4845 marks on Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 106.15 Japanese yen, down from 106.55 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5252 from $1.5200.
Analysts speculated that Bundesbank officials were waiting for proof of moderation in growth of the money supply measure known as M-3.
"It is important for them to see an actual decline in the M-3 numbers printed rather than being postulated for them to actually come along with a rate cut," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
But Lisa Finstrom, senior currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc., said that in addition to the money supply, there were other warning signs of inflation that might be delaying action by the Bundesbank.
She noted that Germany's public union called for a wage increase of 4.5 percent yesterday.
"That's too high by Bundesbank standards," Ms. Finstrom said. "The central bank wants to be a bit cautious in here."
Foreign exchange markets watch both inflation and interest rate trends because they affect the value of investments in a country and demand for that nation's currency.
In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.1887 Swiss francs, from 1.1975 Swiss francs and to 5.0263 French francs, from 5.0630 francs.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Show Decline For a 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for a second consecutive session, as market participants grew more pessimistic about the chances that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again soon.
Other concerns weighed on the increasingly bearish market. Traders were bracing for new supply on expectations that Congress would increase the ceiling on the nation's debt. After the market closed, Congress approved such an extension, which means the Treasury can again begin to borrow. 
 Market participants were also positioning themselves ahead of the employment report for March, which is to be released on April 6, and for end-of-quarter volatility as money managers do some window- dressing on their portfolios.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond settled down 16/32 , to 9024/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.72 percent, from 6.68 percent on Wednesday.
Activity was light in the futures and cash markets, exaggerating price movements.
Bond prices started the session by getting a little bounce after the weekly report on initial unemployment claims. The number of claims rose by 43,000, to 429,000, for the week that ended last Saturday. The number, which was inflated by a strike against two General Motors brake plants and the subsequent temporary shutdowns of other plants, matched analysts' expectations.
Signs of economic weakness are often bullish for the bond market, because they indicate that inflation, which erodes the value of bonds, is likely to remain in check.
Prices received little support yesterday from the release of the Conference Board's help-wanted index, which measures the amount of job advertising in newspapers. The index fell to 82 points in February from 85 in January, but remains at a relatively high level, pointing to continued strength in the employment market.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, a market research and analysis concern, said he expected the market to remain on the defensive through next week.
"Looking further ahead, I think the underlying modest growth of the economy will eventually show through in the economic numbers," he said, which will indicate "a modest growth that keeps inflation in check."
But it may take a month or more before the economic data, which have been affected by severe winter weather and the G.M. strike, show such conditions, he said.
At the close of the futures market, prices were near the lows of the day. The June Treasury bond futures contract, which had traded as high as 11113/32 , closed at 11023/32 , or just off its low for the day of 11012/32 .
Mike Zentz, director of capital markets research at Pegasus, a unit of Thomson Research, said: "In only two sessions, bonds have gone from extremely overbought conditions to nearly oversold.
"However, they are not quite there yet, and besides, this is in line with the main trend, and there's a chance that bonds could stay oversold for a day or two."

HEADLINE: Slapp-Happy Companies

BYLINE: By George W. Pring and Penelope Canan; George W. Pring, a law professor at the University of Denver, and Penelope Canan, a sociology professor there, are the authors of "Slapps: Getting Sued for Speaking Out."

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Corporate America complains that lawsuits are crippling productivity. Chrysler is seeking sanctions against lawyers who have filed unsuccessful class-action suits alleging that the company put faulty brakes in cars. A California referendum that would have capped fees for lawyers who represent injury victims was narrowly defeated on Tuesday. Under industry pressure, the Senate passed a tort reform bill limiting damages in lawsuits involving faulty products.
One might almost believe that corporations are constant victims of lawsuits. But they are actually doing much of the suing. 
 More and more often, the companies' targets are neighborhood groups, environmentalists, consumer watchdogs, good-government groups, homeowners' associations and individuals. Their sin? Exercising their First Amendment right "to petition the Government" by speaking out at public hearings or contacting their elected representatives about corporate or government misdeeds.
Lawyers and judges call such suits Slapps, for "strategic lawsuits against public participation." A nationwide study we recently completed for the National Science Foundation found that there were virtually no such suits before 1970, but since then tens of thousands of Americans have been sued and untold thousands have been silenced by threats.
A company filing a suit will usually allege defamation, business interference or conspiracy. But these accusations are just the window dressing necessary to get court attention.
The most frequent Slapps are filed by real estate developers against neighborhood groups and residents who oppose giving them building permits. For instance, SRW Associates of Woodbury, L.I., filed an $11 million suit against 9 community groups and 16 individuals who testified against a proposed development at a public hearing. (The suit was dismissed.)
Corporations sue customers for filing complaints with government consumer protection offices. Businesses sue women's rights groups, civil rights organizations and unions for pointing out discrimination and workplace violations. "Eco-Slapps" are a risk for environmental groups that take on polluting companies, toxic dumps, loggers and even zoos. The Sierra Club has faced 10 such suits.
Perhaps most troubling, government agencies and employees are suing critics. In West Contra Costa, Calif., the sewer district filed a $42 million suit against a resident, Alan LaPointe, and 490 unidentified John Does for opposing its plans to build an incinerator.
The good news is that Slapps are losers; most are dismissed. But a judge's decision is often not the issue. Legal costs can devastate individuals and volunteer groups. As one executive who filed a suit told us, "There should be a price for speaking out against us."
Recognizing that public participation is essential to a democracy, 10 states, including New York, have passed laws against Slapps. New York requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant acted with malice and "reckless disregard for the truth." If a judge rules that a case was brought for purposes of intimidation, the plaintiff can be forced to pay damages and the defendant's legal costs. But only Congress can protect everyone's rights; it should take up a similar Federal bill quickly.
For now, some companies and their lawyers are getting a taste of their own medicine. The legal profession's newest growth industry is "Slapp-backs" -- countersuits filed by Slapp victims for abuse of the courts and violation of First Amendment rights.

HEADLINE: Albany Abandons Budget and Agrees on Stopgap Spending

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders today abandoned their effort to pass a state budget on time because of the budget impasse in Washington. They agreed instead to a stopgap spending measure that would freeze state spending at current levels for four weeks while also allowing a previously approved tax cut to take effect on Monday.
The move insures that the budget will be late for a 12th consecutive year, an ignoble tradition in Albany that has undermined confidence in New York's fiscal policies and driven its bond rating to among the lowest of any state. The state's fiscal year begins on Monday. 
 The measure endorsed today would pay the state's bills under the old spending levels until April 30. But that could worsen the state's finances because the second stage of a cut in state income taxes that the Legislature passed last year at Mr. Pataki's urging is to begin on Monday, costing the state $1.7 billion in the next fiscal year.
In the budget he introduced last December, the Governor had called for deep reductions in state spending on Medicaid, welfare and other programs to help pay for the tax cut. But those plans are now on hold.
At a meeting today, Mr. Pataki told Republican and Democratic leaders of the Legislature that they should quickly come to terms on a new spending plan. He said four weeks should be enough time to wrap up the process.
"The goal is to have us have an orderly month, to continue to observe what is happening in Washington, to not raise anybody's anxiety or fears about state government," Mr. Pataki said.
Mr. Pataki has said repeatedly that despite the state's fiscal problems, he would not consider repealing the tax cut. Both Joseph L. Bruno, majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, and Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who heads the Assembly, have concurred.
The state budget is in disarray mostly because Mr. Pataki based his original plan on changes that he expected the Federal Government would make in its rules for Medicaid and welfare spending. But President Clinton and Congress remain at odds over how to revamp those programs, and without the expected changes an additional $2 billion gap opens.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Pataki presented modifications to his spending plan, contending that he had found new revenues that would patch most of that $2 billion hole, even if the Federal Government took no action.
But many legislators and fiscal monitors expressed skepticism about whether the Governor had really come up with that money, and today's announcement suggested that Mr. Pataki and the Legislature want more time to figure out how to piece together the state budget if a Federal budget is not passed soon.
In recent weeks, Mr. Pataki had publicly clung to the hope that he and the Legislature could agree on a budget by Monday. As it became clearer in recent days that it would not happen, he began lobbying for a stopgap measure that would last only two weeks.
But legislative leaders sought six or eight weeks, and today the two sides compromised on four weeks.
The stopgap measure this year is longer than those that the Legislature routinely passed in previous years when it missed the budget deadline. Last year, before the budget was finally passed in June, the Legislature approved a series of one-week appropriations to keep the state running.
The move today drew criticism from fiscal monitors, who said New York's leaders had rarely shown fiscal discipline. They said they were concerned that because the tax cut would take effect on Monday without any corresponding cuts to pay for it, the budget would be thrown further out of balance.
"This makes an already grim situation grimmer," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a group that studies government finances. "You are phasing in a tax cut without doing anything on the expenditure side. It's a duck. It's the easy way out."
Robert Kurtter, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, which rates government bonds, noted that many other states that were also grappling with the fallout from the Federal stalemate had not delayed their budgets.
Mr. Kurtter, whose firm has given New York the second-lowest rating of any state, after Louisiana, also questioned why Mr. Pataki and the Legislature wanted a postponement when it did not appear that action in Washington was imminent.
"Delaying the budget process to wait for something that doesn't seem to be close to being worked out seems to be waiting for nothing," he said. "It makes one wonder why New York has to go through a ritual that every other state doesn't have to do."

HEADLINE: Immigration Bill Advances in the Senate

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation that would slightly increase the number of foreign-born relatives who can be brought into the country by American citizens and legal residents in the next decade. Most of the relatives would be wives and minor children.
The committee, voting 13 to 4, also adopted provisions favored by business leaders to protect American workers from losing their jobs to temporary skilled foreigners. But backers of organized labor, including the Clinton Administration, said the safeguards were insufficient. 
 The bill could "put hundreds if not thousands of skilled U.S. workers' jobs at risk," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said. Democrats vowed to offer amendments to protect American workers when the full Senate takes up the bill in April.
The panel's action came on the day that the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that the number of legal immigrants had fallen by more than 20 percent during the last two years.
According to the immigration service, 720,461 legal immigrants were admitted in the fiscal year ending last October, down from the 904,292 in the 1993 fiscal year. The 20 percent decline is the largest two-year drop in legal immigration since the 1930's and is part of an overall trend in immigration during the last four years.
Supporters of legal immigration are sure to use these statistics as fresh evidence that efforts to curb legal immigration -- mainly to appease large border states whose social services are being taxed by new immigrants -- are unnecessary. These advocates say the rush to crack down on illegal immigrants has unfairly included attacks on an American tradition of legal immigration that reunites families and serves as a wellspring of economic innovation.
The House last week overwhelmingly approved an immigration bill that would impose tough new restrictions on illegal immigrants, but dropped most provisions dealing with legal immigrants.
The Senate Judiciary Committee this month decided to address legal and illegal immigration in separate bills. The panel's illegal-immigration bill resembles the House provisions. Since the House has few remaining provisions governing legal immigrants, the Senate bill approved today will become the main legislative vehicle this year for changes in legal-immigration law. The full Senate is to consider both bills during the week of April 15.
A coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, supported by religious organizations and pro-immigration groups, today reversed proposals in the original Senate bill that would have cut legal immigration by over 30 percent after five years. Family immigration makes up most of this category.
Instead, the panel adopted, by a vote of 11 to 4, a different family-visa approach offered by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan. That approach allows citizens to sponsor their spouses, minor children and parents. It is expected to allow about 250,000 people to immigrate a year.
The original Senate bill, written by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, would have limited eligible parents to those people 65 or older who had a majority of their children living in the United States and who had health coverage.
The current bill would also allocate 175,000 family visas a year for citizens and legal residents to bring in other relatives. The provision would reserve at least 75,000 of the these visas for children of citizens. The remaining 100,000 family visas would then go to, in priority, the spouses and minor children of legal residents, the children of citizens, the children of legal residents and the siblings of citizens.
Finally, the bill provides an additional 75,000 visas a year for 10 years to help reduce the backlog of 1.1 million spouses and minor children of legal residents and a backlog of 1.6 million siblings of citizens.
As a result, the bill approved today would allow for 500,000 family visas a year for 10 years, compared with 480,000 allowed now, a 4 percent increase. The original Senate bill would have eliminated the adult children and siblings categories.

HEADLINE: FINAL FOUR;
States Put Aside Their Rivalry And Try a Little Cooperation

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
New York and New Jersey may raid each other for businesses, squabble over Port Authority resources, litigate over proprietorship of the Statue of Liberty and feud over the peculiar residency of the Jets and the Giants, two carpetbagging "New York" teams who play in East Rutherford.
The two states may even be preparing their armaments for the coming Battle of the Hudson: Which will be the future home of the New York Yankees? 
 But all you need know about the temporary bond between the states hosting the Final Four in New Jersey is that the logo for the three-game hoop-de-doo at the Continental Arena features Miss Liberty, which the United States Supreme Court ruled belongs to New York even if it stands 8,000 feet closer to New Jersey. Bruce Springsteen could have been the logo's symbol of New Jersey, but he probably would have charged a hefty fee. Lady Liberty is in the public domain.
"The statue captures the area more than anything," said Robert Mulcahy, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and a member of the Meadowlands Organizing Committee. "And she is closer to us."
New Jersey and the Continental (ne Brendan Byrne) Arena became Final Four host-worthy to the National Collegiate Athletic Association once Madison Square Garden's commitments made it unavailable. "To take five or six days out of inventory would be tough," said Paul Munick, the Garden's vice president of athletics and family entertainment. And at this time of year, the Garden also has the circus.
Meanwhile, the Continental Arena had proved itself by hosting N.C.A.A. regionals -- eight East regionals, to be exact.
Still, New Jersey had to augment its relatively slim lodging resources by linking with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau to get coordinated access to the city's nexus of hotel rooms, venues, airports and transportation.
"The nature of our venue is so different from other Final Four venues in Seattle or Charlotte," said Mulcahy. "If you fly into Seattle, you have one airport and one central downtown. We have no city, no downtown, no 1,000-room hotels. We had to overcome that and went to the visitors' bureau for help."
The bureau assembled lodging totaling 23,000 room-nights -- impossible in New Jersey -- and located venues for events like the Fan Jam, which is being held at the New York Coliseum. Cooperation like this last occurred for the 1994 World Cup (held locally at Giants Stadium), but rarely does.
Steve Morello, president of the bureau, said: "There are times we have to cooperate to meet the customers' needs. At those times, it's necessary to overcome our natural competitive desires."
For most of a week, oodles of money will be spent by visitors on food, lodging and souvenirs, and plenty more will be exchanged for scalped tickets for what Mulcahy hyperbolically calls "American's greatest sports event."
But to stage the Final Four, the committee is spending a modest $1.5 million on transportation ($200,000), hospitality ($500,000, mainly for a reception for 5,000 at the New York Hilton), decorations ($300,000), volunteer training and management ($150,000) and arena operations ($350,000). That money is raised by renting 10 luxury suites for $150,000 apiece for six hours of sport.
"But we could have sold another 20," Mulcahy said.
Just as the arena's regular suite-holders know they cannot sit in their boxes during the Final Four (unless they are one of the 10 that paid the extra $150,000), so advertisers know their signs will be plastered over with the event's logo and the names of the 64 teams that started in the men's tournament on March 14.
"The N.C.A.A. wants a uniform look," Mulcahy said. Any chance that arena advertising will conflict with the N.C.A.A.'s sponsors is thus eliminated. The arena will also lose its sponsored identity for the event with an N.C.A.A.-leased floor, without the airline's name, now laid and ready for dribbling.
Mulcahy insisted there were few surprises over the past seven years. But of course, there was the disappointment of not having the 300- to 400-room Meadowlands hotel that the recession scotched. And there were the 160 banners placed along local highways that recently flew away in 100-mile-an-hour gusts.

HEADLINE: U.S. Business Cutting Plans For Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
American businesses plan to spend only slightly more this year than in 1995 on new buildings and equipment, marking a sharp slowdown in an important sector of the economy, a survey released today by the Commerce Department said.
Overall economic growth has depended heavily in the last several years on capital spending by business, and economists said that today's figures were more evidence that growth this year would be anemic. 
 The Commerce Department's Investment Plans Survey estimated that businesses would spend about 1.5 percent more this year on capital goods, which are primarily buildings, machinery and other equipment. If the estimate proves correct, it would be the lowest growth recorded in capital spending since the recession in 1991, and it would be a steep falloff from last year's growth rate of 8.1 percent.
"We've had a boom in plant and equipment spending in the past several years," said Paul L. Kasriel, the chief domestic economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "That has added a lot of capacity to the economy at the same time that demand has slowed down. As a result, businesses do not believe they need to add a lot of capacity."
The overall numbers masked broad differences in spending plans among different types of businesses.
Manufacturers, which account for 30.6 percent of the planned spending, said they expected to spend 7.2 percent more on plant and equipment this year than last year, with the durable goods sector up 10 percent this year.
Economists said the figures appeared to reflect in part the continued strength of export growth for manufactured goods, particularly such capital goods as machinery being bought by foreign companies.
Retailers and wholesalers, however, plan a cutback in spending of 4 percent, in what economists said was a sign of weak consumer spending and overbuilding of stores.
Growth in capital investment has far outstripped growth in consumer spending since the economy started rebounding in 1992, and while today's figures were not a surprise to economists, they served as the latest confirmation that the nation's output this year would expand, according to various projections, by well under 2 percent.
"We don't see a recession," Mr. Kasriel said, "but clearly one of the main engines of growth is shifting into a lower gear."
Some economists said the lower rate of investment growth came not just from corporate decisions about capacity, but from their growing concern about their bottom lines.
"Capital spending plans usually turn weak when profits start to get squeezed," said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence in New York. "Profits should be down 5 to 10 percent this year, so it's not surprising that companies are cutting back plans for purchasing new plants and equipment."
The Commerce Department survey found that companies plan to spend $603.4 billion for capital goods this year, up from $594.5 billion last year and $549.9 billion in 1994. The dollar figures are not adjusted for inflation, meaning that the small percentage increase in planned expenditures this year could actually translate into a smaller quantity of plant and equipment being acquired than last year. The survey got responses from more than 20,000 companies, which were questioned in November about their capital spending for last year and their plans for this year.
"Businesses will continue to invest, especially in equipment, to increase the efficiency of their operations," Mr. Kasriel said. "They feel they can handle without much problem the anticipated order growth, but it's still an extremely competitive business environment and they feel the need to produce that given amount of goods at a lower price."

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Little Changed, With Dow Gaining by 3.97

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were little changed yesterday in quiet trading.
Analysts attributed the trendless market to uncertainty as to whether economic growth would be damaged by higher interest rates. As it did on Wednesday, when stocks fell sharply, the stock market took its cues from bonds, which slumped for a second day. 
 "There was continuing weakness in the bond market," said Edwin D. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A. "Higher yields for bonds are an increasing hurdle for stocks."
The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point during the session declined more than 35 points, closed up 3.97 points, to 5,630.85. Among the broader indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks inched up 0.03 point, to 648.94, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 0.95 point, to 1,094.83.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advancers, 1,272 to 1,053. A total of 368.3 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared with 403 million shares on Wednesday and the three-month daily average of 420 million shares.
Auto stocks -- like many other economically sensitive, or cyclical, issues -- generally turned upward. General Motors climbed 3/4, to 54, and Ford Motor added 5/8, to 34 1/4. But Chrysler eased 1/8, to 62 3/8.
Chemical stocks were higher on projections of a better-than-expected economy. Du Pont closed at 82 1/4, up 1; Eastman Chemical closed at 73, up 1 3/4, and Rohm & Haas, which was upgraded by Merrill Lynch, closed at 68 5/8, up 2.
Traders also rotated into aluminum issues. Alcoa, the biggest gainer in the Dow, increased 1 1/2, to 64 3/8, and Reynolds Metals advanced 7/8, to 59 3/4.
Insurance stocks sold off in sympathy with bonds, as they traditionally do. Chubb dropped 7/8, to 94 1/4; American International lost 1/4, to 95 1/8, and Reliastar gave up 1/2, to 45 3/8.
Interest-sensitive utility stocks followed the same pattern. Allegheny Power closed at 30 1/4, down 1/8; Duke Power closed at 50 1/2, down 3/8, and Brooklyn Union closed at 26 3/4, down 1/8. The Dow Jones utility average sank 1.47 points, to 215.27.
Banking issues were also lower. Wells Fargo fell 1 5/8, to 255 3/8; Mellon declined 1/2, to 56, and Republic New York dropped 1/4, to 58 1/2.
Sybase was off 2 1/2, to 22 1/4, on a negative report from Montgomery Securities. Asarco fell 1, to 34 1/4, after warning that first-quarter earnings would be hurt by a drop in copper prices. And Uromed plummeted 2 3/4, to 11, after stating that it did not expect imminent Food and Drug Administration approval of one of its devices.
On the other hand, Bay Networks was up for another day, jumping 1/4, to 30 1/4, on rumors that it may be acquired by AT&T. Segue Software, an initial public offering, is at 21 1/2. And Zoom Telephonics rose 1 1/8, to 16 1/2, following its withdrawal of an offering of almost 1.7 million new common shares.

HEADLINE: Minimum Pay Bill Falls Short in Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Republican desertions from Bob Dole's leadership today put a clear majority of the Senate behind increasing the minimum wage, but the House voted twice against considering the issue.
Eight Republican Senators voted with all 47 Democrats to support ending debate on the wage question, which President Clinton and Congressional Democrats have labeled a major issue for this session of Congress. But Senator Dole, the majority leader and the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, and 44 other Republicans voted against them. So supporters of the increase -- from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 -- fell short of the 60 votes their motion needed for passage. 
 Even if they had won those votes, the complex parliamentary situation would not have enabled them to bring the issue to a vote any time soon. But the 55 votes made it clear that the issue would continue to haunt Mr. Dole.
"We'll be back offering this, week after week, until we get it passed," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
Not all of the eight Republicans who voted with the Democrats on the procedural issue would necessarily vote to raise the hourly minimum wage. Spokesmen for several of them pleaded ignorance about why their bosses had voted with the Democrats.
But four, Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, made it clear that their votes meant they supported an increase. With 47 Democrats on board, that means the Senate could pass an increase if the issue came to a vote.
Mr. D'Amato issued a statement saying: "Working men and women are having trouble making ends meet. Those who are taking on minimum-wage jobs, by and large, are doing so to get by. We can do better. My vote sends a signal that we recognize the difficult economic situation that some Americans are facing with the Clinton crunch economic policies. We should raise their pay, cut their taxes and help them find jobs."
A spokesman for Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that he did not know why Mr. Santorum voted to end debate but that the Senator was opposed to raising the minimum wage. A spokesman for Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said she believed that the issue should be voted on, but had not decided how to vote.
Spokesmen for the two other Republicans, William S. Cohen of Maine and William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, said they could not locate the Senators or say what their votes meant.
In the House, Democrats struggled to overcome the fact that the minority has almost no ability to force an issue onto the floor if the majority wants it shelved. But Democrats tried twice today to put the minimum-wage question up for a vote, as an amendment to a bill raising the limit on the Federal debt.
They lost 232 to 180, and then 228 to 192. On the second vote, seven Republicans, either moderates or conservatives facing tough races for re-election, voted with the Democrats. Five conservative Democrats voted with the Republicans.
Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, opposed any consideration of the issue. He promised hearings to examine why wages seemed stagnant.
"We'll look at the overall picture," Mr. Goodling said. But he added, "We will not be rushed to do something that will stagnate the economy even more."
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the deputy Democratic leader, complained that the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was now at a 40-year low. Mr. Bonoir also said a low wage interfered with welfare reform because "you can't move from welfare to work if you don't make work pay."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said, "We're going to bring it back and back and back and back until we finally prevail."
The debate in the Senate was explicitly focused on Mr. Dole, though he stayed off the floor. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has led the Senate effort to raise the minimum wage, quoted statements Mr. Dole had made in favor of past increases.
Then Mr. Kennedy broadened his fire to include Speaker Newt Gingrich, saying: "Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole make a remarkable couple. It's like Bonnie and Clyde writing the Republican platform. Newt Gingrich wants to repeal the ban on assault weapons, and Bob Dole wants to block any increase in the minimum wage."
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said, "The attack is on my leader and I resent that."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, insisted that raising the minimum wage would cause employers to dismiss workers. He called the Democratic effort "nothing but a political act of appeasement, or trying to make the leaders of organized labor happy."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Chairman, Train Conductor And 'Regular Guy';
Blues-Playing Union Man Leads Party in Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Chris DePino concedes that he may not be the most typical Republican state chairman Connecticut has had: an Italian-American, Roman Catholic city-dweller who proudly shows off his union card from his job as a Metro-North train conductor.
At the Capitol here, where he is a legislator from New Haven, Mr. DePino talks with relish about the people he has met on the train, from immigrants on their way to housekeeping jobs to vice presidents on their way to Wall Street. He takes out the 48-note chromatic harmonica that he always carries, that he mastered over years of swing time between trains, and says that as much as he loves what he's doing, if Toots Thielemans offered to take him on tour, he would walk out right now. 
 "I try not to lose my focus," said Mr. DePino, who performs with jazz and blues bands at a New Haven club on weekends. "There's life, and then there's politics. I try not to turn it around."
But as he prepares for his party's biggest annual fund-raiser -- the Bush Dinner in May, named for former Senator Prescott Bush, and in 1996 honoring one son, Prescott Bush Jr., with the help of a second, George Bush -- Mr. DePino vows that the Republican future in Connecticut depends on regular guys like him.
"My goal is to break the perception that we're all rich people," said the 43-year-old Mr. DePino, whose 24 years' punching tickets on Metro-North have yet to earn him enough seniority to claim a summer vacation. "We've got to have the ability to grow as a party, and there's a huge bloc of conservative and moderate Democrats we're going after."
"They don't have to change their party," he said. "They just have to vote Republican. And their fingers won't fall off."
Those votes are needed to give Republicans control of the State House of Representatives, whose Democratic majority has blocked efforts by Gov. John G. Rowland, the first Republican elected governor here since 1970, to remake government.
Mr. Rowland, whose political base is Waterbury, a city that swooned over the Kennedys in the 60's and voted for Ronald Reagan in the 80's, has courted the state's largest city, Bridgeport, with offers of economic aid and by supporting an unsuccessful effort to authorize a casino there.
Now, in choosing Mr. DePino as party chairman, Mr. Rowland has elevated an exemplar of both the urban voters he is seeking and the new Republican politicians needed to attract them. Mr. DePino, who took over in January, has twice won election to the Connecticut House from a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 11 to 1.
But can Mr. DePino, the son of a union welder and union seamstress who also happened to be Republicans, duplicate himself among the working people his party has wooed ever since Richard Nixon appealed to the "silent majority" in 1968?
Riding the New Haven Line for more than two decades, he has learned to appreciate the "literally thousands of very decent, genuine people" he has met. He has taught English to Central American immigrants, and been taught Spanish by them; he has played his harmonica over the public-address system on the Friday rush-hour train for executives on their way home to Southport and for strippers on their way to work in Bridgeport.
"The train is my center of gravity," Mr. DePino said. "When I change gears and get on the railroad, I get a rest."
And to win election from Morris Cove and Fair Haven Heights, his district in New Haven, Mr. DePino benefited not only from his reputation as an alderman and from intense door-to-door campaigning, but also from deep ethnic, religious and personal ties in the neighborhood where he grew up.
While the party plans a minority-outreach office to register black and Hispanic voters, Mr. DePino said, the largest group of potential supporters are people just like himself, in neighborhoods just like his.
"Italian-Americans alone are 20 percent of the population," Mr. DePino said, "and as a state we have the largest proportion of Catholics, about 42 percent. I'm not speaking in terms of religion; I'm speaking about political philosophy. The point is that Roman Catholics as a group stand for something. Their moral values stand for something. And when I look at the Republican Party, it's clear to me that it stands for their values."
Unlike the Democrats, he said, Republicans welcome conservative Catholics, whether they support abortion rights or oppose abortion. "I'm a pro-choice Republican," he said, "but if you're a pro-life Catholic, I have a home for you."
Republicans favor school vouchers that would enable poor minority children in cities to attend better schools, he said, and if the better school is a parochial school, so be it. In supporting school choice, he speaks from experience; he is a graduate of a Catholic high school, and his children attend parochial school.
"Besides," he said, "my bishop asked me to vote for it."
Robert M. Ward, a Republican State Representative from North Branford, said Mr. DePino's background was unique for a party chairman but "not greatly different from the base of our party."
"There are plenty of blue-collar Republicans in Connecticut," he said, "It's just not what people see or focus on."
Mr. Rowland echoed that view, saying: "If you go into Bridgeport or Waterbury or New Haven, if you go into a predominantly black or Hispanic area, and you talk about the death penalty or replacing welfare with workfare, or local empowerment, you'll get a more rousing response than you would in Simsbury.
"The problem is that a lot of people think that the people in cities must be liberals, and they're not. They're the ones who are living with crime and living with social problems, and most of them want to see these types of changes."
Democrats and labor leaders praise Mr. DePino, but they say they doubt that his working-guy background is going to shape the party, when Mr. DePino himself says that his job as chairman is to rally support for Mr. Rowland and his agenda.
"Before you get to the politics, you have to look at the individual, and Chris is first-rate," said Representative Thomas D. Ritter of Hartford, the Democratic Speaker of the House. "When the Governor told me that Chris was going to be party chairman, he said, "That means he can't vote with you any more,' and I said, 'As long as he doesn't vote with me any less, I'm happy.' "
"I hope that he is successful in moderating his party," Mr. Ritter continued, "but I'm not sure he's going to do it."
John Olsen, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose state-employee affiliates have been attacked by Mr. Rowland over raises won in arbitration, said, "I agree; Chris has been someone who has been sensitive to labor."
"But this is all an illusion," Mr. Olsen said. "He has a Governor who has an agenda, and his approach is not one of reaching out to working people. No. 1 on his agenda is taking care of the business community. He believes in trickle down."
Mr. DePino acknowledges that his main job as chairman is "to support the big picture, and the big picture is the Governor." And he is enjoying the job.
"When I'm on the stage," he said, "I'm not a politician, I'm not party chairman, I'm just a musician, I'm me, and that's best for me. But there are some perks to being state party chairman: I get to talk to the Governor whenever I want."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Padres' Small Step South Reflects Game's Growing Interest in Mexico

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
When the Republicans gather in San Diego this summer to crown Bob Dole as their presidential candidate, they will also have to debate their stance on illegal immigration, including Patrick Buchanan's call for the building of a wall along the Mexican border.
Yet even as they consider that issue, the hometown Padres will be on the road to Monterrey to play the Mets, the first-ever regular-season series played south of the border. 
 The Padres weren't ordered to leave the country, nor do they have to give up their field at Jack Murphy Stadium to the G.O.P. Rather, the National League team chose to play the three games Aug. 16-18 in Monterrey, where sellout crowds of close to 30,000 are expected.
"It's a way of becoming more of a team with Mexican connections, not just for Mexicans but for Mexican-Americans," said Larry Lucchino, the chief executive officer of the Padres. "It's just a broader marketing base."
Still, the Padres' one small step in this direction reflects a larger, bolder step for the sport. For baseball's view of Mexico is the antithesis of the seal-the-border, shut-them-out fervor sweeping some quarters in America.
But baseball is offering the Mets-Padres series as an hors d'oeuvre for the global-minded. It is also holding an audition for a Mexican metropolis to be a candidate for a major league expansion team. For Monterrey and Mexico City have superseded Charlotte, Orlando, Vancouver and even the once-hot northern Virginia area in the eyes of those who want to see baseball grow to 32 teams before the end of this century.
"Yes, we want to see how the fans respond to those games," said John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, the chairman of the baseball owners' expansion committee, which has doled out new franchises to Miami, Denver, Phoenix and Tampa-St. Petersburg in this decade alone. "I'll be curious myself. I might even go down there.
"I would say that the country itself is one of the most viable situations for us, because of Monterrey or Mexico City. You look at the population down there and the interest in the game, that's what makes it so viable."
The very notion that baseball is thinking of its future in Mexico shows how much the sport has changed. As recently as 1992, it balked at allowing Japanese interests to buy majority interest in the struggling Seattle Mariners.
In a highly criticized isolationist move, baseball introduced bylaws that to this day limit majority ownership in clubs to Americans and Canadians, rules that eliminate not only overseas investors but the only other nation in North America -- Mexico.
Times and financial interests have apparently gone a long way in eroding those xenophobic inclinations. After all, Mexico is full of major markets still untouched by any major league sports as Americans know them. And it is ensconced in a Latin American rim rich with its own baseball history.
Mexico has been home to a professional summer league since 1955. The league, which ranks in caliber with Class AAA in the United States, is already an independent partner in baseball's National Association of minor leagues and has produced, among others, Fernando Valenzuela and Teddy Higuera.
Baseball officials began thinking about Mexico more seriously when they received informal overtures from brokers and wealthy Mexican interests during the scramble for expansion franchises last spring that was won by Phoenix and Tampa-St. Petersburg.
Now, major league owners are aware that Mexico's economy almost melted down in the 1990's and that the collapse of the peso helped spur a wave of immigrants coming into America. "The economic and governmental situations may be such a handicap over the next 10 years that we may not be able to get there at this time," Harrington said. "We will have to look at that as part of our due diligence."
Still, this is one of the precious few caution flags thrown in this discussion.
"If you went just by the demographics, Mexico is on its own list and everyone else is on the next list, if you're talking A and B lists," said Harrington. "If you didn't have to consider the economic troubles and the governmental situation and well, if Mexico City were in the United States, they would have had a major league team a long time ago."
In North America, only New York City (16.3 million) has a larger metropolitan-area population than Mexico City's 15.5 million. Monterrey, located just southwest of Brownsville and Laredo in Texas, has a much smaller area population of two million, but it holds the heart and soul of the nation's baseball pulse.
"The people love baseball, especially in Monterrey," said Colorado Rockies third baseman Vinny Castilla, a Mexican who plays winter ball in his homeland. "In Mexico City, people play a lot of soccer, but Monterrey I think is the best place to get a major league team because of that love of baseball."
Baseball officials need little convincing. The sport already is in partnership with Mexico in many ways, according to Timothy Brosnan, the chief operating officer of Major League Baseball International Inc., the sport's economic expeditionary force.
"We've had a longstanding television partner, Televisa, the national network, that has carried up to three major league games a week live, and all the jewels for as long as I can remember," said Brosnan. "It's a fertile market, almost untapped, but we're poised to tap it."
Said Harrington: "We have two new teams starting up in 1998 and we're three to four years away from serious consideration to do it, again, until we get our economic situations settled. But Mexico's in there. I wouldn't want to get their hopes too high, but they have a lot going for them down there."

HEADLINE: 1995 Was Good for Companies, And Great for a Lot of C.E.O.'s

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A preliminary survey of the compensation of chief executives at a number of America's largest corporations indicates that executive pay may have risen last year at the fastest rate since the mid-1980's, when pay for performance became the guiding principle for rewarding corporate chiefs.
The median salary and cash bonus rose nearly 15 percent in 1995, to more than $2 million, for chief executives at 76 of the largest 150 companies in a survey conducted by an expert on executive pay. That compares with median pay increases for chief executives at large corporations of 11 percent or less since 1988. 
 Add the value of other compensation, mostly in the form of options to buy company stock at special prices, and the median increase in total compensation rose 31 percent last year, to nearly $5 million. Swelled by sharply rising stock prices, this estimated increase was nearly double the rise in 1994 and triple the one in 1993 for those among the 76 executives in their jobs that long.
The increases in executive pay come against a backdrop of stagnation in the earnings of most Americans. The pay of chief executives of publicly traded companies, who number in the thousands, has been rising at an average annual rate of nearly 9 percent since 1990, according to Graef Crystal, the compensation expert who conducted the survey. But the wages and salaries of the nation's workers have never risen by more than 4 percent a year over the same period, the Labor Department reports. Lately the rise has been under 3 percent a year.
While raises for chief executives have for years outpaced what most other people get, the early returns for 1995 are especially significant at a time when some chief executives have been criticized for being rewarded with hefty pay increases for decisions that result in the layoff of thousands of employees.
"Their incentive pay encourages anything that increases the value of the company's stock, and in some cases that means downsizing," said Stephen F. O'Byrne, senior vice president of Stern Steward & Company, a consulting firm.
But many chief executives argue they are being rewarded for making critical decisions that play a big role in determining whether their companies will sink or swim in a highly competitive world. Their large increases in compensation reflect, they say, the valuable executive skills that have made corporate America more successful in recent years, and have enriched their stockholders as well as themselves.
"Most of the escalation in C.E.O. pay reflects healthy increases in profits and shareholder gains," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "That should be applauded."
All this only adds fuel to the growing debate over the pay of chief executives. This is especially evident when chief executives receive big raises in years when their companies' performance lags, a phenomenon widely evident last year among the 76 surveyed.
Moreover, the spread between the pay of the typical worker and chief executive -- a 30-to-1 ratio in the 1960's and more than 100 to 1 today -- creates "an incredibly privileged class of people," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. "These executives are hard-working, driven guys, and if you give them $1 million instead of $10 million, they are still going to be very motivated."
Some experts argue that judging a chief executive's performance is an inexact science at best.
"No one has been able to measure the value of a chief executive," said Nancy Rose, a management expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been trying to do exactly that. "There are so many factors that go into a big corporation's performance, other than what the C.E.O does. But if you tie his pay to the stock and stock prices go up, then he gets the credit."
Each year, starting in late winter, corporations whose stock is publicly traded are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a "proxy statement" that details the pay of each company's top executives. By midsummer, thousands of these reports will be on record and the early returns offer a strong flavor of what is ahead. The 31 percent jump in compensation may taper down to a smaller increase once all the proxy statements are in, including those from companies that are not as large, compensation experts said. But the early returns still suggest that 1995 was a record year. Not since the 1980's, when incentive pay -- mainly stock options -- became the major form of rewarding chief executives, has so large an increase been reported for a group of chief executives. The norm has been under 20 percent.
The 76 examined by Mr. Crystal all come from the nation's 150 largest companies, as measured by the value of their outstanding stock.
A handful of the 76 reports bear out the view of corporate consultants that the directors of major corporations are increasingly insisting on C.E.O. pay packages that more or less match measures of a company's performance. At Johnson & Johnson, for example, Ralph S. Larsen, the chairman, received $3.2 million in compensation last year. That was a rise of 25.8 percent from 1994, or roughly in line with the 21.5 percent compound annual return to shareholders over the last three years of his tenure. Shareholder return is measured by combining the change in a stock's price with the value of the dividends.
But that was not the case for most of the packages. Instead, many chief executives have received compensation increases that exceeded what they delivered for shareholders. For example, Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar, received a total package last year of $4.07 million, up 53 percent from the year before. The payoff to shareholders was notably less, an annualized return of 31.4 percent over the last three years and 8.8 percent last year.
A Caterpillar spokeswoman, while declining to comment, pointed to passages in the proxy statement that said Mr. Fites had met sales and profit goals, and had successfully managed the company during a long strike by the United Automobile Workers, settled last December.
Many compensation experts argue that executives often receive pay increases that are more generous than justified by a company's performance. The reason, they say, is because directors are constantly trying to make sure that their C.E.O.'s are paid enough to attract the best talent to the job. And when word comes of a big pay package for some newly hired executive, pressure builds to raise the pay of other corporate chieftains.
"You get a C.E.O. brought into a corporation to do a tough job and a big package is offered to get him," said Paula Todd, a principal at Towers Perrin, a consulting firm. "And all the other chief executives look at the package and say to their directors, 'I'm a C.E.O. and I'm doing a good job and I should get that pay, too.' And pay almost goes up for that reason. Chief executives don't want to fall in the C.E.O. pay scale."
The survey of 76 large corporations found that three-quarters of the pay increases last year were not in line with company performance as measured by the return to shareholders, according to Mr. Crystal, who compiled the 1995 pay data from the latest proxy reports. This was especially evident when stock performance and pay were compared for the 47 executives in the group who had been in their jobs at least three years.
The average stock price of the companies surveyed rose by a total of 13 percent in 1993 and 1994, and then surged in 1995, so that the rise for the three-year period reached 36 percent. The median value of the stock options, in turn, rose by 50 percent from 1993 through 1994 -- far more than the stock price or shareholder return -- and then took off in 1995, rising a total of 125 percent for the three years.
"The executives should have gotten fewer stock options in 1995, but that did not happen," Mr. Crystal said. "They said their stock went up and they were the geniuses who made it go up and, ergo, they should get more options."
Of the 76 executives, only five received less than $1 million last year in salary and cash bonus. But because of changes in tax laws and accounting procedures, more and more of the compensation of executives has been shifted to incentive pay, chiefly the stock options that permit an executive to buy his company's stock several years later, paying only the price of the stock when the option was awarded. If a stock is valued at $50 a share on the day an option is issued and at $75 three years later, then the C.E.O.'s reward is $25, multiplied by the number of options.
Given that stock prices have been rising with few interruptions since the mid-1970's and that the number of options often runs into the thousands, this procedure has paid off handsomely. But there is a risk that stock prices might drop. In order to value the options in the year they are issued, a complex formula is used that takes into account the various possibilities, including the risk that a stock might fall to a point where the option becomes worthless.
When stock prices rise sharply, as they did last year, then the current value of new stock options also rises. "Even if you issue no more options in 1995 than you did in 1994, compensation jumps sharply, and that is what happened last year," said James Woodrum, a pay expert at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm.
The Gillette Company, the razor and toiletries manufacturer, exemplifies many of the complexities associated with executive pay. The company paid Alfred M. Zeien, its chairman and chief executive, $7 million last year, a rise of nearly 94 percent from the previous year's compensation. The package included a grant of 350,000 stock options, up from 100,000 the year before. Moreover, Gillette's share price rose last year by 50 percent, to $52.13.
One goal of the big pay package was to keep Mr. Zeien, who is 66, from retiring, Patricia Klarfeld, a company spokeswoman, said. Another was to prevent him from being lured away to another corporation, given his success at Gillette. During his five-year tenure, Gillette's earnings per share rose by 18 percent a year, and the return to shareholders increased a total of 253 percent.
Mr. Zeien's base pay -- salary and cash bonuses -- rose 209 percent in that period, to $2.4 million last year from $785,000 in 1990. He also received nearly 700,000 in stock options, and those he could cash in today would bring him upward of $15 million.
"Mr. Zeien has been a very, very successful chairman and chief executive," Ms. Klarfeld said, "and the board wanted to compensate him for his great skill."

HEADLINE: Dijon Journal;
To Arms! Rebuilt Organ May Have German Accent

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: DIJON, France

 BODY:
Burgundy, with its matchless wines and architectural monuments, is the last place you might expect the French to be on the defensive about their culture.
There is little argument from Germans, Americans or anyone else who visits Dijon or nearby towns with names like Gevray-Chambertin, Fixin and Nuits-St.-Georges about the wine. 
 But the French can be touchy and defensive when they see a threat to their cultural heritage, and prone to unease about Germany, which they fear might swallow them up economically in a more closely united Europe.
That fear surfaced in the unlikely setting of the newly restored Gothic Cathedral of St. Benignus, whose historic 250-year-old pipe organ was rededicated this month in a weekend of celebrations after eight years of work. It was built, albeit in the French style of the time, by a German -- Karl Josef Riepp of Bavaria, who stayed in Burgundy and eventually made more money in the wine trade. But of his instruments, he said, "If better ones can be found in Europe, then my name is Jack."
A century later, French organ builders like Aristide Cavaille-Coll could claim superiority over the Germans. But today, French builders are losing contracts even at home to competition from the Netherlands and Germany.
So it was in 1988, when city and state authorities decided to restore Riepp's instrument, built in the French Baroque style, and awarded the contract to a contemporary German builder from Bavaria, Gerhard Schmid, instead of to a French company.
Now, $1.8 million worth of public money later, passions have exploded over the result, with champions of the French musical tradition crying cultural betrayal and showing how fragile European unity can be, even half a century after World War II, once national pride is threatened.
"This is an organ that was classified as a national historical monument, and we had builders in France who were perfectly capable of restoring it," said Michel Chapuis, an organ virtuoso who specializes in French Baroque music but angrily called off plans to play at the rededication in protest at the way the project turned out.
"Mr. Schmid has not restored the Riepp organ at all," he said. "He has turned it into a modern Schmid instrument."
Maurice Clerc, the cathedral organist at the center of the storm, is incensed by the criticism. Mr. Chapuis, he pointed out, was the recording secretary of the state commission that oversaw the restoration project.
"What we're seeing is sour grapes by people who had plenty of time to pay close attention to what was going on but didn't, and now want to find somebody else to blame for being surprised at the result," he said.
On March 8, 2,000 people, many of them German-speakers drawn to Burgundy by the controversy, filled the church and enthusiastically applauded Mr. Clerc's two-hour dedication recital, an eclectic mix of works by French composers, Bach and Lizst.
Mr. Schmid, a bespectacled 71-year-old Bavarian, spent the previous night tuning many of the organ's 7,000 pipes and recovered before the dedication in a sleeping bag tucked up in the loft behind the towering organ case. Rubbing his eyes, he seemed baffled by all the fuss.
"I can't really respond to the criticism," he said. "The organ has just spoken for itself, and maybe after a while it will calm people down."
"Usually," he allowed, "behind the criticism there's a desire that some other organ builder should have gotten the job. I don't wish any of them any ill, but I'm glad the work is finished and I don't see any reason to redo any of it."
Mr. Chapuis thinks otherwise, particularly about the organ's trumpet, clarion and bombarde stops, which have a sonority in French Baroque instruments that he and some other French organists listening on that Friday night thought had been submerged by something more German-sounding in Mr. Schmid's renovation.
"He will have to do a few more months of work on them at his own expense," said Patrick Arnould, the regional curator of historical monuments.
The Professional Organ Builders Group, a French trade organization, warned that national honor was at stake.
"We consider that what has gone on in Dijon is an insult to French builders, to good craftsmanship and to our patrimony," the group said, criticizing the state authorities for letting Mr. Schmid overrun the initial contract by 45 percent and condemning him for lengthening many of Riepp's pipes with a different metal than the original's.
"The Riepp organ was altered considerably seven times after he finished it in 1745," Mr. Clerc retorted. "It was electrified 20 years ago, and we found fewer than 2,000 pipes dating from the 18th century when we dismantled the organ in 1988. We're at the end of the 20th century, and Gerhard Schmid has given us an organ that can play music from all periods, not just French Baroque music of the 18th century."
Mr. Chapuis recently dedicated a new organ modeled after a lost 18th-century instrument by the French Baroque builder Francois-Henri Clicquot, in the former royal chapel at Versailles.
"Bernard Cattiaux and Jean-Loup Boisseau, the builders who did that work, showed that it is possible to be faithful to 18th-century French ideals if you take the trouble to understand them," he said. "Mr. Schmid understood nothing."
Riepp, who had trouble getting his French Baroque-style organ accepted by the church authorities who commissioned it in the 1740's, might have sympathized. By the time he died in Dijon in 1775, he was as well known for the vintages he grew in Vosne-Romanee and Gevray-Chambertin as for the organs he built.

HEADLINE: Texas Joins Other States In Suing Tobacco Industry

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Texas yesterday became the seventh state and the largest yet to sue the tobacco industry, seeking an end to advertising the state says is aimed at children, as well as more than $4 billion in compensation for Medicaid spending on tobacco-related illnesses since 1980.
In a shift in tactics from the states that filed earlier, Texas sued in Federal rather than state court and is basing its claims in part on Federal racketeering, conspiracy and fraud statutes designed for use against organized crime syndicates. The suit also alleges that the defendants violated Federal and state antitrust laws and state public nuisance laws. 
 "The tobacco industry has violated the law for so long and in so many ways it has become standard operating procedure," said Dan Morales, the Texas Attorney General. "History will record the modern-day tobacco industry along side the worst of civilization's evil empires."
The defendants include Philip Morris Companies Inc., the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the Lorillard Tobacco Company and the Liggett Group Inc. Also named were the American Tobacco Company, which has been acquired by Brown & Williamson, B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., which is Brown & Williamson's British parent, and the United States Tobacco Company, the leading maker of snuff and chewing tobacco. The remaining defendants are the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research USA Inc., two industry-financed organizations, and Hill & Knowlton Inc., the industry's longtime public relations adviser.
"The Attorney General's legal theories have no support under state or federal law," said Philip Morris, the industry leader, in a written statement issued at its New York headquarters. "Every industry in Texas is now on notice that it may be the target of a politically motivated lawsuit."
Brown & Williamson, which is based in Louisville, Ky., accused Mr. Morales of trying to "retroactively change the rules" governing the sale of a legal product.
The decision to file the suit in the Federal court in Texarkana, Tex., reflects tactical considerations as well as the use of the Federal statute. Judge David Folsom, the only judge in the court, is relatively new and has a lighter caseload than state judges do. Texas hopes that will lead to faster pretrial preparations and a trial within 18 months.
Lawyers familiar with tobacco litigation say the effort to invoke the Federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, faces an uphill battle. A Federal judge in San Diego threw out a suit based on the act and filed against the industry in 1994 on behalf of addicted smokers, ruling that their personal injuries were not covered by the statute. Texas will argue that its claim for economic losses can be distinguished from that case.
"Beyond that, there's more evidence emerging," said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University professor working with Texas on its case. "With every added whistle-blower coming forward, there's more evidence of conspiracy to prevent the development of safe products."
Tobacco companies deny that they have squelched product safety research or shared information on product development. They also deny the state's charge that their advertising is directed at children.
Investors shook off their tendency of recent weeks to drive tobacco stocks lower with each potentially negative piece of news. Philip Morris shares actually rose $.75 to close at $88.375.
Texas's suit adds a twist to the political cross-currents in the tobacco wars, in which Democrats have been leading the attacks and Republicans repeatedly taking stands as defenders of the industry. At both the state and national level, Democrats have been accusing the Republicans of being influenced by the tobacco companies' hefty campaign contributions
In Texas though, Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican, has described the strategy of suing the industry as "interesting" and the decision whether to do so as one for his Democratic Attorney General. That is a stark contrast to Mississippi, where a fellow Republican, Gov. Kirk Fordice, has gone to court to challenge the authority of Michael Moore, a Democratic Attorney General, to pursue a similar suit. Moreover, Bob Bullock, a Democrat who is Texas's Lieutenant Governor, has said he is an addicted smoker who wants to be a witness against the companies.
"This issue is breaking through," said Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, an outspoken advocate of tougher regulation and criminal prosecution of the tobacco companies. "There is going to be enough political pressure to hold these companies culpable to reach both parties."
Besides Texas and Mississippi, the states suing the industry are Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota and West Virginia. A half-dozen other states are considering similar actions, lawyers involved in the litigation say. In every case, the suits are being managed by private lawyers working on a contingency-fee basis, thus minimizing the upfront costs to the states.
Texas has not yet decided whether to join a proposed settlement that Florida, Massachusetts, Mississippi and West Virginia reached early this month with Liggett, the smallest of the cigarette makers.

To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis (column, March 25), describing California's proud history of state-supported higher education, notes the contribution of Govs. Earl Warren and Edmund G. Brown Sr. 
 The current Governor, Pete Wilson, and I were law school classmates at the University of California at Berkeley. As California residents, we paid, at most, $100 a semester in administrative fees. Mr. Wilson has apparently forgotten his own indebtedness to free higher education. Perhaps he never understood it was the engine behind California's economic growth.

HEADLINE: A Safer Way to Dredge New York Harbor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree that we need secure containment sites for the contaminated dredge spoils that need to be dredged out of New York Harbor (editorial, March 24). But "deep holes capped by tons of clean sand" are not always secure containment sites.
Twenty thousand signers have joined me in opposing that approach. A better approach, urged by prominent environmental scientists, would be to use sand-capped pits in Newark Bay that would not contaminate the marine life in Lower Bay borrow pits off Staten and Coney Islands that is critical to waterfront businesses and commercial and retail fish operations. 
 Our coalition supports the restoration of shipping activity in New York City and the reopening of the Brooklyn port. In the 1960's, container shipping activity was shifted to New Jersey, costing New York thousands of jobs.
Given new technology, the harbor dredging and disposal operation could be performed without risking our health, the marine environment, coastal integrity, our recreational pursuits and other economic interests.

HEADLINE: Product Liability Bill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to your March 21 editorial and recent news articles, under the product liability bill since passed by the Senate and the House, people who are injured by defective products would still be able to collect damages for their economic losses ("lost wages, medical expenses and damaged property") and for non-economic injuries like "pain and suffering," loss of consortium and emotional distress. 
 The bill limits punitive damages only to the greater of two times all damages (economic and non-economic) or $250,000 for each claim filed. If a judge determines that the amount of the punitive damage is not adequate to punish the defendant, he or she can award more punitive damages up to what the jury awarded. The only exception to that punitive damages rule would be a case in which the defendant is a person whose net worth is less than $500,000 or a small business or organization with fewer than 25 employees. In these cases, punitive damages cannot exceed $250,000 in a single award.

HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;
Noble and Self-Sacrificing, A Long-Distance Mother

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
If one were being facetious, Josephine Perera, the subject of Nilita Vachani's documentary film "When Mother Comes Home for Christmas," could be described as a Sri Lankan answer to Mildred Pierce. A widowed mother of three, who selflessly dedicates herself to making a better life for her ungrateful brood, Josephine is one of thousands of Sri Lankan women who have left their country to earn high salaries (by Sri Lankan standards) as domestics elsewhere.
The money they send home is so vital to the tottering economy that the Government gives instruction in modern housekeeping. The film visits a class in which aspiring domestics are taught everything from microwave cookery to the use of condoms. 
 The film begins in Athens, where Josephine works for an affluent Greek family with two young children. Almost every cent of the $500 a month Josephine earns is sent home. As the movie shows, her salary goes a long way in Sri Lanka. Josephine has bought a touring bus for her eldest son and has kept her youngest son in boarding school. Although she regularly writes letters to her grown-up daughter, they are not answered.
"When Mother Comes Home for Christmas" follows Josephine as she makes her first visit home in eight years and discovers to her chagrin that no amount of long-distance love and material help can assuage her children's bitterness. Her lonely, isolated daughter is rushing into a hasty marriage that will have no financial footing except what Josephine can provide. Her youngest son has been caught stealing and is earning poor grades at an austere boarding school that he hates. Although her bus-driver son seems to be making a go of it, it will be years before his vehicle will be paid off.
In the movie, which is being shown at the Museum of Modern of Art tomorrow and Monday at 6 P.M. as part of the New Directors/New Films series, Josephine emerges as a noble, self-sacrificing woman who hasn't lost her zest for life, although at moments she breaks into tears and wonders how long she can continue to be a workhorse. Adding to the pathos are her memories of a wretched marriage to an abusive husband.
"When Mother Comes Home for Christmas" presents an intriguing portrait of Sri Lankan society, but it is one of the cruder films in the New Directors series. Messily structured, with several unnecessary tangents and a voice narration than can be confusing, it offers a jumble of vignettes that never quite jell.
 
WHEN MOTHER COMES HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
 
Directed, produced and edited by Nilita Vachani; written in English and Sinhalese, with English subtitles; director of photography, Vangelis Kalambakas; music by Ross Daly.

HEADLINE: In Cuba, A Musician As Outsider And Idol

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, March 29

 BODY:
Carlos Varela is one of Cuba's most popular singers and songwriters, yet it is almost impossible to find his records on sale in stores here. Many radio stations simply refuse to play his music, and he hardly ever appears on television. But when he walks down the street, Cubans of all ages stop him to talk about the meaning of his songs.
Paradox, in fact, seems to be the concept that best defines the career of this 32-year-old guitarist and bandleader. More by circumstance than choice, Mr. Varela has become a figure both idolized and marginalized in Cuba. He has also found that the Cuban exile establishment, which normally embraces everything that is frowned upon here, also regards him with suspicion. 
 These are not easy times for Cuban musicians and artists who are seeking an independent path. Just as Mr. Varela's latest record, "Como los Peces," on the Ariola label, was being released in the United States last year, the Ministry of Culture here was moving to shut down the private recording studio and management company of Pablo Milanes, one of Mr. Varela's mentors and probably the country's most prominent singer and songwriter.
"What is important for me is to be able to think, to read, to write, to create, to compose," Mr. Varela, a slight, bearded figure who is as energetic offstage as on, said in an interview here. "All I want to do is write songs that reflect how my generation of Cubans lives: our dreams, likes and dislikes and what it means to be living in Cuba at this moment."
Mr. Varela's first brush with notoriety came after he wrote "William Tell," a retelling of the Swiss legend that finds the son battling to take the place of his father the archer and resenting the older man's stubborn unwillingness to step aside. The ballad became an anthem for young Cubans chafing under the ideological rigidity imposed by a socialist state.
" 'William Tell' was a song that I wrote practically in 10 minutes," Mr. Varela said. He introduced it in 1989, just as the Soviet bloc was collapsing and doubts about Cuba's future were increasing. "There was a kind of catharsis," he said, "but I never could have imagined the dimensions it would have."
Among Cubans here and abroad, "William Tell" has been widely interpreted as an allegory about Fidel Castro's insistence on remaining in power and his resistance to political and economic reforms. Mr. Varela, however, will neither endorse nor reject that reading.
"I'm not going to tell you that I wrote it solely for that, because that would not be correct," he said. "To say that William Tell is one person, or to say the lyrics have only one meaning or another, would be to underestimate the song. Yes, 'William Tell' was written on the basis of something one lives through on a daily basis here. But in reality, I must confess to you that I wrote the song thinking of father and son, of the conflict of generations."
Since then, Mr. Varela has cemented his reputation, and fed the apprehensions of Cuba's old guard, with a series of equally bold compositions. On his 1992 record, "Monedas al Aire" (Qbadisc QB-9010), he addressed the collapse of the Soviet bloc in "Now That the Maps Are Changing Color"; expressed disgust for propaganda and indoctrination in "Like They Did to Me," and documented the erosion of Socialist ideals in "Wall."
That penchant for politically sensitive themes means that program directors at most state-controlled radio and television stations are reluctant to play Mr. Varela's music. But he has discovered that there are fewer impediments to live performances, including those at the prestigious Karl Marx Theater here, where he draws a full house whenever he is allowed to play. And like the Grateful Dead, he has grown accustomed to seeing audiences tape his songs so they can be copied and passed around to other fans.
"If I introduce five new songs today," he said, "in a concert a month from now, five thousand people will be singing along in unison, without these songs having been played even once on radio or television."
Despite his image here as an artist at odds with the system, Mr. Varela finds his relationship with the Cuban exile world to be as ambiguous and uneasy as that with the Cuban state. To be accepted by the Miami exile establishment, musicians, actors, painters and writers are expected to defect to the United States, then show up at a radio station for a ritual denunciation of Fidel Castro and any former colleague who chooses to remain here.
Mr. Varela, however, refuses to take that step, which would also enable him to gain access to the American market. "I don't question where you want to live, so don't you mess with me," he said. "I want to continue making my music, which is a music that is not easy to make in my country. I'm not an artist who has been given privileges by the system. Nevertheless, I want to continue returning here, and I believe I have that right, don't I?"
Under pressure from Cuban-American exile groups in Miami who thought otherwise, the all-music cable network MTV Latino in 1994 withdrew from its rotation a video of the song "Robinson," in which Mr. Varela likens the isolation of Robinson Crusoe on his island to Cubans on theirs. But that has been only one of Mr. Varela's problems in reaching young Hispanic listeners in the United States.
"In Cuba, there are people at the radio stations that won't play my music, and in Miami there are people who aren't willing to accept that my music is being played there," he said. "So the question becomes, 'Where do they want me to go and live?' "
Over the last decade, Mr. Varela has recorded and toured regularly in Latin America and Europe, winning a loyal following there. But the American embargo on travel to Cuba and trade with it makes it virtually impossible for him and other Cuban musicians to perform or record in the United States, which in turn makes it difficult to promote his records, commercial though they may be, in the American market.
"We're caught in the middle," said an executive at the Miami headquarters of Mr. Varela's American record company, BMG Records, a branch of the German conglomerate Bertelsmann. "I can't take people down to Havana for a showcase, and he can't come up here. It's very controversial with him right now."
In musical terms, Mr. Varela does not conform to stereotypes either. He and his six-man electric band have a vocabulary that includes not only traditional mainstays of Cuban music like salsa and cha-cha-cha, but also modern rock-and-roll and international pop, which often comes as a surprise to foreign audiences that encounter him for the first time.
"It always makes me laugh when I go to Spain, and they say to me, 'But you have so many connections with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon,' " he said. "Well, why shouldn't I? I'm from a generation that in addition to living with Cuban music has grown up with the best of American music, so it all seems perfectly coherent to me."
It was hardly surprising, then, that Mr. Varela said he not only would be interested in recording and performing in the United States, but also fully expects to do so before his career ends. "This situation is absurd and foolish, and it has to end some day," he said.
"I'm not directly identified with any political party or position, nor do I want to be," he continued. "What I want is for my songs to be like scissors that cut the strings that have made us puppets for so many years, inside Cuba and out. To me, all of us Cubans have the right to defend each other, everywhere, and I believe that many, many young people inside Cuba and out think just as I do."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Drop 1.3% As Midwest Cold Hurts Buying

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
New-home sales slid nationally in February for the first time in four months, as unusually cold weather in the Midwest disrupted buying.
Sales improved in the Northeast, South and West, but a 24 percent plunge in the Midwest pulled down overall sales of single-family homes by 1.3 percent, to an annual rate of 700,000, seasonally adjusted, the Commerce Department said today. 
 "If we had had better weather in the Midwest, we would have had a better overall number," Eileen Neely, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Corporation, said.
Still, said Stan Duobinis, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, "700,000 is a surprisingly strong number compared with what we've seen for the last two years." He attributed the figure to buyers who were taking advantage of relatively low mortgage rates.
Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors reported that home resales surged a surprisingly strong 6.5 percent in February and also attributed the gain to low rates.
The rates, however, began inching up during the month. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, which hovered around 7 percent before starting to rise, averaged 7.69 percent this week.
Ms. Neely said the higher rates could mean that the January-February sales levels would be the highest of 1996.
The Mortgage Bankers Association has already reported declines in home-loan applications for three consecutive weeks, Ms. Neely said. That will lead to declining sales in the coming months, she said.
The February decline was the first since October, when sales fell 1.6 percent. The new report showed that sales in January were stronger than previously thought, totaling 709,000 at an annual rate rather than the 693,000 originally estimated.
As a result, sales during the first two months of this year were 19.1 percent higher than during the corresponding period of 1995.
The report also said the estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 368,000, seasonally adjusted. That would supply six months' sales at the current rate, the smallest reserve since a backlog of the same size last August.
The inventory level "should allow housing starts to stay at a higher level than otherwise would be the case," Ms. Neely said. Because of the higher mortgage rates, "there will be a decline, but not to the degree some people had thought."
The median price of a new home was $134,900, meaning that half of the homes cost more and half less.
Sales in the Midwest plunged to an annual rate of 117,000, lowest since 106,000 a year earlier. In the Northeast, sales jumped 23 percent, to a 58,000 rate, after plunging 42 percent during the blizzards of January.
Sales rose 8.7 percent in the West, to a 213,000 rate, and in the South, up six-tenths of a percent, to 313,000.

HEADLINE: Bonds End the First Quarter on Upbeat Note

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bond market ended the first quarter yesterday on a positive note, as buyers emerged and prices rose.
Bonds were bolstered by reports on manufacturing and housing that suggested the economy was expanding slow enough to keep inflation from accelerating. The data appeared to keep the door ajar for another cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve this spring. On Tuesday, Fed policy makers left interest rates unchanged. Their next meeting is scheduled for May 21. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 19/32 , to 9111/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.67 percent, from 6.72 percent on Thursday. A week ago, the yield was 6.64 percent.
A report by the Chicago Purchasing Managers Association showed growth but with modest price pressures. The purchasing managers' index rose to 47.3 in March from 44.9 in February. While the index number was higher than expected, the report also showed that manufacturers were paying lower prices, as the prices-paid component showed sluggishness as it slipped to 46.8 from 49.1. The Chicago purchasing managers' report is seen by the market as a precursor to the report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which is to be released on Monday.
In other data, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell 1.3 percent in February, to 700,000 annualized units from 709,000 in January. And traders said the University of Michigan's March survey pointed to an improvement in consumer sentiment, showing little difference from the preliminary results of the survey earlier this month. The university's surveys are released only to subscribers.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, noted that the bond market seesawed within a narrow price range this week, ignoring most economic reports.
"The February new-home sales edged lower, but all three winter months have seen solid home sales in response to falling mortgage rates," Mr. Hoffman said. "The spring home-buying season, however, will be weaker in response to the recent rise in mortgage rates."
But next week, he said, the market's attention will be focused on several important economic reports, including the purchasing managers' report and the Labor Department's March employment report on Friday.
"The bond market is searching for clarity in these numbers," Mr. Hoffman said. "Unfortunately the G.M. strike will make this data as clear as mud. In response the bond market may spend another week continuing to trade within a narrow band."
In addition to these reports, the market is also bracing for another round of new supply, which was largely absent in March. After Congress raised the nation's debt limit on Thursday night, the Treasury plans to return to the market in the next two weeks.
In addition to its regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the Treasury plans to sell new one-year bills on Tuesday and two-year notes on April 8 and five-year notes on April 9. In when-issued trading, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.75 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 6.09 percent. The Treasury will also sell nine-day cash management bills on Monday.

HEADLINE: Jan. 31 Rate Cut Unanimous at Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers, confronted with signs of a slowing economy, were unanimous in lowering a key lending rate at their Jan. 31 meeting, minutes of the session disclosed today.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10 to 0 to trim the target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent at the meeting. 
 The full Fed board also voted 5 to 0 that day to lower the more symbolic discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges for loans to commercial banks -- by a quarter-point, to 5 percent. January's actions followed a similar quarter-point reduction in the Federal funds rate on Dec. 19.
"Although a pickup to an acceptable rate of expansion was seen as the most likely course for the economy in coming quarters, the risks of a shortfall in growth were believed to be significant," the minutes said. Some members suggested an even larger rate cut could have been warranted, "but they preferred a cautious approach," according to the minutes.
At their most recent meeting on Tuesday, the policy makers took no action on interest rates.
The minutes from Jan. 31 also showed that the Fed policy makers did not expect the decision to lower the Federal funds rate would undo their effort to prevent consumer prices from accelerating.

HEADLINE: For $125 Million Cash, City Cedes Budget Control

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
In exchange for an immediate cash infusion of $125 million from the Municipal Assistance Corporation to close this year's budget gap, the Giuliani administration has accepted the corporation's demand to cut projected city spending by $125 million for each of the next four fiscal years, according to details of the agreement made public yesterday.
The agreement represents the first time since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's that the city has agreed to let a state agency set its spending limits. 
 Administration officials defended the arrangement as a sound deal that would help the city solve its immediate budget problem while not necessarily binding it to any spending priorities. They said that if the city's actual spending strayed from the figures set out by the agreement, the city need only to repay the $125 million.
City Council leaders lashed out at the Giuliani administration for entering into what they characterized as a secret agreement that essentially would cede ultimate control over the city's budget to a state agency.
Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone demanded that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani rescind the agreement, which still must be formally approved by the corporation's board. He harshly criticized the arrangement because the spending limits are based on the Mayor's January financial plan, a document that traditionally is extremely tentative and is filled with budgetary assumptions that do not materialize or are significantly altered by the time a budget is adopted in June.
Later-year spending ceilings delineated by the corporation are based on preliminary budget figures for the years 1997 through 2000 that were proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in January. Those future-year budgets are highly tentative.
"This is purporting to write in stone our priorities for the next four years," Mr. Vallone said. "You might as well close shop and let Big M.A.C. and the Financial Control Board take over. Well, we're not prepared to cede our job to anyone else at the moment." Mr. Vallone asked the Mayor to rescind the agreement today, but the Mayor has not responded.
The Municipal Assistance Corporation, which has four members appointed by the Mayor and five by the Governor, was created to sell bonds to keep the city's finances afloat during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. The corporation pays off those bonds by tapping the city's sales tax revenues.
The Financial Control Board mentioned by Mr. Vallone was set up in 1975 to actually rein in city spending, but it officially gave up that power in 1986, when the city was in an economic boom. State law requires it, however, to continue to monitor the city's finances until 2008.
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, also strongly opposed the deal, calling it "an abomination" because "it ties the hands of the City Council, abrogates the City Charter and the public's role in the budget process and further erodes basic services in the city."
The Mayor insisted that the agreement with the Municipal Assistance Corporation would not actually force the city to meet specific spending totals in the next four years. He said the agreement was no different in principle from the one the city and the corporation agreed to two years ago when the agency gave the city $200 million to finance severance packages that ultimately persuaded about 14,000 workers to leave the city payroll.
But while the previous agreement required the city to reduce its work force over a given period of time, it did not set specific spending limits. The current deal would set an overall spending total for all agencies that are completely under the city's control. Agencies such as the Board of Education and the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which rely heavily on state and Federal financing, would not be included.
The Mayor also said that he was perfectly comfortable committing to an additional $125 million cut in overall spending because he had already asked city agencies to come up with $200 million in savings for the next year.
"It's easy for me to agree to it because I know we're going to do a lot more downsizing than $125 million," Mr. Giuliani said.
Edward V. Regan, chairman of the corporation and a former state Comptroller, would not comment on the specifics of the agreement. He said, however, that he had already discussed it with the other members of the corporation and expected its formal ratification soon.
Officials of the State Financial Control Board would not comment on the agreement, but the city's two other fiscal monitors, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, both said they believed the deal was technically and legally sound.
Still, Leah C. Johnson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Hevesi, said Mr. Vallone had raised "significant charter issues" regarding the Council's role in the budget process that should be addressed.
Mr. McCall also said it was unfortunate that the administration did not try to resolve the Council's concerns before signing off on the agreement. He added, however, that he did not believe the agreement would place the city under outside financial control, as Mr. Vallone charged.
"We don't read it that way, because there's a way out of it," Mr. McCall said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Toyota Sets A Buyback Of Its Stock

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 29

 BODY:
In a highly unusual move, the Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would spend up to $1 billion to buy back its own stock.
Toyota's stock buyback appears to indicate that Japanese companies are beginning to pay more attention to their shareholders. 
 Buybacks, which are often used in the United States to raise a company's stock price, have been virtually unheard of in Japan, where shareholders are more docile. Securities analysts have long said that one of the competitive strengths of Japanese companies is that they can focus on long-term goals and use their cash to expand their businesses, without having to worry about share prices or short-term earnings.
Indeed, just a few months ago Japanese auto companies were relieved that they were not in the same situation as the Chrysler Corporation, which wanted to save its cash for its business but was being pressured by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to use it to reward shareholders.
But now, things are slowly changing in Japan, in part because a sour economy and low interest rates have forced institutional investors here to seek higher returns on their stock holdings. "It's becoming increasingly important to be aware of shareholders," said Saul Rubin, an analyst at SBC Warburg Japan Ltd.
In November, in an effort to bolster the stock market, Tokyo suspended for three years a tax that had strongly discouraged stock buybacks. Before the suspension, all shareholders of a company that did buy back some stock would be taxed on the ground that with fewer shares circulating the value of the remaining shares had risen.
Since the change in the law, a handful of companies including the Sumitomo Corporation, Asahi Breweries, the Tonen Corporation and Amway Japan have announced stock buybacks. With Toyota, one of Japan's largest manufacturers, now giving the concept respectability, the movement could accelerate, though no one expects it to turn into a rush.
"Everyone is just testing the waters at the moment," said Kathy Matsui, vice president and chief strategist in Japan for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Toyota said it would buy back up to 100 billion yen of its stock, with details to be decided in May and shareholder approval sought in June. At today's closing price, that would represent 42.37 million shares, or about 1.1 percent of the company's 3.74 billion shares outstanding.
Toyota's announcement was made after the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company's stock fell 10 yen, to 2,360, on a day when the Nikkei index of 225 issues climbed 111.03 points.
Although a Toyota spokesman said the move was intended to benefit shareholders, the auto maker did not appear to be responding to any particular shareholder pressure.
Rather, Toyota apparently felt obliged to set an example. That is because its chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, is also the chairman of Keidanren, a business lobbying organization that has been urging stock buybacks to bolster the market.
Toyota can well afford it. The parent company had 1 trillion yen, or about $10 billion, in cash as of the end of September, its latest reporting period. It also owned $4 billion in marketable securities.
Stock in many Japanese companies is largely held by friendly affiliated companies -- banks, suppliers or customers, or other members of the keiretsu, or industrial group. Such shares are held to cement the relationship and ward off takeovers and are therefore not easily sold.
In Toyota's case, 93.2 percent of the shares are held by such long-term investors, leaving only 6.8 percent floating in the market, said Peter Boardman, an auto industry analyst at UBS Securities in Tokyo.
The result is that while American companies are said to be run for the shareholders, Japanese companies are managed for the employees. The return on equity in Japanese companies is less than 3 percent compared with 23 to 25 percent in the United States, according to Ms. Matsui.
But now, Japanese companies are feeling pressure to raise stock prices or dividends. Some of that pressure is coming from foreign investors, who now own about 10 percent of the stocks compared with about 4 percent in 1989, Ms. Matsui said.
Even domestic institutional investors are starting to seek higher returns on stock holdings.
Still, a survey conducted by the Life Insurance Association of Japan a few months ago found 70 percent of companies saying they had no interest in buying back their stock.

HEADLINE: January Gap In U.S. Trade Grew Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened sharply in January to nearly $10.3 billion, reversing its performance of late last year, when the Clinton Administration boasted that its policies contributed to a drastic improvement in American competitiveness, Commerce Department figures showed today.
The surprisingly big trade gap -- the amount by which imports of goods and services exceeded exports -- was marked by record purchases from abroad and an almost equal drop in sales to foreigners. 
 Analysts said the figures suggested that in the months ahead, trade would provide scant support for the economy because exports would do little to create jobs.
While the January figures represent an aberration to some degree, Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, observed that export growth had been slowing for nearly a year. This, he said, suggested that with the disappearance of the temporary factors, the trade gap would settle in a range of $8 billion to $9 billion, compared with just under $7 billion in the final two months of 1995.
"The trend is toward a slower pace of exports," Mr. Niemira said, citing a growth rate now halved from the 20 percent or so that prevailed early last spring.
And Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for First Union National Bank in Philadelphia, said, "Forecasts that an improving trade deficit would be a significant factor in causing the economy to grow at a more sustainable 2 percent to 2.5 percent pace in 1996 may have to be revised." For the final quarter of last year, the economy grew at an annual pace of just under 1 percent.
Analysts and securities markets took the trade data in stride, apparently recognizing that special factors had magnified the $3.3 billion January surge in the deficit. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.71 points, though the sharpest drop was concentrated in late trading -- long after the 8:30 A.M. trade report.
The main factors in the sharp January rise were said to be severe weather, a jump in the price of oil and the lingering effects of a strike at the Boeing Company, analysts said. Some also speculated that the partial shutdown of the Federal Government may have delayed the permits needed for certain high-technology exports.
"It looks like exports were kept down pretty good while imports kept on coming," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International in New York.
He said the biggest factor was the blizzard, which had slowed or halted shipments in the Northeast, and flooding in other parts of the country that had crippled transportation.
Nonetheless, it seemed likely that a widening trade deficit could become more than the province of Patrick J. Buchanan, who based much of his effort to win the Republican Presidential nomination on the Clinton Administration's trade policies, which he said had cost American jobs and held down incomes. Among other things, President Clinton supported ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement and other market-opening measures.
In January, exports of civilian aircraft plunged to $445 million, not seasonally adjusted, the lowest level in 18 years. The drop reflected the Boeing strike, which ended in December.
Over all, exports declined 2.2 percent in January, to $66.6 billion, with telecommunications equipment combining with aircraft to account for more than 85 percent of the drop from December's export record.
Meanwhile, imports climbed 2.4 percent, the bulk of it because of a higher bill for foreign oil and for automotive goods. Oil cost the nation 12.5 percent more than it had in December, reflecting a modest rise in volume, to an average 7.43 million barrels a day, and a 59-cent surge in price, to $16.45 a barrel.
The result was the biggest deficit since $11 billion in July.
The report showed that the nation's surplus in trade of advanced- technology products shrank, to $558 million in January from a 1995 peak of $2.4 billion in December.
Tabulated by trading partner, a $66 million surplus with Western Europe was transformed in January to a $935 million deficit, while the deficit widened sharply with the Pacific Rim. The deficit with Japan, which has been on the wane, rose 9.3 percent, to $3.8 billion, while that with China rebounded 39.3 percent, to $2.7 billion.
"The situation with China is becoming more and more critical," Mr. Naroff said.
With Canada, the deficit was unchanged at $2 billion, while the deficit with Mexico rose 23.2 percent, to $1.3 billion. The figures for countries and regions are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation.

HEADLINE: Young Voters, Diverse and Disillusioned, Are Unpredictable in '96 Race

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Their first memories of politics are of the Reagan era. They only glimpsed the end of the cold war. And they have no unifying experience like the anti-Vietnam movement of the 1960's.
They are often irritated when lumped together as faceless members of Generation X because they are a diverse group of executives, factory workers, students, welfare recipients and volunteers. 
 But as this generation of 18- to 29-year-olds strives to establish its turf in a society where baby boomers set the agenda, one thing clearly defines them, political strategists say: Their numbers are large and their political allegiances fluid, making them unpredictable in the Presidential election next November.
"My biggest concern is that I'm still a college student struggling financially," Kevin Rogers, 23, of Hot Springs, Ark., said. "What jobs are going to be there when I graduate?"
"The past two elections, I've voted Republican," said Mr. Rogers, who has taken a year off from college to work. "This election, I don't know what I'm going to do."
Referring to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumptive Republican nominee who is 72 and, if elected, would be the oldest President ever to assume the office, Mr. Rogers said: "There is something about him that seems Presidential -- he follows foreign policy issues like trade and world peace. But he doesn't address enough issues at home."
Richard Thau, executive director of Third Millennium, a nonprofit, nonpartisan Generation X advocacy group, said it would be difficult to predict how millions of young voters like Mr. Rogers would vote. But Mr. Thau asserted that "young voters are as important demographically as California is geographically."
Even as political analysts, and candidates, recognize the force of this group of voters, a major registration drive is under way. The campaign is designed to draw young voters into the political process and continue a development that began in 1992 when, after years of poor turnouts, the percentage of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 rose.
In the 1992 Presidential election, young voters made up 22 percent of the electorate, compared with 20 percent in 1988, according to polls of voters after they had cast their ballots. The 1988 poll was conducted by The New York Times and CBS News, and the 1992 poll was conducted by the major television networks.
In the 1984 and 1988 Presidential elections, most young people voted Republican, according to exit polls conducted by The Times and CBS News. But in 1992, 44 percent of young voters chose Bill Clinton, while 34 percent supported George Bush and 22 percent backed Ross Perot, the exit polls found.
This year political experts are unwilling to predict what direction the young vote will take. "Neither candidate has come close to either appealing to the generation or addressing the issues facing it during the 21st century," Mr. Thau said, referring to President Clinton and Senator Dole.
David Anderson, 25, the tour manager of an MTV bus campaign that is crisscrossing the country to promote voter registration, called young voters "independent, undecided and wary about their future" and said, "They're wondering whether this year's candidates will really keep the promises they make."
Indeed, what was clear from dozens of interviews in Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas with college students, white- and blue-collar workers and young people on welfare was that young voters are increasingly dissatisfied, disillusioned and frustrated with the political system.
Conservative on economic issues and liberal-leaning on social issues like health care and abortion, young voters want lower taxes and less interference from the Federal Government at state levels, but they also talk about the need for a higher minimum wage and for Federal spending on education, and they are concerned about protecting the environment and finding better jobs. According to New York Times/CBS News polls, 33 percent consider themselves independent, 30 percent say they are Republican, and 28 percent Democratic.
Many of those interviewed said their identification with a political party would be driven by the personal appeal of a Presidential candidate and by specific issues.
"They are completely steeped in the new information environment," said Michael Delli Carpini, professor of political science at Barnard College, who specializes in American politics, the youth vote and the media. "They are more pragmatic, more cynical, more sophisticated. I think they are a vote that can move in different directions, depending on different appeals."
As a mark of the importance of these voters, a major effort is being made to register them -- the most extensive effort since the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18, was ratified in 1971.
This year's Presidential election will be the first under the motor-voter law, which allows potential voters to register when they get a driver's license and in certain government offices. More than 11 million people were registered to vote in 1995 under this law, according to statistics from Human SERVE, a national voter registration organization. The group believes that a large number of these voters are under 29 because most people applying for drivers' licenses are young.
Youth Vote '96, a national coalition of youth organizations based in Washington, says its goal is to get 12 million young people to the polls this year, about 50 percent of the eligible young voters.
The MTV bus, covered with graffiti quotes ranging from Aristotle to Madonna, is stopping in cities, shopping malls and campuses to register young voters, answer questions, hand out voter guides and conduct surveys. In 1992, MTV also ran a voter awareness campaign; Census Bureau statistics show an increase of two million young voters between the 1988 and 1992 elections.
For this year's effort, MTV has added the bus, and is again working with Rock the Vote, an independent nonprofit youth organization. As of the last week of March, about 8,000 people have been registered.
To publicize the tour, called "Choose or Lose," MTV has home pages on the internet where interviews and the daily progress of the bus are posted, and each candidate's agenda is outlined. Potential voters can read about such issues as taxes or proposed cuts in Federal education grants. (The web address is: http://mtv.com/chooseorlose.)
Radio stations across the country are doing public-service announcements about the bus tour.

HEADLINE: Israeli Opposition Chief Making Comeback

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 29

 BODY:
After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in November, it seemed there was nothing Benjamin Netanyahu could say that Israelis cared to hear.
In the grief of the moment, the very fact that Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud Party, had opposed Mr. Rabin's peace policies seemed a profanation of the fallen Prime Minister's memory. Mr. Netanyahu's image as a smooth operator and slick talker made him seem unworthy compared with Mr. Rabin's old-fashioned candor and soldierly roughness. 
 Now, after a new wave of suicide bombings, people are listening again, especially when Mr. Netanyahu, referring to the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, ridicules "the idea that Arafat will be our subcontractor to fight terrorism," or expounds his campaign theme of "peace with security."
Bibi, the nickname by which Mr. Netanyahu is universally known in Israel, is back. He is hammering away at Prime Minister Shimon Peres and the Labor Party with the cascade of catchy slogans, crisp sound-bites and punchy interviews that have earned him the sobriquet, "the first American politician in Israel."
That characterization has some basis in fact. Mr. Netanyahu attended high school and two colleges in the United States -- the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard -- and served in Washington and at the United Nations before returning to parlay the political tools he had acquired in the United States into a meteoric political career.
His mastery of communications, which he has said he learned from watching President Ronald Reagan, coupled with his grasp of American-style personal campaigning and his charm and good looks, introduced a whole new style of Israeli politics.
At the same time, his fluent and accentless American English made him a fixture on American television as an exponent of the Israeli conservative cause.
In the aftermath of Mr. Rabin's assassination, Mr. Netanyahu's career seemed to come to a crashing halt. His purported association with the violent slogans of the extreme right prompted Mr. Rabin's grieving widow, Leah, to shun Mr. Netanyahu's hand at graveside. Public opinion polls showed him trailing so badly that Mr. Peres decided it would be a sound move politically to advance national elections from October 1996 to May 29 this year, and members of Mr. Netanyahu's party hinted that their chances might be better if he stepped aside.
All that changed with the four suicide bombings and the profound fear they revived among many Israelis that the peace with the Palestinians was not bringing them what they most wanted: security.
This is Mr. Netanyahu's theme. In the immediate aftermath of the bombings, he was cautious to avoid any notion that he was seeking to capitalize on the disaster. He gave his support to the Government and the steps it was taking, and he ordered his followers to show restraint.
But as soon as the campaign for the May election resumed, the gloves came off. "The Labor Government had a chance to bring peace, and we see what sort of peace it is," Mr. Netanyahu told his party's central committee. "We must put our defense back in our own hands and give our security forces the freedom to hit where and when they deem right. Peace with the Arabs begins with security for the Jews."
From the political limbo of last winter, when he languished as far as 30 points behind Mr. Peres in popularity polls, Mr. Netanyahu has revived as a real contender to win the vote for prime minister in the election. Today, polls have him neck-and-neck with Mr. Peres.
Likud spokesmen deny that it was solely the bombings that turned Mr. Netanyahu's fortunes, noting that he had been ahead of Mr. Rabin in the polls before the assassination and that he had been regaining lost ground before the new series of bombings began on Feb. 25. Indeed, the Israeli public is notoriously given to broad swings after major crises, and nobody expected the conservatives to stay down forever.
But there is little question that the bombings brought public attention back to security, the central issue of Israeli politics, and turned the race into a critical referendum on how the Israelis want to proceed in shaping coexistence with the Palestinians.
The theme is closely linked to Mr. Netanyahu's career. The event that served more than any other to shift him from a business career to politics was the heroic death of his older brother, Yonatan, who was killed commanding the Israeli rescue of hostages in Entebbe, Uganda, in July 1976.
That led Mr. Netanyahu, then 27, to organize conferences on international terrorism, which brought him to the attention of Moshe Arens, then the Ambassador to the United States, who invited him to Washington as his deputy. Mr. Netanyahu next became Israel's chief delegate to the United Nations.
By the time he returned to Israel in 1988 as Deputy Foreign Minister, he was a serious player in Likud politics. His innumerable appearances as Israel's spokesman during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and again during the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, established him as a national celebrity. In 1993, after Likud's loss in national elections, Mr. Netanyahu, 43, was elected the party's leader.
Now, at 46, he stands as the youngest politician ever to seek the office of prime minister here, and as the first to reject the traditional paternalism and clubbiness of Israeli politics in favor of direct, personal and professionally packaged appeals to voters. His opponent, Mr. Peres, is 72, and was active in politics before Mr. Netanyahu, or Israel, was born.
Whether Mr. Netanyahu's youth and style will prove as successful in the election as they were in winning the Likud leadership will become known only on May 29. Personal, American-style campaigning is still relatively new to Israel; and in the intimacy of a small and disputatious nation, sound-bites quickly wear thin.
A large part of Mr. Netanyahu's challenge is to convince voters that there is more to him than slogans, to dispel the suspicion of his abilities that persists despite his business degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and two published books, one on Israel and another on international terrorism.
Many political commentators have also noted that for all his attacks on Labor's peace policies, Mr. Netanyahu has not made clear how his government would differ from Labor's in handling the Palestinians.
In an interview, he said that he would not seek to roll back the existing agreements, but that he would provide a "firmer hand at the till" and thus achieve "a more durable peace."
But beyond the promise of a firmer hand, it was difficult to find substantive differences between his views and those of Mr. Peres.
"What I would do is to continue negotiating with the Palestinians, providing they fulfill the basic conditions of the peace," he said. "We would negotiate in such a way that the Palestinians would run their own affairs, but we would have responsibility against terrorism and foreign threats."
On Jewish settlements, Mr. Netanyahu declared that "clear red lines" should be drawn between Palestinian self-rule areas and Israeli areas. On building a barrier between the West Bank and Israel, he declared that he supported the idea of separation for security reasons, but not as part of a long-term peace.
If Mr. Netanyahu sometimes sounded like Mr. Peres, Mr. Peres has come to sound increasingly like Mr. Netanyahu since the bombings. The Prime Minister has taken a severe stance toward the Palestinians, vowing to maintain pressure on Mr. Arafat until he crushes the Islamic militants of Hamas and ordering the houses of terror suspects demolished.
The convergence of the candidates reflects the common wisdom that the May election will be decided by a large and wavering bloc of centrist voters, who generally want peace but are primarily worried about security, especially since the deaths of 62 people in the four bombings.
Mr. Peres's major challenge in the campaign is to overcome his image as being soft on security, while Mr. Netanyahu's is to convince the voters that he is not against making peace.
The race is also the first in which the prime minister will be elected directly, and not as head of a party slate. That has made each candidate's personality more of an issue than in the past, and both are vulnerable.
While Mr. Netanyahu has not convinced voters he has depth or strong principles, Mr. Peres has acquired a solid record of achievements and a reputation as a visionary intellectual. But he has never gained the trust or personal affection of voters.
And while Mr. Peres is unchallenged as leader of Labor, Mr. Netanyahu presides over a coalition that includes bitter rivals. Three years ago, he was forced to admit having an extramarital affair after anonymous rivals threatened to release a compromising videotape. No tape was ever produced, but Mr. Netanyahu accused his long-term rival, David Levy, of orchestrating the scandal. Mr. Levy subsequently quit Likud to form his own Sephardic-based party, but recently returned after being promised that he would be foreign minister in a Likud government.
Despite his fuzziness on the peace issue and his other problems, Mr. Netanyahu becomes positively professorial when expounding his faith in a free-market economy.
"We are mobile and have a strong scientific and technological base courtesy of the army and so have the best resources for launching forward into the technological and communications industries of the 21st century," he said. He calls for "privatization of state industry, deregulation with a vengeance, and the release of public lands into the housing market."
These are messages that many of his prosperous peers in the 40-something bracket and below are likely to embrace, and that any future Government will have to consider.

HEADLINE: How 3 Young Voters See the Election and the Choices

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH 

 BODY:

April Smith, 21
'Clinton Is the Lesser Of Two Evils'
Ms. Smith said that she believed that this year's Republican candidates were spouting platitudes, and that she would vote for Mr. Clinton. 
 Yet she supports the Republican push for lower taxes and smaller Government and opposes abortion.
But Ms. Smith, like Mr. Rogers, is deeply concerned about education cuts. Last year, at the end of her sophomore year at the University of North Texas at Denton, she dropped out because she did not have money for the $2,400-a-year tuition, despite holding down two part-time jobs.
She now works 40 hours a week as a saleswoman in Gordon's jewelry store at the Denton mall and manages to save $100 a month. She can only go back to college, she said, if she gets financial aid.
"The Republicans seem to be more for the upper class instead of the poor or the elderly," Ms. Smith said. "Clinton is the lesser of two evils."
Ms. Smith also said she was worried about the environment. "I plan on having kids," she said. "Will there be a planet?"
Health care is another issue that concerns Ms. Smith, who said she had a strict Southern Baptist upbringing in Naples, Tex. Her parents helped her financially the first year in college, but now she is independent of them.
Her health insurance has a $500 deductible, and she fears that if she had an accident or became sick, her dreams of going to college could be put back years or wiped out.
 
Carlos Hernandez, 24
'Liberal Leaning,' But Feeling Fed Up
With a degree in international affairs from Georgetown University, Mr. Hernandez is the associate director of the National Hispanic Institute, a nonprofit organization in Maxwell, Tex., that conducts leadership training programs for Hispanic youths. He said he was just as passionate in his beliefs as those under 30 were in the 1960's.
He earns in the $20,000 range, he said. To save money and pay off a college debt of $15,000, he has moved in with his sister. He said he did not want to be like his parents whose savings were wiped out when they sent him to college.
Mr. Hernandez, a first-generation Mexican-American, said that he was "liberal leaning" but hated being labeled and was fed up with politicians. Nonetheless, he has voted every year and will this time, he said, probably for President Clinton because the Democratic agenda was closest to his concerns.
Still, he said he was disappointed with the President's performance on health care and welfare. And he added that Gen. Colin L. Powell would have been an attractive option.
Mr. Hernandez's father died of a heart attack at 48 so he said he worried about his own health and benefits. He said that he wanted to see his siblings and relatives go to college but that Republican cuts in education might make that dream impossible. The budget deficit gnaws at him, he said.
"I think we're mortgaging our future," he said in an interview at a restaurant in Austin. "As a young responsible citizen of this country, I'm responsible for balancing my checkbook. It's very difficult to run a government or a business if 40 percent of your payments are debt payments."
He does not believe the Government is responsible for providing him with a job but he believes it should provide training for those who do not have the chance for an education.
Like many other young people, Mr. Hernandez said his philosophy and beliefs were gleaned from his parents' experiences. His mother, a migrant cotton picker, was the first in her family to put herself through college.
And his father left Mexico to grow up in the projects of Brownsville, Tex., where he would break into people's houses to steal cans of tuna. The church changed his father's life and he put himself through college and earned a degree in electrical engineering.
"I'm just a Mexican-American concerned about where my community is going," Mr. Hernandez said.
 
Kevin Rogers, 23
10 Years Ago, 'A Common Goal'
Mr. Rogers has taken a year off from studying philosophy and political science at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway to work full time at the college bookstore. Next fall he plans to transfer to a bigger college in California, he said. The youngest of six children from a Southern Baptist family in Hot Springs, Ark., he and a brother are the only ones to have gone to college.
"I could leave college and go home and live a comfortable life," he said. "But that's a dead end."
Mr. Rogers talked of friends who are struggling to make ends meet in college only to return to their hometowns to work low-paid jobs. And he said he was worried about cuts in education threatened by the Republicans and wanted better benefits for college students. At the same time, he said he supported downsizing of the Federal government.
Like many in his age group, he finds himself thinking conservative on economic questions, and more liberal on social issues.
"I think 10 years ago, we as a generation had more of a common goal to fight over," he said. "Now there are so many stands to be had. It really divides up a generation."

HEADLINE: Intelligence Experts Meet to Combat Mideast Terrorism

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
In a follow-up to the Middle East summit meeting at Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, political and intelligence experts from 29 countries and organizations, including Israel and the Palestinian Authority, met today at the State Department to draft specific recommendations to fight terrorism.
The recommendations, on topics ranging from intelligence-sharing to methods for detecting false passports and hampering fund-raising by terrorist organizations, are to be presented at a meeting of foreign ministers on April 22 in Luxembourg, American officials said. 
 Officials also announced that an emergency meeting would be held April 12 in Brussels to speed aid for the Palestinians, who have received only small amounts of the $1.8 billion they have been promised over the past two years.
Four recent suicide bombings have created new questions in the American Congress about continued aid to Yasir Arafat and his Palestinian Authority, unless it cracks down harder on terrorists and alters the charter of the Palestine Liberation Organization, as promised, to eliminate a pledge to destroy Israel.
The original summit meeting was hastily called for March 13, in response to the bombings in Israel, which killed 62 people, led to a suspension of peace negotiations between Israel and Syria and prompted Israel to close its borders with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The bombings damaged the election prospects of Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel by refocusing attention on Israelis' concerns about the security risks that would come from peace with Syria and with a more complete handing over of control in the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority.
The border closing, intended to stop suicide bombers from entering Israel, has caused significant economic distress. There have been reports of hunger among Palestinians who have been prevented from going to jobs in Israel.
The two-day meeting here was planned to focus on the details of the complicated fight against terrorist groups. But it also became a forum for the Palestinians and some Arab and European nations to criticize Israel for its harsh measures against Palestinians, participants said.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher helped broker a modest relaxation of the border closing. The easing, announced on Thursday, is allowing shipments of construction materials and some other items to be moved across the borders.
"We must find ways to support the Palestinian people as they, too, suffer the consequences" of the bombings, Mr. Christopher said.
Israeli officials attending the conference here said Israel had already begun to relax the border closing before today's action. They said the United States had worked hard to keep the focus of the conference on terrorism, which all the countries attending have reason to fear.
"We shouldn't regress from this period of finding peace to the period of armed conflict," one Israeli official said.
He expressed concern, though, whether much could be accomplished in such a large forum.
Information sharing, for instance, is a fine idea in principle, he said, but really represents information trading, which is best practiced on a smaller scale, "not in such a big bazaar." Otherwise, he said, "everyone thinks they are giving up too much and not getting anything in return."
Some of the topics for which committees are preparing proposals are how to promote cooperation among law-enforcement agencies, how to use extradition laws more energetically, how to enhance border controls -- with specific focus on the detection of forged documents and how to help to train the Palestinians in anti-terrorism and police tactics.
Syria and Lebanon refused to come to this meeting, as they had refused to attend the Sharm el Sheik summit talks.
At the meeting here, American officials urged Arab allies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt to shut down public offices of organizations like Hamas, which took responsibility for three of the four bombings, and to work to cut off contributions to Hamas.
Europeans, the French in particular, have criticized what they see as the American "obsession" with Iran's possible role in promoting terrorism, saying Hamas -- unlike some other militant groups -- has indigenous roots, local grievances and little funding from Iran. "Terrorism will be over when Palestinians feel they have their rights recognized," one senior French official said.
A group of Arab-Americans, representing 14 organizations in 13 states met in Washington today under the sponsorship of the Arab American Institute. They said they were sympathetic to the Clinton Administration's desire to assuage Israeli fears, but that there had been a lack of similar measures to boost Palestinian confidence. In a statement, they said they opposed terrorism of all kinds, criticized Israeli collective punishment measures in the West Bank and called for more aid and job creation there to promote peace.
Speaking of the State Department meeting, Nicholas Burns, the Department's spokesman said that, "Given all the emotions on the agenda, it went pretty well." The aims of the conference were always multiple, he said, with the intention of working on fighting terrorism but also of recreating among Israelis and Palestinians the willingness to press ahead toward a comprehensive peace.
"We have to make the effort to create the kind of climate that allows the peace process to continue," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Adjusting Its Consumer Price Index

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Government said today that it was adjusting the Consumer Price Index to correct a fault in its measurements of inflation.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the modifications to the index would shave about one-tenth of 1 percentage point off the annual rate of inflation. 
 That change will translate into about $1 a month less for the average Social Security recipient, whose benefits are adjusted annually based on how much consumer prices increase. If the change had been in place last year, it would have meant the average monthly benefit would have been increased $17 instead of $18 in January.
While even small changes in the Consumer Price Index can result in big savings in those benefit programs like Social Security that are adjusted for inflation, the Clinton Administration based its new budget plan on an even bigger revision. The new budget assumed that the annual increase in consumer prices would be reduced by two-tenths of 1 percent.

For-Profit Hospital Chain To Buy Blue Cross Business
Columbia-HCA Healthcare agreed to buy the main business of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio for $299.5 million, in the first sale of a Blue Cross company to a for-profit hospital chain. The takeover could open the door for similar deals by a number of nonprofit Blue Cross plans that are struggling. 
 The deal would place Columbia-HCA in the unusual role of being both a provider of health care and a middleman serving employers and consumers. It would increase pressure on hospitals to reduce costs. [Page 1.]
 
Citibank Data on Mexican Sought
Federal law-enforcement agencies have subpoenaed records from Citibank's New York offices in an effort to assist Mexico with its investigation of Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former President, according to Government officials and bankers. They said Citibank itself is not under investigation. [39.]
 
Congress Extends Budgets
Congress voted enough money for Federal offices without 1996 budgets to finance them until April 24. Without the stipend, various Cabinet departments and offices ranging from NASA to the E.P.A., would have had to shut down beginning today. [1.]
 
Dow Ends Quarter Up 9%
Computer-guided sell orders lowered stock prices in the final half-hour of trading. The Dow ended off 43.71 points, at 5,587.14, but finished the first quarter up 9 percent, or 470 points. Other market indicators were mixed yesterday. [41.]
 
Bond buyers emerged and prices rose. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 6.67 percent, from 6.72 percent. [40.]
 
Pacific Gas Stock Tumbles
Shares of Pacific Gas and Electric fell 10 percent after the company proposed speeding up its depreciation of power-generating assets in return for freezing customer rates for five years. While Pacific Gas said the accelerated depreciation could save it billions of dollars, analysts lowered their earnings estimates and warned that the dividend might be cut. [47.]
 
Speedier Action on Cancer Drugs
The White House is trying to speed the F.D.A.'s approval of drugs treating cancer, and said the regulatory changes would apply to at least 100 drugs now under study. [1.]
 
Abbott Labs in Acquisition
Abbott Labs agreed to make an $876 million acquisition of Medisense Inc., which makes kits for diabetes patients to test their blood glucose levels. The move is Abbott's first venture into the diabetes market, which accounts for 10 percent of all diagnostic testing. [39.]
 
New-Home Sales Turn Down
New-home sales slid 1.3 percent in February, in their first decline in four months. Sales rose in the Northeast, South and West, but plunged in the Midwest, where harsh weather quieted activity. Despite the drop, January and February may be the best sales months of the year, with mortgage rates now rising. [40.]
 
In Rare Move, Toyota to Buy Stock
 Toyota said it would spend upwards of $1 billion to buy back its stock. In the U.S., companies buy up some of their shares to lift their stock price, but the practice has been practically unheard of in Japan. Now things are slowly changing. [38.]
 
Auto Suppliers to Merge
Motor Wheel agreed to buy Hayes Wheels for $560 million, creating a supplier of wheel and brake parts with sales of $1 billion. [39.]
 
Ruling Sets Back Electric Cars
The automobile and oil industries won a victory against electric cars in a ruling by the California air quality board. [6.]
 
Europeans Offer Help on Mad Cows
European leaders promised aid to Britain to combat mad-cow disease and to reclaim its export market in beef. They clearly hope the matter won't spill over into important negotiations about the future of Europe. [3.]
 
Big Bidder Quits Wireless Auction
Another big bidder, Go Communications, dropped out of Washington's auction of wireless communication licenses. [39.]

HEADLINE: Dow Loses 43.71 in Flurry Fueled by Program Trading

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
A flurry of computer-guided sell orders caused the Dow Jones industrial average to fall sharply in the final half-hour of trading yesterday, the last session of the first quarter. Other market indicators were mixed.
"We had a wild day," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president of Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "Along with the sell programs, there was some end-of-the-quarter window-dressing by mutual funds." 
 The Dow closed at 5,587.14, down 43.71 points for the session, after losing some 35 points in the last half- hour. The blue-chip average dropped almost 50 points for the week but still gained 470 points for the quarter, or just over 9 percent.
The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed yesterday at 645.50, down 3.44 points, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,101.40, up 6.57.
Advances topped declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,279 to 1,050. Big Board volume jumped to 413.8 million shares, from 368.3 million on Thursday.
The bond market was quite strong, respondig to a Commerce Department report that sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly slumped in February as mortgage rates started rising. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond surged 19/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.67 percent, from 6.72 percent on Thursday.
Technology stocks turned upward on analysts' projections that their profits will be higher in 1996 because of heavy demand for their products. I.B.M. rose 1 1/2, to 111 1/4; Microsoft increased 7/8, to 103 1/8, and America Online added 3/4, to 56.
Some chemical issues were also higher. Du Pont closed at 83, up 3/4; Dow Chemical closed at 87, up 3/8, and Union Carbide closed at 49 5/8, up 5/8.
Also finishing in plus territory were a number of banking companies. Nationsbank gained 1 1/4, to 80 1/8; Citicorp advanced 3/4, to 80, and Wells Fargo rose 5 7/8, to 261 1/4.
Oil stocks, which have generally showed strength recently, sold off yesterday. Of the three oil-stock components among the Dow industrials, Exxon gave up 2 1/4, to 81 1/2; Texaco slid 1 1/8, to 85 3/4, and Chevron lost 1 1/4, to 56 1/8.
Utility issues, whose earnings could suffer if interest rates do not fall, were also lower. Houston Industries closed at 21 5/8, down 17/32 ; Pacific Gas and Electric closed at 22 3/8, down 2 1/8, and Consolidated Natural Gas closed at 43 1/2, down 3/4.
McDonald's fell 1 1/4, to 48, after saying that it would seek stockholder permission to raise the number of shares it can issue to 3.5 billion from 1.25 billion. Wal-Mart fell 1, to 23, after losing one of its senior executives to Blockbuster. And American Standard dropped 2, to 29 1/4, after projecting that first-quarter net income will not meet expectations.
Cincinnati Bell, which said that it had won a contract to provide billing services to AT&T, soared 8, to 52. Medtronic, which was reiterated as a buy by J. P. Morgan, advanced 5 3/8, to 59 5/8. And Barnett, a plumbing and hardware supply company, increased 8 1/2, to 22 1/2, on its first day of public trading.
 Earlier in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 111.03 points, or five-tenths of a percent, closing at 21,406.85.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the stock market's activity on Friday misstated the closing stock price of the Consolidated Natural Gas Company in some editions. It was $43.50, not $4.50.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
Manhattan Projects

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
AFTER WRAPPING buildings, enveloping islands and fencing coastlines on four continents, Christo dreams of something even more outrageous. He would like to create his first piece of public art in his hometown -- which, unfortunately for his ambitions, is New York.
He and Jeanne-Claude, his partner and wife, have wanted to do a local job ever since they moved here from Paris in 1964. They proposed wrapping buildings in lower Manhattan (at 2 Broadway and 20 Exchange Place) and in Times Square (the one where the ball drops), but the owners turned them down. Their plans to wrap the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum were rejected. Then Christo got the idea to line all the paths in Central Park with rectangular steel gates that would hold fluttering saffron-colored banners.
"New York is the city of displaced people, of refugees like us," Christo says. "We wanted to do a project with that feeling of openness, that airy feeling, which is so exhilarating. We also wanted to celebrate the way New Yorkers walk everywhere. It's the most famous city for walking in the world." 
 Christo first proposed the Gates project in 1980, offering to put up 11,000 arches, each 15 feet high, along the park's 25 miles of paths. Their banners would billow in the breeze as people walked underneath; from above, the park would be a jumble of golden streams looping from one end to the other. The extravaganza would be installed just once, for two weeks during foliage season in October. Christo, who finances his work by selling paintings and drawings of the projects, promised to pay for everything: the environmental impact statement, installation, cleanup, insurance and any extra costs for police and park workers. While Christo was willing to spend at least $6 million up front, the city stood to make money. It would have collected extra taxes from tourists who came to see the exhibit, and it would have had the exclusive right to sell commemorative merchandise, with all proceeds going to the Parks Department.
So here was an acclaimed artist offering to donate a work that would delight throngs of strollers, offer spectacular views, create jobs and provide cash to the city. How dare he! The park's wealthy patrons and neighbors on the East Side mobilized against it. (The less-affluent neighbors to the north and west generally supported it.) The Times editorialized against the Gates project because of the crowds it would attract and the "dangerous precedent" it would set for future events in the park. Environmentalists and urban planners pleaded to spare the park from desecration. Christo's request was ultimately turned down by the Parks Department, which decried "the project's systematic and complete alteration of a landmark space."
That was in 1981, but Christo still hasn't given up. In his studio, on the fifth floor of the old loft in SoHo where he and Jeanne-Claude live, he keeps turning out sketches and collages of the Gates. He and Jeanne-Claude take the long view of these projects. They waited 23 years before getting permission to wrap the Reichstag last year. "The German Government turned us down three different times before saying yes," Jeanne-Claude says. "Then it was so popular that they asked us to leave it up longer than the two weeks. The city of Berlin collected $100 million in additional taxes. Maybe New York will pay attention when it realizes how much money it can make. We still hope to do this project before we die."
I share their hope, and not just because the Gates would be such a fine sight. The project could set a valuable example by encouraging further large works of public art. We need to exploit the city as a backdrop, because that seems to be our greatest economic asset these days. Our industries may have fled -- exiled, like Christo, to places that welcome new enterprises -- but the Sun Belt and the suburbs haven't yet managed to lure away our streets and skyline. We've become the world's premiere urban theme park, a favorite location of television and film producers, a hub for garish tourist restaurants. Suburbanites may not want to live here, but they'll pay to look at the exotic scenery, and they'll keep visiting as long as we keep offering attractions like the Gates.
I've been working on plans for a few new attractions myself, and although I wasn't able to get Christo interested in collaborating, I still think they have potential. One, titled "Haute Clothesline," would stretch from the Empire State Building to the Chrysler Building during Fashion Week, displaying 40-story-high designer dresses from the shows in Bryant Park. The World Trade Towers could wear a large pair of pants. I would encourage the city's interior designers to go beyond model rooms by exhibiting their work on subway trains -- maybe one model car per train, decked out as a wood-paneled English den or a Louis XV parlor. I would install a trompe l'oeil above Grand Central Station that would cover the Met Life (the old Pan Am) Building with a vista of blue skies and the neighboring buildings. "Vanished Eyesore," as I'd call it, might even become a permanent exhibit.
The artist Bruce McCall has drawn an edifice that could be a lovely temporary exhibit opposite the Flatiron Building: a horizontal one-story structure suspended high in the air on metal legs, called the Ironing Board Building. Two other artists, Pascal Giraudon and Steven Lowy, have proposed a grand scheme for Fifth Avenue using a technique they've already perfected on other city streets: coating the pavement with printer's ink, covering it with paper and then driving a steamroller over it to make a paper impression of every indentation in the pavement. The results have been popular -- their manhole covers sell quite well -- and they feel ready to tackle an entire mile of Fifth Avenue. "We'd take the mile-long sheet and cut it into thousands of individual pieces," Lowy says. "A lot of people would be glad to own a piece of Fifth Avenue."
Like Christo, any artists who use public space should pay for the privilege and cover the costs of whatever inconvenience or damage they cause. (This would be a good precedent to apply to any user of public space: a pay-your-own-way policy could eliminate the drearier parades and street fairs that now clog the city.) As long as artists honor these rules, we ought to welcome them and ignore the traditionalists' whining. The city's gentry will complain about the hordes of visitors, but New Yorkers have no more right to grumble than do the idle European aristocrats who have been forced to open their castles for tours. If we're going to live in a theme park, we have to be nice to the paying customers.

The Coinage Game: Neologic Nellies

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
"THOSE HARDHEARTED HANNAHS ARE going to cut Medicare," say the liberals.
"We're not cutting a thing," say the conservatives. "We're reducing the rate of increase." This is followed by a labored explanation of how the net amount being spent is more, but less than it would have been if the current rate of increase were allowed to run amok. 
 "Might there not be a word in Greek or Latin," asks Otto A. Silha in Minneapolis, "that would mean 'reduced increase' for use instead of 'cuts' in future fiscal debates?"
I made a quick run of the traps. Frank Abate of Dictionary and Reference Specialists in Old Saybrook, Conn., responded: "I know of no such word. Do you like deincrementalization?"
No. Tried Hugh Rawson, director of Penguin Reference Books: "A new word for budget balancers to use when increasing expenditures in real terms, but not by enough to account for inflation or to cover projected costs of serving larger numbers of people?"
That's an artful restatement of the problem, but what's the word? "I offer necrement, from Latin nec, 'not,' plus crescere, 'to grow' (and also the root of increment). The budget balancer could explain that 'the necremental increase is such-and-such.' "
Good try, but necrement sounds too much like a euphemism for a scatological epithet. Maybe the Neologic Nellies can solve the problem. These are the people who go about coining words and waiting for them to become part of the language; when they don't, the Neologic Nellies send them to me and wonder what's wrong with the rest of the world.
Wordrobe, for example, coined by June Gundersen of Brooklyn in 1984, meaning "the vocabulary with which we cloak our emotions." Or okayance, a coinage of Darcy McGrath of Chicago that same year, meaning "the bureaucratic process of getting approval." Or greedlock, by David Ebbitt of Newport, R.I., to denote the state of overcrowding caused by avaricious builders.
These are good words that never made it. But be careful about claiming to be the coiner of your favorite neologism: I thought I had a beaut a few weeks ago -- digivision, a shortening of "digital television." Used it twice in a column, admiring how it saved space and came easily to the tongue.
Then in comes a letter from Sherman E. DeForest of San Diego, president of DigiVision: "We own rights to the word in the United States, and limited rights worldwide. In Great Britain, another DigiVision produces computer monitors, and ITT has limited rights to the marque in Germany." He says to cease using DigiVision's trademark as a generic.
Maybe that tricky capital V in the middle weakens his case, but I won't challenge it; somebody else was present at the creation. Neologic Nellies soon find that is all too often the case.

And Also as Well, Too

 "What is your opinion of Tom Brokaw's use of as well in lieu of also?" asks T. H. Scarbrough of Water Valley, Miss. (That's how you abbreviate Mississippi, and not MS, a coinage of Gloria Steinem.) "He always says, 'The Nasdaq was up as well.' "
Gee; that never bothered me, especially when it was going up. Also and as well are adverbs, and are synonymous -- both meaning "in addition" and "too." But if you take a dive into syntax -- that mysterious programming inside our heads that makes natives out of speakers -- you will note a difference.
John Algeo, the neologism expert for American Speech, notes that the difference is "one of restricted privilege of occurrence." Also can go just about anywhere in a sentence; as well cannot. "Also looks in both directions," says Professor Algeo, "whereas as well is only retrospective or regressive."
Let's try it: "Jack Kemp also supports the flat tax." "Also, Jack Kemp supports the flat tax." "Jack Kemp supports the flat tax also." The placement affects the meaning, but the also fits naturally everywhere. Now go try that with as well: it fits everywhere except in front; nobody, not even Steve Forbes, would say, "As well, Jack Kemp supports my flat tax." Nor would you say, "Jack Kemp is as well supporting the flat tax." It must follow the focused-on word or phrase, not precede it: "Jack Kemp as well supports the flat tax" if you're emphasizing the supporter, and "Jack Kemp supports the flat tax as well" if you're emphasizing the range of positions the supporter supports.
That's not my rule; that's not the dead hand of some grammarian telling you what's correct; that's your internal voice of syntax, sometimes stronger than your conscience, telling you, "As well always comes behind the word it focuses on." Even poor little kids who much prefer a progressive tax code know that.
A related subject: now that we know that also goes anywhere, should you start a sentence with it? Good grammar is not always good style; I would use also as a sentence adverb only if I wanted to give the impression of an afterthought. "Jack's a great guy. Also, he supports the flat tax." Also, Prof. Dennis Baron at the University of Illinois in Urbana says, "I hate it when people start sentences with too, though it is a common and accepted practice."
If you want to add an afterthought but not make it seem like an also-ran, use besides. Front or back.

Mistake Sandwich

 "This stark refutation of the First Lady's response," wrote the Pegler-esque vituperator in a recent essay, "was corroborated by contemporaneous notes . . . of Susan Thomases telling McLarty, 'Hillary wants those people fired.' "
"I recognize the violation of a rule," writes John LaRosa of New York. "Use the possessive of a noun or pronoun before a gerund." I learned this rule from you. You pluralized the name when it should have been possessivized."
Got me. The gerund in question is telling, which is a verb acting as a noun, as in "Telling could get you in trouble." When Mrs. Clinton's confidante Susan Thomases (not plural) does the telling, her name should be made possessive -- that is, followed by an apostrophe and then an s. (The Times uses only the apostrophe with a double sibilant.) Though pronouncing it sounds as if you're falling asleep, the correct form is Thomases's.
I must have had politics on the brain. What do you expect from a student of poetic allusions who turns Robert Frost's "Mending Wall" into "Mending Fences"?

HEADLINE: The Beats of Edinburgh

BYLINE: By Lesley Downer; Lesley Downer writes on the arts. This is her first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
LATE AFTERNOON AT ROBBIE'S, A PUB IN LEITH, A working-class district of Edinburgh, Scotland. Everyone is drinking Budweiser, of all things, by the pint. The air reeks of cigarettes and beer. Crowded around a corner table -- beneath cigarette ads, old-fashioned mirrors and two large-horned-animal skulls (probably Highland cattle) -- are Duncan McLean, Gordon Legge, Alan Warner and Paul Reekie, together with some blond-haired women and a young man with a shaved head and multi-pierced ears. McLean is holding forth on Scottish literature. At 31, he is one of the youngest of a group of Scottish writers who have smashed their way out of rave culture onto the British literary scene.
In a cyber era in which literary circles are usually metaphors, they hang out together in Edinburgh's pubs, clubs and rave bars. Few of them can support themselves by writing; some are on the dole, taking full advantage of the steady income and enforced leisure it provides. They live the life of Edinburgh beats -- get up at noon, drink, talk and write the day away, and party through the night. All are young and fiercely working class. They write about people on the margins of society: the young, the poor, the dispossessed, junkies, Ecstasy users, football hooligans and people who live on the dole in housing projects. 
 Their stories are violently funny, sometimes shocking, often written in Edinburgh street lingo and liberally spattered with four-letter words. They give voice to a Britain that most middle-class readers would rather not think about. Despite their street credibility, several of them have been snapped up by Britain's most prestigious publisher, Jonathan Cape.
The undisputed star of the dozen or so writers is Irvine Welsh, whose 1993 novel, "Trainspotting," has been made into a movie that is playing to sold-out houses in Britain and will be released in the United States in July. McLean won a Somerset Maugham Award in 1993 for his dark stories set among the down and out of the remote Scottish countryside. Legge has published three books, one of which, "In Between Talking About the Football," a collection of short stories, has become a cult classic. Warner was recently nominated for the Whitbread First Novel Award. There's also Kevin Williamson, the publisher of Rebel Inc., a literary magazine that has put many of these writers on the book-world map, not to mention myriad fringe characters, like the wild-eyed Reekie and the punk poet Rodney Relax.
McLean, who has written three books -- the short-story collection "Bucket of Tongues" and the novels "Blackden" and "Bunker Man" -- is something of a father figure to the group despite his tender age. Unlike many of his compatriots, he went to college, Edinburgh University, where he studied literature. And he figures prominently in the early history of the recent renaissance in Scottish writing.
After graduating from college in 1986, McLean, like many other Scots of his generation, wanted to make a political impact. Scotland, he notes, is effectively a colony of England. Its schools and universities teach English, not Scottish, literature, and books, magazines and television are largely controlled by an English middle-class mentality. Scots seethe with resentment under the English yoke. "The Thatcher years were insult after injury after insult," McLean says. "Scottish traditions of education, culture and language were not just discouraged but outlawed in some instances. Scotland was perceived, quite rightly, I think, as being sucked dry of its economic plus points -- like oil, for instance -- while getting very little in return."
McLean thus joined a comedy troupe, the Merry Mac Fun Show, which toured Scotland performing street theater and agitprop, scoring points against the English, the bitterly hated poll tax and the politicians. "We were all on the dole, as were most people in Scotland at the time," McLean says. But after three years he was disillusioned. "It seemed to me -- well, we sang our songs and we told our jokes and afterward everything's the same as it was before."
At college he had discovered a different kind of inspiration, the Glaswegian novelist James Kelman. "When 'The Busconductor Hines' came out in 1984, it just blew my mind," he says. "It was the voice. For the first time I was reading a book about the world I lived in. I didn't know literature could do that.
"There was this great example of Kelman, producing art that was more political, more subversive, more powerful than what we were doing. Even though he might never have mentioned any politicians or any particular social policy, it was actually a more effective and longer-lasting way of making your voice heard."
Dropping out of the Merry Mac Fun Show, McLean began to write. This was toward the end of the 80's, when other little-known Scottish writers were beginning to get their work published in small literary magazines. But it was a slow, badly paid way of getting into print. So McLean, who was working as a janitor, started Clocktower Press. "I borrowed a friend's computer -- I didn't have one at the time -- typed out two or three stories, photocopied them and published them, then sold them at readings which were starting to happen."
He took a series of menial jobs -- caretaker of a bandstand, then of a village hall -- to give himself time to write. It took a few years to get his first stories published. Then his fortunes changed. On Kelman's recommendation, his work came to the attention of Robin Robertson, editorial director at the London publishing house of Secker & Warburg and a Scot himself. (Robertson later moved to Jonathan Cape, taking most of his writers with him.) Robertson signed McLean and in 1992 brought out "Bucket of Tongues."
"Robin was blown away by his work," says Alan Warner, an ex-train driver and large, exuberant man of 31. "The story 'Hours of Darkness,' when I read that I realized here was a writer as good as Chekhov, as good as Cormac McCarthy, here in Scotland, making the Scottish world universal, forcing that world into literature through his style." The prose is haunting and bleak: "He came striding out of the north just as darkness was falling. Away to his right fields stretched out, black furrows creased across the red earth, boulders tumbled in by the dykesides, gangs of crows and gulls picking over the broken ground."
McLean is the chronicler of the ordinary guy. In his most recent novel, "Bunker Man," these passions boil to the surface in a tale of quite horrifying blackness and bleakness. Rob, newly married to Karen, is the janitor of a school in a coastal town. McLean evokes his life in painstaking detail: "Rob was out in the car park with a brush, a binbag, and a long-handled scoop. From inside the bothy it'd looked to be a still afternoon, but now that he was out he found a fair old breeze coming in off the sea. The bits of rubbish kept blowing away just as he went to sweep them up."
A dark atmosphere hangs over the story from the start. A vagrant has moved into the concrete bunker on the cliff above the village, and Rob decides he must be dealt with. As his obsession grows, the conscientious janitor is transformed into a monster every bit as menacing as the drifter. The only certainty is that the ax will fall, though who will wield it remains a mystery to the end.
Given the rawness of McLean's language and the savage passions that he reveals in his ordinary guys, it is a surprise to discover that he himself is large, calm and almost avuncular. "I'm at the more old-fashioned literary end of the group," he says. Indeed, McLean is no raver. Able to support himself with his writing, he left Edinburgh for the Orkney Islands, in the far north of Scotland, though he is often to be found back at his old haunts in Edinburgh.
"I'd rather be in a village hall in Orkney doin' strip the willow" --traditional Scottish country dancing -- "than at a rave in Edinburgh," he says, laughing gently.
CONSPICUOUS BY HIS ABSENCE AT ROBBIE'S IS IRVINE WELSH. (LIKE McLean, he has moved to more hospitable surroundings, in his case Amsterdam.) As I relate the tale of my encounter with him in London, I quickly discover that a tidbit of information on Welsh is enough to put me at the center of attention in this crowd, however briefly. One thing impresses them hugely: that he turned up in the company of the rock group Primal Scream.
"All of them?" Reekie and Williamson, incredulous, say in chorus. "All of Primal Scream? Trust Irvine." It is, I gather, something like showing up with the Rolling Stones or the British supergroup Oasis.
I had met Welsh at the Ship, on Wardour Street in Soho, a few days earlier. He seemed amiable enough. There was none of the foul language that peppers his writing. He was articulate, intellectual and intensely serious, speaking not in Edinburgh dialect but in educated Scots. Even to his friends, Welsh is an enigma. "Irvine was a star before he became a star," Legge says.
I found him standing at the bar, pint in hand, a skinny, unhealthy-looking 37-year-old with a round, battered face like a dissolute cherub's. He wore the raver's uniform -- brutally cropped hair, a scruffy brown jacket, T-shirt, faded jeans. He greeted me in his soft Scottish brogue, offered me a drink and introduced me to his drinking mates -- who, of course, were the members of Primal Scream. Then he turned to finish off his conversation, which as far as I could hear above the hubbub was exclusively about soccer results and the latest album from Oasis.
Variously hailed as the new William Burroughs and as the chronicler of the Ecstasy generation, Welsh is the author of three scabrous, foul-mouthed books that plunge the reader deep into the seamy side of Scottish life. "Trainspotting," published in 1993, is set among the junkies and soccer hooligans of Muirhouse, a housing scheme, as the Scots call projects, on the edge of Edinburgh. His second, "The Acid House," is a collection of short stories about the Scottish underworld. His most recent novel is "Marabou Stork Nightmares," which goes inside the mind of a soccer thug and rapist as he lies in a coma.
It was "Trainspotting" that established Welsh's legendary status among the rave generation. Whereas punk rockers rebelled angrily against society, ravers simply want to be left alone -- to enjoy rave music (one of the main forms of which is acid house), to dance, to take the drug Ecstasy. Raves are movable feasts, happenings that can take place anywhere. The best are outdoors, where young people gather in the hundreds to dance a wild mesmeric dance, usually fueled by Ecstasy. In "Marabou Stork Nightmares," Welsh provides a euphoric description of the effects of Ecstasy: "I felt closer to these strangers than I did to anyone. . . . I couldn't stop hugging them. . . . I knew that after I came down I'd still love them. . . . I was the Silver Surfer, I looked into the laser lights and zapped across the universe a few times, surging and cruising with the music."
It was "Trainspotting" that also established Welsh as a literary force. It "comes in the line of 'The Catcher in the Rye' or 'On the Road' or 'A Clockwork Orange,' " gushes Kevin Williamson, 34, the publisher of Rebel Inc., where excerpts from the book first appeared. "In 10 or 20 years it'll still be around, whereas books that won the Booker Prize will have been forgotten." In fact, "Trainspotting" has already achieved enormous mainstream success. Besides being made into a movie, it has been adapted for the stage and was considered a strong bet in 1993 for the Booker, Britain's most prestigious literary award.
Welsh, says Alan Taylor, deputy editor of Scotland's principal newspaper, The Scotsman, is "a wonderful creator of his own myths." When "Trainspotting" was released he was portrayed in the news media as the wild man of literary fiction -- an autodidact who had barely read a book, a wolf-boy, as John Walsh wrote in The Independent, "a literary Kaspar Hauser, raised in the darkness." Later Welsh let it be known that he had a degree in business administration, had done a little property speculating and had held a white-collar job with the Edinburgh District Council. "I was amazed when 'Trainspotting' finally came out and this Frankenstein's monster 'Irvine' loomed in the media with tales of vomiting over literary editors," McLean says. "I remember him in a suit and tie."
Welsh started writing, he says, "because I was bored on this long bus journey between New York and Los Angeles." After a stay in London in the early 80's, where he dabbled in drugs and hung around with punk bands, he returned to Edinburgh in 1988, only to discover that Muirhouse had virtually become the heroin capital of Europe. Many of his friends were H.I.V.-positive from sharing needles, which gave him the inspiration for "Trainspotting."
McLean recommended Welsh to his editor, Robin Robertson, who read the book and loved it but was dubious about how well it would sell. It was, after all, written in dialect -- in Edinburgh gutter slang, recorded with phonetic precision: "The sweat wis lashing oafay Sick Boy; he wis trembling. Ah wis jist sitting thair, focusing oan the telly, tryin no tae notice the [expletive]. He wis bringing me doon. Ah tried tae keep ma attention oan the Jean-Claude Van Damme video. . . . Any minute now though, auld Jean-Claude's ready tae git doon tae some serious swedgin." ("Swedgin," you figure out after a couple of paragraphs, means fighting.)
Robertson set up readings and ordered a print run of 3,000. To date, "Trainspotting" has sold more than 350,000 copies. "My books are sold through word of mouth," Welsh says. "The hard-core people that have bought my books have all been working-class clubbers."
AT FIRST BLUSH THE SLUMS OF EDINBURGH WOULD SEEM ONE OF the world's least likely sites for a literary explosion. Muirhouse, where Welsh grew up, is the city's South Bronx or Soweto -- except that the disadvantaged underclass here is white. In "Marabou Stork Nightmares," Welsh writes: "Edinburgh to me represented serfdom. I realized that it was exactly the same situation as Johannesburg; the only difference was that the Kaffirs were white and called schemies." ("Schemies" because they live in housing schemes.)
Given the extraordinarily high unemployment rate, for most people there is not much to do each day except sit around and take drugs or fight or vandalize the place or rob one another.
Or write. Gordon Legge was on the dole in the small town of Grangemouth. McLean took on his odd jobs. Williamson was a journalist on a local paper. Welsh had a variety of jobs -- television repairman, kitchen porter, training officer in the housing department of the Edinburgh District Council; Alan Warner drove trains. But all of them, unknown to one another, were spending every spare minute writing.
"People were workin' away in their own worlds," Legge says, drawing on a cigarette. "Alan always refers to it, like, he was drivin' trains about, writin' away. He'd be drivin' over the Forth Railway Bridge and down below was Duncan workin' away. He'd be driving out by Falkirk and I would be workin' away down there."
In Scotland, writing is a form of protest by the alienated, a subversive act, and subversion and alienation are themes that resonate with Europe's emerging, post-cold-war youth culture. "Scotland is quite a political place, very much left wing," says Legge, a soft-spoken 35-year-old who smokes incessantly but refuses to drink or take drugs and goes to raves only occasionally. "You grow up in a left-wing environment. Going through the first 30 years of your life and never having met a Tory -- I don't think any of us have, you know." Fiercely nationalist, proud of their working-class status and bitter about British domination and exploitation, the Scots are a highly combustible brew, constantly at odds with their keepers in London. "Writers like to have something to kick against," McLean says, shrugging. "The ruling classes are too busy ruling to make the best art."
Beyond that, as many in the group point out, if you are poor and unemployed in an area so deprived that it doesn't even have a movie house, what else is there to do but go to the pub, tell stories and write? "What passes for a common culture in Britain is a middle-class culture," Welsh says. "It's completely at odds from life as it is actually lived for most people."
IN OCTOBER 1994, WHEN JAMES KELMAN WON THE BOOKER PRIZE for "How Late It Was, How Late," the news was greeted in Scotland as vindication. "He should have won it 10 years ago," McLean says. Still, it provided long-overdue recognition for the flurry of creativity that was going on north of the English border.
Kelman's place in the literary canon is assured. As for Welsh, McLean and their circle, it is too early to say. Alan Taylor, who was one of the Booker judges the year Kelman won, is not about to anoint the whole crew. "I feel with a lot of them that there's too little work to know how good they are," he says. "Alan Warner's only written one novel, a very good novel. Irvine Welsh has written three books, but they're static. I think the Rebel Inc. thing is an underground thing, it's still to percolate up. But what they have done is, they've appealed to a readership that is not a literary readership. The most that most of these people had read before was football programs, and suddenly now they're reading books. Irvine Welsh has three novels in the top 10 Scottish best sellers at the moment, which is really quite remarkable."
For the lads, the night is just beginning. Bubbling with enthusiasm, Williamson describes the next venue to me -- the Vaults, a series of catacombs, each a club in itself, throbbing with music, stretching beneath the ancient city. But I have had enough of the literary life and leave the writers to their raving. "The way Sacaea was doing it the music was just a huge journey in that darkness," Alan Warner writes in his novel, "Morvern Callar." "You didn't really have your body as your own, it was part of the dance, the music, the rave."

 BODY:
RICHARD PENNINGTON LOOKS DOUR AS HE THREADS HIS way among the ponytails and little black dresses at Planet Hollywood in the French Quarter. The new Police Superintendent is wearing a splashy tie, and his double-breasted suit makes his broad shoulders appear even more imposing than usual. But he remains silent as his wife, Rene Webb, stops to mingle. Scanning the room through wire-rimmed glasses, Pennington seems aloof, distracted. It has been 18 months since he was brought in from Washington to clean up the New Orleans Police Department, which some have called the worst in America. Yet the chief continues to maintain a wary distance from strangers, still not sure whom to trust.
You can hardly blame him. Only days after his arrival, Pennington learned that in recent years the department has behaved less like a police force than a loose confederation of gangsters terrorizing sections of the city. The Federal Bureau of Investigation informed the chief that it had wiretapped one of his officers, Len Davis, as he allegedly ordered the killing of Kim Groves, a 32-year-old mother of three who had filed a police brutality complaint against him. 
 Even more chilling was that the F.B.I. said it happened to overhear the murder plot while conducting a drug sting, later described as the biggest case of police corruption in New Orleans history. Davis's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. But prosecutors charge that Davis conspired with 10 other officers to use their police positions to guard more than 286 pounds of cocaine that F.B.I. agents posing as dealers had stashed in an abandoned warehouse, according to court papers. By the time the agents managed to decode Davis's street slang and police jargon, it was too late. Kim Groves was shot in the head while standing in front of her house.
Pennington barely had time to recover from that shock when a 24-year-old patrolwoman named Antoinette Frank and an accomplice executed two members of a Vietnamese family who owned the restaurant Frank was robbing and also killed a fellow officer moonlighting as a security guard. Quickly convicted and sentenced to death in September, Frank was the fourth New Orleans Police Department officer charged in connection with a murder in one year and among the more than 50 cops arrested for felonies, including bank robbery and rape, since 1993. Says Pennington, who visited the triple-murder scene that night, "It was kind of mind-blowing."
As Pennington works his way through the crowd at Planet Hollywood, his very presence here is a sign that things are changing. The party is being given by Gambit, a weekly newspaper whose editor, Allen Johnson, has been a persistent critic of the department. Johnson says previous chiefs may not have felt entirely comfortable attending such events in the past. When a guest suggests that the cops in New Orleans are no worse than anywhere else, Johnson says, "Let's put it this way: We may soon have the distinction of having two cops on death row. How many other cities can say that?"
With Davis scheduled to go on trial soon on charges of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of Groves, New Orleans and its police chief have reached a watershed moment. While some of his reforms are in place and there have been no spectacular incidents since the Antoinette Frank murders a year ago this month, Pennington acknowledges that new rules are not enough. His mission is nothing less than to transform a deeply rooted police culture that, as an expression of this city's peculiar character, has defied every attempt over the last century to bring it under control.
Pennington and his wife slip back through the crowd and head for the door. This may be America's party town, but not for them. The new chief knows it's his Police Department now. Stepping onto Decatur Street and disappearing into the muggy New Orleans night, he remains haunted not only by what his cops have already done -- but what they still might do.
T'S 5 O'CLOCK ON A RECENT AFTERNOON, and Pennington is eating a late lunch of peanuts at his desk. He's 48 years old, but his receding hairline and soft-spoken manner give him an almost grandfatherly bearing. In his police uniform, Pennington speaks in a monotone about the dilapidated condition in which he found the department, from sloppily dressed officers to beat-up squad cars. "My office not well lit?" he says. "Oh, man. The furniture was so old; the carpet was old. I had no computer."
Pennington explains his strategy for New Orleans -- lots of Federal assistance, community policing and rigorous new rules. It developed out of the 26 years he spent on the police force in Washington. A native of Little Rock, Ark., who served in the Air Force in Vietnam, he became a police officer in 1968 and couldn't help noticing how much more comfortable blacks felt approaching him than his white partner, a Harvard graduate named Donald Graham, later to become the publisher of The Washington Post. Cops are far more effective when they are active in the communities they police, he says. He was credited with cutting the homicide rate of Washington's violent Seventh District, where he was commander in the early 90's.
Pennington rose to assistant chief, gaining a reputation as a likable, compassionate officer after working closely with Washington's Asian and gay communities and earning a master's degree in counseling. He also developed close relationships with Washington insiders like Louis Freeh, who later became the F.B.I. Director. Pennington was chosen after a six-month national search by Mayor Marc Morial, the 38-year-old son of New Orleans's first black Mayor, Dutch Morial. The younger Morial was elected in 1994 on a promise to control crime and clean up the scandal-plagued department.
Pennington wants to make sure he has his facts right, so he reads from a list he has prepared of his accomplishments, beginning with an 80 percent drop in the homicide rate at the Desire housing project. Located near the Industrial Canal, so far from downtown that the skyline looks like another city, Desire is a sprawling village of nearly 2,000 residents who live in two-story brick buildings put up shortly after World War II. Two-thirds of the apartments are abandoned, graffiti-covered shells that make excellent drug dens. This is where Len Davis roamed freely for years and was known as "Robocop."
Desire provides a case study of the staggering problems facing New Orleans and its Police Department, as well as Pennington's tentative search for solutions. More residents of New Orleans live in poverty -- 32 percent -- than those of any other large American city except Detroit. Some say ghettos like Desire have been ignored for decades because even though black politicians have controlled City Hall since 1978, African-Americans have never broken the white hold on economic power. But some dark-skinned blacks in Desire say they have been victims of racist neglect by the political elite of light-skinned black Creoles. Whether the politicians are white or black, a more prosaic fact has remained constant over the years: there has never been much campaign money in these areas.
The city's tax base has dwindled since the oil business collapsed in the early 1980's, leaving tourism as the main industry providing jobs. And New Orleans's annual budget of $408 million for a population of 479,000 is less than half that of Cleveland, which has about the same population. This leaves few dollars for municipal services like the police force. The department's starting salary of $17,000 is still among the lowest in the nation's big cities, making it difficult for the new chief to replace the 200 officers whom the department, now down to 1,300, lost in the turmoil of recent years.
But Pennington has made a difference in Desire, which becomes clear after only a few moments of accompanying Lieut. Edwin Compass around the projects. Having spent much of his youth in the neighborhood, Compass is now commander of 45 officers in a new 24-hour substation Pennington installed in an abandoned building. Little children run up to Compass and wrap themselves around his legs, and teen-agers playing basketball in the community center invite him to take a few jump shots.
Brother Twin, a former Black Panther who has lived in Desire for 30 years and remembers the day in 1971 when the Panthers had a shootout with more than 100 New Orleans cops, says the fear of the police is diminishing. He gives the lieutenant credit for not flinching when drug dealers firebombed his police car last year as he started making hundreds of arrests.
The Desire substation is being financed with a $2 million Federal grant that Pennington obtained under the 1994 crime bill, a program now under attack by Republicans in Congress. It's just one example of how his Washington experience has come in handy. Another is that Pennington persuaded Freeh to provide two F.B.I. agents to work as part of the police force to root out corruption.
Community policing and Federal dollars, however, can't solve the problems for which the New Orleans Police Department is notorious. James Fyfe, a Temple University professor and New York City officer for 16 years, observes that some departments have reputations for being brutal (like Los Angeles) or corrupt (like New York), and still others are considered incompetent; the New Orleans department has accomplished the rare feat of ranking high nationally in all three categories.
The department allowed the city to become the homicide capital of America in 1992 and 1994 while solving only about 37 percent of the murders, half the national average. It has also ranked near the top in brutality complaints since 1980. Federal officials estimate that 10 to 15 percent of the force is corrupt -- and some cops say privately that the true number is twice that.
Pennington found problems at every turn. A police academy recruit who had been fired over allegations of stealing told the new chief that 9 or 10 classmates had done worse -- including charges involving narcotics. "Sure enough, I found 9 or 10 that had done worse than what he'd done," Pennington says. "So I fired all them, too."
There was no doubt about what Pennington had to do: carry out the reforms suggested in four independent reports that had lambasted the department but were ignored. Pennington raised hiring standards, retrained his officers, set up an early-warning system to flag potentially troublesome officers and created a new public integrity division to seriously investigate allegations of wrongdoing.
Leaning over his desk, Pennington says, "If you took a poll today, probably half the officers will tell you they don't like me." The disfavor seems to transcend race and sex. Floyd Truehill, a black officer, says, "Chief Pennington thinks everybody on the police force is a crook, like we're all dealing drugs or stealing." And a female officer, who insisted on not being identified, is convinced she is not being promoted because she is white. "He's an idiot," she says, "a yes-man for the Mayor."
But some civic leaders see Pennington as the man who could save their city. Even jaded members of an informal network of citizens who share and sometimes publicize information about police misconduct see signs of hope. Mary Howell, a lawyer who has represented victims of police brutality for the last two decades, says: "When Pennington announced his reforms, he called it 'a battle for the soul of our city.' It's a relief to finally hear that kind of language."
THE PEOPLE OF NEW ORLEANS ARE still wary, fearful of crime and distrustful of the police. A tourist walking into a nearly empty souvenir shop on Canal Street late one night finds an immigrant proprietor pleading with him not to leave him alone with the surly character wearing headphones and loitering near the beer case. Why doesn't he call the cops? The man lets out a rueful laugh. Other victims of crime worry that the cops will show up, like the young entrepreneur who runs a cell-phone company. He points to the black scuff marks on a wall where a thief climbed down and stole some equipment. The staff had a meeting about whether to call the police. "But then we figured, 'Hey, we've got a couple hundred thousand dollars' worth of equipment here. Those cops make about $16,000 a year. No way.' "
The more skeptical citizens in New Orleans doubt that Pennington can prevail because the forces that created Len Davis still exist, deeply imbedded in the city's culture and politics. They have heard the rhetoric of reform many times before, which comes as surely as repentance follows Fat Tuesday. There were at least eight periods of outcry in the second half of the 19th century alone, and in the early 1950's, a citizens' commission exposed widespread cases of theft, extortion, bribery and gang rape before the uproar subsided, as always, and the New Orleans Police Department went back to normal.
The department has always been politically manipulated by the mayors, who retain the authority to appoint a chief's deputies. When Sidney Bartholomey was Mayor, from 1986 to 1994, the Police Department really began to fall apart as some deputy chiefs were undercutting the chief because they wanted his job. Each of the four deputies had his own faction. Mike Doyle, head of the city's Civil Service system, says, "We had the equivalent of four Mafia crime families running the Police Department."
By early 1993, when some members of one superintendent's vice squad were caught in a classic shakedown of strip-joint owners right out of "The Big Easy," the department had become so balkanized that feuding cliques began settling scores by leaking evidence of wrongdoing by rival officers. One scandal after another hit the front page of The Times-Picayune: an elaborate system of cops' recovering stolen cars and keeping them, for example, and a patrolman's passing out naked on the floor of a crack house.
Meanwhile, a strange entrepreneurial climate emerged, encouraging officers to put in long hours moonlighting on private security details and to treat police work as their second jobs. These security details served as a kind of legal protection money that gave the department a perverse financial incentive to let crime soar (if neighborhoods were safe, restaurants wouldn't need to hire a cop to stand in the doorway). More important, these jobs weakened the command structure. A patrolman with excellent contacts could hire his superior officers so often to guard restaurants or arenas that he could be responsible for half his boss's annual income.
"How's a captain going to supervise a lieutenant that gives him a detail off duty where he's making hundreds of dollars?" says Pennington, who has limited the number of hours officers can moonlight to 20 hours a week. "You can't discipline him. That lieutenant says: 'Captain, you're getting ready to give me some discipline? For the last two years I've been letting you work at this detail, making an extra $20,000 or $30,000!' "
In such an atmosphere, even cops who weren't running details could quite literally get away with murder, and the internal affairs division was a joke. Though Davis was suspended at least six times for a variety of offenses during his six-year career, from refusing orders from superiors to hitting a woman in the head with his flashlight, most of the complaints made against him were not sustained.
The department also remains deeply divided racially. Pennington's main opponent is the predominantly white Police Association of New Orleans, which lays the blame for officers like Davis and the decline of the department on an affirmative action program that began in 1987 and has quickly brought blacks to account for 45 percent of the police force, though they have still been largely shut out of ranking positions below the deputy chief level. "They wanted a police department that reflected the city of New Orleans," says Lieut. David Bennelli, the No. 2 man at the police association. "Well, they got it."
But Davis was actually following a long entrepreneurial tradition at the department. The only difference is that unlike the "clean corruption" historically practiced by white officers -- shakedowns of French Quarter bar owners, for example -- the new crop of black officers was left with "dirty corruption" of the lucrative but deadly drug world.
That world is deadly, too, for residents of New Orleans who happen to get in the way. Within two hours after Kim Groves's complaint against Davis, which said he had beaten up a neighborhood teen-ager, he found out about it. The next night Groves was shot in front of her home on Alabo Street at point-blank range by a young black male who took off in a car with two other men, witnesses said. It was just before 11 o'clock on the night of Oct. 13, 1994, only hours after Pennington had been sworn in.
SOME PEOPLE IN NEW ORLEANS wonder if Pennington, with his gentle, earnest manner, is tough enough for this town. "They've spread vicious rumors about me, everything they can to discourage me," he says with a shrug. It's true. Cops love telling reporters off the record that he beats his wife, that they've separated, that he's an alcoholic who hangs out in strip joints. But, Pennington says, "I've never thought about quitting."
Since he didn't bring any trusted associates from Washington, Pennington has been forced to rely on ranking officers who learned everything they know from the corrupt culture of the department. "You don't know who to trust," he admits.
"I think Pennington is incredibly isolated," says Mary Howell, the lawyer who filed a lawsuit that tries to hold Davis and three former police superintendents, among others, responsible for Groves's death. "He's out there swimming in shark-infested waters."
Besides revelations during Davis's criminal cases that will keep the department on trial through most of the year, Pennington also has to worry about what might be called the James Parsons syndrome. Parsons, a white chief brought in from Alabama in 1978 by Dutch Morial, was the only other outsider to try reforming the department.
Two years later, a mob of white cops went on a rampage for several days in a black section of town in retaliation for the murder of a police officer. Four people were killed and as many as 50 injured. As Howell tells the story, some people were tortured and others were dragged out to the swamps, where mock executions were performed. Because it happened on Parsons's watch, he was forced to resign, and the former chief believes that was the point all along -- to prove that the New Orleans Police Department was beyond anyone's control.
The same kind of thing could easily happen to Pennington. Last fall, the city got that sick feeling again when it was announced that a patrolman, Victor Gant, was a suspect in the serial killings of 24 people, most of them left lying naked near swamps. But this time, it was Pennington making the disclosure, perhaps to show that he was in control of the department, although no charges have yet been brought. Through the Police Department spokesman, Gant had no comment.
The chief heads out of his office into a corridor, where workers are putting in a new carpet. "They're going turn this into a real office," he says.
But chiefs before him have said that. The question for the people of New Orleans is whether they will finally give the chief the kind of support he needs to succeed.

Better Bargains Than Ever, Far From the Basement

BYLINE: By Lawrence B. Johnson 

 BODY:
AS THE RAGE FOR home theater has pushed music reproduction out of the spotlight, music lovers have gained a paradoxical windfall. The demands of movie soundtracks, with their multichannel sound, have led to improved designs in receivers and generally helped turn hi-fi stereo into a better bargain than ever.
Twenty years ago, in the heyday of hi-fi stereo sound, a really satisfying sound system -- a good receiver, a solidly built turntable with a decent cartridge, and a pair of accurate speakers -- could be had for about $1,500. Today, in the digital age, the same price may yield a system consisting of a better receiver, a well-designed CD player and more musical-sounding speakers. 
 Of course, when 20 years of economic inflation are figured in, $1,500 today is like a red-tag sale compared with the same dollars when Gerald Ford was President. But what remains constant is the need to apportion your budget carefully and shop with some understanding. It is certainly possible to misspend your money and end up with a sound system compromised by a weak link.
The old rule of thumb that 40 percent of your budget should go for speakers, because they ultimately determine the sound of the system, no longer holds. If in fact it was ever a good rule, it has surely been invalidated by the problematic factor of the CD player. In any case, the basic shopping guidelines might be rewritten to this effect: Find a CD player you like, add speakers that please your ears, and finally, match the speakers with a receiver powerful enough to allow them to play loudly without distorting.
Suddenly, the simple aspiration of buying a basic sound system no longer looks simple. You may feel like a centipede that can't decide which foot to move first. But there is a practical solution -- radical and a bit complicated but practical.
Start your quest not in the medium-price showroom, where you intend to make your purchase, but in the high-end room. Ask to hear a rigorously designed CD player -- no matter if it costs $5,000 -- through a sophisticated setup of electronics and speakers. That's your benchmark. Then listen to two or three players in, say, the $400 to $600 range, plugged into the same electronics and speakers. The one that sounds most like the patrician model is the one you want.
You will have learned a valuable lesson. Not only do all CD players not sound alike, but they differ as wildly as phono cartridges ever did. Lest you be tempted to economize with a $125 model from the bargain basement, ask to have one patched into the high-end sound setup. Then switch between the really cheap model and alternatives in your price range, like the California Audio Labs DX-1 ($595), the NAD Model 514 ($499) and the Marantz CD-63 Special Edition ($399).
The importance of starting with a musically sound CD player cannot be overstated. The best speakers in the world cannot transform the hard-edged, glassy, shrill and otherwise distorted sound of a cheap CD player. On the contrary, accurate speakers only underscore the horrors of an inaccurate (meaning distorted) signal from the music source.
Now you can move on to the speakers. Again, you might prevail upon the sales person (by now probably astonished and perhaps resistant) to lug two or three likely bookshelf models into the high-end room, so you can hear them at their best. Using your intended CD player and the store's most regal electronics, settle in for the audition with music you especially like, not some whiz-bang demonstration disk thrust on you by the salesperson. You expect to live with these speakers for a long time; take time and care in making your choice.
Chances are, your budget for CD player, speakers and receiver will break down roughly into thirds. You should have no trouble finding strong speaker candidates for around $500 per pair. The PSB Model 500, the B & W Model 602 and the Energy C-2 all fall into that range, and they but represent a wide assortment of high-quality, medium-price speakers.
But here another old rule of thumb gets fractured, the one that says speakers are the most subjective factor in a sound system and the key to your enjoyment. Well, yes -- but not exactly. The key is not the speakers but system balance: compatibility, if you like.
ALMOST ANY COMPONENTS can be linked together, but just because Tab A will go into Slot B doesn't mean that the two devices will work ideally together. The CD-player caveat having been delivered, another crucial qualifier must now be raised. Once you've picked the speakers you like, it's vitally important to match them with a receiver that has enough power to make them sing at full voice. Among well-designed receivers in the $500 price range are Onkyo's TX-SV525, Pioneer's VSX-604S and Yamaha's RXV-590.
Bad things can happen to sound when you try to drive speakers with an amplifier that doesn't measure up to their power requirements. You never need to worry about overmatching the speakers with an amplifier that is too powerful. It's good to have ample reserve power for sudden bursts of sound.
Bookshelf speakers can be especially demanding because of the physics of obtaining reasonable bass from small cones mounted in a small box. Moreover, a simple statement of wattage (say, 50 watts per channel, or 80, or 100) does not tell you everything you need to know about the capability of an amplifier.
But your ears will remove any doubt. With the cash remaining in your budget, choose two or three receivers with nominally high power ratings, and hook up your preferred speakers to each in turn, again using your intended CD player as the source. Crank up the volume a bit. If, as the music starts to get loud, it also seems to blare rather than bloom, the amp is overtaxed.
Go with the receiver that can deliver a full sonic bloom. And you've got yourself a system.

In Cuba, Music Eases The Pain

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
IN HAVANA, MUSIC IS EVERYWHERE, whispering to you from a distance, infecting your dreams. That Havana isn't in the news. The recent downing of two American civilian airplanes by the Cuban Air Force brought back a familiar image of Cuba. It is the Cuba of the Castro regime and 35 years of often clamorous hostility toward the United States. But beyond this official Cuba is another Cuba that is rarely mentioned, the Cuba of 10 million people struggling to endure hardship exacerbated by the American trade embargo. Music is one way Cubans ease the pain.
In a country with not much of a telephone system, bad television and an untrustworthy or irrelevant press, music becomes a hugely important source of pleasure and communication. Whether it be the African dance music from carnival called comparsa, the newest pop salsa or Afro-Cuban folkloric music, Cuban music rides on the clave, a five-note rhythmic pattern. And that pattern -- constant, often hidden, often manipulated -- is one of the few good certainties of Cuban life. Music, in its Cuban incarnation, opens the door to satisfaction and cultural identification in a materially bare society. 
 Unlike music in much of the first world, music in Cuba is still a live medium. In the old part of Havana, bands play in the street. Rumba groups congregate at night, filling the alleys and side streets with the language and light of drums. Outdoor concerts attract huge audiences, and in a few private houses that are now being turned into restaurants, guitarists sing old Cuban songs to Cubans who remember the words.
There may be discos, and there may be CD's, tapes, records and radio, but in a country short on material goods, there aren't many. The state-run music stores in Havana offer at best 200 titles on CD; that compares with the 90,000 carried by the Tower Records store on lower Broadway in Manhattan. Americans are obsessed with recording, from the answering machine and the video camera to the newest generation of digital gadgets. Paradoxically, this obsession with digitally recorded reality has come at the expense of a kind of socializing associated with the display of artistic ability. At the turn of the century, many American homes had a piano in the parlor, where dance, music and even conversation were art forms that could be practiced.
The hardships worsened by the embargo have helped Cubans preserve that older, personal relationship with the arts. Without the distractions of modern technology, many Cubans have stayed with live music as a source of entertainment. Seemingly everybody has some sort of musical ability. Even being part of an audience allows Cubans to take part in a performance, chanting the chants and dancing the dances. As a result, performers and audiences create a form of social democracy.
Cuban music is still made for adults by adults. The culture of adolescence in the United States, with its endless loop of false rebellion, drives much of the popular arts there. Nothing really comparable exists in Cuba. Rebelliousness carries more danger in Cuba than playing the punk does here; rebels ends up in jail or exile. Because clubs are expensive and outdoor concerts often take place late at night, adolescents in Havana must wait their turn.
FOR AN OUTSIDER, IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE that Cuban musical culture is largely isolated, keeping up by incorporating the occasional artifact that gets washed up on shore. The American embargo, which has crippled the exchange between two of the most musical societies in the world, has seemingly created a musical Galapagos. And like the environment of the Galapagos Islands, Cuban music has flourished in its own way, moving forward on its own evolutionary path. At the same time, it has remained curious about the outside information that comes its way. It is as if Cubans were building entire books from a few found sentences.
In Cuba there are vocal groups built around the music of Bobby McFerrin's experiments in vocal sounds but made Cuban. The singers imitate the sounds of Afro-Cuban percussion, creating an entire drum choir made of singers. The drum kit, borrowed from American music and ignored in more traditional Puerto Rican and New York salsa, is a major part of the percussion arsenal of Cuban groups. Fusion still exerts a strong magnetic pull on the compasses of Cuban musicians. The best musicians there spend a good portion of their year traveling or living abroad, being influenced by their travels. But generally barred from performing in the United States, they are forced to take its music from secondhand sources.
At first Cuban music sounds busy; when American jazz soloists stand up next to Cuban musicians, they seem tranquil and restrained. The Cubans are overamplified. They create raucous, shouting music. It's thick, vibrant and made as if to compensate for the dire want that is visible everywhere. The music is tactile. And the street, with all its public displays of life, is still in the music. The music repays the favor by taking on the street's volume, its amiability, the cacophony of its life. And it shows it off, proud to be able to integrate as much of the existence of a people as it can.

THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
A Journey at the Dawn of the 21st Century.
By Robert D. Kaplan.
476 pp. New York:
Random House. $27.50.
Robert D. Kaplan is an American master of a newish genre that might be called travel writing from hell. Old-style travel writers went in search of the untrammeled and the unspoiled. New-style travel writers seem to seek out Xanadus that are as trammeled and spoiled as possible. Mr.Kaplan is a connoisseur of malarial marshes, urinous bus stations, flea-bitten hotels and the louche charm of the hustlers, fixers and tramps he meets along the way. Many of the best writers in this new genre are English: Bruce Chatwin, James Fenton and Redmond O'Hanlon. Mr. Kaplan's work does not match theirs in irony, subtlety or humor, but he is their equal in political imagination. 
 Because he specializes in exploring the San Andreas faults of the modern geopolitical system, his books have had more influence on politicians and policy makers than most travel writing. An earlier work, "Balkan Ghosts," found its way onto President Clinton's Bosnia reading list, and the President reportedly came away less inclined to intervene because of Mr. Kaplan's emphasis on the ancient and intractable character of Balkan feuds. "The Coming Anarchy" -- Mr. Kaplan's 1994 Atlantic Monthly article -- was intended as a plea for Western engagement with the problems of the third world, but its nightmare scenario of spreading civil war, ecological disaster and demographic explosion hardly engendered much optimistic activism.
"The Ends of the Earth" is a continuation of the argument in "The Coming Anarchy," and it is likely to have the same ambiguous impact. He wants us to care about the places he visits, but the story he tells is so disturbing that both policy makers and general readers are more likely to pull the covers over their heads. This would be a shame, for the question Mr. Kaplan keeps asking is essential to global survival: why are some third-world societies successfully coping with resource depletion and population growth while others are going under?
Mr. Kaplan's journey in search of answers begins in Sierra Leone in West Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the disaster story of his tale: rocketing population, unraveling families, uncontrolled flight to the cities, radical deforestation, raging civil wars and states disintegrating under the strain. Apologists for Africa put this down to slavery or colonialism or the bad old first world, but Mr. Kaplan insists that these are excuses. When Ghana became independent in 1957, for instance, it had a G.N.P. equal to that of South Korea. Now South Korea -- less richly endowed in natural resources than Ghana -- is exporting cars and television sets to Africa.
In Egypt, Mr. Kaplan's next destination, the same factors -- uncontrolled population growth, urban chaos and environmental despoliation -- are putting society under severe strain. But Islam's fierce disciplines are keeping the social fabric from going the way of Sierra Leone; and the Egyptian state, "a calcifying, Ozymandian monolith" -- as Mr. Kaplan calls it -- is still unevenly in control. But food scarcity and an exploding population, he predicts, will force the state either to become more authoritarian or to give way to the fundamentalists.
In Turkey, his next stop, Mr. Kaplan becomes more optimistic. Here there is the same tidal wave of people into the cities -- Istanbul has 10 million inhabitants, making it Europe's largest city -- but in slums like Golden Mountain in Ankara "the architectural bedlam of cinder and sheet metal and cardboard walls was deceiving. Inside was a home -- order, that is, bespeaking dignity. I saw a working refrigerator, a television, a wall cabinet with a few books and lots of family pictures, a few plants . . . and a stove. The floors were spotless and there were no bad odors."
For these slum dwellers, the free market is an abstraction and the Turkish state is far away. What gives hope, order and discipline to their lives is what Mr. Kaplan refers to as the "mortar" of their society or the "muscle tone" of their civilization. Families have kept together through the migration from rural Anatolia to Golden Mountain, and they have hung on to their Muslim faith. Mr. Kaplan here joins those, like Francis Fukuyama, who contend that the third-world societies with the best chance of managing their entry into modernity are those, paradoxically, with deep and stabilizing reserves of tradition, culture and belief. The problem with the argument is its vagueness, and as Mr. Kaplan honestly acknowledges, tradition-rich societies like Cambodia are not managing their transitions any more effectively than Sierra Leone.
Iran, Mr. Kaplan's next stop, turns out to be less fundamentalist, less anti-American and less fanatical than the cliche's of the embassy-siege era would have it. Khomeini's moral revolution is being taken apart by women. Beneath the severity of the chador, lipstick and powder are making their appearance, and in the Teheran streets women boldly return the male gaze. Islamic asceticism is being replaced by a resurgence of Persian pride. Iran, he concludes, is much less obsessed with the Great Satan and its Israeli ally than with its own rivalry with Turkey in the huge region of the Caucasus and Central Asia left open by the collapse of the Soviet empire.
In what was Soviet Central Asia, Mr. Kaplan discovers that all social mortar seems to have given way, along with the balance between man and nature. In Samarkand and Bukhara -- favored destinations of the old genre of romantic travel writers -- Mr. Kaplan finds the fabled splendor all but buried beneath Soviet concrete. No great industrial civilization, he writes, has so systematically poisoned its land, water and people. The view from the bus on the road from Samarkand to Bukhara is of ecological devastation:
"There was no shade. Here and there were the iron-roofed blockhouses of collective farms, with walls of cinder blocks and dried mud. There was no sign that a copse of trees had ever been planted here or a fence painted; no sign of anything personal."
On overnight bus rides through this blighted landscape, Mr. Kaplan encounters drunken, violent, disoriented Russians, Uzbeks, Tajiks and Uighurs, who, having lost a land to love, have lost their own identities. The Soviet empire has been replaced by "bazaar states," run by local ethnic mafias, but these in turn are being rapidly eroded as Turkey, Iran and China seek to extend their cultural influence and economic control. Only in the province of Xinjiang in China does Mr. Kaplan find a state apparatus in this region that still works. Communism survives here as the necessary sociopolitical mortar for an emerging market system.
As he continues his journey across the high Himalayan passes from China into Pakistan, and then southwards through the Indian subcontinent and into Southeast Asia, he sees more and more depressing evidence of states simply unable to cope. The cities of Karachi, Delhi and Bangkok are growing so fast that infrastructures are breaking down; disease, gang violence and a deadly pall of pollution are taking over. Still, Mr. Kaplan's sense of hope is restored by the Rishi Valley in south India, where he comes upon a program of reforestation and development, entirely sustained by local people.
His journey done, Mr. Kaplan arrives at some stark but also contradictory conclusions. On the one hand, he argues that no amount of aid or outside intervention is likely to turn third world states around. They must develop or recover their "natural muscle tone" themselves. On the other hand, he maintains that the West must remain engaged with these societies, helping them -- he does not say how -- to manage their entrance into modernity. Otherwise, disease, environmental degradation and crime will spread north. Policy makers will look in vain for advice and prescription from this grim journey.
Mr. Kaplan's general message -- that the history of the next century will be shaped not in America or in the Mediterranean basin, but by conflicts among ancient civilizations -- Turkish, Chinese, Persian, Hindu and Buddhist -- has been anticipated, in general outline, by Samuel Huntington. But Mr. Kaplan is the first traveler to take us on a journey to the jagged places where these tectonic plates meet, and his argument -- that our future is being shaped far away "at the ends of the earth" -- makes his travelogue pertinent and compelling reading.

HEADLINE: The View From: Dover Plains;
With Riders of the 6:33: A Train Like No Other

BYLINE: By LYNN AMES 

DATELINE: DOVER PLAINS, N.Y.

 BODY:
PHIL CELENTANO commutes to Manhattan every day not unusual except for the fact that he lives in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts.
A 40-year-old collections manager for a telecommunications company, he wakes up each morning at 4 o'clock in his house in Lee, just north of Stockbridge. After a quick breakfast, he drives for an hour and a half to Dover Plains in Dutchess County. There, he boards the 6:33. The train, on Metro-North's Harlem Line, arrives at Grand Central Terminal at 8:26. 
 At the end of the day, Mr. Celentano catches the 5:16 out of Grand Central. He steps off the train at Dover Plains at 7:12 and drives back to Lee, generally getting home around 9 o'clock. By 10 o'clock, he said, he is fast asleep.
Mr. Celentano's routine elicits astonished gasps from those who find that any commute -- even a short one from, say, Scarsdale or White Plains -- gets to be a bit of a grind after a while. On the 6:33, however, he is far from alone. True, he is known as the guy from Massachusetts, the one making the longest trip, but there are plenty of people who commute almost as far. They live in northern Connecticut, in towns like Sharon, New Preston and Kent, and in Columbia and Dutchess Counties in New York. Before the first light has barely touched the sky, they are in their seats, reading newspapers, using laptop computers, chatting with one another. Most remarkable perhaps, they enjoy it.
"This train is like no other," Mary Jane Zukowski, a nurse paralegal who lives in Millbrook, said as she settled into her seat on the 6:33 on a recent morning. "There's a great sense of camaraderie -- everyone knows each other."
Indeed, the long-distance commuters seem to revel in their stamina, their discipline, the choices they have made to live in rural hamlets. Over and over they spoke of their fondness for quaint villages, wide-open vistas, farm-like settings and friendly neighbors.
"My neighbors are cows," said Sue Edelstein, a 43-year-old marketing director whose chic outfit and chiffon scarf seemed more suited to Manhattan than her Gaylordsville, Conn., home. "We lived in Brooklyn until a year and a half ago, and I would never move back." Like many others who made the move to the country, she worries that more people will follow suit and spoil the atmosphere. "We got involved with a citizens group that's trying to stop a big-chain supermarket from going up near us," she said. "It also worries me that they're going to build a platform at the Dover Plains station, which will look like a regular station anywhere. Now, we can actually walk across the track. It is a quaint little stop in a quaint little town."
But the stops along the Harlem Line's northernmost route are no longer "quaint little towns," Donald N. Nelson, president of Metro-North, said. Putnam, Dutchess and Columbia Counties are "where the affordable housing is now," he said. The annual ridership from Dover Plains to Grand Central has risen in the last decade from 41,892 to 199,707.
A total of 20 trains -- 10 each way -- make the daily run, the earliest leaving Dover Plains at 5:31 and the last leaving Grand Central at 9:49. Dover Plains is 77 miles from Manhattan; this summer, Metro-North will extend its service 5 miles north to Wassaic. "That way, we'll start getting them from Maine," Dan Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman, said with a laugh.
Metro-North also plans to renovate five stations, including the one in Dover Plains. Currently, this stop is as picturesque as a Norman Rockwell painting: one set of trains, one train (a two-car train at 5:31; six cars at 6:33), a small, shingled station no longer in use. On either side of the tracks are village streets, lined with brick and clapboard buildings.
One of these is Geo's Deli, a breakfast and lunch spot where the owner, George Dougherty, serves strawberry- and chocolate-flavored cream cheese on bagels, coffee, buttered rolls, and the like. His customers are local folk who live and work in or near town as well as commuters and Metro-North personnel. Mike Fagan, the conductor on the 6:33, and William Rohrig, the train's engineer, and Tom Mabie, its brakeman, take the same table every day.
Mr. Fagan is not only well known at Geo's, he is something of a celebrity on his train. Passengers repeatedly said that it is his gregarious nature -- he is on a first-name basis with all the regulars -- that give thistrain its personality. Mr. Fagan has even organized several dinners at local restaurants, attended by riders of the 6:33.
"Everyone knows Mike, and Mike knows everyone," Ms. Edelstein said. "This is the friendliest train in the world."
It is not only friendliness that makes the 6:33 so popular. Economic realities have pushed home buyers farther and farther up the line. A five-bedroom Colonial-style house with two fireplaces on an acre and a half in Millerton in Dutchess County is offered in a real estate guide for $189,000. The price for a comparable home in Westchester would probably be two or three times that. A four-bedroom ranch in Dover Plains is on the market for $89,500.
Robert Bailey, a 40-year-old commercial real estate broker, recently moved from Chappaqua to Amenia in Dutchess County. The cost of living, he said, is "a lot lower." He also said Chappaqua had become too slick, "too suburban," an ironic comment about a village once considered the epitome of country quaint. "Chappaqua has gotten hard edged and materialistic," he said. "People who moved there in recent years have high expectations but a low level of contribution. There is no sense of community like there is in Amenia." Asked if his longer commute ever made him weary, he replied, "That's the price I pay for living in God's country."
Mr. Celentano also said that he would not trade places with anyone. He and his wife own and live in a bed and breakfast in Lee and, he said, the extraordinary commute is worth the effort. "People think I'm crazy. But really, the trip's not all that bad -- I sleep the whole way. I used to commute from Farmingdale, L. I. I think that short ride on the Long Island Rail Road was harder than this. Hey, everybody does what they have to do."

Watchung Power Center Proposed at Lockheed Site

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: WATCHUNG

 BODY:
FOR more than 30 years, the 85-acre Lockheed Electronics complex was a constant sight alongside Route 22 in the Somerset County Borough of Watchung. But in 1990 it closed, leaving behind a prime, albeit polluted, piece of property.
To maximize its redevelopment potential borough officials, working with Lockheed Electronics (a subsidiary of what is now Lockheed Martin Corporation), rezoned the site in 1994 from industrial to highway commercial use. This permits retail on its site along a main shopping corridor in Union and Somerset Counties. 
 And Lockheed Electronics set out to meet the state law requiring that the site, which contained levels of trichloreoethylene -- a solvent for fats, oils and waxes, be cleaned before it is redeveloped.
Since then 75 acres of the site have been cleaned, the remaining 10 acres are being cleaned and much of the old complex has been razed. Now a developer is proposing to turn the 75 acres into a 750,000-square-foot shopping center, despite a softening in the retail market and the bankruptcies of some national discounters.
The proposal, which still must receive approvals from the borough's planning board, underscores several characteristics of contemporary commercial development. One is the trend toward power centers. Watchung Square, as the project is known, would meet the definition of a power center that the International Council of Shopping Centers, based in Manhattan, uses: an open-air retail strip with 250,000 to 750,000 square feet of space and three or more large speciality stores.
Such centers are growing rapidly, increasing nationally over the last year by 60 percent to 461 centers, from 287 in 1994. At the same time, only seven regional malls with more than 800,000 square feet of space were built, according to the council.
"It is the way of the future and the type of development that makes sense in today's environment," said Sal A. Davino, president of Watchung Square Associates, the corporate entity created to develop the project. Mr. Davino, a long-time shopping center developer, also heads Fidelity Land Development Corporation in Chatham.
Plans for Watchung Square call for the $75 million open-air center, designed by architect Patrick Marchetta of Lyndhurst, to comprise a group of six low-rise buildings, instead of one interconnecting strip of stores, scattered near the edges of the sloping site. It would have a 127,442-square-foot Home Depot and a 123,680-square-foot Target department store, a Minneapolis-based chain that is entering the New Jersey retail market.
There would also be a 66,000-square-foot supermarket, a 14-screen theater, some 10 smaller shops and a restaurant, as well as parking for 3,300 cars in front of the stores and concentrated at the site's core.
The project is also indicative of the recycling of old industrial sites to new uses, which follows the aims of the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan. The plan encourages growth where highways and utilities are in place and discourages it in less developed areas.
And it speaks to the long-standing struggle many communities across the state face -- how to diversify their economic bases while still preserving residents' quality of life.
Anthony F. Addario, the Mayor of Watchung, said that the closing of Lockheed, among the larger of the borough's revenue producers, was a blow and that the retail center, which he said was about a $50 million ratable, would "help keep the lid on property taxes." He said that a retail use on the site "blends right in with Route 22."
Still, some residents feel the town may be too eager in its pursuit of ratables. A citizens group called Concerned Homeowners of Watchung was formed last August in response to the project, with more than 100 members. It wants to see how the shopping center "impacts Watchung and its residents," said R. Lawrence Chory, a 17-year resident who is a co-founder.
MR. CHORY said his group's main concerns were the project's scale, its tenant mix and the additional traffic it would create. He said it also felt that so large a project would require more municipal services that the revenue it would generate would not cover. Residents of neighboring North Plainfield are also concerned about the project's impact, including noise and water runoff, as are local officials there and in nearby Green Brook, he added.
Mr. Davino said the plan had already been changed to try to address some of the issues. In one revision the buffer zone between the project and the residences has been enlarged by 25 feet to 125 feet. He also said that some $3 million in off-site road improvements were planned to accommodate the project. They include the installation of a traffic light, improvements to nine intersections, and the widening of a stretch of Route 22 to six lanes from four.
Watchung Square is the largest development proposed in decades in the 6.2-square-mile borough. Its site is one of the few large tracts available for development along the half-mile stretch of Route 22 in the town, where retail stores are the prevailing land use.
Finding that size tract in a established retail area is rare, said Mr. Davino, noting that it sits between the highway shopping hub in Union Township and the Bridgewater Commons Mall in Bridgewater.
"It is a true niche market," he said, noting that the area's demographics could support retail. Some 213,500 people with an average household income of $68,927 live within a five-mile radius of the proposed center, he said, and 64,710 cars pass the site each day. Mr. Davino said most of the tenants have signed contracts to be in the center, where he said rents were expected to range from $15 to $24 a square foot.
Retail brokers agree that the area is ripe for development. "It is one of the rare places in New Jersey where it feels as though there should be a regional mall -- but it's missing," said Richard Brunelli, president of a brokerage in Old Bridge bearing his name.
He puts the vacancy rate in strip centers and free-standing stores along the entire 21-mile Route 22 corridor, from Union to Somerville at 5.4 percent, up from 3.9 percent a year ago. Mr. Brunelli said most of the vacancies were in smaller stores not big boxes, "which are driving the market" and reflect "consumer preferences for more convenient shopping." The vacancy rate in the six major Northern New Jersey corridors is 6.1 percent.
"By and large residents recognize that the borough lost Lockheed and that you don't just let 75 acres along Route 22 go to waste," said Donald V. Speeney, chairman of the borough's planning board. "We're working through the issues."
MR. CHORY said that the goal of his citizen's group "is not to stop Watchung Square but to downsize it to a scale that is appropriate for the site and for Watchung." Right now, he said, the project is three-quarters the size of Bridgewater Commons Mall, which he said was excessive.
A more reasonable scale project might be 600,000 square feet minus the movie theater, he said, adding that there should be some attempt to keep open the remaining 10 acres, which is not part of the current project
Mr. Speeney, chairman of the planning board, said that was a concept that had recently come under discussion. Mayor Addario added that he was confident that after all the sides are heard Watchung will have a project that it "can live with."

HEADLINE: Construction of $1 Million 'Main Line' Homes Surges

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: RADNOR, Pa.

 BODY:
A SURGE in the construction of homes selling for $1 million or more is under way in the exclusive Main Line, about a dozen communities northwest of Philadelphia and within a 20-minute drive of downtown.
Developable land in these communities -- among them, Bryn Mawr, Rosemont, Wayne and Gladwyne -- is scarce and local approvals are difficult and time-consuming. But in recent months, builders have overcome the hurdles to subdivision approval in Lower Merion and Radnor Townships, which embrace several smaller communities. The result is that about 50 new houses are either being built or are in preconstruction marketing. 
 The largest new development is the 66-acre Brooke Farm, in St. Davids (part of Radnor Township), once the undeveloped property of the late Joseph N. DuBarry 4th, a prominent lawyer who died in 1993. The three-year-old, 29-house project is a joint venture of three developers. Nelson Vaughn, president of N. Vaughn & Sons of Devon, Pa., one of the builders, said the property -- worth about $8 million with its subdivision approval in place, he said -- would require about $2 million in improvements, including roads, sewer hookups and underground stormwater runoff lines.
Mr. Vaughn said the DuBarry family was willing to accept deferred payment for the property, taking instead a percentage of the sale price of each home. This, Mr. Vaughn said, would give the DuBarrys more than they would have realized for selling the unimproved property and the developers would be unfettered by the carrying charges had a loan been required to buy the land.
So far, two homes at Brooke Farm, priced at $1.1 million and $1.3 million, were sold by Mr. Vaughn's partners, B.J. Drueding Builders of St. Davids and Pohlig Builders of Malvern. There are deposits on four other sites, said Mr. Vaughn. "This will probably be the premier address in this area for a long time," he said. "There aren't many other areas with this location and natural beauty available for new construction. It has both woods and meadow and we were able to save most of the wooded area by putting the homes in the center of the site."
Many Brooke Farm homes are on three-quarter-acre lots that are narrow at the street front but wider at the rear yard.
B.J. Drueding, president of the company that bears his name, said he expected that it would be four years before all the homes were completed and sold. Roads will be paved by May, he said, and the sole model home should be finished by June 1.
BECAUSE it is so hard to get approvals for a subdivision, builders must be willing and able to take a long-term risk. Gaining all the clearances needed to begin construction may take as much as three years, said Todd Pohlig, president of Pohlig Builders. The DuBarry family obtained the subdivision approval for Brooke Farm before selling the site to the builders.
"A good number of large estates came in for subdivision approval just before I got here nine years ago," said Robert Crawford, township manager for Radnor Township. "But every subdivision here is a different process. The review process is often very lengthy and we get a lot of public input."
Voter approval of a $10 million bond issue last year to finance open space preservation and periodic moratoriums on new sewer connections several years ago slowed development, said Lawrence Flick, president of Roach Wheeler Realtors in Devon, a Main Line community. But the shrinking number of available building sites means that former country estates of elite families are undergoing a generational change, as families or heirs sell them to developers if they cannot find a single buyer for a multi-acre property and single residence.
Originally developed in the late 1800's, the Main Line was a refuge from the industrializing city, said Roger Moss, director of the Athenaeum, Philadelphia's library for architecture and rare books. Most of its houses are distinctive, built of rugged looking gray Wissahickon schist stone, which was quarried locally, and the quality of workmanship was high.
Nowadays, Mr. Moss said, "people simply can't afford to build with the kinds of hand-wrought ironwork and leaded windows that were quite common before the Depression."
Today's buyers want the best of both Old World and new construction, said Cynthia Roberts, associate broker at Roach Wheeler, with traditional English manor facades and mature landscaping as well as large rooms with oversize windows and new building technology. The Main Line has a 22-month supply of homes valued at $1 million or more and the popularity of new homes can make older ones a hard sell, she said.
"Certain areas are almost recession-proof," Ms. Roberts said. "but we haven't sold homes in those neighborhoods as quickly as they've come on the market. The cost of ground is so fiercely expensive and the cost of getting a development through township approvals means the builder is forced to market a home at a tremendous price. And a newer home in the lower price ranges in some communities just doesn't exist."
Less than a mile separates homes costing $100,000 and others worth $1 million in Wayne and Bryn Mawr, and students from nearby Haverford College and other schools create an eclectic mix in the town shopping districts. But asking prices moderated following the early-90's recession, Ms. Roberts said, as sellers recognized the relatively flat property values of older homes.
In Lower Merion Township, only about two dozen homes sell for more than $500,000 each year, according to statistics compiled by Realist Inc., a Philadelphia real estate database service. That number dipped to 14 in 1993 but the average price reached $744,000 that year; in 1995, there were 26 sales averaging $700,957. In Radnor Township last year, 76 homes were sold for more than $500,000 -- at an average price of $642,000; in 1994, there were 42 sales at an average of $799,000.
Buyers of new homes on the Main Line are passing up pastures for smaller yards and insisting on modern room layouts and technology, said Louis Nemeth, who is building three homes at Fortenbaugh Woods, a five-acre site here owned by Samuel Fortenbaugh, a Philadelphia attorney. The homes will range in price from $790,000 to $1 million, Mr. Nemeth said.
ONE of Mr. Nemeth's buyers, Toby Charrington, who has lived on the Main Line all his life, plans to sell the Nemeth-designed home he owns in Haverford. He expects to move into his new home in the fall.
"We needed some more room upstairs and came close to adding two new bedrooms and two new bathrooms for our children," said Mr. Charrington of his Haverford home. "We looked at all sorts of houses and made bids on two that would have required a lot of work. My wife preferred a turnkey house and when we heard about this opportunity, we didn't want to miss out."
Mr. Charrington's home will be the second in the Nemeth project, after the 6,000-square-foot model home. That home has four bedrooms and eight bathrooms, with an entire floor that can be a suite for a live-in nanny or visitors. Mr. Nemeth, who has 22 years of experience as a developer and an office in nearby Ardmore, Pa., said he had the patience needed to build on the Main Line. "It's a complicated issue to go through subdivision and convince six or seven different agencies, plus the neighbors," he said. "But owners want to get the most value out of their property by subdividing it."

HEADLINE: On the Track Of a Weekend House That's Affordable

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE town of Heath, Mass., is the kind of place where a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story might be filmed. In early spring, its village green appears bleak and pure, an assemblage of white clapboard mid-19th century buildings: a community hall that offers square dancing every other Saturday and a former church without a steeple that now houses the three selectmen, the town clerk, the library and the post office.
Down the street, the old Center School House, its stern white sides also covered with clapboard, is a town museum. 
 "There's no McDonald's here," said Margaret Howland, the president of the Heath Historical Society and the owner of the Deaconess Knapp House, a turn-of-the century shingled cottage in the woods near the green, currently for sale for $69,500.
Though she finds it hard to believe, Mrs. Howland concedes that yes, most people who have looked at her house "are people from out of town, out of state even." But she leaves no doubt in the mind of any outlander who is thinking of Heath as a weekend getaway destination: "Whoever purchases in Heath has to realize there's no store right on the corner, no movie a mile away."
"This is true country living," the historical society president said proudly -- and a bit defiantly.
For those willing to travel an hour or two longer than what many might consider acceptable -- it takes about four hours to drive to Heath from midtown Manhattan -- or for those who will live near, but not in, the pricier towns of northwest Connecticut, or for whom the Hamptons are not the only Long Island address, weekend homes are available for much less money than they might have guessed.
A small white cottage with a fireplace on 12 Berkshire acres and a rutted dirt road near the Heath-Rowe border, for sale at $79,000, might cost triple that amount 30 miles south in Lenox, Mass. A magnificent red 1877 Victorian -- complete with original glassed-front pantry cabinets -- in Falls Village, Conn., might, in neighboring Salisbury, go for double the $375,000 asking price. A shingled 1930's gambrel on a quiet street in Bellport, L.I., is priced at $295,000 -- about half what it might fetch in the village of East Hampton, about 45 minutes farther east.
In Columbia County, N.Y., south of Albany, towns like Chatham and Old Chatham have been "discovered," according to brokers, but prices generally remain lower than they are in comparable towns in neighboring Dutchess or Putnam Counties, which can be an hour or more closer to Manhattan. For many getaway homebuyers, it seems, the difference between arriving at a weekend place at 7:30 Friday night and arriving at 8:30 or 9 is worth a lot of money.
"The drive was the stumbling block -- no question," said Karen Verrill, who with her husband, Charles, a Manhattan literary agent, has bought a stone cottage, on 4.5 acres, that the late theologian Reinhold Niebuhr built in 1933 near the center of Heath.
The Verrills, who have three children and live in Brooklyn, discovered Heath after they answered an advertisement in the Park Slope Food Coop News for a house in nearby Shelburne Falls, a historic riverside town with a burgeoning crafts community. Mr. Verrill mentioned the house to one of his clients, who lives in Ashfield, Mass., and who promptly sent them to look at a place near his own. "We didn't think we wanted to be that far north," said Mrs. Verrill, "but then we heard about the Niebuhr cottage."
WITH directions supplied by the realtor, they drove to the property with their children and wandered around the grounds. Peeking in the windows, they saw a large living room with a fireplace, many small-paned windows and an unrenovated kitchen. From the two porches there was a view of Mount Greylock and a pond.
The next weekend they returned without the children.
The asking price on the seven-room, three-bedroom house was $149,900. They decided they would rent it first with an option to buy. "We thought it was beautiful, but we wanted to see how we liked the town," said Mrs. Verrill, a former dance instructor. "We came to love it. The people are very friendly. There's everyone, from people whose families have been there forever to 60's hippies to university professors -- Williamstown and Bennington are about a half hour away."
In Bellport, L.I., getaway homebuyers can find prices much lower than they are in the Hamptons, and the distance from Manhattan is shorter. Although brokers say that few people who own weekend houses take the train, some Manhattanites keep their cars at their weekend house and travel by train to and from the city, taking a $5 cab ride back and forth to the station.
Most people, however, take the Long Island Expressway. On a recent weekday about noon, it took less than an hour and a half to drive to Bellport, compared with two hours to Southampton. Proponents of Bellport are quick to point out that on a Friday night, the difference can be . . . well, everyone has a story about driving to the Hamptons on a Friday night.
But Bellport is not the Hamptons.
"We're not as upscaly," said Eileen A. Green, who runs a Bellport real estate office. "It's a totally different feel; it's like comparing the Upper East Side of Manhattan to the Upper West Side." Leaving no doubt as to where her sympathies lie, she added: "I consider myself a West Side person."
Bellport also has a more diverse population both economically and racially, she said, and a second-home ownership rate of only 15 percent, as opposed to over 50 percent in the Hamptons.
The racial and economic diversity of Bellport was one reason Donald Bernstein, a Manhattan lawyer, and Jo Ellen Finkel, a doctor, chose Bellport, they said. They had rented for several years in Weston, Conn., a scenic village in northwest Connecticut. "That's about the same distance from Manhattan as Bellport," Mr. Bernstein said. "We wanted to be within striking distance of the city because we use the house for weekends all year round."
The town of Bellport, which has several small beaches for children, also owns a large beach on Fire Island, and Mr. Bernstein said the 10-minute ride on the ferry, used only by Bellport residents and their guests, is one of the summertime treats. "The golf course is also owned by the town," he said, "so you don't have some of the negative aspects of private clubs."
The Bernsteins bought a pristine white colonial-style house, built about 1845, on 2.7 acres in the village. The house is reached by a long drive back from the main street. It had once been the caretaker's house on an estate, and it was moved to its present site in 1992, at which time it was given elegant landscaping, a circular drive and a swimming pool -- along with a new foundation, new plumbing and new electricity.
Although Mr. Bernstein declined to disclose what he paid for the house, houses in similar locations in Bellport usually bring between $600,000 and $700,000. "To get something comparable in the Hamptons, you would pay at least 30 to 50 percent more than we paid," Mr. Bernstein said.
In Bellport, a seeker after the ideal weekend house could pick a tiny vinyl-sided bungalow at the end of the cul-de-sac on the less desirable side of town, complete with fireplace and back lawn ($149,000). The buyer with more to spend might prefer one of the large old shingled houses on a street leading to the water (usually $600,000 to $800,000).
And although Bellport residents stress the town's "low key" outlook, it is not without its own celebrities, Ms. Green said: Charlie Rose, the television interviewer, bought a house about a year ago for $850,000; Isabella Rossellini, the actress, along with the photographers Bruce Weber and Steven Meisel, own property in town.
Every weekender's town, it seems, has its own glossily painted sheen -- or a deliberate lack of one -- and Columbia County's most sought-after towns seem to revel in their sparser, generally more raffish look.
In Chatham, N.Y., besides the shoestore, the tack shop, the kitchen store, the Chinese takeout and the bookstore, there is the Crandall Movie House, currently showing "Mr. Holland's Opus" for a $3 admission charge. "The price just went up from $2.50," said Audrey G. Schoenfeld, a real estate agent.
House prices have leveled off over the last few years, Ms. Schoenfeld said, and are moving slowly upward, especially in the county's "blue chip" towns like Malden Bridge and Old Chatham, hamlets in Chatham, and the Spencertown hamlet in Austerlitz.
The Chathams are smack in the center of horse country, and property often comes with extensive acreage. In Chatham, horse lovers could find a 92-acre Quaker farmstead off Country Road 13 for $645,000. And last year, William and Joy Howe of Scarsdale bought Day-O Farm, once Harry Belafonte's compound, on 140 acres for $870,000.
The mid-19th-century white house has grace but is not overwhelming in size. There is a pool, a pool house with sleeping quarters, an elaborate billiards hall above the garage, a refined smaller house near the road for the caretaker, and a new guest house high on a ridge.
But even in the Chathams, there is room for weekenders seeking something less than an estate. Last year, Lauren Letelier and Chris Atkins, a young couple from New York City, found an 1833 saltbox on Shaker Museum Road in Malden Bridge, known as one of the nicest roads in town, for only $130,000. Now the two are up to their necks in sheetrock dust as they supervise a team of workers who, judging from the camaraderie, have become their friends.
And in Claverack, a town with a more blue-collar character, Garrick Utley, the broadcaster, is selling his former stagecoach tavern on the Old Post Road, with five-and-a-half acres -- a primitive masterpiece with a stream -- for $349,000. One woman from the area, who is house hunting and had heard about the house, said she eliminated it for two reasons: She doesn't like Claverack, and she has been told the house needs a lot of work.
But it has been restored to its early and esthetically correct condition. The wide floorboards have been left unsanded, mantles have been taken down to their original shades of blue and green, kitchen cupboards have been custom built from old boards in a ruined mill across the street. Actually, the house comes with several high-tech features, including an automatic irrigation system fed from the stream.
MOVING closer to the posh northwestern corner of Connecticut, there is an 1800 center-hall house just outside Millerton, N.Y., in Dutchess County, with a primitive Palladian window and a tennis court across the road. The house comes with 17 acres; the owners are asking $685,000.
Robinson Leech, who owns a real estate company in Lakeville, Conn., and who has listed the house, said that a similar house in Salisbury or Sharon -- two highly groomed, highly priced Litchfield County villages only 10 minutes away -- might come on the market for anywhere from $795,000 to $895,000 "and might sell for $650,000." He estimated that the Millerton house, which has been on the market about a year, might eventually trade in the "mid-fives."
Why the difference? Partly taxes, Mr. Leech said. New York has a piggy-backed school tax, which brings the Millerton property's taxes to just over $6,000 a year. (Taxes for a 47-acre farm in Sharon with carriage barns and stable are $4,700.)
But there is also a more esthetic difference. While the old colonial-style house is in a historic district and surrounded by lovely homes, Millerton has a main street with a Burger King, several car dealerships, a movie theater, oil-change shops, a diesel tune-up station and a car wash, among other businesses.
"Many people run over the line to get their oil changed," said Mr. Leech, primly.
About six miles from Salisbury is Falls Village, a tiny town with no strip malls or diesel tune-up places, a charming enclave where the prices reflect a central point: It isn't Sharon or Salisbury.
In Falls Village, which like the other towns is a little more than two hours from New York City, a wreck of a farmhouse and an old red barn on 78 acres on a winding, hilly side road sold last fall for $350,000. And another is for sale. On the same road, Undermountain Road, there is a 1900's Cape Cod-style house -- this one in good condition -- with five rooms, totaling 1,700 to 1,800 square feet.
This house comes with 15 acres on both sides of the road, a separate 18- by 30-foot library "house" or guest room and a 24- by 50-foot kennel/garage, all for $350,000. An additional 75 acres is available for $2,000 an acre. The listing sheet on the house points out that development of much of the surrounding land is restricted -- another advantage to owning second-home property in this part of Connecticut.
"There is an emphasis on preserving farmland, and the state has actually bought the easements on a great many of the properties here," said John G. Borden, president of Albert Borden Realtors on Lakeville's Main Street. In Salisbury, he said, fully 20 percent of the land is in conservation, either through easements bought by the state or easements or land donated by individual owners. (The state, he said, pays anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 an acre, depending on appraisals, which are often fiercely negotiated.)
One estate that recently sold for $650,000 -- the 148-acre Stillwater Farm -- is so restricted that the property can never be subdivided, according to Mr. Borden, whose father started selling real estate here in 1950.
One property currently for sale is a 1900 gambrel barn with only one and a half acres that abuts the Sharon Reservoir and overlooks hundreds of protected acres. The 6,500-square-foot, 11-room barn with its breath-catching views was redone over two decades ago, and its interior -- full of beiges and chrome and built-ins -- is a testament to that period.
"It certainly does look like the 70's," conceded Mr. Borden, who pointed out that the price -- now reduced to $375,000 from $445,000 -- reflects the redecorating that many buyers might wish to undertake. (As a comparison, a 19th-century Federal-style farmhouse on 5.7 acres of lawn and trees on Sugar Hill Road in Salisbury, also with a pool, is for sale for $695,000.)
THE market here, according to local realtors, is as flat as the second-home market almost everywhere in the region (an exception is apparently the Hamptons, where agents say prices are up 15 percent over last year).
Nevertheless, Mr. Borden said that at least the most expensive properties were starting to move: in the last two years, there were a dozen sales in the area for more than $1 million, and three properties sold for more than $3 million.
But there are plenty of buyers with nowhere near $3 million to spend.
"We didn't think we could pay as much as we did for the house in Heath," said Mrs. Verrill, who paid $140,000 in January. "But, well, my husband made one very good deal, and then we could."
Mr. Verrill said he preferred to think of the cottage as a "second home, not a weekend home, so we don't have the pressure of thinking we have to go every weekend."
A weekend in the cottage with three children, ages 8 to 12, makes inviting weekend guests "not always advisable," he said, and the four-hour drive is "an impediment which allows us to be generous with our invitations, in full confidence that no one will take us up on our offers."
Buying groceries is a problem the Verrills haven't quite solved. They are debating between loading up the car in Park Slope or stopping at one of the two supermarkets about 15 or 20 minutes from the house. Things like doing the laundry and plowing the snow are still an adventure. "There's a wonderful Laundromat nearby, and we're still dazzled by the sight of 12 driers," he said with a laugh.
"We really didn't think too much about it beforehand," he added. "We flat out fell in love with the town and then we flat out fell in love with the house."
For others who don't mind the four-hour drive, there's still the 1820 Colonial overlooking the mountains, with 12 acres, available for $75,000. "Winterize it," reads the listing sheet from Upton-Massamont Realtors in Shelburne Falls, "and you're only a hop, skip and a jump from excellent skiing. This one is loaded with rural charm."

The End of History, the Start of Tourism

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
DR. JOSEPH SALVATORE, the chairman of the State Historical Commission, felt a little awkward the other morning. He was standing alone beside a winding road with a picket sign that said: "Gov. Whitman: Don't Let the Commission Become History."
He waved the sign when the car bearing Mrs. Whitman glided by, delivering her up the hill to the Seasons Resort at Great Gorge in McAfee. The Governor had come to give the keynote address at the 1996 New Jersey Conference on Tourism, where she spoke glowingly about the "unlimited possibilities" awaiting corporations that join the state in "partnerships" to redefine the culture of tourism. 
 Dr. Salvatore, a soft-spoken 65-year-old orthopedic surgeon and lifelong student of history, knows that this redefinition means the end of 28 years of scholarly contribution to New Jersey tourism by the Historical Commission, which provides small grants for academic research, seminars and publications -- the down-in-the-stacks academic work that builds the foundation for tourism at historic sites.
Now, with Disney writing history for tourism, the commission has been criticized as having no "public visibility." This year, the commission's budget was $772,000. Governor Whitman has decreed that it be abolished in her new budget.
"As of July 1, we're dead," Dr. Salvatore said. "The Whitman administration desires a change in the way history is being presented. They want more of what it called public history -- historical re-enactments, that kind of thing."
Mark Lender, a historian at Kean College who has worked with the commission, added, "What we're losing is the scholarly infrastructure, the work promot ing an intelligent blend of history and tourism."
This work is indeed without glamour, he acknowledged. "You don't throw a wine-and-cheese party for the officials when somebody publishes a bibliography. Nobody gives a gala when a manuscript guide comes out."
More than ever, today's domestic tourist economy is driven by entertainment events. As they juggle work and family schedules, Americans have been been taking shorter, but more frequent, tourist trips.
In New Jersey, the seashore accounts for well over half of the $23 billion spent on travel last year. Atlantic City accounted for more than half of the seashore spending. After the shore, the next largest tourism category is called "events" -- sports events concerts, festivals, field trips and exhibits.
Corporate "event" sponsorship now permeates tourism. In 1984, corporate sponsorship of events defined as tourist in nature was $350 million -- 90 percent of it for sports. Last year, corporate sponsorship was $4.7 billion -- 66 percent for sports but 25 percent on destination events like festivals, historical exhibits and cultural entertainment.
Corporate involvement with cultural tourism used to come from company philanthropy departments looking for ways to dignify their image. Now, experts say, the underwriting mostly comes out of market and advertising departments demanding immediate benefits.
During last week's tourism conference in McAfee, corporate marketing dominated much of the talk. At a seminar on how tourist attractions can thrive with corporate tie-ins, John LeBaron, a marketing director for Continental Airlines, spoke enthusiastically of a current benefit of the airline's recent $30 million deal to put its name on the Brendan Byrne Arena: "Having tickets for our clients for the Final Four," he said. Elsewhere, scalpers were reported to be charging up to $8,000 for a ticket to the basketball championship this weekend, since only 1,000 tickets were available to the general public.
While corporate clients at the high end of the new tourism market are favored with wine-and-cheese receptions in skyboxes, the low end -- student field trips -- is also being courted. At a seminar on how to "enter the educational market," Karen S. Traa, the owner of eight McDonald's restaurants in Atlantic County, said that McDonald's, which encourages its managers to join local school boards, has developed an extensive catalogue of cultural materials, as well as a promotional tie-in that offers free coupons for students who visit participating tourist attractions.
"A few years ago, it was very dificult to get involved in school systems," she said. "Now with the budget cuts, it's becoming much easier to build partnerships. It's a terrific key to unlock the door."

HEADLINE: New Takes on the Melting Pot

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
WHEN Judy Sulik moved to Bridgeport from the suburbs a few years ago she went exploring her new hometown and was amazed. Along with the expected Italian restaurants and Irish taverns she found a veritable United Nations of cuisines. Around every corner the native food of yet another ethnic group was being served.
And so, "without leaving my hometown" Mrs. Sulik turned her discovery into a combination international cookbook and restaurant guide, "An Adventure for Your Palate," collecting recipes from Bridgeport's ethnic restaurants introduced by a brief profile of each establishment. 
 Irish and Italian food are represented, but also Brazilian, Bulgarian, Jamaican, Mexican, Portuguese and Thai. Bridgeport, it seems, is surprisingly cosmopolitan. "That's not the image many people have of it," Mrs. Sulik said.
Nor of Connecticut as a whole, for that matter. But in fact, the state is reflecting a 10-year wave of immigration that brought in tens of thousands of new residents from all over the world, even while the total population declined by a few thousand.
The newcomers have brought their music, sports and food, widening horizons in a state that fancies itself "the land of steady habits" and stages most of its official celebrations around historic Yankee traditions.
Typifying the newcomers are four immigrant groups: Brazilians, Irish, Hungarians and Vietnamese.
For example, this month an Irish musical group, Big Geraniums, played "Gaelic rock" in Fairfield. And the large Brazilian population in Danbury held an indoor tournament for soccer, a wildly popular sport in Brazil. In June, both ethnic groups will hold three-day festivals in Connecticut open to the general public.
While recent Irish immigrants add a relatively subtle touch of the modern to the traditions of native-born Irish-Americans, the bouncy samba rhythms and spicy meat dishes served up by the Brazilians are standouts in the new cultural mix.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service recorded 91,489 foreigners entering the United States between 1985 and 1994 who listed Connecticut as their destination, but many of those were single individuals making multiple trips or paying a visit and returning home, so the actual number of resident aliens in the state is certainly smaller.
In the five years starting 1990, according to recent Census Bureau figures, the influx of foreign immigrants was 36,963, statewide. Immigrants interviewed for this article were living in Connecticut throughout the 10-year immigration wave, and their observations confirmed I.N.S. records indicating that arrivals nearly doubled between 1985 and 1991, the peak year, and has tapered down since then, probably due to the state's sluggish economy.
These recent immigrants nearly offset an equally large migration of native-born people out of the state in search of jobs elsewhere. That immigrants replaced native-born residents, rather than just adding to them, intensifies their cultural effect, especially in the cities where most have settled.
"It's not numerically a flood, but it's an important pattern," said Thomas Steahr, professor of demography at the University of Connecticut. Professor Steahr said the traditional ethnic mixture of Connecticut leaned heavily toward western and central Europeans, African-Americans and Puerto Ricans. But the new immigrants are largely from Asia, Africa, South America and eastern Europe.
The Connecticut Department of Education reported that 95 different languages were spoken by children in the state's public schools in the 1994-95 school year. Federal census data lists as major categories, white, African-American, Hispanic, and "other minorities."
"That 'other minorities' category has gotten quite a bit more diverse,' " said Thomas Murphy, a spokesman for the department.
Many new immigrants have come to the state because of Connecticut's growing foreign trade. But more typical are people like Carlos Coelho, who moved to Bridgeport from Governador Valadares, Brazil, in 1983, recently divorced and looking for opportunity. He chose Bridgeport because his sister, Necy Fernandes, a television studio-set decorator for the decorating and home entertaining expert Martha Stewart, lived nearby.
Bridgeport and Danbury are attractive destinations for Brazilians because both cities had long-established Portuguese communities who speak the same language.
When Mr. Coelho arrived there were only about 35 Brazilian families in Bridgeport. Now he estimates its Brazilian population to be about 1,700. Danbury's is even larger, around 4,000, said Fernando Flores, who arrived in 1988 with his wife, Angela, to join relatives.
Mr. Coelho said he watched as Brazilian immigration increased. "From 1987 the population started to grow, and it slowed down in 1992," he said.
They were skilled workers in Brazil. Mr. Coelho was a cash register mechanic, Mr. Flores an electrician and Mrs. Flores a dressmaker. But Brazil's economy was poor and their prospects were dim. After years of working and saving they have opened small businesses of their own. The Flores own a cleaning service and a party decorating business. Mr. Coelho has a travel agency catering primarily to other Brazilians. His brother, Cleber, also operates a travel agency and started the Barriga-Cheia restaurant, which appears in Mrs. Sulik's book. Mr. Coelho has remarried, having met his wife, Glenda, a Chilean immigrant, while learning English in night school.
Their stories are repeated often -- the tales of skilled, educated people who are looking for better lives and join relatives and friends from their native countries who have already established themselves. But with each nationality the motivation to emigrate may be different.
For Irish immigrants, Connecticut offers higher wages. For Hungarians, the social and economic disruptions resulting from the fall of Communism, as well as their new freedom to migrate, are the motivations. For the Vietnamese, Communism still remains, which is cause enough.
Johnny Huynh came to Connecticut in 1986 as a teen-ager, after two aimless years in Arkansas. His uncle, who lived in Stamford, got him a job at Pitney Bowes. Mr. Huynh spent much of his pay bringing the rest of his family to Connecticut, and last summer he opened a restaurant, Pho Que Huong. His family operates the business, and many of his customers are Vietnam War veterans who never lost their taste for Vietnamese food.
Mr. Huynh said Bridgeport is a second American destination for many Vietnamese, who move there from California, New York and the South, and who, like him, believe their chances for success are better in Connecticut. "There's already an established community here, so that's why they come," he said.
Jacqueline Wong, a Vietnamese refugee of Chinese extraction who is Mr. Huynh's fiance, noted that the city's other established groups include Koreans, Taiwanese, Chinese, Cambodians, Laotians and Thais. Each group is very tight-knit, rarely socializing with the others, she said. The University of Bridgeport is the center for inter-group socializing that does occur.
Ms. Wong said each nationality has its own social club that hosts ethnic festivals and parties at which the different Asian groups sample each other's cultures.
At the University of Connecticut in Storrs, the Asian Center, which opened in 1993, is trying to make Asian culture more accessible to native-born state residents, the center's director, Angela Rola, said. It offers exhibits of Asian-American art and history, music, literature and other cultural events, as well as a place for Asian students to socialize.
Ms. Rola said Asians are the largest racial minority at the Storrs campus. Eleven percent of the students are Asian-Americans or Asian nationals. The university offers courses in Hindi, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Tagalog, the language of the Philippines. Ms. Rola, a second-generation Filipino, said foreign trade produces demand for the new immigrants.
"I get calls from major corporations to see if we have experts who can give cultural crash courses on different nations in Asia," she said.
Bridgeport and its suburbs have the second-largest concentration of Hungarians in the United States (after Cleveland), making Connecticut a popular destination for newer immigrants.
Joseph F. Balogh, a Stratford resident who is active in the Pannonia American Hungarian Club, which helps these immigrants start new lives, said recent immigrants have fled the high unemployment and crime that troubles post-Communist Hungary. Many of them lived in Romania and Czechoslovakia, before continuing on to the United States. "Most of them have relatives already here," Mr. Balogh said.
Relatively few in number, the Hungarian newcomers quickly absorbed by the older Hungarian immigrant community, dominated by refugees from the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, and make little cultural impact, Mr. Balogh said. But they do add to the audience for Hungarian culture and cuisine. Hungarian orchestras regularly perform at Tomlinson Middle School in Fairfield Center, which is walking distance from the Pearl of Budapest, a Hungarian restaurant.
The impact of the Irish newcomers of the last 10 years reflects change in Ireland itself, according to John Smith and Lena Smith, cousins and partners in the Black Rock Castle, an Irish restaurant that appears in Mrs. Sulik's book.
Mr. Smith said Ireland has moved in the last two decades from an isolated agricultural nation to one strongly involved in tourism and manufacturing, and reforming its educational system. Irish emigres are much better educated and skilled than they were 25 years ago when he and his cousin arrived. "Up to 15 years ago there wouldn't have been many new Irish, and the old folks carried on Irish traditions as they knew them," he said.
Ms. Smith said the newcomers emphasize Irish culture as they have lived it, "rather than just the clubby feeling between people who share a lineage." There's also more demand for importing Irish entertainment, including many of the island's best performers.
Professor Steahr said one of the most remarkable aspects of the immigration is the extent to which it has gone unnoticed by native-born residents. "It takes a period of time before the in-migration begins to be noticeable," he said.
The insular nature of immigrant communities, language barriers and native-born Americans' ignorance of other cultures are all reasons. But Ms. Rola said she believes that eventually people will begin to recognize each other and enjoy their differences. "The buzz word used to be 'melting pot,' but now we're embracing multiculturalism, diversity," she said. "It's got to make a great impact."

FILMS FROM HONG KONG
A comprehensive study of movies made in Hong Kong begins this week at Yale in New Haven. The series, at the Whitney Humanities Center, is free to the public. Co-sponsors include the Yale Council of East Asian Studies, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade office in Manhattan, the Yale-China Association and Yale Film Study Center. 
 Five films made between 1987 and 1994 will be shown over the next two weeks, and on the final day, April 14, Barbara Scharres, director of the film center at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago, will lecture on "Current Trends in Hong Kong Cinema" at 1 P.M. A panel discussion will conclude the series at 7:30 P.M.
The first film, on Tuesday at 7:30, is "A Chinese Ghost Story" with Leslie Cheung (of "Farewell My Concubine") as a tax collector who seeks shelter from a storm in a deserted temple haunted by a beautiful spirit.
"God of Gamblers," on Wednesday at the same time, is one of Hong Kong's highest grossing films.
On April 11 at 7:30, "Green Snake" is the feature, based on a Chinese folk tale and the Beijing opera about two sister snakes who have practiced for centuries to become human.
On April 14 at 2 P.M., "He's a Woman, She's a Man" will be shown -- a comedy about three people falling in love with each other.
The final film, "The Bodyguard From Beijing," concerns a mainland Chinese bodyguard assigned to protect a fashionable Hong Kong woman who is a sequestered witness in a trial. For more information, the numbers are 432-9392 or 432-3426.

JACKIE ROBINSON
"Jackie Robinson and the Integration of Professional Baseball" is the subject to be discussed on Tuesday at 7:30 in the Gengras Student Union of the University of Hartford. The speaker will be Warren Goldstein, author of "Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball," which won the 1989 award for the best book of sports history from the North American Society for Sport History.
Mr. Goldstein, who received advance degrees in American studies from Yale, is to join the University of Hartford faculty as a professor of American history this fall.
The university is at 200 Bloomfield Avenue in West Hartford, and admission is free. The number is (860) 768-4806 for more information.

SHORT SUBJECTS
"All in the Timing," comprising six comic short works, previews on Tuesday at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. Written by David Ives, the show is said to be the most-produced theater piece of 1995, having had 600 performances at Primary Stages Off Broadway, as well as productions in Vienna, Berlin, Sydney, Montreal, Paris and London. Individual segments include "Sure Thing," concerning romance the second, third and fourth time around, as well as "Words, Words, Words," in which three chimpanzees are locked in a room with three typewriters.
"The Universal Language," is about a language that no one can speak but which turns out to hold the meaning of life. The remaining segments, called "Degas, C'est Moi," "Foreplay, or the Art of the Fugue" and "Variations on the Death of Trotsky," are equally arcane.
Officially opening on April 10, the show will run through May 5. Performances are at 7 P.M. on Tuesday and at 8 P.M. Wednesday through Friday. Saturday performances are at 4 and 8:30; Sunday at 2 and 7. Weekday matinees at 2 P.M. are scheduled on April 17 and May 1.

HEADLINE: A Proposed Water Sale Stirs Opposition

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHY the anger? Why an alliance with New York City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi? At issue is water and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed sale of the New York City water system to the city's Water Board, a move that the Westchester Chamber of Commerce here opposes. The Chamber of Commerce has joined Mr. Hevesi in his legal fight against the sale.
"Taxation without representation is what it is," said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce. "If the sale goes through it will be at the expense of all Westchester water users, both residential and business. They will be adversely affected. If Mayor Giuliani's plan succeeds, Westchesterites can expect to pay water rate increases of anywhere from $17 million to $45 million over the 30-year term of the bonds sold to finance the sale of the system." 
 Mr. Giuliani hopes to realize $2.3 billion from the sale of the water system to the water board, a quasi-independent agency, which leases the system from the city. The sale will give the city an infusion of much needed cash, said Dennis B. Kremer, head of the Economic Development Department of the County Chamber of Commerce.
Under Mr. Giuliani's plan, the Water Board would raise $2.3 billion through the sale of bonds, but Mr. Hevesi refused to give the approval necessary for the Water Board to sell the bonds.
"What it tells me is that the Mayor needs money badly, and he's trying to find 'creative ways' to raise cash," said Mr. Kremer, a certified public accountant and a partner in the accounting firm of Marshal Granger in Mamaroneck. "There's no question in my mind this is an attempt at creative financing by a government that has a desperate need to find new sources of revenue."
Observing that increases in Westchester water rates do not include projections of other costs like maintenance, which rate payers may be facing over the next 30 years, Mr. Vogt said: "Several aspects of the scheme are even more troubling. For instance, about $1 billion of the sale proceeds would go into New York City's capital improvements fund to pay for things like renovation of the city schools. What that means is that Westchester County businesses and residents will be taxed to pay ongoing New York City financial obligations that are totally unrelated to Westchester County. This sets a very dangerous precedent."
Mr. Giuliani's plan with its imposition of $7 million to $45 million and additional charges and fees for water to the people of Westchester County is contrary to the law, said Andrew J. Goodman, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Rosner Bresler Goodman & Bucholtz. Mr. Goodman, who lives in Edgemont, is representing the Chamber of Commerce pro bono in the action.
Originally, the Chamber of Commerce was not named as a defendant, Mr. Goodman said. "Because we want to go on record in opposing the sale," he said, "we have filed papers that allow us either to be named as a codefendant in the proceedings or to have our position acknowledged in the official record as a 'friend of the court.' "
Mr. Goodman added: "People in Westchester will be paying for something for which they receive no concomitant benefit. This sets a dangerous precedent."
He emphasized that Mr. Hevesi has opposed and withheld his approval of Mayor Giuliani's plan, which Mr. Hevesi called a financial gimmick that would cause the city to lose direct control of a valuable resource. "The Mayor counteracted by instituting a suit against the Controller to force his approval in court," Mr. Goodman said. "But on March 1, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jane S. Solomon dismissed the complaint. However, on March 12, Mayor Giuliani filed a notice of appeal, so it's not over yet."
The New York City water system, a network of reservoirs, pipelines and sewers, includes the Croton Reservoir and the Catskill water system in Sullivan and Greene Counties. The New York City Water Board buys the water wholesale and sells the water to other water companies and municipalities. They in turn supply water to New York City residents and to 85 percent of Westchester.
"I think people in Westchester should be up in arms about the proposed sale," Mr. Kremer said. "But the reaction from the county and other trade and professional groups has been muted. I imagine because it's not a painful issue yet. When it becomes painful, it will be too late to do anything. The cost of living in Westchester and doing business here will go even higher if the sale goes through."
Mr. Vogt said: "I'm not trying to pass judgment on how Mayor Giuliani solves his financial problems in New York City. I just don't want people in Westchester to have to pay for benefits to New York City. This proposal will have a significant economic impact on Westchester County, and it demands our attention and action."
As for county officials, although they are carefully watching the situation, they are not entirely convinced that Mr. Giuliani's plan would lead to excessive water-rate increases for the county's customers, said Marc Moran, senior assistant to County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke.
"We're not concerned about New York City's attempt to raise money through the sale of the water system; that's their business," Mr. Moran said. "But we are very concerned about any increase in rates the sale would bring to Westchester customers. We have been in touch with Mayor Giuliani, and he has assured us that the sale will not increase rates to Westchester customers. We have asked for detailed information on the exact impact on water users in Westchester, and when we review it, then the County Executive and the County Attorney will decide if there is any role for us to take in the on-going litigation."
Water has always been controversial, said Gerard T. Koeppel, a Manhattan writer whose as yet untitled book on the early history of the New York City water supply will be published by Princeton University Press next year. "For example," he said, "when water supply systems were privately owned, financial interests came before the public interest. In 1799, for instance, when Aaron Burr got control of a water company in New York, he generated enough money from it to start a private bank, which since has evolved into Chase Manhattan Bank."
In the early 1880's when Baltimore had a private water company, Mr. Koeppel said, "the water quality was poor and the rates were excessive."
"By contrast," he continued, "Philadelphia with its public water supply had good water and was considered to be a healthier and more desirable city to live in and to do business in."

HEADLINE: TV RATINGS;
How Violence Might Pay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "TV Turns to an Era of Self-Control" [March 17], Mark Landler overlooked one aspect of the difficulty of rating programs: the possible economic benefits of a violence rating. 
 As part of the recent National Television Violence Study, research we did here at the University of Wisconsin showed that the label "parental discretion advised" and the M.P.A.A. ratings PG-13 and R significantly increased boys' desire to see programs and movies. The effect was particularly strong among boys 10 to 14 years old. Industry executives may soon weigh this potential market increase against fears of advertiser pullout.

HEADLINE: YOUNG NEW JERSEY;
Pass the Mackerel and Toss In Some Pasta: Grocery Clerks for a Good Cause

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: HILLSIDE

 BODY:
Coffee cans were flying through the air in one room, pieces of pasta in another. The coffee was headed in the right direction: into boxes of food destined for soup kitchens, homeless shelters and senior citizen centers. And the pasta -- well, it may be inevitable that a little food will fly when 180 eighth graders get together, even for a good cause.
The students had come from four Bergen County communities to work in the 280,000-square-foot Hillside warehouse of the Community Foodbank of New Jersey. But there was more going on than first met the eye. While food was being sorted out -- canned mackerel here, Typhoon Blasters drinks there -- students from different towns, different races and different economic backgrounds were being mixed together. 
 The session on Tuesday took place because Dr. Mat Glowski, principal of the Alpine Public School, thinks it's important to break down stereotypes as the students head for more integrated high schools and eventually into adulthood.
Does one day out of the school year make a difference? Dr. Glowski obviously thinks it does. "They see they can work together," he said. "If you can do it once, you can do it again. It's an example to adults, too."
(He didn't mention -- he didn't have to -- the long-running, often angry debate about how to desegregate Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood and whether the state can force other Bergen County school districts to be part of the solution.)
The noise level told much of the story. As the students, from Englewood, Englewood Cliffs, Tenafly and Alpine, entered the warehouse, they sounded like exactly what they were: teen-agers liberated from the classroom for half a day. In a word, loud.
Things quieted considerably when they were divided into work teams and told to stand beside someone from another school. The goal was to learn that person's name and hobbies, and then tell the rest of the group. Fortunately, the students were also wearing name tags; many of the introductions were mumbled toward the floor, lost in a circle of shuffling feet.
The noise level picked up again when the work started. Voices called out expiration dates on packages, yelled for another box to fill up with iced-tea mix, alerted a supervisor that a damaged item had to go to the "bad box." Predictably, perhaps, girls got down to work more quickly and quietly than boys. Predictably, too, some of the students soon rearranged themselves so they could work and talk with the classmates they had come with. And, yes, a few noodles were flung at friends in the room where students were scooping broken pasta from a box as big as a hot tub and repackaging it in smaller bags.
There were also a few groans about "gross" food. The mackerel would definitely not have been a hit in the school lunchroom. And some of the students assigned to pack detergents and other cleaning products, a dusty and sticky job, looked longingly across the room at classmates who could work without protective aprons and gloves. But that didn't stop them from filling box after box (almost all labeled "bananas") that soon rose in stacks taller than some of the students from pallets on the floor.
And then it was time to get back on the buses and go back to school.
Ninety minutes of work translated into about 2,000 pounds of packaged food, said Meara Nigro, a Foodbank spokeswoman. Combined with the food packed by a group that came the week before, that's enough to fill an 18-wheel tractor trailer truck.
Enough to make a difference? A student on the March 19 field trip told a teacher it was the best he had ever been on because "we're doing something for others." The students there on Tuesday were quick to make the same point, although they were generally silent on whether the day was meeting any of the goals Dr. Glowski had set when he began the Foodbank outings last year. (The picture will be clearer when he reads the surveys they filled out after the trip.)
Kathleen DiChiara, executive director of the Foodbank, had no doubt about the day's value. She counts on volunteers -- more than 6,000 people who contribute 50,000 hours a year -- to help distribute up to 14 million pounds of donated food and grocery items to 1,500 New Jersey charities each year. Based on other groups' experience, she's sure the students went home thinking about the hungry, about one another, about her own deliberately diverse staff. And she knows that some of them, and their parents, will almost certainly be back.

 BODY:

Finding Bargains Against the Flow
T. Rowe Price Equity Income buys stocks with high yields when Wall Street frowns on them and then sells after market sentiment reverses. With this strategy, the fund's longtime manager, Brian Rogers, generated a 32.9 percent return for the year that ended in January. His long-term performance is notable, too. For the last 3, 5 and 10 years, the fund has finished in the top 10 percent of its peer group, according to The Value Line Mutual Fund Advisor, a New York newsletter. 
 Though they are rarely the best performers in soaring markets, equity-income funds tend to provide a cushion for investors in down markets. That is because blue-chip stocks with high yields generally hold up well when there is a so-called flight to quality.
At Mr. Rogers's fund, the typical holding is the stock of a company that has a relatively strong position in its industry but has been a poor performer recently, making its yield high relative to the market.
Right now, Mr. Rogers is selling some of the financial, health care and large consumer stocks that produced last year's strong return, Value Line reported.
He is said to be moving into cyclical issues, which tend to rise with the economy. The prices of cyclical stocks have generally fallen over the last six months because of investor concern about earnings this year.
 
New Managers
Jerry A. Webman, managing director and chief fixed-income strategist at Prudential Mutual Funds, joins Oppenheimer Funds as director of tax-exempt fixed-income investments.
Christine Thompson and Ian Spreadbury have taken over Fidelity Global Bond, succeeding Jonathan Kelly, who remains a foreign bond analyst at Fidelity. Ms. Thompson continues to run the Fidelity Intermediate Bond, United States Bond Index and Target Timeline funds. Mr. Spreadbury has been a portfolio manager for Fidelity International since 1995.
Fidelity Short-Term World Bond has also changed hands. Charles Morrison and Luc Huyghebaert have replaced Scott Kuldell, who remains at Fidelity in fixed-income research. Mr. Morrison also manages three other Fidelity bond funds. Mr. Huyghebaert has been a fixed-income portfolio manager for Fidelity International since 1994.

HEADLINE: ON CAMPUS;
Union Effort by Part-Time College Teachers Bogs Down

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
A year has passed since part-time faculty members at eight state colleges took the first steps toward creating a union, but their quest for higher pay and job security could drag on indefinitely. Last month, an official in the State Attorney General's office set forth a series of reasons why the part-timers, or adjuncts, should not be allowed to bargain collectively.
In a letter to the state's Public Employment Relations Commission, Mary Cupo-Cruz, a senior deputy attorney general, wrote that adjuncts are "nothing more than private consultants" hired for courses that full-time professors do not have the time or expertise to teach. Since state colleges hire adjuncts only on an "as needed" basis, she reasoned, they cannot be considered public employees even if they return to the institutions year after year. 
 "In light of the self-evident status of adjuncts as consultants and independent contractors," Ms. Cupo-Cruz wrote in a letter dated Feb. 28, "it would be fictional to conclude that the status of an adjunct is altered merely on the basis of some arbitrary repetition of services."
If the Attorney General's office had not objected to the unionization effort, the commission would have permitted the adjuncts to elect a bargaining agent this spring. (The agent would probably be the Council of New Jersey State College Locals, which already represents full-time faculty members at the institutions.) But now, the election could not take place until September or later, said Mel Driban, a national representative of the American Federation of Teachers who has been supervising the effort.
Lawyers for the council responded to the state's objections earlier this month, stressing that the organizing effort has legal precedent. The state has already allowed adjuncts at Rutgers, Raritan Valley Community College and Camden County College to join unions. (None of those unions were created without a fight -- the Rutgers part-timers waited three years for an election, and Raritan Valley adjuncts waited six.)
The commission will take the next step, either setting a date for an election or accepting the state's arguments. If it rules in favor of the adjuncts, the state can appeal to the courts.
"I am assuming the arguments put forth by the state are so specious and the precedent is so obvious that PERC will order an election," Mr. Driban said from the council's office in Union, where he has been working on the project since last March.
The council estimates that more than 3,000 adjuncts are teaching at state colleges this year, and while some have full-time jobs in other professions, hundreds eke out a living teaching at three or four schools. They earn $400 a credit hour, and cannot teach more than six credit hours a semester at each institution. So while full-time professors earn between $28,000 and $75,000 a year, part-timers seldom make more than $9,000. They are not entitled to health benefits, offices, phone lines or free parking spaces at the colleges, and they have no job security from one semester to the next.
College administrators say they are sympathetic to the plight of adjuncts, but paying them more would be exceedingly difficult, since state aid to higher education is being cut.
Besides, they say, they are trying to decrease the number of adjuncts teaching anything but highly specialized courses, because students are better served by full-time professors who are on campus all day.
"It certainly is true that part-time faculty generally have been taken advantage of, and collectively they are very well qualified," said Robert Scott, the president of Ramapo College in Mahwah, where adjuncts teach 25 percent of classes, compared to 35 percent several years ago. "But this could have a severe economic impact."
Even though the situation does not look promising for state college adjuncts, the council has already embarked on another project that is even more ambitious: organizing at least 3,500 adjuncts at 17 county colleges. Mr. Driban said 350 adjuncts at Middlesex County College will soon have a chance to sign cards authorizing an election for a bargaining agent -- the same step the state college adjuncts took last year. He said he decided to forge ahead with a second effort because he had received dozens of calls from adjuncts at county colleges, especially those in North Jersey.
Mr. Driban said he will focus on Middlesex County College this semester, but he has also sent questionnaires to adjuncts at other county colleges to gauge their interest. County colleges tend to have more adjuncts than state colleges -- Sussex County College, for example, has 30 full-time faculty members and at least 250 adjuncts, Mr. Driban said. In 1992, the last year for which statistics are available, adjuncts taught 40 percent of community college classes in New Jersey, compared with 27 percent of classes at state colleges.
Hoping to attract attention to their effort, state college adjuncts are planning a demonstration in front of the State House in Trenton on April 24.

HEADLINE: Slouching Toward Mount Laurel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: MOUNT LAUREL

 BODY:
IT didn't matter that she was dying of cancer and couldn't walk without help, couldn't breathe without an oxygen tank. Ethel Lawrence insisted on going out on a hot and humid day in June 1994 for a last look at an empty field here that would someday, she hoped, be filled with housing for the poor.
"It was very emotional. She never gave up the hope or the fight," her daughter, Ethel Halley, recalled not long ago. "She just told the people from the state: 'Please help. Please do whatever you can do to build this housing. My wish would be to put the first key in the door.' " 
Ethel Lawrence never got her wish. She died the next month at 68. But two years later, her field of dreams has edged closer to reality, a poignant symbol of the hopes and frustrations associated with the decades-long battle to open up the suburbs.
It has been a quarter of a century since Mrs. Lawrence lent her name to a class-action lawsuit filed by Camden Regional Legal Services against Mount Laurel Township -- a case that became an instant landmark in 1975, when the State Supreme Court struck down the township's zoning code on the ground that requiring houses on large lots discriminated against the poor. (That ruling, which lacked enforcement teeth, was reaffirmed in much stronger terms in 1983.)
While the rulings will forever link the name Mount Laurel with exclusionary zoning and affordable housing, it is less clear whether the results will ever match expectations. In strict numerical terms, Mount Laurel has been a disappointment, resulting in the construction of only 21,000 homes around the state since 1983 -- many of them not in large-lot suburbs at all, but in the very inner cities that the original Mount Laurel plaintiffs wanted to avoid.
But Mount Laurel's effect has been far from merely symbolic. It has left an imprint on almost every institution, every city and town, in New Jersey. It has affected state and local politics, race, economic status, transportation, urban renewal, land use, town-house development, the environment.
"Those rulings put the concept of 'fair share' on the public agenda and forced a wholesale revision of zoning across the state," write the authors of a new book about the case, "Our Town: Race, Housing and the Soul of Suburbia" (Rutgers University Press, 1995). "Their impact reached far beyond New Jersey, affecting policies from Massachusetts to California, as Mount Laurel became the Roe v. Wade of fair housing, the Brown v. Board of Education of exclusionary zoning."
The Mount Laurel debate has died down somewhat since the mid-80's, when Gov. Thomas H. Kean, responding to the Supreme Court's assault on the cherished principle of home rule, called the 1983 decision "communistic." (And Mr. Kean, a moderate Republican, was polite compared with some local officials.) Still, anger persists. Seventy-five communities are still battling developers in court, and many as 80 are procrastinating or ignoring their obligation to provide a fair share of the regional supply of low-cost housing, perhaps hoping the mandate will simply go away.
"We tell them about the horror stories of other towns, and we tell them it's to their advantage to develop a plan," said Shirley M. Bishop, executive director of the State Council on Affordable Housing, which the Legislature established in 1985 to oversee the "fair share" process. "If not, they run the risk of a builder's lawsuit, mounting costs, and all of the emotion."
Even some housing advocates object to the process, saying the council (universally known as COAH, pronounced KOH-uh) puts too much emphasis on numbers and not enough on the needs of the poor. They point out that municipalities can reduce their fair-housing obligations in a variety of ways: by permitting housing for the elderly and rehabilitated housing, and through so-called regional contribution agreements, which allow them to pay urban areas to take some of their obligations off their hands.
"COAH has this shopping list of discounts -- you get a credit-and-a-half for rental housing, and three-quarters of a credit for seniors," said John M. Payne, a professor at Rutgers Law School. "It breeds a lot of cynicism. It's like, 'Double coupon day on Wednesday for affordable housing!' "
And there are questions whether the process has benefited those who need it most. While those who earn up to 80 percent of the median household income are eligible for the low-cost housing provided under Mount Laurel, Ms. Bishop says not everyone can afford it, because even low-cost housing requires down payments, security deposit and other fees.
If the goal was to integrate the suburbs, the rulings have clearly had little impact. The first comprehensive study on who lives in Mount Laurel housing is only now under way (by the Center for Public Service at Seton Hall University). But anecdotal evidence suggests that most people moving into the new low-cost housing are young, working-class and white.
Still, the long and pervasive reach of the Mount Laurel decisions cannot be denied. That became clear in recent visits to three communities whose stories bring together many of the themes of this 25-year controversy.
 
MOUNT LAUREL
Slow, Uneasy Progress
It all started a generation ago when this sprawling Burlington County suburb -- then rural, and with no multifamily housing -- rejected a plan to rezone 32 acres of land for 36 garden apartments. So Ethel Lawrence and other black residents, fearful that their children would not be able to afford to live in their hometown, solicited the help of public interest lawyers to fight the township.
It was an angry time. The Lawrences received volumes of hate mail, had to change their phone number three times and survived gunshots through the bedroom window.
In the end, the town that gave its name to the Mount Laurel cases capitulated, however reluctantly, to the Mount Laurel process. About 150 low-cost units have been built or are under way, out of a "fair share" of 839.
As with other Mount Laurel housing around the state, the builders include the low-cost units in their developments as a condition of getting local approval to build the market-priced housing. Many developers simply absorb the costs, adding them into the price of their market-rate units. And some government subsidies and tax credits are available.
It's hard to distinguish the low-cost units from the others, in a town that now bristles with town houses and new cul-de-sacs. Though there were fears that those units would diminish the value of surrounding property, Dolores Smith, the township's tax assessor, says it hasn't happened. Nor has the new housing appreciably changed Mount Laurel's demographics: in 1970, blacks made up 3.3 percent of the population of 11,000; by 1990, that figure had inched up to 6 percent out of 30,270 residents.
The township's housing obligations are something of a legal hodgepodge: some developers are suing it in court; other tracts are about to be under the jurisdiction of COAH. It is all a bit too much, township officials say. These days, the big theme is density, and what Mount Laurel -- whose population has tripled since 1970 -- can do to cap its growth.
"You have developers taking land and building multifamily housing in the middle of nowhere," said Mike Mouber, the township attorney. "Density adds cost, density adds schoolchildren, density adds police protection, street lighting costs, everything."
Peter O'Connor is also unhappy, but for different reasons. Mr. O'Connor, one of the original Mount Laurel litigants and now executive director of Fair Share Housing Development Inc., in Cherry Hill, says the town has not done enough to make housing available for the truly needy. The township prefers to sell, not rent, its affordable-housing units, he says, adding that it is always looking for ways to reduce its "fair share" obligation.
"If you look at Mount Laurel in isolation, we have been tremendously successful in establishing the legal and administrative structure," he said. "But the difficulty is that we've moved away from the theory and rhetoric. You've peeled away those layers that it's safe to help, and to go further means you have to confront the underlying problems of race, class and morality."
Still, he has some hope. Next year, ground could be broken on the Ethel Robinson Lawrence project: 140-unit low-income apartments on a 63-acre field that is owned by Mr. O'Connor's organization.

NEW BRUNSWICK
Help From Outside
In New Brunswick, a city of 41,000 where the population is 40 percent black and Hispanic, exclusionary zoning is not an issue. But as a result of the regional contribution agreements allowed by the 1985 Fair Housing Act, New Brunswick has become a major beneficiary of the Mount Laurel process.
Some advocates have criticized the agreements as a way for suburbs to keep the poor out of their backyards. But city officials in New Brunswick and elsewhere embraced them as an impetus for urban renewal.
To date, New Brunswick has received $10.8 million from four suburbs -- Warren Township, Bernardsville, Piscataway and Branchburg -- and used the money to build 306 new housing units and rehabilitate 100 more. Across the state, more than 40 municipalities have participated in the program, resulting in a transfer of some $80 million to urban areas, according to the Council on Affordable Housing.
One was Providence Square (shown on the front page), a red-brick former cigar factory, was converted in 1993 into an attractive complex for the elderly. The 98 one-bedroom apartments rent for $400 a month. A 44-unit town-house development was built on two acres that were once the site of a New Jersey Transit bus garage. Those units sold for $22,000 to $55,000.
New Brunswick is trying hard to encourage homeownership, but it has not been easy. At first, it was impossible for potential low-income buyers to qualify for home mortgages, said Christiana Foglio, president of Community Investment Strategies, New Brunswick-based consultants on affordable-housing and economic development projects. Then came the steady slashing of Federal housing programs for the poor under the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
There are now more programs to help first-time buyers, Ms. Foglio said. But critics say the Fair Housing Act has not served the intent of the Mount Laurel doctrine and that the regional contribution agreements ignore the reality that many inner-city residents would like to move to the suburbs.
"We're against any R.C.A.'s because it smacks in the face of everything we've done," said C. Roy Epps, president of the Civic League of Greater New Brunswick, a plaintiff in the second round of Mount Laurel litigation. "We're trying to open up places; they're trying to concentrate people with limited choices where they'll be captured the rest of their lives. If people could have bought their out of busing, they would have done that too."
 
HILLSBOROUGH
A Question of Sprawl
Hillsborough, a 54-square-mile township in Somerset County, is one of many thinly populated towns in the fast-developing rural or exurban parts of New Jersey where affordable housing has only recently become a lightning rod.
So far, Hillsborough has only been marginally affected by the Mount Laurel "fair share" numbers, parceling out 79 units to Phillipsburg under a regional contribution agreement and building 91 rental units within a larger development in the center of town. But now, private local developers are seeking to build a 3,000-unit project for the elderly on 750 acres, with 136 units set aside to meet the "fair share" obligation. (Under state rules, one-quarter of a municipality's affordable-housing obligations can be satisfied by housing for the elderly.)
The Hillsborough project is one of several around the state that have raised fears that fair-housing concerns could override environmental ones. William R. Neil, assistant director of conservation of the New Jersey Audubon Society, says that here and in nearby places like Pohatcong, Bethlehem and Greenwich, housing could be built on fragile farmland.
Traffic is another concern. The rush of housing to the exurbs runs counter to the much-praised State Development and Redevelopment Plan, which aims to discourage sprawl.
"Hillsborough is a test case for how affordable housing and state planning can co-exist," said Barbara L. Lawrence, executive dirctor of New Jersey Future, a planning organization. "Towns don't want to be sued; they don't want to be publicly castigated as anti-affordable-housing. You end up in a situation where you're building in places probably where you shouldn't be bulding."
Even the most ardent affordable-housing advocates concede that it may not be reasonable to expect many more units to be built, because the Mount Laurel process relies so heavily on private developers, and the real estate market has been soft. In 1987, the affordable housing council set a statewide target of 145,000 affordable units; in 1993, it reduced the figure to 86,000, and more reductions are possible.
"Some people think we should be the panacea for all the housing problems in New Jersey, but we can't be," said Ms. Bishop of the council. "We're trying to balance land-use concerns in municipalities, overcome exclusionary zoning problems, and have community awareness and acceptance of housing."
No one expects the Mount Laurel doctrine to be rolled back, though, regardless of the political fashions in Washington or Trenton. Even advocates who have disappointed by the results of Mount Laurel acknowledge that New Jersey has come too far to change course.
"In this business, you have to be optimist," said Professor Payne of Rutgers. "When the final chapter is written, I think we'll be very proud of what's happened and I don't think we'll look at it as a brief utopian interlude that crashed of its own weight; I think it's alive and well, and eventually we'll have a much broader housing policy."
 
A Quarter-Century Later, Segregation Persists
 The first Mount Laurel lawsuit, brought in 1971, aimed to break down zoning barriers that kept poor people, many of them black and Hispanic, from living in the suburbs. An original plaintiff was the N.A.A.C.P. of Southern Burlington County.
 But despite the State Supreme Court's rulings in 1975 and 1983 striking down large-lot zoning and other restrictions as "economic discrimination," the state has hardly grown any less segregated.
 New Jersey has about 1,900 census tracts, with an average of 4,000 people each. In the 1980 Census, the minority population was clustered in about a third of those areas, mainly cities and older suburbs: 29 percent of the census tracts were at least one-fifth black and Hispanic.
 By 1990, as reflected in the map above, that figure was 34 percent, an increase consistent with the statewide increase in the black and Hispanic population. In 1991-92, the Harvard Project on School Desegregation found that New Jersey's schools, whose students closely reflect the general population, were the fourth most segregated in the nation.
 While the census data are now six years old, researchers say little has changed. "I haven't seen anything to suggest that there's been a major change," said John M. Payne, professor of Rutgers Law School. "No. 1, because of the slow growth of housing due to the recession, and No. 2, becuase there has been no evidence to suggest any unusual outward mobility."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
It's March Madness, Baby. Sue Them.

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
MILLIONS of college basketball fans will be watching the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game on television tomorrow night, but they will not be the only ones experiencing March madness.
All over Manhattan this month, brokers and lawyers are competing for championships in corporate basketball leagues. Cramped gyms, not huge arenas with thousands of screaming fans, are the sites of these heated weeknight battles, where these amateur players release their professional intensity and competitive drive. 
 "Everyone wants to play basketball this time of year," said Jason Moede, a 6-foot-2-inch forward and an economist at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "You sit in all weekend long watching the games. It just makes you want to compete."
"People don't realize it, but these leagues have become almost a subculture," said Peter Grean, who quit his law practice to oversee the 140-team Lawyers Basketball League, which he started as a small parochial league in 1970. "Every weeknight, most of the city's gyms are filled with these guys."
"The phones are ringing non-stop this time of year, there's a real buzz," he added. "These guys call a few times a day just for scouting and injury reports, even to see who their ref will be, looking for that advantage."
On the court, each profession seems to have its own style. Brokers and bankers, always shooting for the big prize, like to take the game into their own hands, frequently screaming for the ball on offense. Lawyers tend to concentrate on tenacious defense and argue every call.
"Lawyers in particular know all the rules inside and out," said Mr. Grean's assistant, Dave Walker. "We constantly get calls the day after a game where a player is questioning a technicality of a rule."
Altogether, about 1,000 corporate teams play in city basketball leagues, with about 300 teams involved in playoffs. The players pull off the silk ties and Tommy Hilfiger shirts, change from Ballys to Reeboks, stuff the cellular phones in the gym bags and prepare to do battle on the court, all for the sake of the firm.
"The intensity in these leagues is like that of a tough collegiate game," said Mike Howard, a referee who officiates for the lawyers and corporate leagues when he is not working local college games. "At the top levels, the skills are comparable too."
Steve Cronin, a 29-year-old broker with J.W. Charles Securities, went from playing for Tufts University and a year with a professional team in Israel to a Corporate League championship last year with Troster Singer, a securities trading house. A Manhattan hoops freelancer, Mr. Cronin plays in three leagues, and March finds him racing from gym to gym.
"It's always intense," he said. "You know guys on other teams, rivalries develop and it all comes to a head around now. The competition is excellent: Division I college players, even some ex-pros."
But for John Donahue, a 5-foot-9-inch guard for Barrington Capital, a midtown brokerage house, the allure is more personal.
"Hitting that 3-pointer is like getting a big trade," said Mr. Donahue, a 30-year-old stock broker, as he unclasped his $5,000 Rolex watch and gently draped his $2,000 Giorgio Armani suit over his gym bag before a recent game at Brandeis High School gym. His firm finished 9-1 in the "Rich and Famous" division of the New York Urban Professionals Basketball League last week. The team will start its playoff schedule this week.
"You're playing against guys that are from the same walk of life as you," said Paul Schnell, vice president of sales for the B.W.D. Group, a Long Island insurance brokerage. His team, made up of longtime friends, won the league championship last week in the top division of the New York Corporate Basketball League. "Lawyers, brokers, investment bankers -- you see eye to eye because you're going through similar challenges and pressures at the office," he said. "Some other leagues are more back-office types, you know, like mail-room guys."
"People always love to play ball," he added, "but this time of year, they're more pumped up."
The Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding firm's 55-46 victory recently over top-seeded Schulte, Roth & Zabel, in the quarterfinals of the Counselors Division of the Lawyers Basketball League, impressed the boss -- senior partner and a courtside regular, Herman Badillo.
"I try to go to as many games as I can," said Mr. Badillo, who is also Mayor Giuliani's special counsel for oversight of school finances. "I hope this is our year to win it all."
After the 9 P.M. game, Fischbein's star center, Dwight Chase, who led all scorers with 14 points, threw his long black overcoat over his uniform and hustled with some teammates out of the Friends Seminary gymnasium at 222 East 16th Street, back to the Midtown office.
The next day, Mr. Badillo summoned Mr. Chase into his office for some serious business, to make sure the center's strained knee was all right for this Tuesday's semifinal game. Clearly, team pride takes precedence over issues like billable hours.
"The intensity is much higher this time of year," said Fischbein's captain, Jeff Mitchell, who said playoff results are regularly published in the firm's bi-weekly newsletter. "Lawyers don't like to lose. They're really competitive, and there's a real loyalty to the firm. No one wants to come into the office a loser -- and people do ask."
"To do business in this city, you've got to go all out," said William Silver, founder of Nu Tech, a systems integration company. "To win in this league, you have to do the same thing. I have two bloody knees right now from diving on the floor last week."
Mr. Silver was preparing a presentation on document management for the city's biggest banks, using little basketballs in his graphics.
"It's March madness, baby," said the 35-year-old forward. "These guys are all brokers and businessmen. We're competing all daylong. Someone's always trying to eat my lunch in the business world and it's no different on the court."

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
Who's Afraid of Jobs and Growth?

BYLINE: By ROBERT EISNER; Robert Eisner, professor emeritus at Northwestern University and a former president of the American Economic Association, is the author of "The Misunderstood Economy: What Counts and How to Count It."

 BODY:
BOND and stock markets in shock! Dow plunges 171 points on stunning news of a big gain in jobs in February! Interest rates spike as unemployment drops to 5.5 percent! That was the report a few weeks ago.
But are more jobs bad for the economy? Or just for Wall Street? Or is something else going on? 
 Karl Marx argued that capitalism could not survive without a "reserve army" of unemployed. This was necessary, he said, so that competition from the jobless could hold down wages and allow companies to make the profits that keep them operating. A surprising number of economists buy that analysis, without usually acknowledging its origin. The modern twist they put on it is that low unemployment will bring inflation -- indeed, unbearable inflation. The argument has been refined and embodied in a still-dominant dogma in the dismal science, that of the Nairu, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, often dubbed the "natural rate" of unemployment.
If unemployment falls below this rate, the doctrine declares, we will not only suffer inflation but, as long as it stays below the rate, inflation will keep rising, ultimately into hyperinflation that threatens the orderly operation of the economy.
What does this have to do with the market's recent gyrations? The key is that our Federal Reserve apparently believes all this and, without necessarily following the economic theory, bond dealers and other investors know the Fed believes this. Hence, news of lower unemployment is taken as a signal that the Fed will be prepared to tighten the screws of monetary controls. It will certainly not nudge interest rates down, as had been expected in response to evidence of a slowing economy. Since that expectation had, in large part, been built into current bond and stock prices, dashing it created market turmoil. The Fed, indeed, confirmed this market perception of its policy by its refusal to lower interest rates last week.
The remarkable, and sad, part is that the Nairu dogma lives on with so little supporting evidence -- even, in fact, as events contradict it. If there is a natural rate of unemployment, God apparently treats his many children differently. In much of Europe, unemployment has been in double digits -- 11 percent in Germany, 12 percent in France and 22 percent in Spain. If those rates are above the Nairu for these countries, the theory says inflation should have turned into accelerating deflation. Clearly, that has not happened.
In Japan, unemployment was long about 2 percent and even now, in a recession, is in the 3 percent range. Where is its accelerating inflation? Or is its natural rate somehow far below everybody else's?
IN the United States, the Congressional Budget Office has prepared Nairu estimates going back to 1947; they have ranged from 5.3 percent then, to 6.3 percent from 1977 to 1980, and 5.8 percent today. But there has been no evidence of continuously accelerating inflation when unemployment was below the Nairu. During the Vietnam War, annual unemployment averages were below 4 percent from 1966 to 1969 and inflation rose -- but only from 3.2 percent to 5.1 percent -- and one could well argue that even this modest increase was a short-run response to a surge in war spending.
I have put the budget office estimates of the Nairu and the presumed consequences to strenuous econometric tests. I have found that, while unemployment above the Nairu seemed to cool inflation, unemployment below the Nairu did not raise it. There is even some evidence that low unemployment lowered it. And Ray Fair of Yale University finds that data for the United States and 29 other countries also reject the conventional concept of the Nairu.
My own results may well be explained by several factors. At low unemployment, workers are doing well, frequently benefiting from overtime pay, and have little desire to upset the apple cart by pushing up wages. Further, productivity is high and costs are low, with production lines full. And companies hesitate to raise prices when potential competitors, also rich with cash, may try to move in.
Most recently, unemployment has been below the Nairu from October 1994 on, and inflation has, if anything, been moving down. As unemployment fell to 5.5 percent last month, consumer prices rose only two-tenths of 1 percent and wholesale prices fell by that amount. A number of suggested corrections to official figures would put inflation over the last year close to zero.
Tied to the Nairu dogma is the dismal argument that economic growth cannot be allowed to become too rapid. According to this view, annual economic growth of more than 2.5 percent can be achieved only by reducing unemployment, but further reductions now would supposedly bring us accelerating inflation. Thus the stubborn resistance in the Fed, and among some political leaders, to pursuing policies focusing on faster growth.
By a principle called Okun's Law, named for Arthur M. Okun, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Lyndon B. Johnson, each percentage-point reduction in unemployment is associated with at least two percentage points more in output as the labor force is utilized more intensively. That indicates that if the unemployment rate fell a percentage point a year for the next two years, to 3.5 percent, we would have four percentage points more in ouput, or $300 billion, by 1998.
Think what that would mean for every problem of the economy, real or imagined. In five years, it would bring a painless reduction of $180 billion in the annual deficit, as tax revenues increased, without raising tax rates, and unemployment and welfare outlays declined.
So let the Fed -- and all our policy makers -- divest themselves of the dogma that unemployment can be too low, and rather promote maximum employment and economic growth. And as Wall Street witnesses that growth and perceives that the Fed is not trying to stop it with higher interest rates, we might well expect the Dow, and not inflation, to go ever higher and higher.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Blockbuster Blooms in a Longtime Video Wasteland

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
For years, Harlem residents have complained that their community suffers from a case of benign neglect when it comes to life's amenities. Until recently, basic conveniences like pizza delivery were unavailable to the area's predominantly black population. Videos were rented at a handful of mom and pop general stores -- with relatively small selections -- or bootlegged through an open-air market of street vendors.
But Blockbuster Video has come to Harlem, and its arrival is being touted by leading voices in the community as one indication that Harlem itself has arrived. 
 The video chain recently opened a store on 125th Street, between Frederick Douglass Boulevard and Lenox Avenues, Harlem's main commercial strip. It is the first video chain to establish a presence since Roy's left four years ago. Beyond the 20 to 30 new jobs created by the store's opening, residents say Blockbuster, the largest video renter in the world, is just what the area needs to restore its economic vibrancy and lure middle-class residents.
"This gives the people of Harlem a sense that their community counts," said Warren S. Whitlock, deputy executive director of the Harlem Community Development Corporation, which helped broker the deal with Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation. The organization is now working to lure Domino's Pizza. In addition, a plan is moving forward on developing a six-story retail complex -- including a movie house and ice rink -- on another parcel on 125th Street.
Wally Knief, corporate communications manager for Blockbuster, said the new location, the chain's 69th store in New York, made sense from a business standpoint.
"There are 43,000 households within three-quarters of a mile of the site," said Mr. Knief. "There's a great deal of foot traffic, a subway exit and the State Office Building is next door."
About 1,500 people had obtained membership cards in the two weeks since the store opened, according to Frank Groce, the store's manager. He said the store, open from 10 A.M. to midnight seven days a week, is averaging 150 applications a day.
Customers browsing through the selection of 15,000 videos and 1,000 video games commented on the chain's arrival.
"There were those who said we'd steal the videos off the shelves or couldn't be trusted to return them," said Louis B. Love, a disabled veteran who uses a wheelchair and lives on West 145th Street. Before the store came to Harlem, he had to travel to the Blockbuster store on East 96th Street to rent videos. "Blockbuster was willing to take a chance," he said, "and that says a lot."
Rose Riley looked like a kid in a candy store. "Who needs to go to the movies?" she said. LENA WILLIAMS

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CARROL GARDENS;
'Mayor' Who Refused to Run

BYLINE: By MARK FRANCIS COHEN 

 BODY:
Salvatore (Buddy) Scotto looks so much like Mayor Giuliani that strangers often mistake him for the Mayor. But Mr. Scotto seldom encounters strangers when strolling, driving, or just standing in his neighborhood. Many locals refer to Mr. Scotto as the Mayor of Carroll Gardens.
"He's gotten that name because he is someone people in the community look to and respect," said Assemblywoman Eileen Dugan. "He never says no to anyone. It never ceases to amaze me." 
 "Buddy, I don't know what to do," a woman implores as Mr. Scotto prepares to leave the funeral home he owns on One Place. "My daughter wants to join the Air Force."
"She should," Mr. Scotto says, buttoning his coat. "But we'll talk later."
Mr. Scotto, 67, is a man people lean on, recruit, draft and appeal to. It's a position that has let him leverage deals and move politicians.
He first started working to improve his neighborhood so that long-time residents would not flee. Since then, he has been a remarkable force behind the elections of several politicians, a new sewage treatment plant, a senior citizens center, low- and middle-income housing and two local community development corporations.
"He has got incredible energy," said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza. "I think one extra ingredient that makes him effective is the nature of Buddy's profession. As a funeral parlor director, he comes into contact with people in their time of need."
Still, Mr. Scotto has gone to great lengths to avoid becoming a politician himself. In 1975, he quietly registered as a Republican so that the local Democratic reform club -- the one he helped start -- wouldn't put him on the ballot.
Ironically, Republican leaders, aware of his influence in the community, enlisted him as a delegate to the Republican National Convention the next year. Mr. Scotto accepted because he wanted to go to a national convention. Since he did not favor any of the Republican candidates, he announced he was going to the convention uncommitted.
Within weeks, he got a call from Vice President Nelson Rockefeller demanding his support. So, Mr. Scotto said he would only give his support if he got Federal financing to clean up the sewage-spoiled Gowanus Canal. After a few visits to the White House, Federal money was appropriated for the project.
The 15 more years it eventually took to complete the Red Hook sewage treatment plant was a lesson about politics for Mr. Scotto, who began a dogged effort in the 1980's to start community-based organizations.
He is still on what some see as a quixotic quest to make the Gowanus Canal a pristine waterway that could sustain open-air cafes, small craft and fishing. He has vowed to swim it one day. MARK FRANCIS COHEN

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Short-Sellers Are Lonely Hunters, but Is Their Bounty Near?

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
TRYING to profit from overvalued stocks has never been easy. But given the roaring bull market of recent years, the task has become onerous, and that has made a hard job even harder for short-sellers. These professionals hunt for sky-high equities and, by borrowing shares, sell them at the lofty price while later paying the lower price to which they expect the stock to tumble. They pocket the difference -- or pay it, if they guessed wrong.
Despite short-sellers' recent bad luck, investors in a soaring market can still learn from them. Indeed, if the Dow falters, their perspectives may be much in demand. So we paid a visit recently to Michael Katz and Geoffrey Hulme, partners who manage a total of $30 million in Reynard Partners and Glenrock Global Partners in Manhattan. Reynard is a short-selling fund, and Glenrock is a hedge fund that is half short, half long. 
 Q. Let me first ask you for some personal perspective. You describe 1995 as something of a murderous year for short-sellers. How did you fare?
KATZ -- Well, it's a good news-bad news story. I'll begin with the good news. The good news is that we think, according to what the professional scorekeepers tell us, we probably fared better than anybody else last year in our pure short-selling fund. The bad news, though, is that we still lost about 4 percent in Reynard before fees. [Glenrock was up 17 percent in 1995.] And we don't get paid on relative performance. We get paid on absolute performance.
Now to give you the points of reference. The stock market was up 37 percent, and from what I understand the average short-selling fund lost 26 percent last year.
Incidentally, 1995 was not the first bad year. We've been in a battle mode for five years.
Q. -- How much do you have in your short fund?
KATZ -- About $12 million.
Q. -- How has the number changed recently?
KATZ -- The pure short-selling business has been the most out-of-favor strategy you can imagine. In 1990 we made 68 percent when the market was essentially flat for the year. So around that time everybody wanted to invest in short funds. But the general interest at the moment is minimal. Most people believe that the market will never drop.
Q. -- Given recent market volatility, is it possible that the short-sellers' time has come?
KATZ -- We thought so time and time and again over the past five years. It again looks like it. I mean you have signs like a very choppy market at record valuations. You have all sorts of phenomena that so-called technicians are better at explaining, so we're a little hopeful.
HULME -- One thing we've learned is that when it seems like things are getting aligned for a little easier environment, we make sure we're short stocks and not short markets. We really try to stay very stock-specific and hope that the environment helps us even more.
Q. -- Last year, many short-sellers were hurt by technology and biotech stocks. What were your positions in them?
KATZ -- We had positions in both types. In biotech we did lose some money, but not a lot, because we were partially hedged.
Q. -- I don't think anyone expected '95 to be as healthy as it was for biotech.
HULME -- Some real things were happening, but it didn't have to flow in to all the other companies.
KATZ -- And in technology we had a lot more. We were actually quite heavily invested in technology, I'd say to the tune of 18 to 20 percent.
HULME -- At the end of the year. Throughout the year, say 10 or 15.
KATZ -- As for technology, it raises the whole issue of risk control. Technology looked appetizing for the better part of '94 already and then in '95 it really took off. And in a sense that, if all we were doing were valuations, and shorting high-priced stocks, we would have gone in then. But that's not what we do.
We typically seek three things: high valuations, researchable fundamental problems -- business problems -- and some sort of event horizon, to develop a time line.
This plan serves two purposes. It gives us a trigger. If a certain piece of news comes out, then people will look at this differently and the stock will come down.
The other thing is to check our own thesis along the way. Are we right? If we expect this to happen, does it happen? If it isn't happening, why? Are we wrong? That sort of thing.
So that is the reason we didn't short many technology stocks early last year, even though our fingers were itching to pull the trigger.
Q. -- What other strategies do you follow to protect your position?
KATZ -- What we spend our time with is fundamental research. We read. We devour paper.
HULME -- We make research trips that we think other people don't make. We try to get much primary, objective, unbiased information from the industry.
KATZ -- We talk to lots of competitors, suppliers, clients, consultants, trade associations, trade journals. And so forth and so forth.
But intertwined with that is always the focus that we want to know the fundamentals of the business. We want to know what problems a business has.
The difficult thing on the short side is that if a stock goes against you, it gets bigger as a part of your portfolio.
HULME -- So when some things we hoped would happen didn't happen, we cut the positions. You wanted a balance sheet to get worse; it didn't get worse. You wanted a new product to fail; it didn't fail. Or maybe it got some news out of nowhere that's positive.
Q. -- How is '96 shaping up for you so far?
KATZ -- Well, so far, we've lost some ground. I think we're down between 3.5 and 4 percent, something like that. That's always painful. Again, for perspective, the Dow's up about 10 percent.
Q. -- You are one of the few short-sellers with an international position. What are you doing there?
KATZ -- International investments have been extremely helpful for two reasons. No. 1, we've been able to find ideas where there aren't many other people interested on the short side. There is much less competition internationally for us. The second is that it has kept us out of trouble, having about a third of our capital in shorts outside the U.S.
HULME -- It's important to remember, again, we're not short for those markets. We're short for individual situations.
Our No. 1-performing situation last year was Eurotunnel. It's basically a situation where they generate 500 million of interest expense a year and, last year, I think, they did about 300 million in revenue. This year they might do 500 million. So who knows, maybe in the third year they have more revenue than interest expenses. I'm not talking about any operating costs here or anything.
KATZ -- Also, the company suspended paying interest late last year.
Q. -- How much did you make on this one?
KATZ -- In dollars? I don't even know. But in percent, we were short the stock before last year. We were short the stock going into last year, probably in the 40's on average in francs. It's now 6. By the way, I think Eurotunnel as a construction project is a wonderful thing. But the way it was financed and the delays and screw-ups along the way have just made it a totally untenable situation. They owe way too much money and the shareholders were taken for a ride.
HULME -- No pun intended.
Q. -- Besides Eurotunnel, where else did you do well internationally?
KATZ -- Euro Disney is another one where we have a very long history. We've been in that since '92.
HULME -- When the gates opened we started to short the stock. We really try to look for these situations where it's no longer a concept, it's a real thing.
KATZ -- As long as it's a concept and there's nothing to measure anything by, brokers will get it anywhere they want. They'll hype it. They'll have all sorts of fantasies about it. But once it's opened, every day the register is open and it rings or it doesn't ring.
HULME -- Often, analysts make very top-down models: "So many people in France. So many will visit Euro Disney. It's going to cost this, and they're buying this many."
KATZ -- "Plus there are 80 million people in Germany, and 10 percent of them own a car," or whatever.
HULME -- And then the reality enters, but in between it's very difficult because people believe those numbers.
KATZ -- By 1994 it was clear that under the old structure Euro Disney was essentially insolvent, a similar story to Eurotunnel. It had much too much debt. So at that time they essentially did an informal, prepackaged bankruptcy, if you will. The banks essentially agreed to a moratorium on interest, took some equity. And there was a huge equity dilution.
HULME -- And U.S. Disney decided to defer its fees.
KATZ -- And now the recapitalization, which was done over two years ago, is not enough. Many of their interest payments and lease payments and royalties to Disney are coming due again.
Q. -- The payments are coming back?
HULME -- Coming back like a boomerang. They might not come back in the same percentages, but they are coming back.
KATZ -- Internationally, we also have a significant exposure in Japan to manufacturers of semiconductors, in particular DRAM chips. And Hong Kong, where we have had a presence since '94, approximately. We have some situations in the United Kingdom and Canada.
The problem with many international markets is that we can't borrow stocks. That's a technical requirement for short-selling. You have to find someone to lend them to you.
Q. -- What other analyses do you perform?
KATZ -- We spend a lot of time thinking about who are our opponents in the market. Let's say opponent analysis, meaning, who buys stock from us?
In short-selling, very often you're dealing with unsavory characters on the other side. Many companies are "promote jobs." In the worst case, they're complete frauds. In many cases, they are not frauds but certainly wide exaggerations of potential and plays on people's gullibility. And more often than not in this kind of company there is effectively a cabal of brokers with management that inflates the stock. We have to be very careful with whom we're dealing. Sometimes those people's abilities to manipulate prices are astonishing.
I don't want to say that everything we short has unsavory people on the other side. Many, if not the majority of our shorts, simply have very bad business fundamentals.
We also think long and hard about what sort of exogenous risk factors our stocks are exposed to. In an airline, you could pick several, but I would say oil, the price of gasoline, is the most important. And then see how exposed we are in the portfolio to that exogenous risk.
Q. -- Any advice you want to give investors about today's market?
KATZ -- The market is at heights that it has never before reached in 120 years, in terms of valuation.
HULME -- In the past 14 months, January '95 to February '96, the market is up 50 percent; 37 percent last year and 10 percent on top of that this year comes out to 50 percent. It's an absolutely staggering number, considering particularly that at the beginning of '95 it was expensive.
KATZ -- Brokers, and others, justify it by saying this time is different than prior overvaluations. And people buy it. The American investor has as many stocks in his or her portfolio, as a percentage of household liquidity, as during the highest of the highs in the late 60's. The last time it was that high was just prior to a series of vicious bear markets.
Even so, there is something much worse than that now. The crash of '87, for instance, did not do anything to the economy, mostly because the average consumer didn't own any stocks, I believe. So when they lost a lot of money in the crash they didn't stop buying; it didn't matter to them. Now, everybody owns stocks through mutual funds. And it's not just that they own them for their savings accounts or for money that they can afford to lose. They put their pensions in them now.
I would say if there's any accident in the market today, you'll have absolutely massive repercussions on the economy because so many "regular" guys will lose so much of their savings and their pensions.
Under these circumstances, is this the time to gamble the farm on mutual funds or stocks, when all of the historical evidence is against you?
Q. -- As a short-seller, what are your top picks now?
HULME -- One is North American Vaccine. It's a biotech company that's developing a pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine. We believe that in the trials the vaccine showed the lowest efficacy versus three other vaccines. There are three very large multinational companies doing this. We also believe North American is behind in the F.D.A. approval process, that it has no ready manufacturing capability. We believe it has a dangerously low cash position, about two quarters of cash left. Insiders have been selling their shares over the last few months. And the market cap of the company, which is nearly $520 million, is almost twice the worldwide revenue opportunity for this type of vaccine.
It's a perplexing situation. There is this phenomenon of money flowing into the biotech sector and people with a checklist saying: "Let's find a company that is in Phase 3 trials. This company's in Phase 3 trials. Let's find a company with a novel product. Well, this company has one."
They go through it this way and they do the work a little bit, but they don't do it the whole way. And a rising tide lifts all boats.
HULME -- Glaxo is another situation. The products that account for nearly 65 percent of its revenues were flat last year, and those include Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug, and Zovirax, an antiviral drug. And about 40 percent of the 65 percent in the next 18 months will lose patent protection. Meanwhile, the stock is valued on a price-earnings basis like several other large pharmaceutical companies that don't have the same affliction.
Q. -- What else are you shorting?
KATZ -- Micron Technology, a semiconductor stock. All they essentially make is memory chips. As late as last fall, neither it nor anybody else in the industry -- and certainly not the brokers -- was admitting that the market was dropping. Everybody knew that there were dozens of plants, large-capacity chip plants, being built all over the world, in Korea, Taiwan. Nobody was willing to admit that this was a problem.
Suddenly, in October or November, we got news that the price for memory chips was dramatically weakening. Everybody thought they were still at $14 and suddenly they were selling at $12, which seems so dramatic. And then they kept accelerating. And week after week we get these reports. Then they cascaded down to $5 and have bounced to $7 or $8 right now.
Micron made money like they were printing it for years because the normal big annual decline for the price of new chips didn't happen. They could just sell those chips at extremely high margins for an inordinately long time. And so the stock, even at the height of it, didn't look that expensive based on the prospective price-earnings ratio.
Q. -- Are there any particular kinds of companies that are candidates for shorting?
HULME -- There are a few: recently public companies, or those that have done lots of offerings. And then there are companies that are passing through the "dream reality" stage.
KATZ -- Insider selling is a very frequent tip-off. I mean, we often find that we get attracted to ideas of highflying stocks and suddenly we see insiders selling or doing secondary offerings. And so you get a feeling. It's not in and of itself a reason to short anything, but it's often something to be examined. Several of these companies are one-product companies.
HULME -- One-product companies are another way to limit our risk. They limit what we need to be right about, and we can get our arms around them and they can't reinvent themselves.
KATZ -- The nature of good short ideas, or what makes a short idea, is not static. It depends very much on what else is going on in the market and the economy and so forth. For instance, five, six years ago, we had large concentrations in stocks that were extremely leveraged, as a result of the leveraged-acquisition boom of the 80's. They were in no position to pay their debt. And that worked very well.
Then, of course, over the succeeding years, everybody recapitalized and that whole debt motif went away. But many things are just one-of-a-kind, special situations that you can't really impose a category on.
HULME -- Theme investing is often a way to get killed in short-selling.
KATZ -- Yes, exactly. Good point.
HULME -- Death by analogy. It can be very dangerous.
Q. -- What should investors think about short-selling?
HULME -- I think short-selling is a rational strategy, and we think there's a place in a well-diversified portfolio for it.
KATZ -- More than that, we think we're going to make a lot of money. While we've lived through the past five years, we think it has been a historical anomaly. I mean, markets have risen faster, more frothily, more speculatively and with fewer setbacks than at any time that I can think of.
There's another thing. Prior to the past five years, short-sellers were making high absolute rates of return even in bull markets. The 80's were a good period, even though it was a raging bull market. Something else decoupled in the past five years; I suspect it's an anomaly. It'll come back into sync. You can't long have a rational strategy where reasonably intelligent and hard-working people get their head handed to them year after year, while investors who are running with the pack make a lot of money without work and without . . .
HULME -- He was thinking of something mean.
Q. -- And you had to catch him. It's good there are two of you there.
KATZ -- Yeah, well, we have our healthy debates.

HEADLINE: Lost in Toyland

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
STANDING on the top floor of the Toys "R" Us store in Santa Monica, Calif., far above the endless racks of Monopoly games, Barbie dolls and coloring books, Diane Summers Craig was very much alone.
"Hello? Hello? Is anyone here?" Ms. Craig called out as she perused a deserted aisle of computer software. 
 At last, a clerk wandered over to help her, but acknowledged that she did not really know the differences among the computer programs for sale. The clerk added with a polite smile, "Someone will be here in a minute to help you." Frustrated, Ms. Craig mumbled something about not having a minute, but waited for several of them anyway.
Another clerk came, but help was not forthcoming. "No one here really knows anything," huffed the mother of two young children before turning on her heel and leaving.
Wall Street has known for quite a while that the world's largest toy retailer is troubled. After 16 consecutive years of uninterrupted growth, the company's earnings took a 72 percent nose dive in the fiscal year that ended on Feb. 2, to $148 million, largely due to a hefty restructuring charge.
Further, in a bull market in which the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen more than 40 percent since the beginning of 1995, the stock price of Toys "R" Us has declined about 11 percent. Company shares, which went for $42.875 at the end of 1993, stagnated in the $20's for most of 1995, and closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $27, down 25 cents. Add it up, and the company has lost a staggering $5.2 billion in market value, weighing in at $7.5 billion from a pinnacle of $12.7 billion.
Michael Goldstein, the chief executive of Toys "R" Us, has big plans to stem the bleeding. But he is caught in the classic quandary of the turnaround artist: if he spends too much on revamping his stores, he could wreck his already shaky profit margins; if he spends too little, his efforts may come to naught.
The company's fall from grace didn't happen overnight. In 1990, retail analysts treated Toys "R" Us as almost sacrosanct, projecting earnings growth of 25 percent a year.
Yet the company has come close to that target only once in the last six years -- and then only after two lackluster ones.
Analysts give a variety of reasons for the reversal of fortune at Toys "R" Us, which just over a decade ago was rolling over its competition like a Tonka truck lumbering down a grassy suburban hillside.
They speak of discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target ratcheting up the competitive pressure; of a dearth of creative new toys; of the fading popularity of the Power Ranger action figures, which accounted for huge sales the previous year.
But it is perhaps those retail analysts with children, the ones who have made a Saturday afternoon venture into that dizzying landscape of bikes, bath toys and a ubiquitous giraffe named Jeffrey, who know what parents indifferent to issues of market cap have known for years: while Toys "R" Us has what they're looking for, getting it can come at a cost to their sanity.
"I don't know a single retailer about which I hear as many complaints as Toys "R" Us," said Barry Bryant, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw and the father of a 3-year-old son. "You never know where anything is, and there is no one to help. And to make matters worse, children are enticed in there as if they were walking through one long candy store. All of these things combine to create a uniquely unpleasant shopping experience for the parent."
The supermarket style of selling playthings has always been the Toys "R" Us trademark. Shoppers squeeze through charmless, colorless aisles, and pick through rows of crayons, doll houses, video games and action figures, strung together like so many sausages, displayed often without care or accessibility.
Merchandise is often piled so high it is impossible to reach, particularly while holding a wailing 3-year-old whose eyes are wildly fixated on Mr. Potato Head.
And if a sales clerk can be unearthed, chances are his or her job is to stock, not to serve. "I usually feel like I am getting a price break and a lot of selection," said Cindy Read, a program administrator in Louisville, Ky.,. "But I don't look forward to going in there, seeing all these families fighting over toys. People are tired, parents seem annoyed -- that is why I don't take my son there."
By offering a giant selection with very low prices and plenty of inventory, Toys "R" Us has been able to get away with this no-frills, service-short shopping experience, and to do so in a way that has made shoppers all around the country abandon the competition, if begrudgingly.
But times are changing in the world of fun and games, and parents have grown decreasingly tolerant of the lack of attention and the chaotic arrangements at Toys "R" Us, especially when they can find some of the goods for the same price, or better, at general discount stores.
Further, a growing number of so-called educational toy stores have cropped up, offering soothing worlds of purple carpeting and television screens to plop children in front of while mom and dad shop. And nibbling away on the baby end of the business is Baby Superstores, a 63-store chain based in Duncan, S.C.
TOYS "R" US has caught on to all of this, and is finally fighting back with new store formats, including one with the sole mission of challenging Baby Superstores. But can the giant that built its war chest through pre-emptive strikes do as well playing catch-up?
When asked about his company's earnings trouble during a recent interview in his office in Paramus, N.J., Mr. Goldstein looked a bit like a basketball coach who just watched his team get pummeled in a playoff.
"It hurt," he said of the recent profit plunge. "Particularly for a company like ours that never experienced a decline in earnings. It was a rude awakening."
Then the coach recovers and plays to the fans. "But it energized us to do a better job," he said, smiling. "We see a lot of options in 1996."
Toys "R" Us has enjoyed a glittering history. The country's first category killer -- industry argot for giant warehouse-style stores that offer the most of one type of merchandise -- it toppled Child World, Kiddie City Toys and countless regional stores during the 1980's. It now easily dominates the market, with more than $9 billion in annual sales and 650 stores in the United States.
Even after the company's expansion slowed in the early 90's, the prospect of overseas growth kept investors' hopes alive. Several analysts remember conference calls in 1993 in which Toys "R" Us executives promised gains of as much as 50 percent in the company's international business. But many of the stores have failed to deliver. "We gave projections, and we didn't meet them," Mr. Goldstein said.
Each foreign market threw its own curveball at Toys "R" Us: a sluggish economy in Germany, a Christmastime strike in France and strong local competition in Australia.
But while those forces were beyond its control, the company also made some strategic missteps, like choosing poor locations, and failing to negotiate prices on merchandise and real estate.
WITH its fortunes sagging at home and abroad last year, the retailer desperately needed a hot Christmas. Instead, it got slammed when no new video or toy products arose to rival the phenomenal success the previous year of the Power Ranger action figures and the spinoffs from the Disney hit movie "The Lion King." Worse, discount stores slashed prices, forcing everyone to sell toys at a loss.
After the disappointing holiday season, Toys "R" Us announced that it would take an after-tax restructuring charge of $270 million, equivalent to $397 million pretax, to close 22 stores in the United States and Europe and to consolidate distribution and administrative offices. Company officials acknowledge that the charge includes other sundry expenses, like inventory write-downs. While the restructuring announcement caused them embarrassment, the charge makes it much easier for the company to achieve its fiscal 1997 earnings targets.
A disclosure in January that the Federal Trade Commission had targeted Toys "R" Us in an antitrust investigation only made matters worse. The inquiry stemmed from complaints by wholesale clubs that the big retailer unfairly used its marketing power to discourage manufacturers from selling popular toys to them.
Mr. Goldstein neither confirmed nor denied the accusations.
Most analysts scoff at the investigation as a Washington sideshow, but antitrust lawyers are less dismissive. "It is quite serious," said Richard M. Steuer, a partner at the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. "There are few categories where you have a retailer with as much power as Toys is perceived to have, so however it comes out is likely to set a precedent for other categories."
The F.T.C. is expected to conclude the investigation within a month.
But Toys "R" Us has even larger themes to wrestle with. Like many retailers that enjoyed boom days a decade ago, it must find new ways to lure in 1990's shoppers who have become accustomed to price wars and their spoils, and who are eager for fresh concepts and new merchandise. In the 80's, all a retailer had to be was big and omnipresent. Now, it really needs to be clever.
This has sent the entire industry to the analyst's couch: Every retailer wants to know what it has done wrong, and how it can be better, more self-aware and more of a participant in its relationships with shoppers. But seducing new shoppers does not come by tweaking existing concepts -- it comes from reinventing them. This is the challenge for Toys "R" Us.
To fend off interlopers and make its stores more inviting, Toys "R" Us is fighting back in three ways. First, it plans to roll out new stores known as Concept 2000, in both new locations and existing sites. These stores will be an aesthetic antidote to the current spaces, which have the charm of a tenement basement.
The 45,000-square-foot stores will have wider aisles and lower racks, so shoppers can see where things are and reach the merchandise. Each store will have a skylight. Colored tiles will replace the current gray floors, and fixtures will be festooned with colorful toyland icons. Employees who assemble bikes will do so in an open space, Santa's-workshop style, in the back of the store. The first of 16 Concept 2000 stores will go up in Raritan, N.J., this year.
Then there's Babies "R" Us, a superstore devoted to the needs of the under-5 set. There will be furniture, clothing, diapers and formula, complete room models in the back and the all-important baby registry. Eight to 10 of these stores will pop up in 1996, the first in Westbury, L.I.
Plan C brings together various ideas. In 1996, the company will put up two yet-to-be-named megastores: 90,000 square feet of toys and baby offerings that marry all of the stores' concepts, including Kids "R" Us, under one roof. All Toys "R" Us stores are meant to have better customer service.
In the front of the giant marts, there will be a food vendor, most likely a McDonald's; a party room; a haircut salon, and a photo studio, all leased to franchisers. Elsewhere, there will be entertainment centers, breast-feeding rooms and a "castle" containing little girls' fitting rooms smack next to traditional girls' toys, intended to encourage cross-shopping.
"This is a big change from what we have been doing," said Mr. Goldstein, standing next to models of the three stores that sit alone on a table in a conference room. "We think it is going to be great for us."
AS Mr. Goldstein tells it, the fix he has in mind doesn't have to tie up a lot of cash and wreck margins. But much as he would like, he can't have it both ways. If the roll-out is so guarded and snail-like, how much good can it really do and how long will it take?
"It is quite expensive," Mr. Goldstein said, looking into the model of the Concept 2000. "We would like to remodel all of our stores this way, but it depends on sales increases."
He declined to say exactly how much this will cost, but analysts estimate that the company's capital expenditure budget in the current fiscal year will run in the neighborhood of $650 million, well over the $586 million the company spent last year..
How much the company ultimately spends on the overhaul "is absolutely material," said Peter Kupferberg, a portfolio manager at Gofen & Glossberg in Chicago, whose firm has slowly unloaded much of its holdings in the stock. "If they can't stick to their numbers, that will only push margins further."
At $27 a share, or 15 times next year's estimated earnings, about equal to what the overall market fetches, Toys "R" Us stock is not worth buying unless the company's management can keep sales growing at about 11 percent a year -- and fatten net margins back over 5 percent, more than triple last year's dismal performance. This will be no easy trick if the company is also paying for expensive make-overs.
Many investors think that Toys "R" Us has gone about as far as it can in the United States, where it has captured about 23 percent of the $23 billion toy-and-video market.
In their view, it will need strong international growth to push earnings growth.
"They can put up these new stores, but they are pretty saturated," said Greg Jackson, a portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago, which has invested about $1.3 million in Toys "R" Us. "The tremendous growth potential is international, particularly in Japan."
He said Toys "R" Us did not have a Kmart or a Wal-Mart to do to it overseaswhat they did to it here. The company has 37 stores in Japan and will add 14 more this year, putting it in a dominant position in that market, too.
ANOTHER drag on domestic growth could be shopper inertia. "The perception of bad customer service at Toys was built up over many years and I think even at places where you've seen improvement, shoppers may not see it right away," said Sean P. McGowan, a retail analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison.
Mr. Jackson said he was looking for the shares to increase by about $8 to about $35 over the next 18 months as the company's earnings growth rebounds. "If you compare it historically, this stock is extremely cheap." he said. "But we are looking at slower growth rates for the future."
For investors, the questions remain: Why did Toys "R" Us wait so long to explore new opportunities, and can the same team that got them into this jam lead them out? "We first started to think of making changes in late 1994," Mr. Goldstein said. "We saw a number of things happening. The expansion of Baby Superstores, of educational stores and the price aggressiveness of discount stores. We looked at all that and said, 'To meet the challenge going forward, what should we do?' "
Yet it seems odd that it took the folks at corporate headquarters until the end of 1994 to turn their thoughts to these issues, given that the discount chains have been turning on the heat since the early 1990's, educational stores have been rolling out since the beginning of the decade and the Baby Superstores concept was well under way by then, too.
"It is clear they should have done this five years ago," said Mr. Bryant of Rodman & Renshaw.
What is more, plenty of other retailers who don't even sell toys figured out long ago that parents needed a place to park tots. Ikea, the Swedish discount-furniture chain that invaded the United States a few years ago, has huge playrooms just waiting to be destroyed in its warehouse-like megastores. Barnes & Noble Jr. has live entertainment and readings for little shoppers. Even supermarkets often offer entertainment for kids, like rides for a quarter out front.
EVEN smaller companies have figured out the lure of pure fun. Noodle Kidoodle, an educational toy store based on Long Island, has a big-screen television that shows children's videos, and offers in-store use of computers to try out software. No one accuses this company of being short on cash, given its propensity for stock buybacks and its solid balance sheet. But Toys "R" Us is not used to pouring money into aesthetic improvements, and the addition of better and more workers on the floor will certainly take a bite out of the balance sheet.
Clearly, keeping costs in check is no easy task. Toys "R" Us beefed up its advertising budget by 10 percent last year, and will do so the same in 1996. Selling, general and administrative costs crept up from 19 percent to 20 percent of sales last year. "Mystery shoppers" now visit stores and report back to management on customer service.
And to help reduce the hopeless clutter of its stores, Toys "R" Us has also said it will reduce its store offerings from 15,000 to 11,000 items.
In a nod to stores like Zany Brainy, Noodle Kidoodle and Learningsmith, all regional toy stores offering wholesome playthings, Toys "R" Us will throw more educational toys into the mix and make the current ones more visible.
While Mr. Goldstein has always played down the threat factor of educational stores, shoppers seem to love them. In a recent visit to Natural Wonders, an educational store in Louisville, Doris Walker cruised the serene ailes with her 9-year-old granddaughter, Whitney Kelsey.
"I can see the appeal," said Mrs. Walker. "Everything is touchable."
Paring down the merchandise and rolling out new stores will take buying genius, and some spectators wonder if Mr. Goldstein and the president of his stores, Robert C. Nakasone, could use some help.
Mr. Nakasone comes from the supermarket industry, a background that many analysts say has worked for Toys "R" Us, with its emphasis on keeping a tight cost structure, but also against it by perpetuating a warehouse mentality in the display of goods. "They sell toys like cabbages," Mr. Bryant said.
While executive-search firm executives tend to praise the entire Toys "R" Us team, it is getting a little long in the tooth. True, to help start its expansion plan, it has called on outside consultants and even hired a new merchandising manager for Kids "R" Us. But all the top executives have been at the company for at least five years. Mr. Goldstein has been around for 13 years, and Mr. Nakasone for 11.
"The two senior people running this business are in finance and operations," said a person who works closely with the company and spoke on condition of anonymity. "What is essential now is that a strong merchandising acumen come into this."
Mr. Goldstein said he felt that his company has "the best merchandising team around," and didt seemed moved by the idea of hiring new people for the executive suite.
So what's the investor to make of all this? Given the maturity of the domestic business, the growing number of competitors breathing down the company's neck and the uncertainty abroad, investors are resigned to one fact: "It's never going to be the growth stock it once was," said Marina Carlson, a portfolio manager at Strong Capital in Milwaukee, which holds around a million Toys "R" Us shares. Nonetheless, she thinks the stock has potential for growth.
"We'd be happy at 10 to 12 percent," she said.
Several product introductions -- like new Star Wars figures, fresh Nintendo 64 videos and toys that spin off the films "101 Dalmatians," "Toy Story," and "Space Jam" -- should bolster Toys "R" Us this year. And the retailer is counting -- perhaps incorrectly -- on discounters to let up on the price wars, and for shoppers to catch on quickly to the store's operational changes.
MR. GOLDSTEIN does not seemed fazed by hard times. The company's headquarters in Paramus are just a few miles from one of the busiest Toys "R" Us stores in the country. Inside, Mr. Goldstein's office walls are plastered with framed comic strips and drawings that celebrate his company and its world-renowned name.
"This one is from the time we were really big," he said almost reverently, pulling at the corner of a framed old news clip. "And we'll be there again." But for now, the models of his dreams sit on a table in a silent conference room, eerily alone.

ALL you worrywarts wringing your hands over whether liberals and conservatives in this country will ever come together can just take a chill pill.

HEADLINE: Living Helpless and in Hope;
It's Not Easy Being 'Jose'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MAZATLAN, Mexico

 BODY:
THERE are nearly 100 million Mexicans below the Rio Grande, but in the heat of an American election campaign they often are reduced to cliches.
For the American who fears for his job, there is just "Jose," a malevolent and suspicious partner who would take what the United States has. For the businessman who worries about his investment, there is only a corrupt and indifferent Mexican system to be wary of. For a candidate who plays on fears, there is nothing but an unwelcome neighbor whose very language and culture are threats. 
 The truth is that even for the Mexicans themselves, these times are a puzzle. But in trying to understand the complexity of their lives, there is perhaps one good place to start: the perpetual coexistence, for most, of both hope and helplessness.
Consider the experience of a small group of women in this shrimp-catching port on the central Pacific coast.
These are hard times for Mexicans, as they struggle through ferocious economics and poisonous politics, and it became especially so last Sept. 14 in Mazatlan, when the luck of the shrimp men just ran out.
It was the season when men bet their lives against the weather to make the first catch, which provides 70 percent of the yearly harvest they export to the United States. Last September a tempest called Ismael sent to the bottom some 200 men on 50 boats, one of them called The Hurricane. Survivors said a government weather warning came too late.
Six months after the storm, some of the widows have formed what is probably the first women's fishing cooperative in Mexico. They have petitioned the Government to turn over three old shrimp boats confiscated in drug raids. The women will rely on relatives to do the actual fishing.
But now they have to contend with the infamous Mexican system -- which is indeed corrupt and indifferent. And this is what is difficult for people north of the Rio Grande to understand. The Mexican people tolerate this system, but they do not trust it. It is, in a way, part of their fate to put up with it, like the hurricanes.
So the women can only wait for the boats to be released to them.
Casilda Rodriguez Morales, whose husband and son went down on The Hurricane, refuses to despair. With luck, she says, the three ships will put to sea in September.
She remembers the morning when she last talked, quietly in her still-dark kitchen, with her husband Arcadio and their 17-year-old son Mauricio. "We were saving for a washing machine," she says. The men had been forced back to port by a refrigeration problem on their boat. "Mami, there are many shrimp," Mauricio told her. A good catch could bring $3,000 -- enough for the washer and to finish the small house they are building.
"Many, many shrimp."
And then they were gone.
Anyone who has seen a Mexican construction site, where men dressed in rags scamper up rough ladders shouldering five-gallon tin cans of wet cement, knows that Mexicans accept hardship. In some Indian communities, corn stalks must be bent during the rainy reason so the rain slips off the husks and does not rot the corn. This is made into a lesson for life: In order to survive, a person must accept hardship and be willing to be bent.
So now, surviving on a $60-dollar-a- month pension, Casilda Rodriguez and her five remaining children expect little help from outside their family or the extended family of the shrimp cooperative. She is not surprised that the Government is dragging its feet on the legal process of giving up the three boats, which are docked at Mazatlan under Navy guard.
"We stupidly support the party at election time and then afterwards they forget us completely," said Rosario Gonzalez, another shrimp women whose husband was trapped in an air-bubble in his overturned boat but died when a diver, contracted by the government, cut open an escape hole and let the air slip out.
 
 
 
Not Expecting Welfare
 So these are women who have learned not to expect the Government to solve their problems; at best they hope for permission -- as with the three confiscated boats -- to help themselves.
It is hardly the stereotype so often presented in the United States of Mexicans seeking to pour across the border to take advantage of welfare. "Look, if we could one day have relationships among citizens in the States and citizens in Mexico, we would both be surprised at what we are," said Vicente Fox, a central state governor and prominent opposition politician. "Unfortunately, the only relationship now is through politics, and that's completely deviated from what we really are."
Outsiders often say that Mexico is hard to understand; a European ambassador here says serving in revolutionary Iran was easier than being in Mexico the last four years. For the sense of tragedy itself is complicated. Forged in the clash of Indian warriors and Spanish conquistadors, and unable to declare either side winner or loser, the Mexicans have from the beginning seen defeat as unavoidable, but not permanent.
 
 
 
A National Depression

And the Mexican character today is not simply stiff upper lips and valor. There is corruption and indolence, and an almost primitive violence in much of life. And after more than 15 months of the worst economic depression in 60 years, some prominent Mexicans, like the columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio, think Mexicans suffer from a national depression.
These heirs of Mexico's revolution have taken this crisis calmly. For over the decades they have been lulled into acceptance by an overpowering triumvirate: single-party government, milquetoast labor unions and the powerful television network Televisa, which finds reporting on real crime distasteful even as it fills soap operas with rape, murder and betrayal.
There may be no more practical symbol of the way Mexicans understand the relationship between hardship and hope than the block-and-concrete houses in which most poor Mexicans live. The walls of the ground floor go up first, and then steel bars are set in concrete to form corner posts. The bars extend several feet above the roof line and are capped with Coke bottles to keep them from rusting.
These are called "los castillos" -- the castles -- and they represent a hope, not in the system or the Government, but simply in the possibility that someday things will get better and that there will be enough money to build a second floor.

HEADLINE: In Uganda, An Election Where Parties Are Silenced

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, March 30

 BODY:
Uganda's first presidential election officially got under way this week with plenty of hoopla, speeches, rallies and bunting, but without the one ingredient opposition politicians say would make it possible to unseat President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni: political parties.
Despite pressure from Western democracies, Mr. Museveni, a former rebel leader who fought his way to power 10 years ago, has steadfastly refused to allow political parties to operate here, arguing that multiparty democracy has brewed nothing but chaos in Africa, dividing people by tribe, religion and region. 
 But as the official campaign started on Friday, the main opposition candidates complained that the real aim of Mr. Museveni's brand of "movement politics" and "no-party elections" is to quash dissent and to hold on to power.
While parties are not banned in Uganda, they are rendered toothless by law. Candidates must run as individuals, not as party representatives, and parties are not allowed to raise money, hold meetings or campaign. Even wearing clothes of a party's colors can be grounds for arrest.
Diplomats and opposition leaders say that in recent weeks the police and local militias allied with Mr. Museveni have been breaking up political meetings and harassing supporters of the main opposition candidate, Paul K. Ssemogerere, the leader of the Democratic Party and a former Deputy Prime Minister.
At the same time, Mr. Museveni has been taking political advantage of powerful Government machinery and the organization of his own National Resistance Movement, the former rebel group that essentially is the ruling party. The President has been traveling the country and speaking to throngs of supporters, ostensibly to promote an anti-poverty program.
"We are not allowed by law to address the people, to go out and assemble campaign teams," said Mary Lubega Mutagama, Dr. Ssemogerere's campaign manager.
"We are told we are not supposed to gather in groups of more than 10 people. We even found it difficult to open a bank account."
For his part, Mr. Museveni was unrepentant earlier this week as he held a huge rally here to announce a platform that firmly places economic development and military strength ahead of increasing political freedom. He accused former Ugandan leaders like Mr. Ssemogerere of using government to enrich themselves and said Uganda should look to one-party governments in Asia as models for economic development rather than to the United States.
"The future lies in attracting as many industries as possible, and in attracting as many service industries as possible," he said. "All the Europeans sitting here, they know that, but when they come they tell you about multi-partyism."
Mr. Museveni's hard-line stance against partisan elections is embarrassing to Europe and America, which have been pouring money into Uganda and touting Mr. Museveni as an enlightened leader, diplomats say. The United States alone gives Uganda about $50 million a year.
One Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Museveni had become "arrogant and dismissive" after 10 years of being the darling of the West. "There has to be give and take," he said. "Museveni has reached the stage that he will take but not give."
Still, diplomats say, it is unlikely that the United States or its European allies will withdraw support, and Mr. Museveni knows it. For the United States, Uganda is a bulwark against the expansion of the Islamic regime in neighboring Sudan. Moreover, Mr. Museveni has restored a measure of peace and stability to a country that suffered horrible human rights abuses under Idi Amin and Milton Obote.
Mr. Museveni, who began his long civil war as a Marxist, may also have practical reasons for not wanting a return to party politics. If the vote were to split along traditional tribal and religious lines, he might be defeated.
Since Mr. Museveni is a southerner from the small Ankole tribe, he has worked hard to build a coalition, appointing ministers from various ethnic groups to woo their votes, just like any big-city mayor in America. Nevertheless, the largest tribe, the Buganda, centered around Kampala, is expected to split, since Mr. Ssemogerere is one of them.
Still, Mr. Museveni himself remains popular with many people who remember how difficult life was under Mr. Obote and Mr. Amin.
"My guess is that Museveni would win, but a lot of his ministers would not, and there would be a lot of opposition in Parliament, if it is a free and fair election," said one Western official here. "That is what Museveni is afraid of."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Minimum Wage, Maximum Debate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH many Republicans are loath to admit it, there is an undeniable logic to Democratic proposals to raise the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage.
That logic goes like this: if a plant is thirsty, water it; if a tire is losing air, fill it; if the pay of low-wage workers keeps them mired in poverty, then simply raise it -- if necessary, by legislation. 
 For President Clinton and the many Democrats pushing for a higher minimum wage, such a step would be one way to narrow the growing income gap between Americans on the bottom rungs and those on the top. The Democratic plan to raise the wage to $5.15 over two years would also be a tidy way to stop the incomes of low-wage workers from falling further behind inflation.
In an election year, there's a lot of political logic at work, too. With three-fourths of Americans supporting an increase in the minimum wage, and with the wage gap growing as a public issue, the Democrats see a higher minimum wage as a political slam-dunk.
In large measure that explains why Democrats pushed the issue onto center stage in Congress last week and why Mr. Clinton made it the subject of his weekly radio address yesterday. Depicting their party as the friend of Joe and Jane Lunchpail, the Democrats said that raising the minimum to $5.15 would increase the wages of approximately 4 million workers now earning $4.25 an hour, and of another 8 million earning between $4.26 and $5.14 an hour.
As the Administration's chief cheerleader on the issue, Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, has repeatedly pointed out that the $8,500 that a full-time minimum-wage worker earns each year is so far below the poverty line that the worker would most likely need welfare and food stamps to support a family. With the poverty line set at $15,600 for a family of four, one full-time worker would need to make $7.80 an hour to climb above that line. Mr. Reich also notes that because of the corrosive effects of inflation, the minimum wage -- which was last increased five years ago tomorrow -- is 31 percent below where it was in 1979 and will soon be at its lowest point in 40 years.
 
Lifting All Boats
"Some people want us to believe that the typical minimum-wage worker is a teen-ager flipping hamburgers," Mr. Reich said. "That's simply not the case. Most minimum-wage workers are over 20 years old, and 40 percent of them are the sole breadwinners in their family."
Democrats look to a higher minimum wage as a way for a rising tide of economic growth to lift all boats, not just the yachts.
For many Republicans, the Democratic drive to lift the minimum wage is equal parts junk economics and cheap politics. Eager to show that they too are concerned about the poor, Republicans argue that lifting the minimum wage will result in layoffs for tens of thousands of low-wage workers because many of those jobs would be eliminated or shifted overseas.
In Senate debate last week, Senator Bob Dole, the all-but-annointed Republican candidate for President, said: "There are going to be a lot of young people who lose their jobs. Many are black teen-agers, and many are young people whose parents live below the poverty line."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said a higher minimum wage would cause many employers to hire fewer unskilled workers once they became more expensive to employ. "Instead of helping people get on the economic ladder, the Democrats are pulling the economic ladder up and not enabling people to get on."
Senator Dole may have have won last week's legislative battle by maneuvering to prevent the Senate from voting on a higher minimum wage, but the Democrats say President Clinton is winning the public relations war by showing his concern for the beleaguered American worker.
 
 
 
Just Politics
 Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, "People believe that somebody who works a 40-hour week ought to make a wage they can live on, and the fact that Republicans oppose that notion is incredibly damning of them to voters."
Supporters of a higher minimum received some unexpected new moral ammunition last week when a study found that chief executives' pay, with stock options included, soared 31 percent last year, the highest jump in a decade, putting their median pay at $5 million.
Republicans insist that Mr. Clinton's push for a higher minimum wage is not quite the high-minded enterprise the Democrats suggest. "They know it has no chance of passing," Senator Nickles said. "They're just trying to score political points."
Nonetheless, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and a handful of other Republican Senators, perhaps sensing which way the political winds are blowing, last week announced their support for a higher minimum wage.
Some minimum-wage workers say it is patronizing for Republicans to assert that a higher minimum wage would wallop the poor. Lawrence Ware, a $4.25-an-hour temporary employee with the New York City Human Resources Administration, took issue with the Republicans, saying: "It makes me feel like they prefer the cliche, 'The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.' They don't really care much about poor people."
Like many low-wage workers, Mr. Ware said he doubted that a higher minimum would cost his job. The Clinton Administration and many Democrats point to several recent academic studies that buttress this view. The best-known study was conducted by two Princeton professors, David Card and Alan Krueger, who surveyed 331 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey when the state raised its minimum wage by 80 cents, to $5.05 an hour, in 1992. (Ten states have minimum wages that are above the Federal level). The professors found that even though the restaurants gave the 19 percent increase to their many minimum-wage workers, the higher minimum did not cause a drop in the restaurants' employment.
At the American Economics Association convention last January in San Francisco, Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, presided over a panel discussion in which conservatives and liberals crossed swords.
But, he said, a consensus emerged that "the employment effect of a moderate increase in the minimum wage would be very, very small."

HEADLINE: Better Unread Than Read;
Russia's Press Edits Out a Communist

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov has made some far-fetched claims on the stump. Last week, he suggested that Stalin respected the Russian Orthodox Church in his heart. He also said that 20 years ago the C.I.A. launched a plot to destroy the Soviet Union, and that the Russian mass media are conspiring against him.
On at least the third claim, Mr. Zyuganov has a point. 
 Mr. Zyuganov was making his first campaign tour as a presidential candidate in southern Siberia, giving detailed press conferences and long, impassioned speeches in factories, farms and town halls. He was followed around by 14 journalists, but only one of them was Russian -- a 24-year-old reporter for the small news agency RIA-Novosti.
Mr. Zyuganov, the architect of the Communist Party's stunning comeback, is, according to most polls, the most likely candidate to beat Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin in the June elections. He is arguably the biggest story in Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed. But here in Russia, his campaign is getting about as much air time as Lamar Alexander got after the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Zyuganov calls the neglect of the press "black propaganda." It is really more of a blackout. The Communist leader's campaign trip was not mentioned on state-controlled television or on the main privately-owned network, NTV. No mainstream newspapers wrote about his trip. The news agency Tass ran a short bulletin by a part-time correspondent who covered a press conference in Barnaul.
Russia's fledgling effort to create a genuinely independent fourth estate is being put to the test by Mr. Zyuganov. Despite his assurances that he will preserve pluralism and free speech, many reporters fear that his victory would mean a return to censorship and strict government control of the media. So many of them view the campaign not as a horse race but a fight for survival. Radio Liberty, which is financed by the United States Congress and is often a target of nationalists and Communists, is contemplating relocating its Moscow office to Vilnius, Lithuania, in the event of a Communist victory this summer.
The Russian press is much more independent and adversarial than it was in Communist times, but it has a long way to go before it reaches the standards of impartiality and balance that are considered normal, or at least desirable, in the West.
Like their European counterparts, most Russian newspapers have a pronounced political slant, and readers take it for granted. But respected newspapers like Izvestia that are labeled democratic (as opposed to right-wing or left-wing) and that have been critical of the Yeltsin Administration until now, have switched their focus -- and their undisguised hostility -- to what they view as the greater evil, Mr. Zyuganov.
There is an undercurrent of revenge in the non-coverage of his candidacy. Since the Communists did not play fair when they ruled the country, the "democratic" newspapers figure, why should we?
It is fairly obvious why the state-controlled networks ignore Mr. Zyuganov -- their directors have made it clear they serve the President's interests first. But the privately-owned network NTV has been just as reticent. Stanislav Marmitko, the deputy news editor of NTV, explained, "We didnt have a bureau nearby. So what if it is his first campaign trip, we're not obliged to cover it."
The Russian networks are doing some things that would be terrible breaches of journalistic protocol in the United States. It would be unthinkable for the president of CBS to formally advise the Clinton campaign; but Igor Malashenko, NTV's chief executive, will work as a top adviser to the Yeltsin re-election campaign.
Izvestia has recently published several pieces reporting rumors of splits within the party leadership, as well as more investigative stories about the Communists' economic programs. All major non-Communist newspapers have run passionate editorials warning against Mr. Zyuganov's election. But the candidate's speeches and trips are barely covered.
Igor Golembiovsky, the managing editor of Izvestia, explained his decision not to send a reporter to cover Mr. Zyuganov: "First, we have no correspondents in that area. Second of all, Zyuganov doesn't like Izvestia reporters. Third, we're not interested in it. As a leader and as a person -- we've already got his number."
The Russian press evidently feels that it is better to ignore the candidate than to give him free air time and publicity. But there is a self-defeating aspect to such attitudes. Without close, daily scrutiny, Mr. Zyuganov can easily fudge facts and distort history with impunity. While every mistake and gross exaggeration of the American candidates on the campaign trail gets scrutinized, here they slide by undetected.
Trying to appeal to nationalist sentiments by stressing his respect for the Russian Orthodox Church, Mr. Zyuganov told his audiences that Hitler told Nazi occupiers that to subdue the Soviet nation they would have to install Protestant clergy in every village. An adviser to Zyuganov later cheerfully admitted the canididate was taking "poetic license" with the facts. Without a truth squad to examine his statements, Russian reporters are giving Mr. Zyuganov license to spout a lot more than poetry.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Europe Isn't Divided In Its Joblessness

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THE European Union is deep in crisis, perhaps the worst of the decade. It is not about beef, the problem that preoccupied leaders of its 15 nations Friday in Turin, where they had planned to kick off a conference on how to handle expected expansion, but about the one thing that truly unites them: unemployment.
That has now reached a European-wide average of 11 percent, nearly double the rate in the United States. 
 Pitting alienated European working-class populations against unemployed immigrants, "Dickensian" Britain against "socially advanced" continental welfare states, chronic unemployment has undermined the optimism and self-confidence that created European unity after World War II.
It is the one problem this generation of European leaders seems to be able to do the least about, undermining the confidence of younger generations in unity as their best guarantee of peace and prosperity in the future. Germany, the economic engine of the continent, is as severely affected as the rest.
As in America, the employment pattern has had to adjust to increased competition from low-wage manufactures from abroad. In Europe, in addition, the problem is compounded by social regulations that include heavy payments for health insurance, pensions and unemployment insurance, and such stringent protections against dismissal that companies think long and hard before hiring anybody.
Many economists are beginning to argue, therefore, that what the European welfare state produces most efficiently is joblessness. They say Europe simply has to consider lowering the minimum wage, shifting some burdens of paying for social benefits from payrolls to tax rolls and changing work habits that now put five- and six-week vacations ahead of productivity growth.
A passion for productivity can complicate the job market if it turns into a passion for downsizing, as it has in the United States, but at least small businesses generate millions of jobs there. Not the high-paying kind, however, that Europeans think of as a right. "French workers don't want to live like the Anglo-Saxons," union leaders warned during last December's strikes against the French Government's first attempt to whittle down the welfare state.
The leaders at Turin didn't set out to do that. France's President, Jacques Chirac, pressed them to reaffirm support for a high level of social protection, rather than see a spiral of competition to attract employers by undercutting wages and benefits.
 
 
 
Trains or Beef
 He also wanted them to get on finally with a series of large-scale construction projects on trans-European rail and communications networks that have long been discussed as potential job generators. But with billions needed to solve the spreading beef crisis, there may be little money left for construction projects.
Unable to do much about their problems, European leaders often take to denying they exist. Meanwhile, last month, Germany recorded a post-World War II record of 11.1 percent unemployment. And if its economy slumps, France, where 11.8 percent are jobless, is almost sure to follow. The two are each other's biggest trading partners.
Throughout the European Union, governments are all strapped and paring budgets to reduce debt built up by years of unemployment benefits for millions of people. Nobody knows of a simple solution except demagogues like France's Jean-Marie Le Pen, who wins ever larger vote shares by saying unemployment would disappear if immigrants -- a disproportionate share of the unemployed -- were just chucked out.
Many Europeans, like Americans, blame cheap labor overseas or immigration for their unemployment troubles, even though many big European companies have followed Volkswagen's example and agreed with labor unions to cut work hours and save jobs rather than dismiss employees.
European leaders met in Bangkok earlier this month hoping to create new jobs by stimulating trade with the booming economies of Asia, and employment ministers will meet with American, Japanese and Canadian counterparts in Lille this week to discuss global unemployment.
Still, Britain felt it necessary five years ago to opt out of the European Union's "social charter," a codification of its welfare-state labor practices.
 
 
 
A Corrosive Influence
 The longer unemployment continues to be chronically high, the more corrosive the effects on self-confidence. In France, one recent survey of 500 people between 18 and 25 years old, taken by the Sofres organization, showed that more than half expected to be living less well in 20 years than they did now, compared to only about one in four Germans surveyed last summer by the Emnid organization.
Little wonder that French youth today are more worried about jobs than any generation since the 1930's. "I have grown up surrounded by young people who can't find work when they finish their studies," said Veronique Ridel, a 22-year-old university graduate in Rheims. "They live with their parents, they can't collect unemployment benefits, they've never had jobs. If it weren't for my father, I'd be out on the street."
When French university students went on strike last fall, they were not trying to bring Marxism back or the Government down. They wanted the Government to spend more money on building better classrooms and hiring more professors, to give them a better shot at what jobs there may be.
Alienation is as much a part of European culture today as in the days of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. But in an era of bewildering technological change, the new existential question is how to bring jobs back. Without an answer to that, the whole idea of Europe could be in trouble.

HEADLINE: Asian Immigrants Help Bolster U.S. Economy, New Report Says

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 30

 BODY:
From Cambodian doughnut-shop owners to Chinese electronics engineers, Asian immigrants do far more good than harm to the nation's economy, a new report says.
The study, sponsored mainly by the Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics, a national nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles, was made public this week, timed to allow the nation's 7.2 million Asian-Americans to call attention to their achievements as Congress considers revising immigration laws. While the report used Asian-American success stories in California as examples, it applied its conclusions to the country as a whole. 
 As the fastest-growing immigrant group in the United States -- the number of people whose origins are in Asia or the Pacific increased by 385 percent from 1971 to 1990, and is expected to reach 11 million by the year 2000 -- Asian-Americans have a special interest in keeping the nation's doors open.
But the Chinese, Filipino, Indian and other Asian and Pacific immigrants also serve as potent examples of the economic shot in the arm that immigrant entrepreneurs provide, said the report's main author, Bill Ong Hing.
"When you see an immigrant working, a well-meaning person might think, 'Oh, an American could have been working in that job,' but what you do not see is the job-creation process," said Mr. Hing, an associate professor at Stanford Law School who is an immigration scholar. "Immigrant entrepreneurs are left out of the calculation."
And those entrepreneurs go far beyond the stereotypes of Chinese dry cleaners and Korean grocers, said Edward J. W. Park, a sociologist at the University of Southern California who contributed to the report.
Of the estimated 2,000 high-technology companies in the Silicon Valley near San Francisco, he says nearly 500 are run by Asian-Americans. The report said 15 of the nation's most successful high-tech companies were founded by immigrants; those companies now have a combined revenue of $22.25 billion.
The report, titled "Asian Pacific Americans: Reframing the Immigration Debate," seeks to counter anti-immigration arguments by citing the achievements of Asian and Pacific immigrants.
While opponents of immigration have emphasized the financial burden that immigrant children impose on education and welfare budgets, the report focused on a longer look at the life span of such children, viewing the money spent on education as an encouragement to advanced schooling and an investment later returned in taxes and productivity.
It found that among Americans 25 to 38 years of age in 1990, Asian Pacific Americans were twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have received a post-college degree. And once they reach the second generation in America, the number of Asian-Americans receiving welfare is much lower than average.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE FIRST VOICES;
Polls Find Far Right Doesn't Define G.O.P. Vote

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 30

 BODY:
Despite warnings from conservatives that Senator Bob Dole risks losing crucial support from the Republican coalition if he moves toward the center, surveys show that the nearly 12 million people who voted in Republican primaries this year are not particularly far right on major social issues like abortion.
An analysis of surveys of voters in primaries in 28 states found that most do not think the Republican Party should retain a platform plank opposing abortion; they are divided on the sensitive issue of cracking down on immigration, and most do not put the nation's moral troubles at the top of their list of factors in voting. 
 These findings, drawn from exit polls conducted by the four television networks and The Associated Press, suggest that Mr. Dole might not have so difficult a time as some Republicans have predicted in dealing with Patrick J. Buchanan and other conservatives in the run-up to the party's national convention in San Diego in August. Many conservative leaders have warned in particular that Mr. Dole risks fracturing his support if he picks a running mate who supports abortion rights.
Mr. Dole gained enough delegates in the primary here on Tuesday to pass the 996 mark, the delegates needed to win the nomination. Overall, he captured 6.6 million votes or 55 percent, while Mr. Buchanan drew 2.7 million or 22 percent. The magnitude of Mr. Dole's victories, and the willingness of religious conservatives to support him as the candidate most likely to prevail over President Clinton in November, could also make it easier for Mr. Dole to rally conservatives around his candidacy.
In a study of voting in the primaries, Curtis Gans, director of Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, concluded that the shallowness of Mr. Buchanan's support means that while Mr. Dole "will have to step carefully in the issue of reproductive rights," he "need not pay unnecessary homage to Buchanan to unify his party."
Mr. Dole supports a Constitutional prohibition on abortion with exceptions for rape or incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger. But he has been far less outspoken on the issue than Mr. Buchanan, who has threatened to take the matter to the party's convention.
Specifically, only 38 percent of all primary voters this year said the plank that calls for a Constitutional ban on abortion should be part of the Republican platform. Among those voters who identified themselves as Republicans, 55 percent opposed the anti-abortion plank, while 43 percent favored it. But among a pivotal voting group in November -- independents who voted in the Republican primaries -- there was even less support for the plank: Fifty-three percent opposed the anti-abortion language, 25 percent favored it, and the remainder had no response.
In another notable indication of how Mr. Dole has won the support of religious conservatives, 45 percent of the people who identify themselves as part of that voting group backed the Senator.
While they did not dispute the findings, some conservative groups argued that the figures mask the fact that foes of abortion are among the most reliable Republican voters and are a critical group to keep in the coalition for the general election.
"Yes, abortion is an issue that makes a lot of Republicans uncomfortable," said William W. Pascoe 3d, political director of the American Conservative Union. "But it doesn't make them so uncomfortable that they will actually vote for the Democrat because they care more about other issues."
On the other hand, Mr. Pascoe argued that if Republicans continue to make opposition to abortion an issue, it could attract support from blue-collar Catholic voters in battleground states like Illinois and Michigan. "Abortion is an issue we use to give those Democrats a reason to cross the line and vote for our guy on Election Day," he said. "It's that simple."
Although many leading Republicans complained that the shortened Republican primary season ended too fast, before most people had a chance to weigh in on their preferences, Mr. Gans' study found that turnout actually rose over both 1992 and 1988 in all but five states: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Illinois.
Turnout was by far the highest in New Hampshire, where 23.9 percent of the voting age population went to the polls. But Mr. Gans said that although Mr. Buchanan won that primary, he did not think the high voter participation in the state reflected his vociferous opposition to abortion, Instead, he said, the rise "was more likely due to Pat Buchanan's appeal to working class, more normally Democratic voters on the issue of economic insecurity."
Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who backs abortion rights and is an active supporter of Mr. Dole, argued that the relatively low support for Mr. Buchanan demonstrates that he should not be allowed to hold much sway at the party's convention or in affecting Mr. Dole's positions as the campaign progresses. "We shouldn't do anything about him," Mr. Wilson said in an interview. "Pat fought his fight and came up short."
From the analysis of voter surveys, a portrait emerged of the people who handed Mr. Dole the Republican Presidential nomination. He drew support from a broad range of demographic groups, and was especially popular among people over 60; women, voters in the highest income categories, and voters who think of themselves as moderate or somewhat conservative. Mr. Dole did not draw a majority of support among voters without a high school diploma; those whose education included postgraduate work; those who consider themselves very liberal or very conservative, and those who supported Mr. Clinton or Ross Perot in 1992.
The findings also highlighted Mr. Dole's vulnerabilities. Sixty percent of those asked said that Mr. Dole's age would make no difference in how he performed as President. But 30 percent said the fact that he is 72 would hurt his performance. And 52 percent of Republican primary voters who were asked said they did not think Mr. Dole had new ideas.
Over all, people who voted in the primaries were more male than female. They were wealthier, better educated and older than those who will probably vote in the general election and Americans over all. And, not surprisingly, they were more conservative.
Despite their conservatism, the surveys underscored that these voters were far from monolithic and hewed to positions that were not always the most popular with the right wing. They were divided on the issue of immigration, with more voters saying the country should welcome new immigrants. They were far more concerned in their voting with economic rather than social issues. Asked what mattered most in their voting decision, taxes ranked first, with 22 percent; followed by the economy and jobs, 20 percent, and the deficit, 20 percent. Abortion was way behind, with only 11 percent of voters citing the issue.
Despite the high turnout figures, the voters were not particularly excited with their choice this year. Forty-seven percent of voters said they would have preferred more of a choice in the primaries.
"What we do know," Mr. Gans said, "is that each party is relatively but unenthusiastically united for its candidate for fear of the opposition, and the amount of breakage toward a third party is likely to be minimal."

HEADLINE: As Plant Closing Looms, an Enclave Splinters

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON MANOR, N.Y.

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, Mirta DeJesus and her two sisters traveled up from Puerto Rico to find work in this Catskills village's chief industry: a plant that processes 40,000 kosher chickens a day.
They became part of an enclave of Puerto Ricans, Salvadorans and Hondurans that is conspicuous in this trout-fishing countryside streaked with craggy hills and swift, silvery streams and populated largely by poor and working-class white people. The Hispanic enclave is so settled that the local market, Peck's, carries yucca root, frozen platanos, or fried bananas, and frozen arroz con pollo, or rice and chicken. 
 But the colony's days are numbered and the three DeJesus sisters, their husbands and children are reconciling themselves to the likelihood that their family circle will soon splinter, its members dispersing as far as Puerto Rico and Indianapolis with no certain prospects for work.
The reason they and almost every Hispanic family here are being uprooted is the closing of the chicken plant.
More than 250 workers who pluck feathers and gut, wash and salt chickens and turkeys as 70 birds a minute speed along an assembly line will lose their jobs at the end of April after the plant has met the demand for Passover seders. While the plant employs Jewish slaughterers and ritual supervisors who ensure that the work complies with Jewish dietary laws, the bulk of the workers are Hispanic, including former migrant workers who had given up the nomadic life of following harvests from Texas to New York.
"Some of them will go home, some of them will fall into the welfare system, some will find other jobs," said Jo Diescher, vice chairman of the Community Action Coalition to Help the Economy, based in nearby Liberty.
But finding jobs in a depressed region will not be easy, she says. And migration will hurt children who in many cases have thrived in English-speaking schools and grown fond of mainland mores and their friends. Of Livingston Manor's 4,096 residents, 186 are Hispanic. Other workers are bused in from Hispanic enclaves in Liberty and South Fallsburg.
The factory is being closed by Conagra Inc., the Omaha-based food giant which had 1995 sales of $24 billion. Conagra, which markets Armour bacon and Wesson oil, has in recent years seized on the kosher food business for growth, acquiring the Mogen David, Zion and Isaac Gellis brands as well as the chicken plant's owner, National Foods, the company best known for Hebrew National hot dogs but also the nation's second largest producer of kosher chicken, after Empire Kosher Poultry.
A Conagra spokesman, K.T. Miller, said the company does not see a profit in sustaining the 57-year-old plant, a maze of connected shed-like buildings. Workers say the plant's roof is leaking and a Federal inspector gave the owner 60 days to put in a new one.
Elton Harris, Supervisor of the town of Rockland, which embraces Livingston Manor, thinks the decline of Sullivan County's chicken farms is another factor. National Foods' chickens are raised five hours away in Pennsylvania and the expense of trucking them adds to the already steep price of kosher chickens. The chickens packed here carry Falls and Galil labels and go out to supermarket counters from Baltimore to Buffalo.
There is a local effort to find a replacement chicken processor, but it will not be easy, said Gerald Skoda, executive director of the Cornell Cooperative Extension Service of Sullivan County.
"Kosher is a different world," he said. "You could run a Frank Perdue plant successfully and go bust here. The first thing you've got to do is keep the rabbis happy, and they're as demanding as Federal meat inspectors."
The three DeJesus sisters stopped working at the plant years ago to raise children, but two of their husbands still work there and will be displaced.
"They work hard, they work long hours, but they got the money to pay the rent," says Mirta DeJesus, 36.
She will probably return to Puerto Rico because her husband, Angel Rodriguez, shop steward at the unionized plant, thinks family members in his native village near Ponce can find him a job. Her sister, Haydee, 32, must contemplate a new life for herself, her husband, Juan Reyes, and their two children in Indianapolis, where there is a Conagra chicken plant to which workers like Mr. Reyes have been invited to transfer.
Iris, 50, the oldest sister, would like to return to Puerto Rico to live with her mother. But her husband, Abraham Rodriguez, who worked nine years at the plant, was disabled last year with diabetes and high blood pressure. Her bull-shouldered 16-year-old son, Angel, does not want to go, having spent practically his whole life among English speakers and cultivating the mainland passion for football. He is an offensive guard on the Livingston Manor high school team.
Mirta DeJesus has liked Livingston Manor, a pleasingly ramshackle village set in a bowl of hills.
"It's peaceful," she said. "You don't see people fighting."
Her five-room, $219-a-month subsidized apartment has the hard-won touches of permanence: a video recorder, a microwave, a coffee table packed with porcelain figurines, pots of trailing philodendron. The walls are studded with the earnest faces of her children in school photographs. On one wall are three soccer medals her daughters won in the league the county set up because of the Hispanic presence.
Mrs. DeJesus likes the school across the road, where her daughter, Keyla, 10, got "excellents" in mathematics and social studies on her last report card.
Her husband, Angel, a brawny man with thick workman's fingers whom she met while working at the plant in 1983, hates the biting Catskills winters, but loves the crisp summers and the chance for barbecues at nearby state parks.
No doubt, the 12 years at the factory have been hard. When he worked the assembly line, dressed in a heavy apron and thick blue rubber boots, he would stand on a cold, wet floor and work with machines that have been known to slice off a finger. There was only a 10-minute bathroom break every two hours. The bustling Passover season requires 12-hour days and work on Sundays, which means missing Mass.
With pay starting at $4.45 an hour, these are jobs that few people even in the depressed Catskills seem to crave, even if management gives out two chickens a week as a bonus.
But now Mr. Rodriguez is loading chickens onto trucks, a slower-paced job, and he would have liked to stay on.
Not that his family's stay has been trouble-free. Although most people have been friendly, Mrs. DeJesus says she has occasionally felt the sting of discrimination. "It's ignorance,' she said. "People don't understand. We went to the library. One lady said, 'You jerk.' I said, 'I don't say nothing to you.' "
"The people were very prejudiced," says Sister Grace Therese Murray, a Bronx nun who teaches English classes to the Hispanic community in Livingston Manor. "They didn't want all these Hispanics here. But now they realize, 'Who's going to shop in the supermarket?' "
While Dr. Kenneth F. Gray, Superintendent of the Livingston Manor Central School District, says the Hispanic children, who make up 12 percent of the 775 students, do well, Ms. Diescher, a sociologist, says a third of the district's Hispanic students fail to graduate. She blames the district's refusal to establish a bilingual program.
"The children start to fail and that eats away at self-esteem and they start making friends with people who are failing," she said.
Not all the displaced people are Hispanic. Daniele Edwards, 36, may also be uprooted from the area where she has spent most of her life because her boyfriend is losing his plant job.
"We got families too, the whites and the blacks," said Ms. Edwards, who is white. "The work may be hard but the money is clean. I don't have to sell drugs to put food on the table. I haven't been on welfare for over two years."
But her leaving will not change the area's character much. The Hispanic workers' leaving will.
Richard Robinson, manager of Peck's Market, figures he will lose up to $5,000 a week in business and trim back what he calls his "Goya section," the shelves stocking Hispanic products. He hopes some laid-off workers will stay on because, he says, their enclave makes Livingston Manor different from, say, neighboring Roscoe, the trout-fishing haven that Mr. Robinson calls "all American, Marine, short-hair country."
"It adds a lot of flavor to our community," he said.

HEADLINE: Croatian General Plans to Surrender To Hague Tribunal

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, March 30

 BODY:
The Croatian Government announced today that a Bosnian Croat general charged with involvement in the killing of hundreds of Muslim civilians would turn himself in to international prosecutors on Monday. The move was described by visiting American officials as an important step forward in bringing war criminals in the Balkan conflict to justice.
The suspect, Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, is the only Bosnian Croat officer under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The extradition of such a high-level suspect could signal a new willingness by Croatia to cooperate with the tribunal. 
 The timing for his surrender was announced after meetings today between Croatian leaders and Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who had warned that international financial and military aid to Croatia was threatened by the reluctance of its Government to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal.
The Croatian Government, which had been promising for weeks that General Blaskic would be turned over to the prosecutors, insisted that he was not being sent against his will. "He has volunteered himself to go to the Hague tribunal," the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, said after meeting with Mr. Perry.
But American officials said that General Blaskic was actually under house arrest in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and that he was being ordered to surrender, apparently in response to pressure on the Croatian Government by the United States and other countries.
"He's being pushed onto that plane," said an American official here.
The general was indicted by the tribunal in November for crimes against humanity for killings during vicious fighting between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Muslim forces in 1993 and 1994. He is accused of commanding troops that rampaged through at least 14 towns in the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia, near Vitez, killing hundreds of Muslims and torching their houses.
The Croatian move will almost certainly step up the pressure on the Serbs and the Bosnian Muslims to cooperate with the tribunal, which has so far arrested only 5 of the 57 people it has indicted for war crimes committed in the Balkan civil war.
Seven Bosnian Croat civilians, most of them believed to be living in Croatia, are among those indicted by the tribunal.
The Croatian Government insists that it wants to cooperate with the tribunal but that it cannot act against the suspects until its Parliament approves a new law allowing for the extraditions. General Blaskic was presented as an exception because he had supposedly volunteered to give himself up.
In meetings this month in Geneva with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr. Tudjman tentatively agreed to the transfer of General Blaskic to The Hague.
But the agreement appeared to unravel last week, with the general insisting that he would give himself up only if prosecutors agreed to place him under house arrest in The Hague -- instead of in a jail cell -- and allowed him complete freedom of contact with his family and lawyers.
At the Geneva meeting, the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, promised to hand over two Bosnian Serbs -- Drazen Erdemovic and Radoslav Kremenovic -- who are wanted for questioning in the killing of some 1,200 Muslims in Srebrenica.
The two men were handed over to the tribunal in The Hague today but have yet to be indicted by the war crimes tribunal, which allowed Mr. Milosevic to claim in Geneva that he was not establishing a precedent of handing over indicted Serbs. They may be indicted after questioning.
Mr. Erdemovic and Mr. Kremenovic are former troopers in the Bosnian Serb army who told the French newspaper Le Figaro that they took part in the reported killings of civilians at Srebrenica in July 1995.
In discussing why General Blaskic had agreed to face his accusers, President Tudjman said, "There has been some slight confusion because his attorney has tried to delay things."
The Croatian leader insisted that whatever legal ruckus involving General Blaskic took place last week, "the Republic of Croatia remains committed to full cooperation with the Hague tribunal."
Whatever his public assurances, Mr. Tudjman and his deputies had until today seemed no more enthusiastic about working with the war crimes tribunal than their counterparts in Serbia and leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have.
Several of the suspects indicted by the tribunal -- most notably the Bosnian Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic -- are considered freedom-fighting heroes by their followers. Of the 57 people indicted so far, 46 are Serbs. Similarly, many Croats consider General Blaskic a hero in the cause of Croatian nationalism.
But outside pressure, especially economic and military pressure from the United States, may be forcing the Serbs and the Croats to cooperate with the tribunal after months of waffling.
Mr. Perry told reporters today that the Croats "must turn over indicted war criminals" and that without full cooperation with the tribunal, they risked the loss of American financial and military assistance, as well as American support for Croatia's application to a NATO's program intended to be the first step toward full NATO membership.
Mr. Perry's trip to the Balkans -- first to Croatia and then to Bosnia -- is aimed largely at bolstering the fragile Bosnian Federation that anchors the Dayton peace agreement. Meeting with reporters aboard his Air Force plane, the Defense Secretary dismissed suggestions that the federation was collapsing.
"It is not unraveling," he said. "But it is not working as well as we would like either, and we would like both the Bosnian Government and the Croatian Government to put maximum efforts and maximum pressure behind making this federation work."
Mr. Perry said he would warn officials on all sides that the American-led NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina would move to shut down illegal checkpoints that have appeared with worrying frequency in recent weeks. Many have been set up by Croatian or Muslim militias to extort money from refugees.
The peacekeepers "will fan out all over the country, and any place they come across a checkpoint, they are going to knock it out, and they are not going to be polite about the way they knock it out," he said. He added that they "will have zero tolerance for units that try to stop freedom of movement in the country."

HEADLINE: CUBAN COMMUNISTS TAKE HARDER LINE

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, March 29

 BODY:
Warning of what it described as a campaign by the United States to "deceive, confuse and dismantle" the Cuban revolution, the Cuban Communist Party has called for strengthening ideological and economic orthodoxy and threatened "severe punishment" for those who failed to comply.
The party's Central Committee endorsed a harder political line against what it said were Washington-supported "Trojan horses" and "fifth columnists" in its midst. Reports of the rare full session, which was held last weekendbehind closed doors, only began to emerge this week. 
 Party leaders also sharply criticized features of the limited opening of the economy in the last three years, which has rescued the Cuban economy from the brink of collapse. Instead, they demanded increased self-reliance and discipline.
The actions come at a moment when relations between Cuba and the United States are unusually tense, a result of the episode on Feb. 24 in which the Cuban Air Force shot down two light planes belonging to a Miami-based Cuban exile group.
In retaliation, President Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act, which intensifies and extends the longstanding American economic embargo against Cuba.
Ordinary Cubans, dissidents and foreign diplomats have expressed concern at the tone of the documents emerging from the party meeting, saying they augur a period of increased repression and retrenchment.
"This is a sea change in terms of moving to a much more rigid ideological position and a much more absolute control by the party of everything," said one diplomat here.
In a report to the party conference published this week in Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Defense Minister Raul Castro, the country's second-most-powerful figure and the President's brother, argued that Cuba must at all costs avoid reforms of the type that "undermined the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."
Self-employed workers and intellectuals here are being used by Cuba's enemies, he complained, to weaken the authority of the party and the state and must be brought back into line.
President Fidel Castro led the closed two-day party plenum, the first since 1992. The full text of his remarks has not yet been made public, but Granma reported that he had told the 212 members of the Central Committee that the meeting marked "the start of an intense ideological battle," requiring the mobilization not only of party members "but of the people as a whole."
The effort is necessary because the country is experiencing "particularly difficult and dangerous moments," warned President Castro, who is also the head of the Communist Party. "Revolutionary ideology has never been more necessary than today."
Ricardo Alarcon, the Speaker of Parliament, said in an interview that the Central Committee session was to be followed by "thousands of meetings throughout the country to discuss this report" in workplaces and schools.
The Helms-Burton Act will be a main focus of discussion, he said, and he predicted that the strengthening of the United States sanctions against Cuba would be especially useful in motivating young people, whose ideological commitment to the Cuban revolution has flagged considerably in recent years.
"We are profiting from Helms," Mr. Alarcon said gleefully. "He has served us on a silver plate something that is crucial from an ideological point of view.
"Of course, we are going to play that card to death."
Other Cuban officials said the call for ideological orthodoxy reflected a "renewed confidence" resulting from a successful sugar harvest and predictions that the Cuban economy would grow by 5 percent this year, after contracting by one-third since 1989.
But Vladimiro Roca, a leader of the coalition of dissident and human rights groups called the Concilio Cubano, contended that the tough line showed a "fear and panic among the leadership of losing power."
The Communist Party views the emergence of a vigorous sector of self-employed workers as a threat to its absolute control over the populace, Mr. Roca maintained. The emerging private sector is less dependent on the state and underlines the inefficiencies of a centralized economy, he said, and so "the Government feels it has to brake this."
In Raul Castro's speech, which was splashed over five pages of Granma on Wednesday and emphasized in television and radio reports, the Defense Minister expressed apprehension that the growing number of self-employed workers "stimulates old and new forms of criminality" like profiteering and corruption. The phenomenon also is "creating the basis for organized groupings, associations and actions free of the state" that could "constitute a test tube for the subversive efforts of the enemy," he said.
The solution to that problem, said Carlos Lage, Cuba's chief economic planner, in another lengthy speech to the conference, is increased supervision of the embryonic private sector. "We must guarantee the control and combat the illicit enrichment" of self-employed workers, he said.
Mr. Lage also appeared to play down the importance of attracting foreign involvement in the Cuban economy, arguing that the main source of growth in the future must come from within, using Cuba's own untapped resources.
Foreign investment "is necessary, is important," he said.
"We have to promote it," he said, "but it is not the essential factor in our economy."
Officials at Government ministries dealing with economic affairs said Mr. Lage's remarks did not signal a change in economic strategy and that reforms would continue, and perhaps even accelerate. But others who work in sectors dealing with foreigners expressed doubt about his emphasis on self-reliance and fortifying state control.
"This is a bad sign," said a young Cuban employed by a private company that deals with foreign trade. "We have to have more foreign investment in order to grow, because we do not have enough capital ourselves."
Mr. Lage also said that despite the recovery of the Cuban economy, ordinary Cubans should expect to continue to live with the austerity that has been the main feature of life here since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989.
"This is not the moment for wage increases, no matter how justified they may be," he said.
In his speech, Raul Castro warned of deviations within the Communist Party itself, singling out for condemnation a respected research institute called the Center for Studies of America. "Various comrades were falling into the spider's web spun by Cuba experts abroad, in reality servants of the United States and its policy of fomenting a fifth column," he admonished.
The center is a semi-academic institution that focuses on political and economic developments in the Western Hemisphere, the United States included. But economists and political scientists at the institute have also argued and written in favor of more rapid and profound economic reforms within Cuba and for dialogue with Washington.
Cuban intellectuals and foreign diplomats here said that a purge of the institute had begun as a result of Mr. Castro's accusation and that it was likely to spread to other party research centers he has criticized. The director of the institute has been replaced by the head of the Communist Party's polling operations, and other specialists have also been removed from their posts, they said.
Raul Castro called for a similar campaign in the Government news media, because "we lowered our guard" and "have ceased being vigilant in the observe of our own rules." He said some publications used "a language supposedly revolutionary that seems intended to serve as a smokescreen for their true intentions," which he described as "a diversionary role."
Mr. Alarcon defended the dismissals at the institute, saying, "The party has a right to say, we don't like this and we are going to make some changes." Since the institute had been "created by the Central Committee to be a kind of advisory group," he added, it was perfectly proper to tell academic experts whose views are considered wrong that "you are invited to do something else."

HEADLINE: A Job-Training Bill Is Being Attacked by Conservatives

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Legislation to streamline Federal job-training programs, praised by President Clinton and conservative Republicans as a vital step in an era of layoffs and downsizing, is bogged down in Congress and threatened by attacks from very conservative groups.
Last fall both the House and Senate passed bills that would lighten Washington's hand on dozens of programs that now seek to train or retrain about one million unemployed people each year. At the same time lawmakers have added provisions that seek to coordinate high school vocational education with shifts in the economy and expand an electronic jobs-bank to help find workers for vacant jobs. 
 It is the latter two measures that have drawn the most fire.
The complex measure has languished in a House-Senate conference since October, with staff members wrangling and the Representatives and Senators who were assigned the job of finding compromises being distracted by other issues. That has allowed conservative groups like the Eagle Forum and the Family Research Council to whittle away at support for the legislation, asserting that it turns the Government into "Big Brother."
Another problem looming for the bill is Presidential politics. Both the House and Senate versions are close enough to Clinton Administration proposals so that the President could take credit for an eventual bill. House Democrats like Representative Pat Williams of Montana say they fear that Republicans will lose interest in the bill if much more time goes by, seeing no point in such a gift to a Democratic President near Election Day.
At the moment, the conservative attacks pose the more serious problem because they are provoking second thoughts among House members who voted for the bill in September, foremost among them Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois. Kris Ardizzone, legislative director of Eagle Forum, said that under the legislation, "anyone who is looking for a job has to go through a Government computer."
Jennifer A. Marshall, education specialist for the Family Research Council, said her group feared that the measure might require "all students" to undergo vocational, rather than college preparatory, education from an early age. "It's not clear that this is going to be an optional vocational track," she said.
Advocates of the legislation, like Representative Howard P. McKeon, a conservative Republican from Southern California whose House subcommittee handled the bill, said that line of attack "boggles the mind, but it's out there." Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich dismissed the criticism as "incomprehensible."
The conference seems stuck over the question of converting most Federal job-training grants into vouchers, which individuals could use to buy the training they think best. That is the approach taken by the House and by Mr. Clinton. But the Senate bill would stress giving control of the programs to the states through block grants. The states could then decide if they would use vouchers.
In an interview this week, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, chairwoman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said she was pessimistic about reaching an agreement soon even though compromises have been tossed back and forth. Trying to push the conferees to agree, House leaders have said they want the bill ready for floor consideration by April 22.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who was chairman of the committee two years ago when it began looking into consolidation, said: "Better job training and retraining are indispensable in helping families cope with the crisis of layoffs, corporate downsizing and declining standards of living in the current rapidly changing national and global economy. Yet, the long-promised overhaul by Congress of Federal job-training programs is now being jeopardized by the unwillingness of Republicans to agree on reasonable reforms, such as President Clinton's training vouchers."
In the quilt of alignments on the bill, Mr. Kennedy is an ally of Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. It is Mr. Armey who is pushing the conferees to act.
Last month, in a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, he said: "Federal job-training programs today erect barriers rather than bridges between aspiring workers and the jobs they seek. The House and the Senate this year will complete work on Representative Bill Goodling's careers bill, H.R. 1617, which takes control away from the bureaucrats who are in no position to know where the jobs are, and puts it in the hands of workers searching for training."
Mr. Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, is upbeat. "We're making some progress."
But Mrs. Kassebaum said, "We've really had a difficult time negotiating with the House."
Beyond the voucher question, the biggest unsettled issues are whether to combine the programs into one block grant, as the Senate favors, or three, as the House prefers, and how much to spend on training. The Administration is critical of the savings sought in both bills.
Secretary Reich said, "At this point in the nation's history, when Americans face corporate downsizing, defense downsizing and displacement by technology, the last thing we want to do is reduce funding for training."
The question of how much to spend is caught in broader disputes between the two houses. The House Opportunities Committee is ready to spend more on the jobs programs than are House Republicans. The Senate has been trying to increase spending for many programs besides the jobs programs this current fiscal year, but the House is resisting.
Mr. Reich said the money provided in stopgap spending bills, like the one passed on Friday, would cover only about 486,000 dislocated workers, down from 640,000 last year. "That's a major shortfall," he said.
But as the conference drags on, pressure from the right increases.
"We're dying the death of a thousand cuts because we haven't proceeded directly," said Representative Frank Riggs, another California Republican who supports the legislation. "We're running out of time."
The Family Research Council has made inroads by blasting the proposed computerized job and skill matching system, saying, "To grass-roots America, it is Big Brother coming into the workplace."
The Eagle Forum's founder, Phyllis Schlafly, has written in The Washington Times that the House bill makes it clear that students will be trained to work only in the occupations prescribed by the Government.
The United States Justice Foundation, another conservative group, complained that the Senate bill failed to "mention the word parents in the legislation, much less provide for any parental involvement in what is purportedly far reaching educational legislation."
A local Southern California organization known as Parents Involved in Education called the House bill part of a an effort "to remold our 'American Dream,' free-enterprise-driven economy into a socialistic, government controlled and managed national system for human resources development ('The American Forced Labor Bill')."
Mr. McKeon and Mr. Riggs said the conservative attacks had weakened support for the bill.
The most notable success of the opponents has been in enlisting Mr. Hyde, a leading House conservative. Recently he wrote colleagues that he feared the bill would contribute to the "dumbing-down" of education and force individuals to get a Government card to get and hold a job.
Mr. Hyde said on Thursday that he was not sure whether he would fight the bill if it emerged from conference, but said he suspected that it sought "a nationalization of our education in a politically correct way."

HEADLINE: On Social Security, Proceed With Caution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 27 editorial on the current enthusiasm for investing Social Security tax revenues in the stock market wisely urges caution. Before we make drastic changes in Social Security, we must have confidence that the expectations of our work force will not be jeopardized and our economy not disrupted.
There are questions to be answered. For example, would the Government undertake to guarantee against market gyrations a level of benefits to enable workers to plan for retirement? Would the Government's borrowing costs rise if the Social Security surplus were not available for that purpose? 
 How would our economy absorb this new capital? Would it be invested in less risky blue-chips and index stocks, driving up their market power as well as their price (and the compensation of their chief executives)?

HEADLINE: Sold Out

BYLINE: By James Boyle; James Boyle, a professor of law at American University, is the author of "Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
We've got the information age all wrong. Someone who reads today's newspapers would conclude that the four most important aspects of the information age are cyberporn, Windows 95, Newt Gingrich and cyberporn. This is like saying that the most important signposts during the rise of industrial capitalism in America were mass-produced pornographic magazines, Warren Gamaliel Harding and the Veg-O-Matic.
To understand the age we have entered, we need more than a modem, the Bill of Rights and a subscription to Penthouse on line. We need to figure out how the world changes when information becomes one of the most important forms of wealth and power: When everything from the pattern of purchases revealed by credit card receipts to the pattern of your D.N.A. can become a byte of information, to be bought and sold in the marketplace. 
 The first effect of this transformation is that intellectual property rights become very important. Around the world, corporations are lobbying their governments, demanding more expansive copyright, patent, trademark and data-base rights. Governments are complying, granting monopolies over information and information products that make the monopolies of the 19th-century robber barons look like penny-ante operations.
Intellectual property rights are being expanded dramatically, sometimes in surprising directions. Even human genetic information has been privatized. The gene that indicates a predisposition to breast cancer, for example -- called BRCA1 -- has been patented by Myriad Genetics. Harvard University even has a patent (No. 4,736,866) on a mouse -- the Oncomouse -- a transgenic species engineered to be prone to cancer. But beyond these examples, with their Brave New World overtones, lies a more general trend. We are in the middle of an information land grab and no one seems to have noticed.
There is a reason for this apparent blindness. The information economy is unfamiliar territory. When private parties are allowed to exploit Federal land, we can all work out the politics of the situation. We know the arguments (and the interest groups) for and against. But who wins and who loses when the property at stake is intellectual, and the struggle is over the extension of a copyright term or a software patent? As yet, we have no politics of the information age; we don't see the linkages between issues or perceive a common interest in apparently disparate situations.
Who is affected by the politics of intellectual property? Many groups are, though they might not see it that way. Some of the most innovative software engineers have objected to the extension of patent law to cover their products; they fear it will help create an oligopolistic software market and diminish inventiveness. Gay rights activists, meanwhile, are told there can be no Gay Olympics because the United States Olympic Committee owns the word "Olympic" and won't permit its use. (After all, what could be more foreign to the traditions of ancient Greece than homosexuality?) Environmentalists wish that some of the profits on patented pharmaceuticals drawn from the rain forest could be returned to protect their source. Religious organizations protest the patenting of living organisms.
Each group is complaining about an intellectual property system that has expanded out of control. Yet they don't see those complaints, or their interests, as linked. Part of the problem is that we have not adapted our public debate to the realities of the information age. Censorship we understand. But the subtler forms of control imposed by ownership of information? These are harder to discuss.
Congress is now considering the Clinton Administration's proposal for intellectual property on the Internet, aimed at "saving" this thriving medium. Using a far-fetched theory of what constitutes "copying," the proposal would turn browsing an Internet document into a copyright violation. It would effectively privatize much of the public domain by transforming the current law of fair use. It would make on-line service providers strictly liable for their customers' copyright violations, thus giving providers an incentive to monitor what you do in cyberspace.
These proposals are extraordinarily far-reaching. They have been criticized by educators, librarians, writers, civil libertarians and entrepreneurs, who fear that the Net will become a pay-as-you-go information toll road. And yet there is scarcely any coverage of these issues in the press. "Intellectual property" is presumed to be too dry, too technical, an issue, one mainly of interest to specialists.
The information land grab isn't confined to the Internet. In fields ranging from software to biography, biotechnology to court reporting, the general tendency of intellectual property rights has been to grasp outward, ever outward. Some might say, Isn't this necessary? Information products are expensive to create, after all, and cheap to copy; that's why we need intellectual property rights, right?
But the issue isn't so simple. Imagine that you were the intellectual property czar, charged only with creating the most efficient, productive system of property rights. You don't care about free speech, artistic integrity or equal access. All you care about is economic efficiency. What would you do?
At first it might seem that you would just hand out copyrights and patents galore, and even expand the scope of such rights to give innovators a higher return on their investment. The greater their incentive, the more drugs, programs, data bases and gene maps they will develop, right? Not necessarily.
Although courts, economists and United States trade representatives often talk this way, the effect of intellectual property restrictions on innovation is not so clear-cut. Entrepreneurs have to be assured that time spent developing new software won't be wasted, that a profit lies at the end of the tunnel. But they also require an adequate amount of raw material; there has to be an adequate flow of information for the market to function.
This is true even in literature. "Poetry can only be made out of other poems; novels out of other novels," as the critic Northrop Frye famously put it. The same goes for computer programs, which build on the contributions of earlier hackers, or for biotechnology projects, which rely on the availability of unpatented cell lines, and so on and so on. Every intellectual property claim is a chunk taken out of the public domain. If classroom copying is sharply curtailed, if we give someone a software patent over basic functions, at some point the public domain will be so diminished that future creators will be prevented from creating because they won't be able to afford the raw materials they need. An intellectual property system has to insure that the fertile public domain is not converted into a fallow landscape of walled private plots. We are in danger of forgetting this.
Right now, the ground rules of the information society are being laid down by lawyers (strike one) employed by the biggest players in the field (strike two), all with little public debate or press scrutiny. This is bad politics in the thrall of worse economics. We need a politics and a press of the information age. Access to dirty pictures will be little consolation, and speech anything but free, if we let this moment escape our grasp.

HEADLINE: Counties Make Big Reductions In Home Relief

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29

 BODY:
When Chris Scott applied for welfare last month, his case manager handed him a pamphlet that laid out strict guidelines he had to follow. It had a bland title, "Job Search Handbook," but to Mr. Scott it read like a manifesto for sharply curtailing public assistance -- a movement that is taking hold in counties across New York.
The pamphlet emphasized that people who want to get welfare in Albany County must first look for a job, enroll in a training program or participate in workfare. It also warned that anyone who violated the most minor of regulations would lose benefits. And that is what happened to Mr. Scott when his case manager accused him of not hunting aggressively for a job. 
 "They're just taking the whole situation entirely too far," said Mr. Scott, 25, an unemployed painter, after unsuccessfully appealing the decision at the county welfare office the other day.
Officials in Albany County disagreed, saying that they had a right to demand that welfare applicants like Mr. Scott try to find work. This newly hardened attitude is not unique to Albany County. Across the state, county officials are imposing broad new constraints on Home Relief, the program for childless adults that has existed in some form in the state since the Depression.
While Federal and state leaders continue to debate new restrictions on welfare, the county officials -- both Republicans and Democrats -- are pushing ahead on their own, stiffening requirements by using state laws that have been on the books for years but were rarely enforced.
They are being joined by officials in New York City, which has reduced its Home Relief rolls by 26.9 percent in the last 13 months. The city is so large that it administers welfare on its own.
Albany County has cut the number of people on Home Relief 76.2 percent, to 690 last month, from 2,900 in December 1993, county officials said. In 1993, the state and county spent $11 million on Home Relief in Albany County. Last year, that figure dropped to $5.4 million.
"The model is this: We talk about your last day on welfare on your first day on welfare," said Ross A. Prinzo Jr., Commissioner of Social Services in Albany County.
The campaign by the counties to trim the Home Relief rolls comes as these programs are under attack across the country. In recent years, several states, including Michigan, Illinois and Ohio, have cut welfare for able-bodied, childless adults, either doing away with these benefits altogether or setting time limits on how long people can receive them.
As a result, New York is one of the few states that still has no time limits on Home Relief, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in Washington.
Gov. George E. Pataki wants to change that, calling in his proposed budget for a 60-day limit on Home Relief for people who can work. The Governor is also seeking to scale back the other major welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, but that is more complicated because A.F.D.C. is federally mandated and new rules must emanate from Washington.
Home Relief is a state program not subject to Federal guidelines. It is also generally easier to require Home Relief recipients to look for jobs because welfare officials do not have to worry about issues like child care; most Home Relief recipients do not support young children.
It is not clear whether the Legislature, particularly the Democrats who control the State Assembly, will agree to the Governor's proposed time limits on Home Relief. But even without them, many counties are already trying to move able-bodied recipients into jobs within 60 days.
Over all, efforts by the state's 57 counties and New York City have reversed a sharp rise in the Home Relief rolls that began in the 1980's.
The monthly average of Home Relief recipients in New York jumped to 388,088 in 1993 from 174,306 in 1981, according to the State Department of Social Services. But in 1995's first 11 months, that average dropped to 343,069. And in December, the figure fell to 279,230.
The crackdowns are drawing pointed attacks from advocates for the poor, who maintain that officials are so bent on reducing spending that they are using technicalities to shove people off welfare.
The advocates warn that these policies could backfire because people who were once on welfare could end up in homeless shelters, on the streets or in emergency rooms -- situations that often cost more than public assistance.
"They are using every dotted 'i' and crossed 't' that they can find, knowing full well that it makes no sense," said Anne Erickson, legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project, a lobbying group for poor people. "They know that jobs are not there and they are sending them out on wild goose chases and waiting for them to fail so they can reduce their rolls."
For example, Mr. Scott, the unemployed painter, lost his benefits when he broke the rules on job searches. He was told that he had to file applications with 12 employers within two weeks. He went to 12, thinking that he had filled the requirements. But then his case manager told him that all 12 employers had to be hiring and that because only 6 were, he had failed and his case was immediately closed.
Mr. Scott maintains that he did not know that all the employers had to be hiring; county welfare officials said they had made that clear to him.
New York City has about 75 percent of the state's Home Relief population, and under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city has been aggressively trying to reduce its rolls. The number of Home Relief recipients dropped in the city to 218,168 last January from 298,560 in December 1994, according to the city's Human Resources Administration.
While the city has gained attention for cutting welfare, some counties have made even bigger strides.
Besides Albany County -- which has a Democratic County Executive, Michael G. Breslin -- Suffolk, Westchester and Allegany Counties, which are led by Republicans, have also sharply cut their Home Relief rolls. Suffolk has lowered its tally 29.3 percent, to 3,274 last December, from 4,633 in January 1994, officials said. Another county with Democratic leadership, Erie, has also made significant reductions.
The Governor and the State Legislature have influenced this shift in welfare, instituting new policies like fingerprinting applicants to reduce fraud. And last June, the Legislature passed new rules intended to insure that able-bodied welfare recipients look for jobs and participate in workfare. But it is clear from a day spent at a welfare office in Albany County that many local officials have seized the initiative.
Take the pamphlet that Mr. Scott was handed when he requested welfare. The state published it several years ago, but before 1993, many counties either did not use it or did not abide by the regulations it describes.
These days, almost every person on welfare in Albany County must carry a copy of the pamphlet on job searches and have potential employers sign it to prove that the recipient really did come by. The rules have left some applicants grumbling, but others said they supported the county.
Will Grant, 29, applied for welfare last month to help pay his rent and was told that within two weeks he had to seek work from at least 12 employers who were hiring. He did, and soon found a part-time job as a custodian.
"People come here with an attitude, and they expect certain things," he said. "This motivates you. It makes you want to do something. You can't just sit around. Even if you get a part-time job, it's better than nothing."

It's Spring, and Seeds Are Sown for Ice Rinks

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: ELMSFORD

 BODY:
NOW that the crocuses are up and spring is in the air it seems an odd time to be discussing ice skating. But ground will be broken next month for a twin rink complex open to the public in Elmsford, the first to be built in Westchester in 21 years.
The rinks, which will be National Hockey League size and operate year-round, should be ready for use by the end of summer, according to Philip C. King, director of leasing for Baker Properties, of Pleasantville, which is developing the project. 
 The 70,000-square-foot building housing the rinks, snack bar, lockers and showers will be built in the Fairview Corporate Park, where there is also a golf-driving range. Across the street is a sports entertainment center and a miniature-car racing track. The varied operations form a recreational hub along the heavily commercial Route 9A.
"Route 9A is probably one of the ugliest strips in town," said Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh Town Supervisor. "Now it's becoming a real center for recreation. There are also several retail projects that have been proposed for the area. I predict that in five years, it will be one of the nicest places in town."
The Golden Bear Driving Range, which opened in 1993, is a two-tiered heated building comprising a golf driving range and two 18-hole miniature golf courses. The building and surrounding property take up 25 acres. "We looked all over Westchester," said Dominic Chang, president of Family Golf Centers of Melville, L.I., which owns the complex. "It was extremely difficult to find this much land that was zoned commercial."
Across the street is Sportime U.S.A., which opened in 1989. It has batting cages, pool and billiard tables, a virtual reality baseball game and a children's playground with rides.
"Our market is primarily young kids," said Jack Stahl, general manager. He added that professional ball players also come by to work out. "We get a lot of professional baseball players," he said. Mike Torres, a former New York Yankee, and Anthony Mason, the New York Knicks basketball player, have both been in to use the batting cages, Mr. Stahl said.
Directly beneath Sportime U.S.A. is Elmsford Raceway, formerly the lone recreational facility in the area. Offering model-car racing on tracks, it has been in business since 1966.
MR. CHANG said he's pleased about the addition of the ice-skating rinks. "We're the anchor of what's becoming a recreational center," he said, referring to his driving range. "Our whole concept is family entertainment, and the rinks will certainly help bring more families to the area."
The 80-acre Fairview Corporate Park is also home to several industrial concerns, such as a Coca-Cola bottling plant and a Federal Express sorting operation. "Out of the 80 acres, 17 are still available for development," said Mr. King of Baker Properties.
Fittingly, the corporate park's property was the Fairview Country Club as recently as the 60's, when it was converted to a light-industrial park, Mr. King said. Baker Properties purchased the park in 1985, "just when the whole economy changed," he added.
"In a different economic climate," Mr. King said, "the first choice would be to build office buildings in the park. But with the market in Westchester as it is now, that's not a good choice."
In contrast, the rinks represent little risk, Mr. King said. "This is a terrific use and a great addition to the park," he said. "It's not a speculative use. There's a real demand for this facility."
There are already four public rinks in Westchester -- the indoor Hommocks Park Ice Rink in Mamaroneck and Playland Ice Casino in Rye (the practice rink for the New York Rangers) and the outdoor Ebersole Ice Rink in White Plains and E.J. Murray Skating Center in Yonkers.
The two new rinks will be 85 by 200 feet, less that the Olympic size 100 by 200 feet. "These rinks will allow for the expansion of local school teams and allow other leagues to form," Mr. King said.
As any hockey parent knows, getting a child to practice can mean predawn excursions to get precious ice time. Older players are often relegated to playing at midnight.
According to USA Hockey, the national governing body for ice hockey, 24,555 teams registered with the organization during the 1994-1995 season, compared with 14,962 teams in 1990-1991, an increase of 64 percent.
"This is one project that if it didn't get approved people in town would have killed me," Mr. Feiner said. "Since I've been supervisor, this is the most excited I've been about a project. This is something that children, teen-agers and adults can enjoy."
In better times, such a project might even have been attempted by the town itself, he said. "With reduced revenues, this a way for the town to have recreation and improvement along the 9A corridor with no cost to the taxpayer."
OTHER towns in Westchester are equally enthusiastic about the addition of ice-skating rinks. Linda Puglisi, supervisor of the town of Cortland, has been trying to persuade the National Hockey League to build an ice-skating complex in her town.
According to Ms. Puglisi, the league has been looking for sites to build an Olympic-size ice skating rink, an N.H.L.-size rink and a roller-hockey rink. It has been in touch with her about a possible site in Sprout Brook Park. In addition, she recently wrote to the league recommending three privately owned sites on Route 9A, near the soon-to-be-built Cortlandt train station, and two on Route 6. Each site is at least 10 acres, she said. "They need at least 8 to 10 acres for what they have in mind."
According to Ms. Puglisi, the N.H.L. wants the complex for children's hockey leagues, professional hockey exhibitions, figure skating, lessons and a building for Rollerblade skating. "Their main purpose is to encourage youngsters to get into hockey," she said.
In addition, the town hopes to build a new rink near the 404,235-square-foot Cortlandt Town Center shopping complex proposed in Mohegan.
Ms. Puglisi asked the developer, CBL & Associates Properties of Chattanooga, Tenn., to set aside one acre for the town's use. "Our recreation committee advised us that an ice-skating rink would be the best use," she said.

HEADLINE: The Princess and a Plea: More Money

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
ON the day Lady Diana Spencer married into the House of Windsor in 1981, her good fortune appeared to be boundless. Hardly out of her teens, she decommissioned the world's foremost bachelor and signed on to produce the next heir of a monarchy whose wealth is conservatively estimated at more than $8 billion. Fifteen years later, her divorce nearly a fait accompli, the Princess of Wales faces a reversal of fortune.
British newspapers report that Princess Diana is to receive $22.5 million, enough to generate $1 million a year for life, with annual increases to cover inflation, plus a castle and staff. While that sum might be princely for commoners, compared to the settlements of other people who married into great wealth and then divorced, hers averages $1.6 million for each year of marriage. Her ex-Prince Charming looks like a piker. 
 But British law protects Charles's assets with a so-called "millionaire's law," which enables a wealthy spouse to make a cheap divorce settlement, unlike American law, which embodies the concept of shared wealth. His sister-in-law, the Duchess of York, is yet to divorce her husband, Andrew, although it is reported that she and her daughters will get a lump sum of $3 million, two-thirds to go into a trust fund for the girls, plus tuition and about $37,000 in yearly maintenance.
Princess Diana can only dream about divorce American style. Consider the settlement obtained by Amy Irving, the actress. She reportedly received close to $100 million for her marriage to Steven Spielberg, which last less than three and a half years -- or about 18 times as much, per year of marriage, as Princess Diana stands to receive.
In a country that is settlement friendly in marital law, California, the home of community property, is the promised land. Frank Swertlow, a "Hard Copy" correspondent who follows the money of film industry leaders, said a half dozen divorces involving movie stars and directors in the past year have produced settlements bigger than Princess Diana's. "The best way to make money is a good Hollywood divorce," Mr. Swertlow said.
Kevin Costner's wife, Cindy, reportedly is seeking $40 million from him after 16 years of marriage. Tom Arnold is getting "millions and millions and millions," says Roseanne, his former wife of four years.
The Princess, however, did better than Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager convicted of insider trading. After almost 30 years of marriage to his wife, Seema Silberstein, a hotel heiress, Mr. Boesky received a mansion worth $2.5 million, $180,000 a year for life plus a lump sum of $20 million. The lump works out to $689,000 per year of marriage, or less than half what Princess Diana expects for each year of hers.
Raoul Felder, a Manhattan divorce lawyer who specializes in divorces of the rich and famous, said he was surprised at the paltry terms of the royal divorce. "Princess Di gets a castle and staff and so forth," Mr. Felder said, "but the cash is not very much considering her bills, which include $250,000 a year for clothing."
Mr. Felder said he would have expected a settlement more in line with what Patricia Kluge received in 1991 when her marriage to John W. Kluge ended after nine years. At the time Forbes magazine ranked Mr. Kluge as the richest American, with a net worth of $5.2 billion.
Mrs. Kluge received a 45-room Georgian mansion on 9.9 acres, surrounded by Mr. Kluge's 10,000-acre farm near Charlottesville, Va., and $1 billion. Invested very conservatively in 30-year Treasury bonds, that sum would throw off $66 million a year at current interest rates, giving Mrs. Kluge a far more comfortable annual income than the Princess will have.
Such payment streams are common in cases where one partner has much more money than the other, said Kathleen Miller, a financial planner in Bellevue, Wash., who has helped more than 2,000 men and women negotiate divorce settlements. Mrs. Miller, the author of "Fair Share Divorce for Women" (Miller Advisors, 1995), said that when the Princess began leaking details of her marriage and giving a television interview about her life with Price Charles "she was negotiating the business terms of their divorce."
Threats of disclosure often produce more money, Mrs. Miller said.
If that was Princess Diana's intention, her strategy appears to have produced a relatively modest payoff. But then again, if one of her sons becomes king, all bets may be off.

 CORRECTION:
A table last Sunday with an article about a divorce settlement for the Princess of Wales misstated the data for Frances and Norman Lear. They were married 28 years, not 19; her $100 million award translated into $3.6 million, not $5.3 million, for each year of marriage.

HEADLINE: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: CHOOSING SIDES

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
PHAT X. CHIEM UNDERSTOOD well why many of his fellow Vietnamese-american students on the University of California's campus here opposed affirmative action.
 
 In 1979, he fled Saigon with his mother. Like tens of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees, they settled in Orange County, living in Costa Mesa, just a quick drive up the freeway from Irvine. When it came time for college, Mr. Chiem's high schools grades were good enough to get him into U.C.L.A. But given the limits of his mother's wages as a factory worker, and the expense of living in Los Angeles, Mr. Chiem decided instead to stay home and commute to Irvine.
 Many in his old circle of high school friends - strictly other Vietnamese-Americans - also enrolled at school. And they hoped that by the spring of 1998, when the University of California has said it will stop using race as a factor in admissions for African-American, Hispanic and American Indian applicants, the acceptance odds would rise for Asian-Americans like them.
 But at Irvine, Mr. Chiem made a second group of friends through his work on the campus newspaper. Most of them were whites. He quit the pre-med track to major in English. He spent the next few years covering the campus's different racial and ethnic groups, and spent summers in Fresno and Seattle as a reporting intern. By last year when he was elected editor in chief of the paper, The New University, Mr. Chiem's view of community had changed. And so had his views on affirmative action.
 "Will Vietnamese-Americans benefit by the elimination of affirmative action?" said Mr. Chiem, now 21 and a senior, as he sat in a tree-lined plaza next tot he main library. "Yes, I think so. But my concern is, are we then going to have a campus that's all Asian-American and white? When you have a campus where the population of African-Americans is 2 percent, it's hard to say we should eliminate affirmative action to increase the number of Asian-Americans."
 Many Asian-Americans have found themselves torn over the ban on affirmative action at the nation's leading state-run university system. Last July, under pressure from Gov. Pete Wilson,t he Board of Regents decided that the new admission policies would focus on academic achievement but would still allow the nine campuses to consider the impact of an applicant's dis-advantaged economic background.
 The new criteria are expected to boost the number of Asian-Americans, who generally have the highest grades and test scores of any racial group, and to hurt African-American and Hispanic applicants.
 Binh Nguyen, 21, has been Mr. Chiem's best friend since they were 12. Mr. Nguyen admired his friend's individualism and the ease with which he moved in mainstream campus life. Mr. Nguyen's family, who arrived in the United States from Saigon in 1975, considered the medical profession the ideal, safest road to success in America. So an older sister graduated from George Washington University medical school, and an older brother is studying medicine at U.C.L.A.
 At Irvine, Mr. Nguyen was planning to be a fifth-year senior next year to boost his 3.4 grade-point average before applying to medical school. He was worried that for an Asian-American like him, getting into a University of California medical school would be hard. He also worried for Khang Lai and Nhat Tran, friends of his and Mr. Chiem's, who were applying to medical school this year and whose G.P.A.'s were higher than his own.
 "Without affirmative action, it would help me to get into med school," Mr. Nguyen said. "Affirmative action is kind of needed, but for me as an applicant, I would personally not support it. I would look at affirmative action more on an individual basis, how if affects me, rather than how it affects other minority groups. I wouldn't think how it affects all Asians. I wouldn't think that big. I would extend it to my friends. I would say Khang and Naht are qualified. And if they didn't get in and they're qualified, I would be bummed."
 For Asian-Americans the issue often comes down to this: Do they look out for their own interests? Or do they broaden their sense of community to include the interests of African-Americans and Hispanics? It is a particularly difficult question for what continues to be a largely immigrant population, already split along ethnic, generational, linguistic and income lines.
 AT one end are Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans who have been in the United States for a century and whose income and educational levels are above the national average. At the other economic end are Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians who came ias refugees in the 1970's and 1980's; many of them are illiterate in their own language. In the vast middle: the Chinese, Koreans, Indians, Filipinos, many of them professional, who have come to the United States since 1965. The difference in opinions over affirmative action can also be heard at the dinner table: between the parent who mixes only with fellow immigrants and the child who attends a college with a diverse student body.
 And while Asians are not the only minority immigrant group in this country with such divisions, their disproportionately high numbers in higher edcuation and their resulting exclusion from the race-based affirmative action initiatives do serve to put them in a special position. Many believe that Asian-Americans' potential political strength is weakened by their internal divisions.
 "Even at Berkeley, Asian-Americans are apthetic or disagree with one another," said Justin Fong, 21, a junion who has organized building takeovers to fight for affirmative action. "It's very difficult to get anthing done."
 The issue of affirmative action in California is further complicated by the California Civil Rights Initiative, a proposed state amendment that would ban race-based affirmative action in government hiring and contracting. The state will vote on it in November.
 "We recognize the problem with the U.C. systme. Now we're being excluded because of affirmative action," said Charles Kim, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Korean-American coalition, which, like other Asian-American civil rights organizations, is fighting the amendment. "But at this point, affirmative action is one way to achieve social and economic equiality. At this point, for example, if you take a look at the managerial level, we're severely underrepresented."
 In the 1980's, education seemed to be the one issue that did unify Asian-Americans.
 Congress lifted stringent quotas on immigration from Asia and Latin American in 1965 and gave preference to immigrants closely related to citizens. Their numbers increased so much that they now represent the largest groups of foreign-born residents in this country. By the late 1980's, many children of those post-1965 Asian immigrants had reached college age and were becoming a growing share of the student populations at mnay of the nation's elite universities.
 At the time, many Asian-American academics and advocates charged that institutions like Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard and Brown were informally capping the number of Asian-Americans they admitted. The universities, advocates said, were re-erecting the unofficial quotas that two generations earlier had kept the gorwing number of qualified Jews from their campuses. The universitites largely denied these accusations, arguing instead that Asian applicants tended to be concentrated in the sciences and tended not to be the offspring of alumni.
 Between 1988 and 1995, 16 out of 40 of the complaints filed with the Department of Education involving Asian-Americans and admissions at colleges or universities resulted in decisions favoring the complainant, according to a report by the United States General Accounting Office released in December. That proportion was far higher than for any other racial group.
 Today, many Asian-Americans say that it is the affirmative action policies at public institutions like the University of California that perpetuate the practice of denying them educational opportunities they have rightly won.
 "When I was young, I had hard time getting things because I was Japanese, and now it's the other way around," said S. Stephen Nakashima, 73, a University of California Regent who voted to ban race-based affirmative action. "You're Japanese, you're doing well, and they won't accpet you."
 "Back then," Mr. Nakashima said, referring to American society before addirmative action policies was created in the 1960's, "the discrimination was against Asians, blacks and Chicanos. Now it's against the whites and Asians."
 The Supreme Court decided last May that race-based scholarships were unconstitutional. In January, Colorado began giving out only class-based scholarships. University systems in several states also are reviewing how they grant scholarships. And Arizona's state university system is considering eliminating race as a factor in it admissions.
 But it is in California, home to 40 percent of the nation's 774,000 Asian-American college and university students in 1994 (New York was a distant second with 8 percent), that Asian-Americans must navigate affirative action's politically treacherous waters.
 Although Asian-Americans are only 10 percent of California's population, they make up about a third of the undergraduates in the state system. They are the largest racial group at Irvine, Riverside and the system's two most competitive universities, U.C.L.A. and Berkeley. And in city college systems and in community colleges across the state, they make up a disproportionately high score of the student population. Event he percentage of Asian faculty, which is only about 4 percent throughout the country, according to the United States Department of Education, is about 20 percent in the University of California.
 Worried about the effects of the end of affirmative action, many educators are groping for ways to maintain the racial diversity of their campuses. Berkeley's Chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, a Chinese-American, is the only Asian-American head of a U.C. campus. (See Related essay on Page 30.) Chancellor Tien, who opposes the ban on affirmative action, said his university has pledged $1 million annually over five years to help disadvantaged youths from the San francisco area's major urban school districts qualify for entrance.
 . . .
 AT IRVINE, the university's unusual racial mix has spawned nicknames that, depending on who tells the joke, can be self-mocking or resentful. What does U.C.I. stand for? "The University of Chinese Immigrants" or "The University of Civics and Integras," after the Hondas and Acuras that are the favorite cars of many Asian-Americans on campus.
 A Waylkway near the student center is plastered with a poster in Korean and English, announcing a sports match between a Korean-American students' association for those who speak Korean and a Korean-American association for those who do not. Inside the food court, students can order Chinese food and sushi. The food court also is a favorite hangout for many members of the five Asian sororities and fraternities, while the tables just outside are popular among those how belong to white Greek societies. Unaffiliated Asian-Americans are partial to the cafe.
 Yet there also is a cross-cultural center on campus housing three umbrella groups whose purpose is to unify African-American, Hispanic and Asian-American students. And there is mixing of students even in the carings on a tree. On a eucalyptus behind the plaza, a heart is carved with "Jenn & Thanh," the latter being a Vietnamese male name; next to it are the Vietnamese and English names of two women, "Xuan & Marla."
 Not too long ago, Michelle Tsui was flipping through old family albums and recognized several photos of herself - at age 1 - in front of Irvine's main library. She realized that her parents, among the first wave of Chinese immigrants to move to Orange County just as U.C. Irvine was founded in 1965, had clear intentions.
 "My parents visited the campus because even back then they wanted me to study here," said Ms. Tsui, 22, who last year became the first Asian-American to be elected president of U.C. Irvine's student government.
 Manuel N. Gomez, now a vice chancellor who has been at Irvine since 1972, said many Asian immigrant families, like Ms. Tsui's gravitated to Orange County because of the university.
 The racial makeup of the campus reflects in part the change in Orange County over the last two decades from largely white population to one with one of the most diverse conentrations of Asian immigrants. Sarting in the early 1970's, Chinese immigrants settled throughout the area, followed by Vietnamese refugees and Korean immigrants, who eventually built a Little Saigon and a Koreatown in the cities of Garden Grove and Westminster. Irvine is also just 50 miles south of Los Angeles's population of both recent and more established Asian-American gorups.
 Phuong Pham, 22, a senior who heads a Vietnamese-American students organization, said she is a minority among Vietnamese-Americans in supporting affirmative action. Even though she came to this country only in 1982, after spending her early childhood in Saigon, where she and her mother sold matches on the street to support themselves, Ms. Pham said she does not share what she described as her fellow Vietnamese-Americans' narrow view of community.
 "They tell me, 'We came here with almost no English and we've worked hard to be proficient. We're on survival mode. So how can we think of other groups?' " Ms. Pham said. "I tell them, 'now that you're proficient in English, stop being selfish and work with other groups. You should go beyond survival mode.' "
 Sunny Lee, 22, immigrated from South Korea at the age of 6 and grew up in largely white community in San Bernardino. Drawn to Irvine's large Asian-American population, she was surprised to discover others with the same length and style of hair, and a few with the same length and style of hair, and a few with the same first and last name as hers. But perhaps most surprising, she said, was learning about the deep divisions among Irvine's Asian-American students.
 Because of Irvine's large immigrant population, the Asian-American students' varying levels of assimilation was one such divide, ranging from those who were "fresh off the boat" to those who were so "white-washed," she said, that they joined Irvine's white fraternities and sororities, instead of the Asian ones.
 To bridge those divides, Ms. Lee is the social chair-woman of the Asian/Pacific Student Association, an umbrella group for 19 of the campus's Asian-American organizations. The association considers itself nonpolitical, although its officers support affirmative action.
 "This alliance was created in 1984 so that the heads of the organizations would know what the others were doing," she said, "but it's difficult."
 Perhaps because the Asian-Americans on campus are politically disorganized or undecided about affirmative action, Irvine has not experienced the protests over its elimination like those at U.C.L.A. or Berkeley. In the fall, a small group of Hispanic students at Irvine, supported by advocates from off campus, held a hunger strike. But the strikers ended up attracting little support among Asian-American students, many of whom said they felt alienated by the strikers' extremism.
 On a recent evening, about 60 people gathered at the cross-cultural center to listen to Ms. Lee and other Asian-American student leaders talk at a meeting for the Asian/Pacific Student Association. The messages were hardly political, but he underlying attempt at unity was clear. Students stood and explained what their organizations were doing, inviting others to functions. Four groups lobbied for membership in the umbrella organization.
 The next day, Stephanie Essig, 21, a black biology major from Oakland who was sitting in the African-American student union at the cross-cultural center, said she was surprised at the Asian-Americans' political disunity. "Thye have the potential to be so politically powerful on this campus," she said.
 For her, she said, life would be the same if she were on a campus with 53 percent whites. What mattered was the small number of other African-American students. Despite her 3.7 grade point average at a Cathloc high school and her score of 1,200 out of 1,600 on her Scholastic Assessment Test, she thought white and Asian-American students viewed her a having slipped into Irvine because of affirmative action.
 .. .
 AND THEN THERE are the Regents. It was Ward Connerly, an African-American businessman and Regent who proposed the July vote banning affirmative action in admissions. Mr. Nakashima, joined by the other Asian-American Regent, David Lee, a Chinese-American, voted with Mr. Connerly. Mr. Lee has spoken little about his decision. Not so Mr. Nakashima.
 Because of his Japanese ancestry, Mr. Nakashima was interned in a United States Government camp during World War II. He graduated from Berkeley in 1948 and began seeking jobs as a certified public accountant. Companies, he recalled, refused to hire him. And so Mr. Nakashima went to Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.. Eventually he built a successful law practice in San Jose, and in 1989 he was appointed to the University of California's Board of Regents by former Gov. George Deukmejian.
 Mr. Nakashima said the new admission policies will concentrate Asian-Americans at Berkeley and U.C.L.A. and shift African-American and Hispanic students to the other campuses.
 "The young black and Chicano students should enter the rights schools," said Mr. Nakashima, whose children and grandchildren also attended the state's public universities. "If a young black student gets into Berkeley or U.C.L.A. and has a 3.4 average, and has to compete against 4.0's, what is he going to do? He can't compete."
 The University of California guarantees a place at one of its campuses to the top 12.5 percent of high school seniors int he state. But although 13 percent of whites, 5 percent of African-American seniors and 4 percent of Hipsanic students qualified in 1990, 32 percent of Asians-Americans did. The data, which the state collects twice a decade, are expected to show a further rise in qualifying Asian-Americans for 1995.
 Starting for the spring enrollment of 1998, grades and scores on the S.A.T. test alone will determine 50 to 75 percent of students accepted, compared with the current levels of 40 to 60 percent. For the remaining slots, admission officers will instead weight an applicant's socioeconomic background.
 An internal report in May 1995, based on a computer simulation, predicted that such a change would result in a 15 to 25 percent overall rise of Asian-Americans at the University of California, and as much as 25 to 35 percent increase at Berkeley and U.C.L.A., where 75 percent of students would be admitted on merit. The number of whites would remain about the same, but Hispanic students would dip 5 to 15 percent and African-Americans would drop somewhere between 40 and 50 percent.
 The report acknowledges that the outcome may not be so stark. But it is clear, said Terry Colvin, a spokesman for the university of California, that the new policy will boost Asian-American enrollment.
 Lance T. Izumi, a fellow at the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute who testified at the hearings before the Board of Regents' decision in July, said the current race-based policies especially harm newer Asian-American group. The newer groups, like Vietnamese or Cambodians, are lumped in with more affluent Asian-Americans who, if rejected at a public university, can arfford to turn elsewhere, said Mr. Izumi, 37, whose grandparents came from Japan.
 In a study of the acceptance rates of 519 U.C. Irvine students who applied to the University of California's five medical schools in 1993, the Pacific Research Institute found that black and some Hispanic applicants were admitted at more than twice the rate of Vietnamese-American applicants whose grades were higher. The Vietnamese-Americans were excluded from the race-based affirmative action policies, even though 49 out of the 107 Vietnamese-American applicants were considered economically disadvantaged. The study found that other Asian groups were also admitted at lower rates.
Because Asian-Americans of all economic levels often are able to compete academically, Mr. Izumi said, only true competition, will benefit them.
 A recent ruling by a Federal appeals court overturning the affirmative-action program at the University of Texas School of Law also argued for such competition, saying that the school failed to show justification for giving preference to some races.
JERRY KANG believes that affirmative action produces more pluses than minuses for society.
 Mr. Kang was born in South Korea and grew up near Chicago. He went to Harvard as an undergraduate and also studied law there. Now 27, and an acting law professor at U.C.L.A., he has written law articles on affirmative action. Simply put, he supports it.
 "I usually explain that all people of color have benefited from the civil rights movement," he said. "Then I explain why affirmative action can be good for the future. Different races rubbing shoulders, that's good. If someone's going to be less racist to blacks, then they're going to be less racist toward Asian-Americans. But it's difficult, especially with immigrant parents who don't even think in those terms. In Korean culture, there tends to be a belief that if you don't succeed, it's your fault."
Polls show Asian-Americans in California split down the middle on affirmative action. Like at Irvine, their internal divisions have weakened their political influence.
 Nationally, the most outspoken and ardent supporters of affirmative action often might be Chinese-American and Japanese-American academics, who were born in the United States and went to college during the 1960's or 1970's. As heads of organizations, they become spokesmen for the largely politically unorganized Asian-American population. As teachers, they become advisers to students on campuses.
But their critics argue that they represent a privileged class out of touch with the needs of recent arrivals. According to the Washington-based Urban Institute, 66 percent of the 7.3 million Asian-Americans in this country were born overseas.
"The academics and activists are stuck in the 1960's and don't represent the views of most Asian-Americans," said Arthur Hu, a Chinese-American computer software engineer in Seattle, who neccessary info?keeps a home page on the Internet's World Wide Web to expound on his opposition to anti-affirmative action views.
 Mr. Hu, 37, graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981. He set up the page (http://www.halcyon.com/arthurhu) in October, out of his home office, which is lined with bookshelves jammed with articles on affirmative action and books on Asian-Americans. Since the fall, Mr. Hu said he has received about three to four E-mail messages a week, many of them from Asian-Americans who told him they were glad to hear a conservative Asian-American voice.
 In San Francisco, a group of Chinese families, most of them immigrants, is suing the school district, which had capped at 40 percent the share of Chinese-American students allowed to enroll at its most prestigious school, Lowell High School. The district also imposed a higher cut-off on the entrance exams for the Chinese, while allowing lower qualifying marks for whites, other Asians, blacks and Hispanics.
 In February, the school district set the same cut-off on entrance exams for 80 percent of all students, but still kept the 40 percent cap for any one ethnic group. Chinese students now are slightly over that cap. For the remaining 20 percent, an applicant's socioeconomically disadvantaged background, as well as other factors, are considered.
Lee Cheng, a 24-year-old Chinese-American student at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, who attended Lowell before going to Harvard, is among those representing the Chinese families.
 The lawsuit seeks to abolish the quotas, which were set up in 1982 following a lawsuit by the San Francisco chapter of of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Opponents of the change, including some Asian-Americans, say that the elimination of the current policy would turn Lowell into a virtually all-Chinese school.
"Typically, the Asian-American opponents of school reform tend to be English-speaking only, recipients of quote-unquote higher education," said Mr. Cheng, who was born in San Francisco but returned to Taiwan with his family for some years. When the family returned from Taiwan, they settled in Pacifica, a blue-collar suburb of San Francisco. His mother now works as an accountant; his father as a librarian. Mr. Cheng recalls frequently being beat up by white peers who called him "Chinaman."
 "I don't really see them being representatives of Asian-Americans who are recent immigrants," he said of Asian-American academics and activists who support affirmative action. "It's unfortunate they tend to speak English more because the press jumps to them as spokesmen."
 Almost all of the national Asian-American civil rights organizations publicly support race-based affirmative action, but admit that they do not have the grass-roots support that their African-American and Hispanic counterparts do.
The Organization of Chinese Americans, a lobbying group headquartered in Washington and founded in 1973, endorsed affirmative action in higher education. But it has refrained from taking a position in the Lowell High School case, even though the San Francisco chapter is supportive of the Chinese families.
 The Lowell case, said Daphne Kwok, the group's executive director, is "one of the most emotional and divisive issues in the organization's history."
 Asian-American advocates for affirmative action say that it is precisely this disunity that threatens their long-term success in a state with shrinking resources and in a national economy where a college degree is increasingly the only passport to a good job. If Asian-Americans account for a third of the students at the University of California but only 10 percent of the state's taxpayers, they say, the imbalance will result in an inevitable backlash.
 They also argue that white conservatives are using Asian-Americans to divide the country's racial minorities by pointing out that Asian-Americans have succeeded in education without affirmative action and by labeling them a model minority -- thereby indirectly criticizing blacks and Hispanics. Asian-Americans, they say, must building alliances with Hispanics and blacks to fight for equality on all levels of American society.
 Frank H. Wu, 28, a Chinese-American who grew up in Cleveland, last fall became the first Asian-American to teach at the law school of historically black Howard University. He took the position, he said, partly to show how Asian-Americans and black Americans could work together.
 "African-Americans and Asian-Americans have frequently come into contact with each other in situations of conflict," Mr. Wu said. "But it doesn't have to be that way. African- Americans and Asian-Americans have a common interest in fighting racism."
In some ways, Lillian Galedo, executive director of the Berkeley-based Filipinos for Affirmative Action, echoed those sentiments.
 "A lot depends on whether you view yourself as a citizen of the whole "or whether you just view yourself as an individual, and you're looking out for your own interests, your family and the relatives you're supporting back home."
Filipino immigrants, she said, who are about 65 to 70 percent of the Filipino-Americans in the United States, tended to view affirmative action as harmful to their interests. But the American-born Filipino-Americans, aware of the country's racial history, could identify with blacks and Hispanics, and understood affirmative action's intent of creating a balanced society.
Beyond education, those who oppose anti-affirmative action advocates, like Mr. Izumi from the Pacific Research Institute, argue that Asian-Americans are underrepresented at higher levels of many companies because their numbers in the United States have increased significantly only in the last two decades. He and others say that Asian-Americans' success in education ultimately will be enough to lead to a similar one in the workplace.
 But Asian-American proponents of affirmative action point to Marcy Li Wang as evidence that, except for their success in being admitted to colleges, Asian-Americans need more than time to achieve equality in the workplace. And higher education is a key area.
 Ms. Wang was an assistant professor of architecture at Berkeley from 1979 to 1988. After she was denied tenure, she sued saying it was because she is a Chinese-American woman. In January, after a 10-year legal battle, Ms. Wang, 44, won a $1 million settlement from the university, which admitted no wrongdoing. Ms. Wang now works for a private architecture firm in Berkeley.
"A big complaint is that Asian academics do not speak English properly," said Ms. Wang, who was born in the United States. "But they have no problems hiring Europeans with heavy accents. That's considered charming."
 Although Asian-Americans held about 20 percent of the academic positions in the University of California in the fall of 1994, they made up only about 4 percent of faculty members at colleges and universities nationwide in the 1993-1994 academic year.
 Early this month, at a conference in San Francisco sponsored by the Asian and Pacific Americans in Higher Education, about 500 academics and students (the largest gathering in the organization's nine-year history) spent three days discussing everything from Filipino-Americans at Berkeley, to the state of community colleges in California , and Asian-American and student activism.
 Many of the participants raised the paradox of Asian-Americans' success in education: many numbers but little influence.
 Ling-Chi Wang (no relation to Ms. Wang), an Asian-American studies professor at Berkeley who organized the conference, said that Asian-American students, once in college, receive fewer services, including everything from counseling to curriculum. For example, he said, the lack of Asian-American studies courses, especially in colleges outside the West Coast, was a glaring example of how Asian-American students were being treated unequally in higher education. Even though the number of Asian-American students at Ivy League universities is about twice the number of black students, he said, places like Harvard and Princeton offered strong programs in African-American studies but often not a single course in Asian-American studies.
 There are signs that things are changing, he said.
 Some universities on the East Cost are hiring or seeking their first faculty member in Asian-American studies partly because coalitions of Asian-American, Hispanic and black students in the last year held sit-ins and protests aton several campuses, including at Princeton and Columbia, demanding courses and faculty in ethnic studies.
 Some argue that i's only the first step.
 Herbert Yamanishi, 52, the executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, the oldest Asian civil rights organization in the country, said that Asian-Americans' cultural reverence forof education often blinds them to the real goal of equality in the rest of society.
"The one thing we need to understand in America," Mr. Yamanishi said, "is that pure academic success does not mean success in America."

HEADLINE: Queens Old-Timers Uneasy As Asian Influence Grows

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Ethel Chen, considering a run for the New York City Council, sat in her office above the teeming Asian hub of Flushing, counting the Chous, Hsiehs and Lins on the voter rolls. Blocks away, Chun Soo Pyun, a potential candidate for the same seat, was tallying the Kims, Choys and Rhees.
Mrs. Chen, who is Chinese-American and a Democrat, and Mr. Pyun, who is Korean-American and a Republican, found many of their compatriots in the voter registry -- double the number there just five years ago, but far from enough for a victory built on Asian-American votes alone. "If I run with Giuliani," said Mr. Pyun, eyeing an alliance with the Republican Mayor, "I might get some pretty good coattails there." 
 Both Mrs. Chen and Mr. Pyun are among the aspiring politicians looking to break through the barriers that have kept Asians, the city's fastest-growing immigrant group, from attaining political office. Their struggle is especially fierce in Flushing, the city's leading magnet for Asian immigrants, whose longtime Councilwoman, Julia Harrison, is sometimes hostile in her remarks about the immigrants and where many longtime residents are quick to express unease about them.
When Mrs. Harrison, 75, describes what Asian immigrants have meant to Flushing over the last decade, she talks about criminal smugglers and Asian robbers. ("I don't know if they're Korean or Chinese," she said. "I can't tell by the name.") She talks about rude merchants and illegal aliens who depress the wages of American working people.
Her discomfort with the new immigrants reflects that of many of her elderly white constituents, who say they have come to feel increasingly out of place in their own neighborhood as growing numbers of Asian-Americans have settled there, speaking languages the old-timers don't understand and selling foods they have never tasted.
Mrs. Harrison's comments would be less surprising in California, epicenter of the backlash against immigrants, than in New York, which prides itself on welcoming them. She said in an interview that the sudden and transforming arrival of Asian-American businesses -- which city planners and immigration experts say revitalized a declining Flushing in the 1980's -- was "an invasion, not an assimilation."
Those new immigrants, she said, were not like her grandfather, who arrived hungry at Ellis Island early in the century from Transylvania. "They did not come because of a potato famine or because some czar was conducting a pogrom," she said. "They were more like colonizers than immigrants. They sure as hell had a lot of money, and they sure as hell knew how to buy property and jack up rents of retail shops and drive people out."
She added, "The money came first. The paupers followed, smuggled in and bilked by their own kind."
Many politically active Asian-Americans chose their words gingerly when discussing the Councilwoman, who, solidly entrenched in Flushing, got her start in politics there organizing for Eugene J. McCarthy's Presidential run in 1968. But Pauline Chu, who is president of the Chinese-American Parents Association in Flushing and who lost a race to Mrs. Harrison in 1991, is more open.
"She never supported us in this area," Mrs. Chu said. "She should bridge the gap and make peace. We are here. We're hard-working. We pay taxes. Why don't we deserve the right? If smart politicians don't take care of us, later on they'll be sorry. Eventually, we'll be in power. Her voters are aging. Asians are growing and becoming voters."
 
Still a Minority, For a While, at Least
More and more of the Asian-Americans in Flushing are indeed becoming voters -- a trend that will only gain momentum over the next two years as a huge bubble of citizenship seekers become Americans.
Even so, they are still very much in the minority. In the 20th Council District in 1990, almost one-third of the residents, but only 6.7 percent of registered voters, were of Asian origin. Five years later, after an influx of thousands more Asian immigrants, the Asian-American share of registered voters is 12.3 percent, according to Marc Lapidus, a political consultant who was research coordinator for the City Districting Commission in 1991.
The barriers to Asian-American political power in New York and across the nation are formidable. While the first Dominican-born and Jamaican-born Council members were elected in 1991, no Asian-American in the city has ever been elected to the Council, the State Assembly, the State Senate or the United States Congress.
Several factors have conspired to undermine the political clout of the Asian-American population: ethnic heterogeneity; low voter registration rates; a large percentage of registered independents, who are therefore unable to vote in contested party primaries, and the absorption of many would-be voters in the all-consuming struggle to survive economically.
Nevertheless, the sheer magnitude of the Asian influx has the potential to break down barriers in coming years. By 2000, 1 in 10 New Yorkers, and almost 1 in 5 Queens residents, will be of Asian origin, city planners estimate.
Flushing is emblematic of the change. Once a destination for whites of various ethnic backgrounds, it is home to an ever-growing concentration of Taiwanese, Koreans and Indians. The thronged immigrant marketplaces are lined with shops that spill out onto the sidewalks, selling crabs, carp, Chinese long beans and bok choy.
 
Unfamiliar Ways 'Don't Sit Well'
But the growth of the Asian community in Flushing, part of the urban life cycle that has played out ceaselessly over the city's immigrant history, is proving painful, even traumatic, for many elderly white voters, who reared their children in Flushing and once regarded it as theirs -- and who still make up one-quarter of the district's voters.
Rose Wierzbicki, 65, and her husband, Gedda, 79, miss the idle conversation they used to have with the kosher butcher and the shopkeeper who made them pastrami sandwiches. Jack Rubin, 81, says he is uncomfortable going into Asian stores. "Everything is changing," he said.
As Mrs. Harrison put it, "It's very discombobulating, very upsetting. We all recognize that change is part of life, but it doesn't sit well."
The old-timers' feelings of displacement often center on the Asian marketplaces, where the shelves are lined with jars of unfamiliar condiments and the vegetable bins are filled with fare they see as exotic.
In the late 1980's, Mrs. Harrison proposed an ordinance to require shopkeepers to post signs in English as well as their native languages. But she stopped pushing the measure when she found out that a similar law had been passed in 1905, during an earlier wave of immigration.
"I was perceived as anti-Asian, a bigot," she said. "I was trying to soothe the way for the community integrating."
Mrs. Harrison drives to the Waldbaum's in College Point to do her grocery shopping. On a recent walk in downtown Flushing, she paused at a greengrocer's and sniffed a bunch of Chinese broccoli covered with delicate yellow buds. "I think it's dandelion," she said. She examined a star fruit and asked, "What is this? Papaya?"
The Councilwoman does not seem to worry too much about how many Asian-American or immigrant votes she wins, though half the population of her district is foreign-born. Asked who goes to the polls, she said, "The little old men and ladies in walkers and wheelchairs, and that's the truth."
The clash between the old and the new Flushing is reflected in bread-and-butter political issues. Mrs. Harrison opposed the construction of a state-of-the-art four-story library (the old one was perfectly adequate, she said) and of a new entrance to the Flushing No. 7 subway station (the changes would disrupt street traffic, she said). Mrs. Chen and Mr. Pyun strongly support both projects.
Neither issue is explicitly about immigration. But the subway is a lifeline to jobs for immigrants, and the library is a portal to learning and advancement. "These services have a very important role for immigrants," said Madhulika Khandelwal, a research historian at the Asian-American Center at Queens College. "If you're investing in these things, you're investing in the future."
Since 1991, Mrs. Harrison has had Chinese and Korean challengers; she has trounced them all. Her dominance has stirred divisions among politically active Asian-Americans in Flushing about how best to gain influence.
Augustine Chen, a physics professor at St. John's University and past president of the Chinese-American Voters Association in Flushing, said he decided in 1993 that the best chance was to gain Mrs. Harrison's confidence by working for her re-election. He did the tedious work of checking the signatures on Ethel Chen's petition lists, helping to knock her off the ballot in her campaign against Mrs. Harrison.
In retrospect, he said, he does not believe his strategy helped him win Mrs. Harrison's ear.
"I'm very disappointed," he said. "I worked very hard to support her. I stepped on many people's toes. It didn't pay off. She does not need to listen, because Asians do not have the votes. I cannot fault her. Most politicians are like this."
Mrs. Chen, 57, who retired last year after 25 years as a librarian with the New York Public Library and who was appointed a Democratic district leader at large in Queens by party regulars in 1993, is angry about what she sees as Mr. Chen's betrayal. "We call him a traitor to the community," she said. "When he walks, people spit on the floor."
"He wanted to go to the existing power," she added. "This is the wrong philosophy. I say this is a democratic system. We have to have competition."
 
Teaching the Value Of Voting Power
Many local Korean- and Chinese-American civic groups are trying to teach the immigrants about America's electoral process. They are gearing up to register voters once the weather warms up.
"Jewish people, especially seniors, do come out to vote," said Meilin Tan, a district leader for the Republican Party from Flushing. "Asians haven't yet learned to vote as a group. So the Jewish people have a bigger voice. We in the Republican Party have to strive to educate people."
Only about 20 percent of the citizens of Asian origin had registered to vote in 1995. This registration rate was by far the lowest for any ethnic group, according to the city's Voter Assistance Commission. In Queens, because so many Asians are not yet citizens, it meant that only about 4 percent of adults of Asian descent were registered voters in 1995.
And of those who are registered to vote, more than one-third pick no political party, compared with only one-fifth of all registered voters. This means, come primary time, that those voters would be unable to cast a ballot for Mrs. Chen even if they wanted to, further limiting her chances against Mrs. Harrison.
Mrs. Chen's volunteers have already addressed envelopes to the independent voters, whom she is asking to become Democrats.
At an even more basic level, the volunteers must often explain to immigrants why they need to register. In Taiwan, adults have only to go to the polls to vote, and until the last couple of years, there was no such thing as a party primary there.
By the numbers, Asian-American voting strength in the city is still weak, but the potential for geometric growth is there. Sol Nachemin, the 82-year-old son of Russian immigrants, takes the long view. He has lived in Flushing since 1954 and watched it change. His kind are dying out, he said, and the Asians' turn is coming, as inevitably as earlier immigrants had theirs.
"I got to tell you," he said, "I have a sneaking admiration for them. They're hard-working. They're good business people. At the library, I see all these Oriental kids sitting around the table doing their homework. It reminds me of the Jewish kids of my generation.
"I have no doubt. They'll start feeling their oats politically. And one of these days, you'll see a Korean or Chinese Councilman."

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 31 about the involvement of Asian immigrants in New York City politics misstated the percentage of adults of Asian descent in Queens who were registered to vote in 1995. It is 11.6 percent, according to the city's Voter Assistance Commission, not 4 percent.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
The City That Poor Richard Could Afford

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO

 BODY:
"IT is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time," wrote a green young Benjamin Franklin in 1726 on his return to Philadelphia after a brief stay in London. Taking a note from him, I found a thrifty way to get to the City of Brotherly Love in mid-January. I did it not by walking across New Jersey (as Franklin once did) or by buying a $60 off-peak, round-trip ticket on Amtrak, but by taking a New Jersey Transit train from Pennsylvania Station in New York; in Trenton, I transferred to an R7 Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority train to Suburban Station, in the heart of Philadelphia's Center City. The trip took two and a half hours, an hour longer than Amtrak would have. But the connection was easy and the off-peak round-trip ticket cost just $24.
I wouldn't call the trip through the junkyards and grim-looking neighborhoods north of Philadelphia scenic. Still, sitting by a rain-lashed window on the R7, I reasoned that there's a lot more to Philly than you can see from the train tracks -- like its orchestra, art museums, elegant squares and sites evoking some of the greatest moments in American history. Foul weather would trim the lines at the Liberty Bell, I hoped, and maybe flush out a few good off-season deals on meals, lodging and entertainment. 
 Ascending to street level at Suburban Station I found leftover banks of dirty snow, harried commuters and broken umbrellas that looked like butterflies on the sidewalks. The spacecraft-shaped Philadelphia Visitors Bureau lay just across 16th Street, so I stopped in and purchased five mass transit tokens for $1.15 each -- a good buy, since it costs $1.60 to take most buses if you pay in cash.
I boarded the No. 76 bus, a special tourist line that costs just 50 cents, passing Philadelphia's most marvelous architectural gewgaw, the much-embellished Second Empire City Hall at the intersection of Market and Broad Streets, with a 547-foot tower surmounted by a statue of William Penn -- the British Quaker who founded Philadelphia in 1682 -- by Alexander Milne Calder, grandfather of the modern sculptor.
At Liberty Bell Pavilion, a modernistic glass-walled structure with the great cracked bell inside, the bus jogged a block south to Chestnut Street. There I got a first glimpse of Independence Hall, where Thomas Jefferson's draft of the Declaration of Independence was passed by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and 11 years later George Washington, seated in a chair with a rising sun carved on its back, presided over the debate on a proposed Constitution.
The bus let me off in front of the Society Hill Hotel at Third and Chestnut Streets, an intersection surrounded by many of the three dozen buildings and sites that make up the 45-acre Independence National Historic Park. To the south lay the leafy lanes and dignified brick row houses of Society Hill, a bastion of power and wealth in the second half of the 18th century, when Philadelphia was the biggest and most important city in North America; to the north, Old City's coffee bars, galleries and nightclubs, lining narrow cobblestone alleys seemingly cut from the same pattern as those in the City of London; and to the east the Delaware River.
This was just where I wanted to be, though I had to reconcile myself to paying for the central location. Several weeks earlier I had called hotels in the neighborhood, finding even the special weekend rates offered for doubles by the Omni at Independence Park ($115) and the Society Hill Sheraton ($103) too rich for my blood. The least expensive room I could find in the immediate area was a single for $85 (including breakfast) at the Society Hill Hotel, with 12 rooms above a popular restaurant. So I booked it for two nights and planned to spend my last night at the Latham Hotel near ritzy Rittenhouse Square, which was offering a Holiday Saver rate of $89.
A waiter at the downstairs bar of the Society Hill Hotel checked me in, charged me for two nights in advance and gave me the key to room 307, which had nice green wallpaper, a fancily draped window and high ceilings, but was so small that the double bed took up most of the floor space. The size didn't bother me, though the bed's rickety headboard, closet's sticking door, and blackish-green splotches (mold, I assumed) on the tiled ceiling in the shower did. Still, lacking alternatives, I stayed. It was growing late, and I wanted to get to the box office of the Walnut Street Theater, about a seven-block walk west, where half-price tickets for Brian Friel's play "Philadelphia, Here I Come!" went on sale at 6 P.M. sharp.
Later, with a $14 theater ticket in my pocket, I ordered the satisfying $10.95 lobster dinner special at Ralph Jr.'s, a noisy, affable corner bar on Chestnut and Second Street and then washed the melted butter off my fingers before making my way back to the theater. The play was about a young Irishman with scores to settle at home before emigrating to Phildelphia, and the walls of the lobby were lined with pictures of performers who had played the old theater (founded in 1809), including one of a lovely ingenue named Helen Hayes. Afterward a nightcap seemed in order, so I ordered a Dewar's on the rocks, $5 with tip, at the bar on the ground floor of my hotel, listening in as a very candid bartender told the man next to me not to bother ordering the bean soup.
Nor, in the end, could I recommend the Society Hill Hotel. For one thing, the pipe beneath the sink in my bathroom leaked, and for another, halfway through the night a decorative metal ball fell off the headboard and hit me on the head when I rolled in my sleep. Unfortunately, the place has a 48-hour cancellation policy, which meant I'd be stuck paying for my second night even if I left. But the next morning I told the innkeeper I just had to check out, and even took him on a tour of the room's trouble spots. This ultimately got me the promise of a refund for the second night, though as of mid-March, the credit had not appeared on my charge card statement. Then I packed my bag and scooted over to the Best Western Independence Park Inn around the corner, where I got a double room on the fifth floor with a huge bathroom, handsome reproduction Federal furniture and a television with remote control for a special rate of $89, including breakfasts that morning and the next. (When I called the hotel before my trip, the lowest rate quoted was a weekend rate of $99.)
Frankly, I hate to pay more than $75 a night at a hotel, even when the room is as nice as the one I later stayed in at the Latham. That hotel has 138 rooms and suites, an air of slightly faded elegance, helpful doormen dressed in riding breeches and guest privileges at the nearby Panorama Health Club, where there's a swimming pool and hot tub surrounded by lofty windows. So even in the off-season the city defeated me in my search for hotel bargains. But in other ways, Philadelphia prices would have contented Benjamin Franklin himself. For instance, most of the sites within the Independence National Historic Park can be toured free. Each one illuminates a different theme from the early history of the republic (visiting the park made me feel like a grade schooler on a field trip).
On a cold, blustery Saturday morning, I took a chronological approach by strolling past reconstructed City Tavern, a handsome brick edifice on Second Street built in 1773, where radicals like John Adams and Patrick Henry talked about the rights of man while eating mutton joints and sherry trifles.
Two blocks away on Chestnut Street, I paused to appreciate the perfect Georgian silhouette of Carpenter's Hall, where the First Continental Congress leveled economic sanctions against Mother England. Then it was on to Independence Hall, though my heart sank when I learned that heating and cooling system renovations had temporarily closed Assembly Hall, meaning I didn't get to see President Washington's rising sun chair or the inkwell into which he dipped his pen when signing the Constitution.
But I saw the Liberty Bell, which was lugged off to Allentown in 1777 so that Redcoats under Gen. William Howe, who occupied Philadelphia for a year during the revolution, couldn't melt it down for cannonballs; stopped beneath the steel girders of the "ghost structure" in Franklin Place that mark the site of the great statesman and maxim writer's Market Street home and in the subterranean museum there learned that at the age of 14 Franklin invented swimming slippers; toured Powel House, an elegant Georgian mansion built in 1765, just south of the park (admission $3), with Chippendale chairs, moody blue Delft tiles around the fireplace in the master bedroom, and a delightful second-floor ballroom; and then wandered around Society Hill, lunching on a huge Philly cheese steak sandwich (for about $4) at the counter of Simon's Steaks on South Street.
THAT night, a $4 ticket admitted me to the amphitheater section at a Philadelphia Orchestra concert in the Academy of Music, where, way up in my chandelier-level seat, the acoustics were splendid. The program included a Glazunov violin concerto played by an 18-year-old guest soloist named Leila Josefowicz. Bending gracefully into her instrument and gowned in black from, she looked like something out of Charlotte Bronte or a perfume advertisement.
Afterward, I descended to the basement of one of Philadelphia's most famous -- and expensive -- restaurants, Le Bec-Fin on Walnut Street, because I'd heard that in the pretty little Bar Lyonnais downstairs, prices were much lower than in the fancy dining room upstairs. Over stuffed roast quail and a glass of white wine (for $25), I made friends with the couple next to me, who offered me delectable tidbits from their mixed dessert plate. Returning to my hotel, I admired the illuminated summits of Center City's skycrapers from a seat on the Chestnut Street bus.
During the day, however, an older, lower, pristine white spire persistently drew my gaze -- that of the 250-year-old Christ Church just north of Market Street where William Penn, abandoning the Society of Friends, was baptized into the Anglican faith. During the Sunday morning service, light streamed through the huge Palladian window in front, and the Gospel was taken from the Book of Matthew.
Afterward I had a delicious Sunday brunch of eggs Florentine ($6) at the chic Continental Restaurant and Martini Bar two blocks away, decorated with green vinyl and giant fake toothpick-pierced olives.
The rest of my Sunday was devoted to visiting the Barnes Foundation (admission $5) in the suburb of Merion, about 45 minutes' ride on the No. 44 bus. Though the foundation's reopening in November after a three-year renovation had attracted attention, the place was uncrowded.
Dr. Albert Coombs Barnes started collecting works, primarily by early modern French painters, around the turn of the century, ultimately aiming to establish an art school with a radical pedagogical approach. At the foundation Dr. Barnes's 800 paintings are displayed in dense, nonchronological groupings (jumbling together styles as diverse as Mannerism and Impressionism), accompanied by intriguingly shaped antique keys, latches and hinges -- all to teach lessons about the technical components of painting, such as form, color and the rendering of light. The result can be a little befuddling (which is why I benefited from the audio tour, which rents for $4).
Still, I saw paintings I never knew existed by some of my favorite artists, like "The Artist's Family" by Renoir (1896) and "Nude and Bear" by Rousseau (1901).
By Monday morning I was sated, even though in a long weekend I'd barely scratched the surface of Philadelphia's attractions. Just before boarding the R7 back to Trenton, I took the free elevator up to the observation deck in City Hall. Though it was a little foggy I could easily see for miles in all directions, toward some of the sights I had missed like the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the 1876 Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and Reading Terminal and trendy Manayunk. To see all these I'd need another visit, and the boundless energy of Benjamin Franklin.
 
The bottom line in Ben Franklin's town
I spent an average of $146 a day while in Philadelphia, with $88 of that going toward accommodations (or $100, including tax).
 
 Getting There
New Jersey Transit, (201) 762-5100, has trains that run between Penn Station in New York and Trenton for $14 round trip, off-peak (or $18.90 peak, Monday to Friday 6 to 9 P.M., to New York only). At Trenton you can change to a Southeast Pennsylvania Transit System (Septa) commuter train, with downtown Philadelphia stops at 30th Street Station, Suburban Station and Market East; the round-trip Trenton-Philadelphia Septa fare is $10.
Schedules of Septa trains with New Jersey Transit connections and other information on Philadelphia's mass transit system (like Phlash tourist buses and the Penn's Landing Trolley) are available by calling (215) 580-7800.
It's a good idea to purchase both the Septa and New Jersey Transit tickets at the New Jersey Transit ticket window in Penn Station, since the connection in Trenton is usually rather tight.
The round-trip, unreserved fare between New York and Philadelphia on Amtrak, (800) 872-7245, is $60, $78 peak (Friday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 11 P.M.); reserved round-trip tickets cost $66, $86 peak, and Metroliners cost $104 on the weekend, $130 during the week.
 
 Sights
The Philadelphia Visitors Center, (800) 537-7676, is at 16th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard; there is also a satellite office inside the Visitors Center for Independence National Historical Park, (215) 597-8974, on Second Street between Chestnut and Walnut Streets.
Half-price tickets for productions at the Walnut Street Theater, Ninth and Walnut Streets, (215) 574-3550, go on sale at the box office from 6 to 6:30 P.M. the day of the performance. "She Stoops to Conquer" is playing to April 14, and then "Cabaret" April 27 to June 9.
Tickets for the amphitheater level for the Philadelphia Orchestra at the Academy of Music, (215) 893-1999, at Broad and Locust Streets, are available at the amphitheater box office on the Locust Street side of the building one hour before Friday afternoon (usually at 2) and evening (at 8) and Saturday (8 P.M.) concerts; the cost is $4, and each person is limited to two tickets. Other tickets are $12 to $79. The season is September to May.
The Barnes Foundation is at 300 North Latches Lane, Merion, (610) 667-0290. Open Thursday, 12:30 to 5 P.M.; Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $5.
 
 Places to Stay
