HEADLINE: Giuliani Joins Los Angeles Mayor in Backing Gun Laws

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Insisting on the need for urban reform, Republican leaders of two of the nation's largest cities -- Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City and Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles -- said yesterday that they support tough gun-control laws. They also praised President Clinton. And they said they would consider campaigning for Democrats in future elections if it would help their cities.
But in an appearance on the television program "Meet the Press" on NBC, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Riordan also let their Republican colors show, talking of plans to reduce the size of city government, to explore privatizing some city services and to increase the number of police officers on the streets. 
 Asked if those plans included the reappointment of New York City's Police Commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Kelly "has done a very good job." But he declined a more direct answer, saying only that he wants someone who can work effectively with him.
 
20 Applicants Considered
 "We've looked at, in one way or another, 20 different applicants, including Commissioner Kelly," Mr. Giuliani said. "And we'll decide very shortly on whether we think a change is needed or whether Commissioner Kelly can bring about the changes that I want to make."
He said the appointment, once expected by Thanksgiving, would be made "probably within the next week or so."
In the morning interview, the two insisted that they were elected because of ability, not party or race. Mr. Giuliani, a former United States Attorney, and Mr. Riordan, a wealthy businessman, are white Republicans who replaced black Democratic mayors who had had the support of large minority electorates. And once Mr. Giuliani takes office in January, it will be the first time in 75 years that the mayors of both New York and Los Angeles are Republicans.
"City politics is nonpartisan," Mayor Riordan said. "People want a problem-solver."
Both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Riordan said they would campaign for tougher gun-control measures, with Mr. Giuliani saying he supports a "uniform licensing system" for states that would include background checks, lessons, tests and required renewals every two years.
But they stopped short of directly criticizing their party for holding up passage of the Brady bill, a measure passed by Congress last week that requires a five-day waiting period before gun sales. And while they said they support bans on the sale of some semiautomatic weapons, they did not go so far for handguns.
On reducing the size of city government, Mr. Giuliani said he would endure a strike, if necessary, to cut the number of city employees by 35,000 people over the next four years from its current level of more than 220,000. When asked if he would accept a strike by city workers in order to make government more efficient, Mr. Giuliani indicated he would.
"No one wants a strike, but there are more important objectives," he said. "We're ready for anything that is necessary to get to the objectives of straightening out the economy of the city." But, he added, most of the reduction should come through retirements.
While they agreed on most issues, the two Republicans did not see eye to eye on how to help keep people off welfare. Both said they would consider programs that include a limit on how long a person can stay on the welfare rolls.
Mr. Riordan took a tough line, saying that he would support a two-year limit on welfare eligibility and that Government money is better spent on child-care and early-education programs for "minority kids" than back-to-work programs.
But Mr. Giuliani said setting a two-year time limit for receiving welfare benefits was not presently feasible. Instead, he said, he supports programs, for example, that reward companies for helping people get off welfare and back to work.

HEADLINE: Hit Twice, Town Feels Misled by U.S.

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IUKA, Miss.

 BODY:
For more than a decade, this tiny northeast Mississippi community of 3,200 has been all dressed up with nowhere to go.
In the early 1980's, it eagerly awaited jobs and tax revenues as the Tennessee Valley Authority started building the Yellow Creek nuclear plant here. But by 1985, after spending $1.2 billion, the agency halted work, saying it had overestimated the region's need for electricity. Unemployment soared to as high as 30 percent in the area where Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee meet. 
 Residents still remember the hand-lettered sign outside of Handy Sandy's service station at the time. "Will the last person out of Iuka please turn out the lights," it read.
 
Infrastructure in Place
 Then in the late 80's, the town's hopes were raised again when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration thought it had found an ideal site to build its new generation of solid rocket motors. Impressed by the mothballed T.V.A.-built infrastructure of new sewage treatment, water and power lines, and rail and barge routes, NASA decided to spend $1.5 billion to establish its production program here.
But last month, under budget pressure and after new questions arose about the need for the new motors, Congress killed the financing for the site, which was 80 percent complete.
This time the signs commenting on the fate of the town, named for a 19th century Chickasaw chief, are plaintive, like the one at the entrance of Casabella's Trailer Park that reads: "NASA is gone and we are all alone. Christmas is near and we are without cheer."
The effects in Iuka of the cancellation are similar to the effects of the cancellation of the $11 billion Superconducting Supercollider, which was to be built in Waxahachie, Tex. There, too, Congress's vote has clouded the future of hundreds of scientists, engineers and construction workers as well as dashed the economic hopes of a region.
As Congress year after year took aim at what it took to be extravagance, many in Iuka felt fortunate that their effort to make a new solid rocket motor was more concrete and down to earth when compared with the supercollider and its pure research quest for bosons, quarks and forces that are the holy grail of high-energy physics.
"We were bricks and mortar, nuts and bolts," said Iuka's Mayor, David Nichols, of the rocket site. "They were pie in the sky."
In Iuka, about 1,000 construction workers will be let go as the site is closed down over the next year, and 1,000 other employees, including rocket scientists, engineers and support personnel, have received pink slips saying that Dec. 20 will be their last day.
Now at worst, said Mack Wadkins, head of the Tishomingo County Economic Development Foundation, the Yellow Creek site could be marketed as a tourist attraction called "the world's largest outdoor museum to Government waste".
Equally angry are many among the engineers and scientists brought into the area to work at the NASA project. Frank Jordan, 62 an aeronautical engineer who has worked on a string of on-again-off-again missile projects, said that he, like many others here, felt "betrayed and misled."
Many workers are saddled with new homes that they are having problems selling, and they face the daunting task of marketing themselves and their highly specialized skills in at a time when there is little need for them.
"This was a very radical decision for those of us who came from the West Coast to live in the Deep South," said Gary Van Meter, a procurement specialist who came from Sacramento, Calif., in 1990. "I like it, but it is isolated and different. But no matter what we did, we couldn't have prepared for what has now happened. Everybody has been crushed by this thing."
Over the years, Iuka and the State of Mississippi invested more than $100 million in schools, roads, a hospital and a branch of the University of Mississippi. These improvements, he said, will stay with the community and are perhaps the only silver lining of the canceled project.
Such efforts at being upbeat are lost on residents like Letitia Guinn, 27, who feared that Iuka would be a ghost town in a matter of months. She recalled the arson and insurance fraud cases that seemed to followed the T.V.A. shutdown in 1985 as some desperate residents sought a way out of their problems. She fears a repeat.
"A lot of us were skeptical when NASA came in," she said. "They just bring in their big ideas and then let us down."
 
Huge Unused Site
 The NASA complex, on a spit between Yellow Creek and the Tennessee River, looks like some otherworldly sculpture park. Huge concrete and metal structures seemed strewn haphazardly over the site's 1,200 acres.
One unfinished reminder of the T.V.A. project, a circular structure with a diameter the length of a football field that was to be the base of a nuclear plant cooling tower, sits next to an uncompleted building with a six-story concrete blast wall where the liquid components of the NASA rocket fuels were to be turned to solids.
The project, to be operated by Lockheed and Aerojet Solid Propulsion Company, was initially set to be completed by 1994. The rocket motor, to be used to launch the space shuttle, was supposed to replace the model that was redesigned after the Challenger explosion in January 1986.
Then, with cost overruns, the price rose to about $3 billion, and the production starting date was put off until 2001.
To some scientists and legislators, the NASA project was a pork-barrel project from the beginning, the product of the influence of Representative Jamie L. Whitten, a Democrat, who was then the head of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
"Like the supercollider, to a lot of people it was just eating money and seemed out of control," said John E. Pike, an analyst of the space program with the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.
For some other experts, the quest for a safer rocket motor initially outweighed these criticisms. But last year a NASA panel said that the current version was safe, and a group of new Congress members came into office with a mandate to cut the deficit.
 
Hope Remains
 In Iuka, some people hold out hope that some new project will move into the site. And there are still those scientists who say a new generation of solid rocket motor is needed.
Danny McBride, the owner of McBride's Garden Center, talked about rumors that Senator Trent Lott and other officials were working on some alternative use of the site.
Bruce Lott, an aide to Senator Lott who is not a relative, confirmed that efforts were under way but declined to discuss them, noting that he did not want to unduly raise hopes locally.
"Either way, I'll still be here," Mr. McBride said. "We boomed and busted twice before but we aren't down for the count."
Mr. Jordan and many of his engineering colleagues now spend their days at job fairs here sponsored by Lockheed and Aerojet, perusing national want ads at a jobs center set up in the NASA complex's cafeteria or getting job counseling.
Mr. Jordan is among those who say they are determined to stay in the area. He and two dozen other engineers have been exploring entrepreneurial possibilities. Mr. Wadkins of the economic development agency has agreed to help them if they come up with a sound idea, and so far they have considered everything from consulting to software design to some manufacturing ventures.
Mayor Nichols and others talk of never again putting their economic development eggs in one basket as they have twice before. He takes some solace in the rumors of some scaled down operations at the site. But he admits that those rumors have not encouraged the developers of a proposed golf course, stores and an apartment complex, all of whom approached local officials in the last year and then failed to reappear.
"You know, we all feel a little bit like a rag doll," he said.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
New York May Need To Expand Boundaries

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"NO man is an island," the politically incorrect John Donne wrote. No city is an island, either, even if some islands, like Manhattan, have been cities and some others, like Staten Island, still hope to be.
New York politicians who are wringing their hands over whether the city will be a lesser cosmopolis if Staten Island secedes are largely overlooking another alternative: Instead of letting one island go, get together with others. Forget Staten Island. What about Long Island? 
 Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani, the first mayor in memory to lose Manhattan but win the general election in the four less-developed boroughs, has already forged a coalition with county executives from Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland. For the first time in a generation, all five are Republicans. Their goal: to suggest common solutions to the region's problems and to lobby Albany with a common agenda.
A top priority will be to persuade the state to pay a greater share of Medicaid costs, an argument that may carry more weight with Ralph J. Marino of Muttontown, L.I., majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, since more than 6 in 10 New York State residents live in the nine counties that the Mayor and four county executives represent.
"It's going to be difficult, I think, for Senator Marino to resist Mayor-elect Giuliani and the four county executives, especially since they happen to be in the same party," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said earlier this month with undisguised glee at the prospect that a Democratic initiative -- having the state take over Medicaid costs -- may be getting broader support because these soaring costs strike without regard to political boundaries or party.
Annexation accounted for much of the growth of the nation's big cities during the last few decades. Cities burdened with beleaguered downtowns or disproportionately poor populations could capture more taxable properties and wealthier taxpayers by expanding their borders.
Advancing that strategy one step further, Mayor W. W. Herenton of Memphis boldly proposed last month consolidation rather than annexation. Memphis should merge with the suburbs of surrounding Shelby County because, he said, "the progressive cities of the future will be those that will not allow the growth of the suburbs to strip them of their own potential for growth."
To be sure, obstacles abound, not the least of which are money and race. Typically, the goal of consolidation -- efficient allocation of resources on a regional scale -- is not enough of an incentive for suburban whites or ascending urban blacks to surrender their sovereignty or dilute their political power.
Connecticut and New Jersey suburbs have resisted a greater role in helping to finance and to desegregate urban schools. And John R. Dunne, the former Associate Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, while agreeing that no person is an island, generally opposed crossing city lines to ameliorate racial disparities in housing or schooling. Where the Clinton administraton stands is anybody's guess.
Addressing the Manhattan Institute earlier this month, Mayor Edward Rendell of Philadelphia, a Democrat and a former New Yorker, championed metropolitan government. But he warned that where it works, it is often because those regions are racially homogenous and therefore more receptive to the confluence-of-interest argument. The gist of his case was that "only when Scarsdale is willing to help city schools can you save New York."
What would a "Much Greater New York" look like?
According to the 1990 census, the nine-county megalopolis would be home to 11 million people instead of the 7.3 million in New York City alone. The proportion of men (47 percent) and women (53 percent) would remain the same. The average age would rise just marginally (from 36.4 years to 36.6).
A higher proportion would be married (52 percent instead of 48 percent), would have attended college or graduated (46 percent instead of 42 percent) and would be employed (59 percent instead of 56 percent). Average family income (measured before the recession) would soar from $46,879 to $56,011; the percent of people living below the poverty level would drop from 19.3 percent to 14.5 percent; the average value of an owned home would rise from $205,879 to $227,425.
The proportion of whites would increase (from 52 percent to 64 percent) while the share of blacks and Hispanic people would decline (from 29 percent to 22 percent and from 24 percent to 18 percent, respectively).
An ideal city? Compared with what? But surely no more contrived than the five boroughs put together nearly a century ago or pulled apart in the past half-century. Geographic islands may once have made sense as isolated political entities. But political islands like New York's, defined for centuries by artificial and arbitrary boundaries, may have less of a rationale than ever before.

HEADLINE: William Trent, 83, Director of Negro College Fund

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
William J. Trent Jr., the executive director of the United Negro College Fund for 20 years after its inception in 1944, died on Saturday in Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. He was 83 and had lived in Greensboro since 1975.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter Judy Scales-Trent. She said her father had been in declining health for years and had recently suffered from kidney trouble, pneumonia and other ailments. 
 In his years as the executive director of the fund, with offices in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trent oversaw the raising of about $78 million, which he said in 1964 had helped to make "strong citadels of learning, carriers of the American dream, seedbeds of social evolution and revolution." At that time, 32 colleges in 11 Southern states were sharing the fund's income.
In 1961, when the fund was raising about $2 million a year to strengthen the best private black colleges, Mr. Trent said: "Our job is to find enough money to make these institutions good colleges in the mainstream of American education. The country will need good colleges, and none of the Negro colleges have any race restrictions any longer."
 
'Full, Frank Discussion'
 In 1956, he said that all the fund's member colleges were legally open to any qualified applicant, regardless of race. He said that the member colleges could help meet "the heightened sensitivity over the desegregation issue" in the South and elsewhere by developing leaders to cope with the problem and tensions, and that by serving as "islands of democratic participation, both white and Negro citizens can come together in full, frank discussion." By then, all the fund's member colleges had interracial faculties.
Over the years, Mr. Trent served variously as president of the board of St. Luke's Hospital in New York and as treasurer of the National Urban League, where he was a longtime board member.
William Johnson Trent Jr. was born in Asheville, N.C., and grew up in Atlanta, where family members said he graduated from a private black high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1930 from Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C., while his father was president of the college.
 
Taught Economics
 The younger Mr. Trent went on to earn a master's degree in business administration at the University of Pennsylvania and did graduate work in economics at the University of Chicago.
He then taught economics at Livingstone College for two years and later taught economics at Bennett College in Greensboro, where he was also acting dean of education. At the time, all the students at both colleges were black, Ms. Scales-Trent said.
From 1938 to 1944, he held Government posts in Washington during the Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, first as an official of the Department of the Interior with the title of Adviser on Negro Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, and then as race relations officer in the Federal Works Agency.
In 1964, Mr. Trent became assistant personnel director of Time Inc., which publishes Time and Life magazines. In that position he was concerned largely with race relations and minority issues. He retired from the company in 1975, when he was 65. While he worked in New York, he lived in Manhattan and in New Rochelle, N.Y.
In later years, while living in Greensboro, he worked in the Bennett College development office and was on the boards of Livingstone College and of Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C.
At various times he also served on the boards of New York Community Trust, National Council on Philanthropy, National Foundation for the Improvement of Education, College Placement Services, Experiment in International Living and Paine College in Augusta, Ga.
In addition to Ms. Scales-Trent of Buffalo, Mr. Trent is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Viola Scales; two other daughters, Kay Trent Holloway of Potomac, Md., and Toni Trent Parker of Stamford, Conn., seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pension Arithmetic With Low Rates

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Low interest rates may be good news for many, but in a certain way they are wreaking havoc with the nation's pension plans.
Government regulators, fearing that too few corporations are setting aside enough for future retirees, are forcing businesses to use current interest rates in calculating their pension plan obligations. The result is that many companies will have to put aside millions of dollars more and the nation's uncovered pension liability will greatly increase. 
 The action is being led by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has written a warning letter to corporations on the matter. And it comes as the Clinton Administration is preparing legislation to tighten loopholes that now allow companies to evade their pension obligations. It also comes amid new statistics showing that the underfinancing of pension plans had swelled before the S.E.C. spoke out.
 
Companies Catch On Late
 "There appears to be a fairly significant delay by American companies in recognizing that interest rates have declined," said Walter Schuetze, the commission's chief accountant. "It looked to us as if quite a few companies had no recognition in their pension plans that there has been a significant decline in rates, and that's why we wrote this letter. And for many company plans, the change is going to be a fairly large number."
The S.E.C. letter reflects a truism of finance: As interest rates fall, corporations must set aside more money for pensions because the securities in their pension portfolios are expected to earn less.
And many companies, comfortable in the knowledge that the strong stock and bond markets had inflated the value of pension portfolio assets, had stopped contributing to their funds. Now, that corporate financing may well have to resume -- or at least be accounted for in the companies' financial statements.
"Corporations are certainly not happy about this, but they understand," said Richard Joss, an actuary with the Wyatt Company, a pension consulting firm. "They are biting the bullet and swallowing hard. They know the change in interest rates means bigger expenses, bigger disclosures and bigger checks to be written."
Mark Mactas, an actuary with Towers Perrin, the employee-benefits consultant, added, "Companies that had been on a pension-contribution holiday may decide to start funding their plans once again."
In its letter, the S.E.C. recommended that companies use an interest rate equal to that of high-quality bonds, ones now yielding about 7 percent. The letter was sent by the commission to the Financial Accounting Standards Boards, which establishes the accounting rules for corporate financial documents. The S.E.C. letter reiterated a rule already on the accounting books and warned corporations that this rule, which has often been liberally interpreted, must be more strictly followed in all documents submitted to the Government.
But few companies today meet that standard. A study by Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment banker, shows that the use of high interest rates is widespread among pension plans of Fortune 500 companies.
Of 366 concerns surveyed, 300 based their valuations on rates higher than 7 percent. The overwhelming majority used rates of 8 percent to 9 percent, and some were as high as 12 percent. Only eight companies in the survey used rates below 7 percent.
"Many companies are vulnerable if they are forced to reassess the interest rates in their pension plans," said Gabrielle Napolitano, a portfolio manager and author of the Goldman, Sachs report. "This is something that will increase their pension liability, and could constrain corporate cash flow as companies may have to make bigger contributions to their pension plans."
It is impossible to determine at this point how much this change will cost American corporations or how many nominally overfinanced plans will now be classified as underfinanced. In addition, under accounting rules, corporations must report any increases in their pension obligations as an increase in corporate liabilities. This increase in liabilities would have the effect of reducing earnings and stockholders' equity.
"Some pension plans that were previously reported as fully funded may now become underfunded," said Martin Slate, executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal pension insurance fund. "But we have no idea how many. There's been a broad concern among Federal regulators that many pension plans have not been realistic in their assumptions."
 
Too Much of Too Little
 This is of particular concern to Mr. Slate, whose agency issued new statistics last week indicating that underfinancing in corporate pension plans reached $38 billion in 1992, an increase of $9 billion from the previous year. Mr. Slate's agency provides benefits to retired workers whose pension funds have defaulted. The premiums for this fund are paid from corporate pension plans.
Current laws are fairly lax, allowing companies with underfinanced plans to maintain them that way. So plans that become underfinanced with the use of lower interest rates can avoid having to put in additional money to fully finance them. The Clinton Administration is expected to propose legislation to change this by requiring that significantly underfinanced plans pay sharply higher premiums into the pension insurance fund -- both as punishment and as a way to strengthen the insurance fund.
A Labor Department study indicates that for each decline of one percentage point in interest rates used in a corporate pension plan, the plan's total pension liability rises by about 10 percent. "Small changes in interest rates," Ms. Napolitano said, "will have a major impact on the present value of a plan's liabilities." This is because the long-term nature of pension investing makes the plans highly sensitive to slight changes in interest rates when such changes are compounded over many years.
Some leading corporations with uncovered pension obligations say they anticipated the slide in interest rates and began to prepare for it by increasing their pension contributions.
Thomas Capo, treasurer of the Chrysler Corporation, said the S.E.C. letter "came as no surprise.
"We plan on complying," Mr. Capo said. "We're quite focused on funding our pension liability. That's one of our top priorities." The Chrysler pension fund is underfinanced by about $3.8 billion, according to Goldman, Sachs figures, which Mr. Capo confirmed. (The Goldman, Sachs estimate varies from Government estimates).
Chrysler's future payout has been calculated using an 8.375 percent interest rate. Mr. Capo said that would be recalculated at the end of the year.
This year, he said, Chrysler will add $2.6 billion to its plan and has also benefited from high returns on its pension portfolio investments, which are largely in stocks and bonds. "We expect our projected unfunded liability to be significantly lower at the end of this year than it was at the end of last year," Mr. Capo said.
At Westinghouse, a change in the interest rate assumption on June 30 from 9 percent to 8 percent increased the pension liability by $600 million. Westinghouse plans to put about $250 million into its fund by the end of the year, stepping up its contributions.
"We plan to contribute in future years at higher levels," said James Schmitt, a company spokesman. "We are constantly evaluating interest rates, and we will make whatever adjustments are appropriate."
 
Strong Gains in Bond Prices
 But the low interest rates that cause problems for pension funds cut both ways for their corporations. Falling rates mean companies can reduce what they expect to pay in future salary increases, a major determinant in calculating retirement benefits. And it means that the value of many of the stocks, and especially of the bonds, in a pension portfolio have increased.
These pluses are included in the calculation when a company is determining how much its pension liability has increased and what it wants to do about it. Many companies will undoubtedly decide to allow a pension liability to grow and deal with it later.
But the trade-offs include the lowered value of a company's stock amid its growing obligation, and the required reduction when reporting profits. As a result, many companies would rather spend the money today than face these consequences.
"I can assure you, everyone will be taking a look at this and deciding what it means for them," Mr. Mactas of Towers Perrin said. "There's no requirement that companies fund more. But I think some companies will make additional contributions to avoid having this increased obligation."
James McKee, a consultant with Callan Associates in San Francisco, added: "Figuring out the exact impact means you are looking at a lot of moving parts. This is a concern to the corporate community, and I don't think they are being caught totally unaware. And, they've got the resources to determine whether a gross underestimation of their liabilities is in the making."

HEADLINE: Convention Center Proposal Revived for Hartford

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 28

 BODY:
State tourism officials are reviving a proposal to construct a $150 million downtown convention center to bolster the economy and stimulate the sagging hotel industry. The plan was blocked by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. a year and a half ago.
"If we don't do something to make this a more attractive downtown to visitors, you're going to see further decline in the hotels, you're going to see declines in the restaurants," said Jack Courtenay, chairman of the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 Mr. Courtenay and others from the region's hotel, convention and tourism industry have written Governor Weicker to urge him to incorporate a convention center into plans for a football stadium if the state is successful in its bid to lure the New England Patriots to Hartford.
"We need to get legislators to think about and remember the need for a convention center," said Ronald Balmer, executive director of the Connecticut Hotel-Motel Association.
 
Hotel Occupancy Rates
 A center would help revitalize the local hotel industry, which in recent years has had occupancy rates just below 50 percent, a typical break-even point, according to the association.
The visitors bureau estimates that 1,000 people attending a convention would generate $45,000 more in state sales and lodging taxes than 1,000 people attending a local consumer show would generate.
But prospects for the center do not look promising.
The center's development last year was obstructed by the Connecticut Convention Center Authority, which spent more than $1.3 million but did not reach agreement on a final convention center site, said State Representative Eugene J. Millerick, chairman of the Legislature's tourism subcommittee.
Now the Governor, who has not responded to the letter, thinks that a convention center has low priority, compared with other more advanced development projects, said his spokeswoman, Avice Meehan.

HEADLINE: Van Service Saves Parents the Chore of Shuttling Children

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANLIUS, N.Y.

 BODY:
On any given day, the three Visser children may all have to be at different after-school activities at the same time. Candice, 11 years old, and Celina, 13, participate in dance and figure skating. Christopher, 12, enjoys hockey and baseball, and all three attend religious education one day a week.
Their father, Jan Visser, an engineer, works 30 miles from their home in Manlius, an affluent suburb of Syracuse, and cannot help his wife, Denise, with car pooling. Mrs. Visser, a dietary supervisor, works from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. two days a week, and 12-hour shifts on Saturdays and Sundays. 
 Like most parents, they find it a struggle to juggle their schedules and those of their children. But the Vissers have found help with their car pooling problems thanks to a company called Kids Taxi. For $6 for a one-way trip, and $10 for a round trip, parents can have their children shuttled from place to place.
 
'A Growing Need'
 To Keith Tupper, 38, one of the five entrepreneurs who started Kids Taxi last month, the concept was a natural.
"I felt there was a growing need," Mr. Tupper said, "especially in New York State, where both parents have to work in order to survive."
Valerie Grossman, the mother of a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old, could not agree more. "I thought it was wonderful," she said.
Mrs. Grossman's 60-hour weeks as a nurse coordinator for an urgent-care clinic combined with her husband's job as an insurance salesman can cause nightmarish car-pooling problems. For example, she recalled the day her children had doctor's appointments and neither she nor her husband could get away from work. Kids Taxi came to their rescue, she said, adding, "I was blessed."
 
New Ways to Manage Lives
 Kids Taxi is the shape of the future when it comes to business, say researchers at the School of Management at Syracuse University.
"There are a lot of interpersonal things that are going to be services," said Susan Thomas, a research associate with the Innovative Management Program there.
"As we have smaller families and greater responsibilities," Ms. Thomas said, "and our days are more complex, we will manage things differently as individuals and as a community, and do it in an economically viable way."
Mr. Tupper and his partners began their business after looking at similar services in California, Michigan, and across the state in Schenectady -- deciding that safety and security were top priorities.
Before parents ever use the service, the van driver goes to the house for an interview. "He met our girls; they met him," Mrs. Grossman said. "They seem to have thought of every last detail."
Each van has a cellular phone. "In an emergency, we can access the van in two seconds," Mr. Tupper said. For an extra dollar, the Kids Taxi driver will call parents when a child arrives at his or her destination.
 
Identification Cards
 An optional fee of $19.95 provides each child with a special picture/ medical identification card from Medcard of America. Medcard of America, another company based in Syracuse, markets the patient identification card, which contains a strip of archival-quality microfilm readable on any light source. The strip can hold 50 items of patient information, like name, address, emergency numbers, or what medications someone might be taking.
Medcards have been customized for Kids Taxi to include the Kids Taxi logo and phone number in case a child loses the card. Mr. Tupper said such cards will insure the proper emergency medical care if needed.
"I like the idea of a picture ID," Mrs. Grossman said. "The service is small enough now so the driver knows what my kids look like, but I like the added security of the picture."
 
Security Code System
 Finally, parents using Kids Taxi provide the company with a special code word. The code system was set up to insure that no one but the parents can rearrange a child's schedule, and to prevent a noncustodial parent from taking a child if the family is in a bitter divorce.
"You've got to let parents know that they can access their child," Mr. Tupper said, "but no one else can."
The company's two 1993 minivans have built-in child seats and are outfitted with umbrellas and tissues.
"The driver remembered to pick up all their little pictures, and backpacks, and lunch boxes, all the little things I forgot to remind them to get," Mrs. Grossman said. "It was nice."
After a month of operation, Kids Taxi has a small but loyal following in Manlius, the only town where the service is available. And Mr. Tupper hopes that happy customers will generate more business for his company than any other marketing techniques.
Mrs. Visser is happy to spread the word. For what Mrs. Visser called a reasonable cost, Kids Taxi provides her peace of mind. "I'm very picky about who I let my kids ride with," she said.

HEADLINE: The Big Airlines' Tricky and Changing Market

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
With the force and unpredictability of a wind shear, change has swept through the airline industry. Only two years ago, the nation's biggest airlines -- American, United and Delta -- looked to many experts as if they were growing too strong and threatening healthy competition. The list of airlines sending out distress signals included Continental and T.W.A., and Pan Am, Midway and Eastern had been grounded.
Today, Continental and T.W.A. have emerged from bankruptcy, the three largest carriers are flashing warnings of bleak futures, and several new airlines have emerged to answer the demands of consumers for low fares. 
 "It is certainly now clear to all that the marketplace has changed," said Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of the UAL Corporation, United Airlines' parent company.
 
Sense of Great Pressure
 These rapid shifts in the carriers' fortunes offer some insight into why American Airlines' chief, Robert L. Crandall, was adamant -- until President Clinton called -- about holding the line on labor cost issues like requiring three, rather than four, flight attendants on nearly empty flights.
And it also offers clues about how weaker and smaller airlines have adapted to survive. Over the last three years, the domestic industry's $10 billion or so combined loss has been seen as an opportunity by small, lean new airlines.
In Chicago, not far from O'Hare International Airport, the smaller Midway Airport is home to what Mr. Wolf of United calls a "sea of low-cost carriers' tails." Those airlines are expanding, using lower fares to lure business passengers.
New carriers like Kiwi International Air Lines -- founded by more than 100 former Eastern Airlines pilots investing at least $50,000 each -- have come into being in response to passengers' cost consciousness. By paying pilots less than half what they would get at the largest airlines, leasing inexpensive planes that the big carriers do not want, and flying into secondary airports like Midway that charge lower fees, Kiwi found that it could undersell the largest carriers and record an occasional profit.
 
Better Days Seen Ahead
 "If we're able to make it in a very down economy," said Bob Iverson, Kiwi's chairman, "there's no logical reason to believe that we would have trouble in an economy that picks up."
Competitors like these, with work rules that require flexibility from employees, most of whom are not unionized, are the envy of Mr. Wolf and Mr. Crandall. American and United rack up profits on long flights, only to see them subsidize money-losing short routes in the United States. And with carriers like Southwest Airlines rapidly expanding and making the business look easy, the big carriers' disadvantage on short routes will worsen.
"You're kind of flying against a headwind," said Phil Baggaley, a transportation analyst at Standard & Poor's.
In the meantime, older carriers like Northwest, Continental and T.W.A. have managed to defy predictions of their imminent demise, shaking off debt and gaining concessions from employees to emerge as "born-again carriers" with low costs.
Northwest narrowly avoided bankruptcy when its unions agreed to an eleventh-hour swap -- wage concessions in return for an ownership stake. Continental and T.W.A. also emerged this year as feisty and innovative airlines after long tours in the bankruptcy courts. T.W.A. added legroom in coach class, for example, and is working to reverse a reputation for sour-faced service.
Continental has also put into practice what many of the largest airlines are only thinking about doing. Last month, it started a new jet service dubbed Calite that mimics Southwest's strategy of running many low-fare, no-frills flights a day between two cities. The airline cut fares roughly 60 percent on flights between 41 pairs of cities, offering, for example, a round trip for $72 from Newark to Buffalo. After the first month, Calite was running $1 million ahead of revenue projections.
These pressures have boxed in American and United, which are looking at solutions labor leaders oppose. Delta, which is focused on fixing its money-losing international operation, has heard little grumbling from its pilots, members of its only union.
This is not the first time the big airlines have leaned on labor for help. But this time, they are holding out few promises of rewards other than a better shot at job security.
 
Flight Crews Instruct Crandall
 However, as the strike by American flight attendants earlier this month showed, the unions think that they have been leaned on for many years and are in little mood to cooperate. United's labor leaders have issued war threats if the airline should carry out its backup plan to revamp through layoffs and by selling parts of the company.
American's pilots are smarting from Mr. Crandall's dismissal of a report they commissioned on ways to better operate without the need for labor concessions. "Marginal givebacks don't really solve the problems," said Richard T. LaVoy, president of the Allied Pilots Association.
But what are the industry's basic problems, and how did they arise and intensify so much? And what are the biggest airlines doing to solve them?
Those questions came up often in the days leading to the strike at American, as flight attendants argued against making concessions when their employer was reporting profits, with more expected next year.
And viewed from a certain vantage, American and United do look healthy. Each is sitting on a thick cushion of cash -- American has about $1.3 billion in the bank; United, roughly $2 billion. They are feared by competitors abroad for their relatively lean operations, and their far-reaching foreign routes position them well in an economic recovery.
But from a different perspective, the United States airline business smacks of futility. Consider that the companies reported an average net profit margin of 4.9 percent in the most recent quarter. In their best year, 1988, the airlines posted an anemic 2.6 percent margin. Next year, they are expected to earn $1 billion, for a profit of 1.2 percent.
"The point is not to break even, or investors will take their money elsewhere," Mr. Baggaley of Standard & Poor's said.
The carriers are also expected to have to buy more planes to meet a long-term rise in demand for travel and to heed Government orders to replace old jets with quieter models. David Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, the domestic industry's trade group, predicts that the industry will have to spend a combined $10 billion a year on planes after 1994.
That will make for hard decisions about what to do with future profits. "You have this real tension between how much you put into capital, and how much you pay the work force," Mr. Swierenga said.
 
Savage New Economics
 To be sure, this conflict did not always exist to the current degree. Despite chronically low profits, airline investors have long had reason to believe that the industry might be a shrewd bet. For decades, growth surged as new markets opened, aircraft technology improved and deregulation helped drive down fares.
At the same time, financial markets were being deregulated, and planes were suddenly part of many investors' portfolios. Airlines gladly shifted to investors the risks of buying planes, and the carriers expanded to meet an expected rise in demand.
"There always appeared to be something on the horizon," said Daniel M. Kasper, an industry consultant and a member of the commission appointed this summer by President Clinton to study the airlines' ills.
Then the industry suffered heavy and unexpected troubles, with the recession and the gulf war turning travelers into reluctant and penny-pinching fliers less willing to pay a premium for big carriers' service.
Now, United wants to set up separate, low-cost carriers to funnel passengers to its money-making long flights. The idea has incited United's unions, who are again trying to gain control of the airline with a financial package that relies heavily on wage and work-rule concessions.
American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, is investing in its profitable divisions like computer consulting and is shrinking the airline by grounding planes and laying off workers. AMR may also break up its pieces into independent companies, a move that would show that American Airlines is more hobbled than it now appears because it is being subsidized by the other AMR subsidiaries.
American's pilots recently suggested that American pursue a tack similar to Continental's Calite. But American says staying with its hub-and-spoke network is the wisest course.
The entrenched stances now of American management and labor do not bode well for contract talks with pilots next year. Speaking last week of leaders of the flight attendants' and pilots' unions, Mr. Crandall said, "They are sending us a clear signal that they do not understand the message of the marketplace." .
But Mr. LaVoy, the pilots' union president, disagreed: "We've come to the conclusion that labor and work rules are not the reasons you can't be competitive. It's the structure of the airlines that's creating the inefficiencies, and that's where the real savings are."

HEADLINE: Family Planning for All Families

 BODY:
By giving $13.2 million to the International Planned Parenthood Federation last week, and by resuming funding for the United Nations Population Fund next January, the Clinton Administration has retrieved a banner America dropped in 1984. Once more the United States has a chance to make a deep impact on family planning all over the world.
The $13.2 million is only the first installment on a five-year, $75 million commitment to International Planned Parenthood, which, like the U.N. Population Fund, has been denied Federal funding ever since certain Reagan Administration supporters promulgated the so-called Mexico City policy. The policy, continued by the Bush Administration, banned Federal aid to any family planning agencies that so much as mentioned abortion -- despite the fact that American foreign aid has been sequestered, by law, from any abortion-related activities since 1985. 
 When population experts protested that such a ban held poor countries' population efforts hostage to America's abortion controversy, Mr. Reagan's advisers had a blithe, and unnervingly sexist, answer. Population growth, they said, was a "natural phenomenon" that could stimulate economic growth, in that more people meant more ideas, more productivity and more consumers. It also meant that countless women would continue to be condemned to a lifetime of childbearing -- but hey! who was thinking about that?
Ironically, America's retreat from leadership of the campaign to make family planning possible for all people came just as the world's developing countries had begun to embrace it. Now more than half the couples in such countries use some form of birth control; and in Africa, where the fertility rate is highest and contraceptive use lowest, births are beginning to decline.
Even so, world population -- now 5.2 billion and increasing by 90 million each year -- remains awesome, as awesome as the plight of millions of the world's women is tragic. If Mr. Clinton's reversal of a cruel, ill-considered policy is intelligent, it is also profoundly humane.

HEADLINE: More Korean Groceries Failing as the Recession Drags On

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN

 BODY:
After riding the boom of the 1980's and becoming among the most identifiable features of New York City, Korean groceries are suffering through the recession and many are on the brink of shutting down, Korean business groups say.
The grocers, who run the gamut from owning mom-and-pop shops on Brooklyn street corners to brightly lit salad bars in Midtown, mainly blame the recession for their troubles, but also cite harassment by city inspectors, constantly rising rents and increased competition. 
 "Nowadays when we are exchanging salutations, we say how is business," said B. J. Sa, the executive director of the Korean Produce Association. The response generally is, "Oh, we are surviving," and the answer is, "Oh, that's good."
Just a decade ago, Korean groceries seemed to be sprouting up in every corner of the city, many offering customers 24-hour service and a vast array of products, especially fresh produce. The stores were a testament to the immigrants' determination to succeed in a business where profit margins are thin and hours long.
While many Korean grocery owners have attained their American dream of prosperity -- with suburban houses and golf club memberships -- others say they are now giving up the business.
Richard Pak, who owned the 42d Street Salad and Health Deli for seven and a half years, shut it down last month. Despite falling sales that he attributed to high vacancy rates in nearby office buildings, his landlord tried to raise the rent at the store, across the street from the New York Public Library, from about $13,000 a month to $20,000 a month, he said.
"It used to be people spent $6 to $7 on their lunch, now they spend $3 to $4 -- they buy soup," Mr. Pak said, adding he could have stayed open if his rent had stayed the same. He said three Korean-owned groceries closed down within two blocks of his store in the last two years.
"I see people trying, they just give up," he said.
Myong Y. Juch, who owns a grocery on the Upper West Side and is the president of the Korean-American Grocer's Association of New York, said that many grocery owners, for the first time, are not being rewarded financially for their hard work.
"It's not that the work is too hard, it's that their efforts are not being paid," he said. "They have started to cry out. Business is down 10, 20, 30, 40 percent. We hear every week someone is closing down."
The Korean grocers are hardly the only small-business owners suffering through the recession, but because they belong to a tightly knit ethnic community whose economic survival is closely linked to the grocery business, the slowdown has touched nearly all Korean families in the metropolitan area, directly or indirectly. Many Koreans have stakes in the groceries through the informal credit organizations that helped give these business owners their starts. And since many Korean groceries employ family members and operate on thin profit margins, business troubles can have a devastating impact.
 
End of an Economic Boom
 The recession has hit at a time when the grocers are beginning to assert some political and financial clout in the city. Of the estimated 300,000 Koreans in the area, 10,000 own businesses, of which 3,500 are groceries, delis or supermarkets. These account for 15 percent of such businesses in the city. Nearly half of the store owners are now citizens, according to a grocer's association survey. Many supported Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor, Mr. Sa said, because they believe he is tougher on crime and more sensitive to the needs of small businesses and the Korean community.
The story of Mr. Pak, the grocer who closed his store down last month, is typical of many Korean grocers. He came to the United States 20 years ago as an electrical engineer, but the language barrier kept him from getting a job in his field. Instead he followed the path taken by millions of immigrants before him and opened a small business, in this case a grocery store on 14th Street. After 10 years in the same spot, the first four without a single day off, Mr. Pak moved uptown, opening the 42d Street store and riding the last years of the city's economic boom before the 1987 stock market crash.
The end of the economic boom was especially trying for the 300,000 Koreans in the metropolitan area, most of whom emigrated in the 1970's and early 1980's, just in time to ride the wave of the expansion. Ironically, their very success spurred more Korean immigration and led to more and more new groceries, which contributed to the higher rents and increased competition that are haunting them today. Korean immigration has slowed to a trickle in recent years, in part because of the recession in the United States, but also because economic growth in South Korea has opened up more opportunities at home.
What is so frustrating for many grocers is that in the past, hard work alone could make the difference between success and failure. Getting up at 3 A.M. to reach the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx before the best produce disappeared -- and then displaying it washed, trimmed and in perfect rows -- used to be enough to draw an abundance of customers.
 
More Than Hard Work
 "If you worked hard, got up early and displayed nicely, all you had to say was how much," Mr. Sa said. Korean grocers, he added, generally buy the highest quality -- and most expensive -- produce, and then mark up the price as much as they can while still keeping it low enough to stay competitive. But when sales are low, these markups are not enough to pay the fixed costs of doing business, like rent, electricity and salaries.
Mr. Sa estimated that 10 to 15 percent of the Korean groceries in the city will shut down this year, but accurate numbers are hard to come by. "Many times when they close, they don't report, clearly because they feel shame," he said. The city keeps no figures on groceries or business failures, although officials agree that small business failures have increased during the recession.
Mr. Juch of the Korean-American Grocers' Association estimates that of his group's 3,000 members, one third are considering shutting down and quitting the grocery business, while another third would take another job if they could get one.
The Dinkins administration has tried to help by easing rules on ticketing, including the law -- known as the 18-inch rule -- that makes store owners responsible for litter on their sidewalk.
The store owners though, did not see much of a change, and say they are overwhelmed by a costly bureaucracy. Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York, based in Flushing, Queens, said the owners of groceries need between four and eight licenses, pay 14 different taxes, all of which have gone up in recent years, and must abide by more than 120 laws and regulations.
"If you are an inspector and you come to the store, you can find violations guaranteed because there are so many rules," Mr. Kim said, adding that some fines reach $250, an amount that can wipe out a day's profits. "$250 for a fruit store means you've got to sell 120 boxes of bananas."
The hard times are spread out evenly across the city, the grocers say. While in Manhattan, high rents and tough competition may be the culprits, in more residential areas, high local unemployment and high crime rates have pushed some grocers out of business.
Despite these complaints and continuing problems with crime and racial tension in some neighborhoods, the grocers feel they are lucky compared with Koreans who opened other businesses, like nail parlors and dry cleaners. In recessions, people manicure their own nails and iron their own shirts, but they still must buy food, the grocers say.
And the grocers are looking to the future, when they feel their hard work will pay off again.
"I meet 10 store owners a day, and they cry out," Mr. Juch said. "But they are still opening their stores and they are still making their living, and we know the good times will come."

HEADLINE: Cuban Defectors Tell of Plotting Escapes at Games

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 29

 BODY:
Waiting outside an American immigration office to make formal appeals for political asylum today, eight Cuban athletes who evaded security guards to defect during the Central American Caribbean Games here told how they plotted their escapes.
They did not tell their families. One champion weight lifter, Emilio Lara, 23, said he had to keep his plans secret even from his older brother Pablo, a world record-holding weight lifter who was also among about 900 Cubans in Puerto Rico for the competition. 
 "You can't trust anybody," Emilio Lara said. "We took the chance at night and left."
 
39 Defections So Far
 The Cubans have been melting away from the games in record numbers. Thirty-nine people from the Cuban delegation, which includes athletes, state security agents and journalists, had departed as of today, including Andres Gibert, a top basketball player. Twenty-seven had formally sought political asylum by the end of the day, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said. The competition ends on Tuesday.
Guillermo Toledo, the leader of a small group of Cuban exiles, said at a news conference attended by some of the defectors that he had received telephone death threats since he started helping the athletes leave.
Cuban exiles say that the defections are an embarrassment to President Fidel Castro, and that the escapes were prompted by political repression and Cuba's deteriorating economy. The defectors agree, but add that their moves were aided by their presence in a Spanish-speaking commonwealth of the United States and the American immigration law that grants residency to nearly every Cuban who makes it to Puerto Rico. No other nationality has such a status, a fact that has been protested by Haitians and others fleeing to the United States.
"If we were in some place like Oklahoma, I would not have gone," said Dany Garcia, 18, a roller skater who left with a teammate after competing Friday night in Salinas, 60 miles southwest of San Juan.
 
'All or Nothing'
 Yamilet Amaro, 22, a field hockey star, was beaming as she left the immigration office arm in arm with her uncle, Tony Suarez, who fled Cuba for Miami in 1980. She was still wearing the red-white-and-blue team sweat clothes she had on when she and a teammate walked off the field on Saturday morning to leave the athletes' village with relatives.
Their relatives accompanied them today to the immigration offices.
She said she believed that the other Cubans in the athletes' village felt the way she did about leaving but that many did not do so because they did not want to leave children behind. Ms. Amaro left her mother in Cuba.
At the athlete's village, Cuban guards are doing 11 P.M. roll calls, and team members have to ask permission 24 hours in advance to meet with someone outside the village so security can be arranged.
For Marcos Hernandez, a 43-year-old Communist Party member and sports editor for Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency, the decision to leave meant a rejection of ideals he had defended for decades. But he said all Cuba was being forced into the black market to keep fed, and his salary of 340 pesos a month, considered high by Havana standards, brought less than the equivalent of $5 in the black market.
He said Cuban officials would "accuse me of being a traitor," but he added, "in reality, the person who was betrayed was me."

HEADLINE: Pact May Free Up Trade Faster Than the Traffic

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAREDO, Tex., Nov. 24

 BODY:
Never mind the "Streets of Laredo." The main concerns in this border town are the highways to Laredo. And the bridges. Both are clearly overwhelmed.
Even as they celebrate passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the boom times they are sure the agreement will bring, officials in communities along both sides of the 2,000-mile United States-Mexico border warn that the roads, bridges and customs stations needed to handle expanded trade between the two countries are already overburdened. And without major new construction, they say, the situation will only worsen. 
 In Laredo, the terminus of Interstate 35 and the busiest crossing over the Rio Grande, the number of trucks heading south has jumped even without the pact, to 800,000 last year from 185,000 in 1987 -- or more than 2,000 a day now. With Mexico and the United States projecting a doubling of their trade by the end of the century and another doubling by 2010, officials in Laredo say the transportation network needed to handle the next surge is simply not in place.
"There is already gridlock," said Carlos Villarreal, an assistant city manager in charge of border traffic. "We have trucks lined up for a mile and a half -- two miles, some afternoons -- waiting to cross the bridge."
 
No Magic Wand
 The trade pact, which takes effect Jan. 1, will not end searches of trucks and cars at the border. In fact, rather than being a magic wand to clear border backups, it could actually make things worse. While tariffs and other intangible trade barriers will be lowered to stimulate trade, the physical barriers -- clogged roads and bridges, and already strained customs and immigration checkpoints -- will remain, at least for now.
Some impoverished border communities say they wish they had Laredo's problems, but they lack the highways or rail lines to draw the traffic. While transportation officials in the four American border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have drawn up billions of dollars worth of ambitious schemes for more bridges and widened highways, nobody agrees on exactly how to pay for them. The most logical source is customs duties collected from increased trade, but the conundrum is that such revenue is actually expected to fall off as tariffs and other trade barriers are gradually eliminated under the trade pact.
In a few cases, the problem is less one of economics than of an almost spectacular failure in strategic planning.
A prime example is a gleaming new $100 million, eight-lane span over the Rio Grande, just 20 miles northwest of here. Officially known as the International Solidarity Bridge, it is more commonly referred to on both sides of the border as "the bridge to nowhere."
 
Poor Approaches
 There is wide agreement that the new bridge could eventually relieve the strain on the two bridges connecting downtown Laredo and its Mexican counterpart, Nuevo Laredo. Unfortunately, the Solidarity bridge was opened before officials on either side of the border had agreed to build approach highways, and they still haven't. For those few drivers either hardy or impatient enough to use the bridge, the actual border crossing is blessedly sweet. But the roads back to the main highways are narrow and treacherous, traversing a moonscape of mesquite and prickly pear.
In many cases where solutions are obvious, the problem is financial. There are plenty of big plans on the drawing boards, but there is considerable dispute among local, state and Federal officials over how to divide up and pay for the costs.
In financially strapped California, for instance, the state's Department of Transportation said the money budgeted for infrastructure improvements related to the trade pact was about $500 million, with $335 million involving the construction of a privately operated toll road from the Mexican border to San Diego. An additional $1.2 billion of projects remain without money.
In Texas, which has 23 international border crossings -- 20 bridges, two dam crossings and one hand-drawn ferry -- there are proposals for at least 11 more border bridges.
 
Unimaginable Prospects
 For the border communities on the American side, several of which routinely show up on the list of the poorest cities in the United States, the prospect of financing such gargantuan projects locally is all but unimaginable. Modest ventures are challenging enough.
In Laredo, for instance, Mayor Saul N. Ramirez Jr. said that he was working to get all the streets paved by 1995 so that outsiders would stop referring to his city as a "dusty border town."
Congestion and other problems arising from inadequate roads, bridges and customs checkpoints are even worse on the Mexican side. One day this month, diesel trucks waiting to get over the Rio Grande stretched for six and a half miles through Nuevo Laredo.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has promised his citizens 12,000 miles of new superhighways in the next few years, many to be built by private companies that will be guaranteed a percentage of the tolls.
 
A Byzantine Journey
 Shipping goods back and forth between the two countries is often a Byzantine journey of congested roads, bottlenecked bridges, bungled paperwork and lengthy customs searches to confirm a cargo list or look for drugs or other contraband. Rarely does everything go smoothly, and the trade pact is not likely to change that for at least several years.
Al Silva, the general manager of Labatt Food Service, a San Antonio-based company that services large hotels and restaurants in Mexico, said there is a joke about getting goods across the border and on to Monterrey, Mexico's main industrial city.
"How long does it take to get from San Antonio to Laredo?" he said. "Oh, about two and a half hours. And how long does it take to get from Nuevo Laredo to Monterrey? Oh, about two and a half hours. So how long does it take to get from San Antonio to Monterrey? Three days, if you're lucky."
The truck drivers who actually accomplish this feat could not agree more. There are typically three sets of them: Americans who make the long haul from as far away as New England or the Northwest; Spanish-speaking Americans and Mexicans who work for transfer companies based here and who are well-versed in dealing with customs officials, and Mexicans who drive goods to assembly plants near the border or into Mexico's interior. In many cases, goods are loaded on and off three different trucks.
"It is a nightmare," said 25-year-old Mario Mendoza, a Laredo truck driver who was waiting at Bridge No. 1 in Laredo to haul 15,000 pounds of Christmas lights from California on their last leg to Mexico City. Because he is paid by the trip, delays cut deeply into his income. "I can manage three crossings a day only if all goes well," he said. Some nights, Mr. Mendoza added, Mexican customs officials simply close their offices without notice.
"That's unbelievable, man," sympathized Jimmie Hooper, a 44-year-old trucker from Broken Arrow, Okla., who had just finished hauling a load of automobile parts from Battle Creek, Mich., to Laredo. "They're not open 24 hours a day? Canada is."
 
It's a Zoo Out There'
 His friend, Brian Bennett, who had met him here after hauling empty storage crates for automotive equipment from Lima, Ohio, said that as far as he was concerned highway problems began long before truck drivers got to the border. "I-35 could use another lane all the way from here to Dallas," he said."It's a zoo."
And neither Mr. Hooper nor Mr. Bennett, who work for Missouri-based Contract Freighters Inc., seemed at all thrilled with the prospect of liberalized trade rules allowing them to simply drive their trailers all the way to Mexico City, and for Mexican truckers to drive to American destinations. Both said they had heard stories about corrupt Mexican police officers and feared they could get costly and undeserved speeding tickets.
In some ways, the trade accord is already serving as a spur to deal with travel problems.
 
White Elephant
 In New Mexico, John Garcia, deputy chief of staff to Gov. Bruce King, said the Mexicans were looking seriously at finally linking their highways and railroads to an international cargo center in Santa Teresa, N.M., that has proven something of a white elephant. And a Mexican airline recently began direct flights from Mexico City to Albuquerque.
"These are things which we've been trying to do for 20 years and couldn't," Mr. Garcia said.
Some officials even wax about prospects for grandiose projects, like a high-speed bullet train from Dallas to Mexico city.
Others are less optimistic. In the border city of Nogales, Ariz., Mayor Jose Canchola said he worried that Congressmen from northern states who opposed the trade pact would try to sabotage it by blocking needed road and rail improvements. Even if their motives were not as venal, Mayor Canchola added, Federal authorities had generally ignored the region and might not be inclined to look at what was really needed -- not just highways and bridges, but more basic concerns like water and sewer lines. "We're like stepchildren here," he said. "We've been overlooked for many years."

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Reach 3-Year Low

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Crude oil prices plunged to their lowest levels in three years yesterday, sending the prices of gasoline and heating oil down along with them.
The inability of OPEC to agree last week to cut production has sent the oil market into turmoil, with crude oil for January delivery dropping $1.07, to $15.31 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That is the lowest price for domestic crude oil since June 1990, when it traded at $15.06. The market had been closed Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving. 
 The drop had an immediate effect on the products made from crude oil. One heating oil company in New York dropped its price 6 cents a gallon yesterday. In futures trading, unleaded gasoline fell 3.13 cents, to 40.67 cents a gallon, the lowest price since June 1989, when it traded for 38.95 cents a gallon. But distributors said prices might not be cut at gas stations for days, until existing supplies are sold.
Heating oil futures also fell, to 46.80 cents a gallon, down 3.26 cents.
 
'Good for the Consumer'
 "The prognosis is very good for the consumer," said Thomas Burns, the manager of economics at Chevron. "The lower prices will be brought into the system quickly."
Although economists cautioned that the lower prices might not be around long, the bond market pushed interest rates slightly lower on the theory that cheaper oil reduced the threat of inflation. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.23 percent yesterday from 6.24 percent on Friday. [Page D16.]
Stephen Brown, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that lower oil prices, if sustained, would reduce inflation, increase growth and narrow the trade deficit. Each dollar drop in oil prices would add about one-tenth of a percentage point to G.D.P. growth for each of the next two years, reduce consumer prices by three-tenths of 1 percent and narrow the trade deficit by $240 million a month.
"We're able to import oil for less money, and lower oil prices have a stimulative effect," Mr. Brown said.
Although the Dow Jones transportation average rose 17.10, to 1,756.99, because of the prospect of cheaper fuel, the overall stock market was less impressed with oil's decline, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.15, to 3,677.80. [Page D8.]
Oil prices have been falling most of the year, down about 15 percent since January, but it was OPEC's decision last Wednesday to keep its production at 24.52 million barrels a day that set off the latest drop in prices. The 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies 37 percent of the world's oil, said it expected increased winter demand to use up the oversupply, leading to firmer prices.
Also pushing down the price of oil was the possibility of even more supplies reaching the market as Iraq agreed on Friday to let the United Nations monitor its weapons production. That could lead the United Nations to lift the trade sanctions that have barred the sale of Iraqi oil since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. An end to sanctions could bring an estimated one million barrels of oil a day onto the market by next year.
 
Fears for OPEC's Future
 Frederick Leuffer, the oil analyst for Bear, Stearns, said he was concerned that OPEC seemed to signal that it was giving up its role as a cartel to support prices.
He recalled OPEC's statement last week that producing nations outside the organization, like Norway and Britain, should do their share and cut production. Mr. Leuffer said that sounded similar to what OPEC said in 1988 when prices plunged to about $12 a barrel.
"That scares me," he added. "It could mean the disintegration of OPEC as a price setter."
While the immediate effect of lower oil prices will mean lower costs for industrial users of energy, most analysts and economists cautioned that oil prices had bottomed out and could rebound.
Analysts said that the world oversupply was manageable, OPEC has been sticking to the quotas it set in September, and there was some upturn in demand in Europe. They said that there was a strong reaction driving down prices, but that more awareness of the realities would drive prices back up.
Jim Clark, the oil analyst for First Boston, said that it was hyperbole to talk about a glut of oil since the surplus was about five million barrels a day.
"That's a very manageable number," he said, representing about 10 percent of total daily consumption. "I would be wary that things have changed radically here."
While analysts were debating the long-term prospects, there was little doubt about the near-term fall of oil.
Trilby Lundberg, whose newsletters monitor gasoline prices at the pump, said that gas prices had been dropping in recent months, largely offsetting the increase from the 4.5-cents-a-gallon tax that was put through by Congress in October.
"Prices have been falling for many weeks," she said, and "they should fall further," although she would not estimate by how much.
Heating oil is already dropping. David Schildwachter, the manager of Schildwachter Oil Company in the Bronx, dropped the price of his heating oil twice yesterday, by a total of 6 cents, to $1.07 a gallon.
"Prices could continue to drop," Mr. Schildwachter said. "OPEC apparently can't get its act together. The perception is that supply will be more than adequate, so the price will drop."
 Alan Levine, an economist and commodity broker for Smith Barney Shearson, said the price of jet fuel, which is not traded on any market, would drop about 3 cents a gallon.
But some economists were at a loss as to what would happen. Jerrold Levine, the director of corporate studies for Amoco, quoted Yogi Berra, "I never make a forecast, especially about the future."

HEADLINE: Brazil Starts Signing Agreements on Debt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Brazil began signing agreements yesterday to reschedule $35 billion it owes to foreign banks and other private creditors.
With the largest foreign debt of any developing country, Brazil is the last major Latin American country to work out a so-called Brady repayment deal. 
 Such plans, first negotiated under Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in George Bush's Administration, have been crucial in ending the debt crisis that threatened some American banks and saddled Latin American nations with payments that threatened their economies in the 1980's.
Brazil's Brady deal will not become final until the country works out an agreement on economic changes with the International Monetary Fund. The creditors have set an April 15 deadline for that accord. An agreement was first announced in July 1992, then fell apart because of economic and political problems in Brazil, including the ouster of the President.
 
I.M.F. Agreement Still Needed
 "This is a big step, but we still need to have the I.M.F. agreement," said William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, which led the bank advisory committee in negotiations with Brazil.
He and Brazil's Finance Minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, signed the agreement in Toronto yesterday.
Mr. Rhodes estimated that more than half of the approximately 800 private creditors sent representatives to the signing ceremonies at the Four Seasons hotel in Toronto. The others are expected to sign in coming days.
Under the Brady deal, banks forgive some of the loans. In exchange, Brazil turns the loans into 30-year bonds and buys United States Treasury bonds to back them up. The loans are then safer for creditors, and can be sold like other kinds of bonds.
 
Total Debt Put at $120 Billion
 Brazil's total foreign debt is estimated at about $120 billion, the biggest among developing countries. Most of it is owed to governments or multinational institutions like the I.M.F.
"This is good news," said Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging-market equity research at Bear, Stearns & Company. However, he added, "you still have to be able to finance the newly rescheduled debt," which could be a problem, considering Brazil's huge deficit and 35 percent-a-month inflation.
But Mr. Rhodes said he did not expect Brazil to have trouble repaying because of a trade surplus and its large foreign-currency reserves.
He added that in 11 years of restructuring Latin American debt, the magnitude of the response to the Brazilian program -- 90 percent of the country's commercial bank creditors, or roughly 450 to 500 banks were represented -- was the largest he had seen on the first day of an agreement.
"Within the next week to 10 days," he said, he expects commitments for 95 percent of the debt, and the completion of the agreements by the end of December.
Reaching the 95 percent level would lead to payment of an additional 10 percent in overdue interest payments, he said.
Some bankers had feared that yesterday's signing could be held up by objections from the Dart family, who describe themselves as Brazil's fourth-largest private creditor, with 4 percent.
The Darts had protested after Brazil asked to reshuffle the mixture of bonds its creditors could receive. They wanted to hold uncollateralized bonds offering higher interest than those backed by United States Treasury bonds.
However, Melissa M. Krantz, a spokeswoman for the family, said, "We are not in fact changing our position."
Mr. Rhodes said he was still hopeful the Darts would back the agreement.

HEADLINE: High-Rise Co-ops for Bargain-Basement Prices;
New Development in Queens Plans to Use Unusual Financing Method to Lure Buyers

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
So what should it fetch: a new two-bedroom co-op, with a waterfront site and a knock-out view of Manhattan's skyline? The developers of an ambitious, self-contained community in Queens are counting on attracting scads of buyers with a bargain-basement price of just over $15,000.
That's neither a misprint nor a down payment, but rather the expected asking price for an apartment that the developers hope will become a cornerstone of a sprawling residential and commercial city proposed for the Hunters Point neighborhood of western Queens. The only catch is that the co-op will be born with a substantial debt that its owner-residents will have to pay down as part of their monthly maintenance charges. 
 Although the state has yet to give the go-ahead to build 550 units on the site across the East River from the United Nations, the unorthodox strategy for offering no-strings, unsubsidized but heavily indebted apartments for less than a comparable rental is already drawing attention.
 
A Loss-Leader Approach
 "This is a cannot-miss proposition," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is pressing for speedy development of the Queens waterfront as part of his economic recovery plan for the state.
The appeal to would-be residents is obvious: Roughly $15,000 would buy full ownership of an apartment without the credit entanglements of obtaining a mortgage. And although some might consider the $1,400 monthly maintenance fee steep for a co-op in Queens, the developers say it is more than competitive with rental apartments on nearby Roosevelt Island.
For the developers, the asking price is the price of enticing pioneer residents to what is now an industrial wasteland and what will long be a construction site. Like an electronics store that advertises a VCR at cost to generate traffic, the developers are relying on the bargain co-ops to bring their development to life and make it possible to sell later parts of the complex at high prices.
The co-op apartments will not be sold until construction is well under way, expected to be in 1995.
The only serious obstacle to the proposal is now being negotiated and agreement could come in the next several weeks. That issue is how development would proceed beyond the first 550 units -- in particular on how the profits or risk on later construction would be shared between the private developer, M.O. Associates, and the public agencies that are spending heavily to revitalize the area's infrastructure.
Hunters Point has been a gleam in urban planners' eyes since 1984, when the Port Authority was given the green light by the State Legislature to develop a 74-acre waterfront site for commercial and residential use. Like other multi-billion-dollar projects, however, it stalled in the real estate bust of the late 1980's.
 
Commitments Made Recently
 Only in the last two years did the project receive a new lease on life. The state's Urban Development Corporation created a subsidiary, the Queens West Development Corporation, to focus on the waterfront development.
The Port Authority has committed $125 million, roughly half of which has already been spent to buy land, meet environmental requirements and design a community with 6,400 apartments, myriad public facilities and some two million feet of commercial space.
For its part, the city has budgeted $30 million to start construction of roads, sewers and a one-and-a-quarter-mile waterfront esplanade and park -- in total, 19 acres of public open space. Private ferry service is slated to begin next summer.
But the missing keystone has been a private developer with the wherewithal to attract buyers to the now-barren site. And that's where M.O. Associates fits in.
The developer, a partnership consisting of a subsidiary of the Dreyfus Corporation, along with Bill Zeckendorf, James Wolfensohn, Worldwide Holdings, two Japanese companies and a handful of others, owns seven acres in Queens West and has options on another four and a half acres.
 
Luring the Pioneers
 One element of the developer's strategy is to build apartments it hopes will be a cut above cookie-cutter modern. M.O. Associates has hired Cesar Pelli, the architect of the Museum Tower above the Museum of Modern Art, to design a structure with higher-than-required ceilings and interesting detail.
The other part of the strategy was to fashion an attractive financing package.
The classic means for coaxing residents to a planned community is to subsidize the first residents. Typically, that has meant tax-exempt mortgages for moderate-income families.
M.O. Associates is trying a different approach, using the Wall Street technique of high financial leverage to make the seemingly unaffordable, affordable.
The cost of building the contemplated two-bedroom apartment is about $177,000, if one includes a 6 percent profit. And the developer might have attempted to offer the first units for $177,000, hoping that enough people with cash in the bank for the down payment -- typically 20 percent for co-ops, or about $35,000 -- would be tempted.
 
Stability in Payments
 But rather than require individual apartment buyers to come up with down payments and obtain mortgages, M.O. Associates decided to exploit the availability of bargain Federal mortgage insurance to finance the development wholesale. They plan to sell the two-bedroom, 850-square foot co-ops for a bit more than $15,000 and recover the remaining $162,000 by saddling the co-op with a share with a $90 million mortgage.
Of course, $162,000 is a lot of debt for a family of moderate means to bear, whether directly through an individual apartment mortgage or indirectly as the owner of shares in a heavily indebted co-operative. But since Federal insurance makes it possible to obtain a building mortgage at roughly 7.25 percent with repayment stretched over 40 years, the owner of a two-bedroom apartment would have to pay just over $1,000 a month as his or her share of the co-op's mortgage. The mortgage will be paid off after 40 years.
Another potential cost component of the monthly payments, local taxes, is not an issue; all new apartments built outside Manhattan are exempt from property tax for 20 years. Other continuing costs beyond the mortgage should be quite modest, the developers say.
M.O. Associates estimates that the total monthly maintenance (including service of the underlying mortgage) for a two- bedroom apartment would be about $1,400. For a typical middle-income New Yorker in the 35 percent tax bracket, that is roughly equivalent to $1,100 after taxes.
 
Freedom to Sell
 What's more, according to Fred Harris, vice president for the Trotwood Corporation, the Dreyfus subsidiairy, the absence of government subsidies beyond the routine tax breaks means that co-op owners would be free to sell their units for whatever the market would bear.
Almost all the hurdles facing a major urban development project have been surmounted. It has been reviewed and approved by both New York City and the local community board.
Members of the board of Queens West Development Corporation are somewhat muted while negotiations on distribution of profits continue. Stanley Brezenoff, the director of the Port Authority, will say only that "the approach holds a lot of promise."
But Larry Jacobson, director of investments for the Joint Industry Board, a labor-management group for local electrical contractors, is not shy about praising the project. "I have to tip my hat to these folks; they've done their homework. The design and the financing will keep working people in the city."

HEADLINE: World Trade Talks Underline French-German Differences

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Despite repeated assertions of solidarity between France and Germany, the long conflict in world trade talks involving France, Germany and the United States has demonstrated stark differences of economic confidence and outlook between France and Germany, Europe's largest industrial powers.
As negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for a global trade accord gather momentum over the next two weeks, against a Dec. 15 deadline, it seems clear that Germany's differences with France will sharpen and lead to considerable pressure from Bonn on the French Government to accept an agreement. 
 "Europe needs a successful Uruguay Round," said Lorenz Schomerus, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the German Economics Ministry, speaking of the round of trade and tariff talks started in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay. "We will continue to try to convince our partners of this interest," he said. "There's an 80 percent chance that we will get an agreement."
But an official close to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an accord was "possible only if the United States makes concessions." He added that failure to reach a GATT agreement "would not be too serious, apart from on the psychological level." Europe, he added, would "go on doing business in America, and vice versa."
France, with a tradition of state involvement in the economy, has been suspicious of free trade, wary of job losses to countries with cheaper labor like Taiwan, attached to the notion of subsidies, and committed to the idea that governments can solve economic problems.
"France's economic culture is not that of a market economy or free trade," Alain Madelin, the Economic Development Minister, said in an interview. "We have a market economy and we are free-traders, but we still do not adhere intellectually to these ideas. And at moments of fear, such as now, the instinct is to look to the state and be suspicious of the market."
Yet Germany, despite a flood of cheap goods from Eastern Europe and severe unemployment, has been committed to removing trade barriers, confident of its ability to exploit fast-growing markets in Asia, and firm in its conviction that a world trade accord would help ease Europe's severe economic problems.
"GATT is positive for Germany, so we tell our farmers to get out of the way," said Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft A.G., a big Frankfurt-based metals group. "GATT has to come through; we're talking essentials. But I'm afraid French industry has a lot of second thoughts about GATT and uses the agricultural issue as a shield."
The likes of Mr. Schimmelbusch scarcely exist in France. While it is easy to find French industrialists who have severe reservations about free trade, it is difficult to find outspoken advocates of a GATT accord. There is no significant counterweight to the powerful and protectionist French farmers' lobby, and the centrist former Economics Minister, Raymond Barre, has been almost alone among leading politicians in speaking forthrightly in favor of GATT.
 
A Nation Lacking Confidence
 "The French do not have confidence in their economy," remarked Michel Rainelli, a professor of international commerce at Nice University. "It's a paradox. We're the world's fourth-largest exporter, we sell high-speed trains and fighters to Korea and Taiwan, but our reaction in times of difficulty is to say we must protect ourselves because the competition is unfair."
France's contrast with Germany is particularly striking because the two nations' problems are somewhat similar. Over the last year, both have faced rapidly rising unemployment -- to 11.8 percent of the work force in France and 9.2 percent in Germany. Shrinking economies, pressures on budgets from falling revenue and increased unemployment payments, and widespread dissatisfaction have afflicted both countries.
While the effects of the end of the cold war -- particularly of reunification -- have been acute in Germany, many French people have found themselves disoriented by an unfamiliar new politics, with the old sharp delineation between left and right no longer of such importance.
These troubling changes have led to a fairly widespread belief in France that GATT's basic tenet -- free trade will produce more wealth and so ultimately, more jobs -- is false. Most recently, that view has been forcefully argued by Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, in a best seller called "The Trap," which says that free trade will only bring unemployment to Europe on a huge scale.
This French philosophical rejection of GATT goes well beyond the arguments about farm exports and subsidies to the French aircraft and movie industries that have paralyzed the negotiations and prompted jokes in Europe that GATT actually is short for the "General Agreement to Talk and Talk."
"GATT will only do harm," said Jacques Robin, a prominent sociologist. "We cannot compete against industries in Southeast Asia where the workers, often children, have no social protection. GATT means the progressive elimination of jobs in Europe through ever more merciless competition."
In Germany, however, even as cheap steel comes in from Russia and steelworkers say they are "the last victims of Stalinism," the commitment to free trade remains strong.
 
No Interest in Protectionism
 Berthold Huber, chief wage negotiator for I. G. Metall, a union representing more than three million German metalworkers, said: "We are against protectionism. It is not in anybody's interest to exclude the majority of the world's population from the improvements in living standards offered by free trade. Of course we are under huge pressure from cheap Czech and Russian steel imports, but even so, I. G. Metall has no intention of pressing for protectionism."
Asked whether Germany, with its high wages and relatively short working week, could remain competitive against Southeast Asia, Mr. Huber replied, "Up to now the case has been that we can compete."
In France, though, unions tend to see GATT as economic evil and Asian nations as thieves of French jobs.
"We are in the midst of an economic war," said Chantal Rey, an official of the leftist General Confederation of Labor. "GATT is negative for everybody because it will encourage robots, automation and cheap labor to take French jobs."

Precious Metals Drop as Oil Continues Its Steep Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Busines News

 BODY:
Prices of gold and other precious metals tumbled yesterday as the steep decline in oil prices cooled fears that inflation was about to return.
"What you are seeing today is the reaction to the drop in oil prices," said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody in New York. 
 Crude oil prices, a key indicator of inflation, plunged yesterday morning to their lowest levels in five years and oil traders voiced concerns about a global glut.
Gold prices tend to drop when prospects of inflation diminish because investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation, which threatens the value of other assets.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery fell $7.80, to $369.40 an ounce.
 
Silver and Platinum Fall
 Prices of other precious metals dropped even more than gold's 2 percent decline. Silver for December delivery fell nearly 20 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $4.445 an ounce on the Comex, and January platinum lost $9.40 an ounce, or 2.5 percent, to $366.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Despite yesterday's selling, some traders said they still expected gold to rally. They pointed to strong demand from China and India and said a growing imbalance between rising demand and stagnant supply could push prices higher even if inflation stayed low.
"In the long run, supply and demand are on our side," said Jon Nadler, vice president with the Bank of America in San Francisco.
For the time being, however, the plunge in crude oil prices has dampened the likelihood of a gold rally. Oil prices have fallen about 11 percent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided last week against cutting output beyond the current ceiling of 24.52 million barrels a day.
 
January Crude Off $1.07
 Yesterday, January crude fell $1.07, to $15.31 a barrel, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold prices had settled between $375 an ounce and $380 an ounce for 12 of the last 14 sessions, locked in place by the strong demand for delivered metal at the lower prices and concern that gold mining companies would use any rise above $380 an ounce as a chance to sell their production, potentially flooding the market.
"I think there are a lot of people willing to buy below $370 an ounce," Mr. Nadler said. "They want to be called when it punctures $368 an ounce." On the other hand, he said, expectations that producers will sell their metal if prices rise keep traders from pushing prices up.
"They buy it during the dips and they are content with a 3 percent or 4 percent gain" rather than risk a collapse, he said.

HEADLINE: State Aid and Whitman Tax Plan

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
In September, Christine Todd Whitman went to a Mercer County Chamber of Commerce luncheon to promote her campaign promise to cut income taxes for most New Jerseyans by nearly a third.
But the questions raised by the business group did not dwell on the prospect of lower taxes. Instead, the audience at the speech in West Windsor asked how such a huge cut could fail to force a reduction in state aid to wealthy districts like theirs -- and a similar increase in property taxes. Ultimately, Mrs. Whitman conceded, some wealthy school districts like West Windsor could lose aid under her plan. 
 Now Mrs. Whitman, elected governor with the help of suburbs like West Windsor, shows no signs of hedging her promise to cut income taxes. Indeed, she has challenged voters to recall her if she fails in her pledge.
School boards, teachers' unions, mayors and county executives are gearing up to defend their state financing from a Governor-elect who says all levels of government will have to tighten their belts.
From local points of view, Mrs. Whitman could not have picked a more sensitive target than the income tax. Under the State Constitution it is the lone source of revenue that has to be returned in full to local governments to offset property taxes. Cutting the income to this protected fund can only increase local governments' need to compete with other interests for a share of the state's remaining money, local officials say.
 
'Have to Make That Dollar Up'
 "We are very concerned about what the consequences of her plan may be," the executive vice president of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, William G. Dressel Jr., said. "For every dollar in state aid that is lost we have to make that dollar up through higher property taxes. Municipal officials take the heat for any state aid that we lose, and we can already feel the flames licking at our heels."
This month Mrs. Whitman sought to soothe the concerns by assuring the annual convention of the league that her budget cutting would not affect property taxes. Until Mrs. Whitman announces her plan the mayors fret.
"Every mayor of a big city is worried because Governor-elect Whitman is an unknown quantity to us, and she is not overly familiar with our situation either, and I'm worried that she may not see our needs," said Mayor Robert Brown of Orange, a city of 30,000. He is arguing not just for holding the line on state aid to cities, but also for increasing it.
"While she is cutting taxes," Mr. Brown said, "is she going to say, 'You can do with less'?"
The head of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, Bruce Coe, has called on Mrs. Whitman to postpone her tax cutting until 1995, at the earliest. That group estimates that the new governor will face a $2 billion deficit when the fiscal year starts July 1 and that adding the $500 million or so in tax cuts on top of that would create an impossible burden on local aid.
"The state spends $4.7 billion on state services and the rest on aid to the municipalities," Mr. Coe said. "And there's no way you can cut $2 billion from state operations. That leaves cutting from about $11 billion in local-aid programs, and cutting them would produce a tremendous increase in real-estate taxes."
Mr. Dressel is lobbying to put members of his group on a committee that Mrs. Whitman plans to appoint to study her tax pledge.
 
One-Third of Total State Budget
 But elsewhere officials are being guardedly polite toward Mrs. Whitman.
Deputy Mayor Thomas Rankin of Dover Township in Ocean County, who is a Republican, said: "I don't want to make an automatic assumption about Mrs. Whitman's plan, and I want to give her every opportunity to come forward with good ideas. But obviously our goal will be, if possible, to increase state aid and at least to hold our own."
Income-tax collections amounted to $4.7 billion this year, or nearly a third of the $15.7 billion state budget and half the amount that Trenton returns to local schools and governments as state aid. At current collection rates, Mrs. Whitman says, she will reduce that by $1.5 billion over three years.
Local officials worry that as Mrs. Whitman seeks to offset the lost income-tax revenues she also has to deal with the budget deficit and, under a court order, find more than $400 million in additional school aid for poor districts.
"I guess the new Governor is going to have sort of a dilemma on how she goes about this," said Dennis Testa, president of the New Jersey Education Association, the politically potent teachers' union. "Florio appointed a commission to recommend a long-term school-funding formula, and it appears that the commission is leaning in the direction of property-tax relief and more money's coming from the state, not less. A tax cut would make that kind of difficult to do."
New Jerseyans pay the second-highest property taxes of any state, after New Hampshire, and the highest among states with income taxes, despite steadily increasing aid from the income-tax fund. Most of Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 was aimed at reducing municipalities' dependence on property taxes, which are often unrelated to income and generally considered regressive. High property taxes also depress housing values by making houses harder to sell.
Although state aid increased under Mr. Florio, township spending has increased faster, and local governments now rely on property taxes for more than 45 percent of total income, compared to 30 percent in 1979.
In the transition period Mrs. Whitman is saying that she has no specific plan for delivering the keystone of her campaign.
The horse-trading over tax cuts and aid will quite likely turn in part on just how much schools and municipalities can curb costs. Their officials say, in general, "not much."
"Most municipalities in New Jersey are already cut to the bone," said Mr. Rankin, who is expected to lead the League of Municipalities next year. "You won't find much in the way of extras. We pick up the garbage. We police the streets. We provide planning, and we pave the roads, and those things have to go on whatever the Governor does."
Roughly three-quarters of school budgets go toward salaries, Mr. Testa said, and two-thirds of the 600 districts have union contracts with two or three years to go. That puts most budgets beyond the reach of Mrs. Whitman's three-year plan, he said.
The union's greatest influence now lies with the Legislature, whose members are up for re-election in two years. Republican legislators, Mr. Testa said, are signaling that they will not repeat the mistake that they believe the Democrats made in 1990, when they blindly followed Mr. Florio's order to raise taxes.
"Maybe she'll be lucky and we'll get a rapid economic recovery," he added. "Then everything will be easier for everyone."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Oil-Inspired Rally Is Short-Lived Early Buyers Sell

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The oil-inspired rally did not last long in the bond market yesterday. After a surge in bond prices across the board early in the day, buyers seemed to disappear and those who bought early apparently sold later to lock in some quick profits.
The yield of the 30-year bond wound up only slightly down, at 6.23 percent, while yields on shorter Treasury securities closed unchanged or up slightly. 
 As yesterday's session opened, there were expectations of a sharp drop in oil prices following the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree last week on production curbs to support oil prices.
 
 
West Texas Intermediate
 And prices did decline, with the January futures price of a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude falling $1.07 in New York. This decline also helped pull down the Commodity Research Bureau index of commodities, which dropped 3 points, to 220, and the price of gold, which ended down $7.80 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Altogether, the three declines spelled good news on inflation.
But while this news was enough to get some buying started, it was not enough to keep the buying going. One of the reasons is that this will be a big week for new economic data, including the employment report for November, which is to be released Friday.
Traders are waiting for this report to get their first inkling of November's results and a glimpse of whether fourth-quarter economic growth is going to be as strong as many expect. The consensus estimate is that the gross domestic product is rising at an annual rate of 4 percent, more than twice the rate in the first half of the year.
 
 
Fear of Strong Growth
 A fear that the strong growth in the fourth quarter will continue into the first quarter of 1994 is one of the reasons for the recent selloff in the bond market.
Another reason price increases failed to hold is that the uncertainty on the economic outlook is keeping traders cautious and prices and yields in a relatively narrow trading range, leaving the market without any clear direction. John Costas, the managing director of Government trading at CS First Boston, said the trading range for the yield on the 30-year bond was now between 6.12 percent and 6.38 percent.
"There is not a lot of conviction in the market right now," Mr. Costas said. Therefore, he said, news can move the market quickly. But, he added, the market can turn just as swiftly when traders and investors decide the limits of the trading range are near.
Noting that the yield on the 30-year bond fell as low as 6.18 percent yesterday, Mr. Costas suggested that once traders got this close to the bottom of the range they decided to take profits.
Mr. Costas even argued that the rally in the morning did not have a lot to do with oil. He said for oil prices to move the market significantly, traders and investors would have to believe that the decline was going to last for some time. But he said that was not certain right now.
He said the buying was prompted more by investors with a lot of cash that had accumulated during the Thanksgiving holiday and had to be put to work.
 
 
Foreign Investors
 Mead L. Biggs, the manager of risk trading at Deutsche Bank Government Securities, said that much of the buying he saw in the morning was from foreign investors or traders, rather than domestic buyers. He said the jump in the morning was also fueled by traders who had to buy to cover their positions to prevent losses as the market moved higher.
In trading in the secondary market around 5 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond was up just 7/32 of a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was down to 6.23 percent, from 6.24 percent Friday. Earlier in the day, the price of the bond was up more than a point with the yield at 6.18 percent.
Among shorter-term maturities, the yield on the two-year note was up to 4.15 percent, from 4.14 percent Friday as the price slipped 1/32 . The yield on the five-year note was up to 5.08 percent from 5.07 percent as the price fell 2/32 .
In the weekly Treasury auction, the average discount rate on the three-month bill was 3.12 percent, down from 3.14 percent last week, and 3.26 percent on the six-month bill, down from 3.30 percent.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Stocks in Retreat, With Dow Falling 6.15

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices turned downward late yesterday, failing to respond to declining oil prices and an upturn in existing-home sales. The early gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, which finished off 6.15 points, to 3,677.80, was prompted by a strong performance from the transportation index.
The drop in the price of crude oil to its lowest level in nearly five years, lifted transportation issues with the prospect of cheaper fuel, but also caused oil stocks to fade. 
 Volume was heavy at 272.7 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up from the abbreviated trading session on Friday when just 90.2 million shares were traded. The number of losing issues narrowly outpaced gainers by 1,067 to 1,053.
 
Increase in Home Sales
 The market was also helped by a 3.6 percent increase in existing-home sales in October, another sign of an improving outlook for housing .
Some analysts note that with oil prices at their lowest in more than five years, interest rates may remain low over the intermediate term, helping both stocks and bonds. Edwin Walczak chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A., the United States arm of the Swiss Private Bank, said yesterday's market performance was a muted response to what otherwise would be good news on falling oil prices. "Frankly it was not much of a response, with beneficiary stocks making only half-hearted advances and not as vehement as would have been expected," Mr. Walczak said.
For example, low oil prices and tax cuts are less inflationary and typically good for the market, especially the financial sector. "But the market closed down, with the down volume exceeding up volume and financials mixed," Mr. Walczak said. "Surprisingly they and bonds didn't do better,"
One explanation is that the market does not expect the oil decline to be long-lived. "Another, I think could be that the market over all is richly priced and incapable of rallying to good news," Mr. Walczak said.
Some analysts expect the Christmas season to be favorable for retailers, but investors failed to translate those expectations into higher stock prices.
And as in last week's trading, the immediate beneficiaries from a drop in oil prices were the transport issues. In trading yesterday United Airlines, rose 3 1/4, to 148 1/2. Dobbs International Services, a subsidiary of the Dial Corporation, also said the acquisition of 15 United Airlines flight kitchens was on schedule and expected to continue through early 1994.
A $400 million contract for cellular-telephone equipment awarded to Hughes Network Systems lifted the stock price for General Motors by 1/2, to 54 3/8. Hughes is a unit of G.M.
Paine Webber raised or initiated ratings on several banks, gaming stocks, semiconductor makers and some toy manufacturers. Among the banks was J. P. Morgan, up 1 1/8, to 70 3/4, and raised to neutral from unattractive. Society Corporation, a bank holding company, was upgraded to attractive from neutral and rose 3/8, to 29 1/2, while BankAmerica was reiterated with a buy rating, closing at 43 5/8, up 1.
 
Buy Recommendation for TRW
 A strong buy recommendation, up from neutral, by Michael Lauers, a Kidder, Peabody analyst, apparently sent TRW stock up 3 3/4, to 65 5/8. Traders said the analyst put the stock on the brokerage house's recommended list, citing a drop in the price and expectations for an acceleration in earnings through 1995.
Elsewhere, Jenny Craig fell 1 1/4. The weight-loss company sees second- quarter earnings substantially below the level a year ago because of of a weak economy, particularly in California.
Traders said King World Productions, a distributor of feature films and television productions, was up 1/2, to 41 3/4, on takeover speculation .
Because of falling oil prices, oil stocks weakened, as investors assessed the negative impact of lower prices on company earnings. Atlantic Richfield was down 1 7/8, to 103; Texaco fell 3, to 63 1/2, and Mobil fell 1/4, to 75.
Cabletron Systems, which makes computer-networking products, was up 4 to close at 104 1/2. Traders said Paul Johnson, a CS First Boston analyst, called networking the "fastest- growing sector in technology."

Dollar Gains Against Yen But Falls in Mark Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the Japanese yen, which came under pressure in reaction to a sharp selloff in the Tokyo stock market.
But the dollar lost ground against European currencies after positive American economic news failed to attract new buying of dollars. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 109.20 yen, up from 108.75 yen on Friday. The drop in the yen came as stocks plunged in Tokyo, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues falling 3.9 percent.
Traders said the selloff of Tokyo stocks had emphasized the weakness of the Japanese economy and that had put pressure on the yen. Andrew Gonzalez, corporate foreign exchange dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the stock crisis had also led to speculation that Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, might cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.
"If that happened, money would flow out of Japanese assets into higher-yielding assets," he said.
The dollar rallied against European currencies overnight amid speculation that the German central bank might cut official interest rates at its meeting Thursday.
The dollar hit a high of 1.7181 marks after some upbeat news about the American economy -- a hefty 3.6 percent rise in sales of existing homes in October. But the rally lost steam and the dollar slumped as follow-through buying failed to materialize. "Every time the dollar gets close to 1.72 marks, it finds heavy resistance," Mr. Gonzalez said.
The dollar fell to 1.7091 marks in late New York trading, from 1.7135 Friday.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4890, up from $1.4774 late Friday. Other late dollar rates compared with Friday's quotes included: 1.4894 Swiss francs, down from 1.4995; 5.9025 French francs, down from 5.9225; 1,696 Italian lire, up from 1,694; and 1.3357 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3297.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stock Funds Continue to Boom but Bonds Falter

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors continued to plow money into foreign stock funds this month, but the interest in American bonds waned as interest rates ticked up, fund managers said yesterday.
Some groups even reported net outflows from bond funds, an unusual occurrence in a year when investors have invested record amounts in such funds. But others said that bond funds took in modest amounts of money despite the higher rates, which resulted in lower bond prices that produced losses for many funds. 
 The comments came as the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported a record October in terms of cash flow for stock funds, driven largely by the big flows into foreign funds. Domestic stock funds continued to report strong sales, but well below the records set earlier this year.
 
Various Records
 Over all, sales for equity funds came to $13.3 billion in October, 10 percent higher than the record of $12.1 billion, set in August. Global and international stock funds took in $5.6 billion, a record. The flow into domestic stock funds, $7.7 billion, was the highest since April, when such funds took in $9.2 billion.
Many groups reported declines in November from that record pace, but added that sales were still strong. "I'm used to saying it was another record month," said Stephen Gibson, a managing director of Putnam Investments. "Not this time."
T. Rowe Price was one fund group that reported small net outflows from bond funds this month, mainly from investors who moved cash to money market funds in apparent expectation that rates would continue to rise. But Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund group, reported that all of its bond funds showed small net inflows so far this month.
Both Price and Fidelity sell funds directly to investors, rather than through brokers, and tend to see more volatile results. At State Street Research in Boston, which sells through brokers, fixed-income sales were flat.
Over all, bond funds reported net inflows of $10.4 billion in October, up from $7 billion in September. The comments of the fund managers indicated that figure would be down this month. Most of the swing in October came from the revival of junk bond funds, which took in a net $1.4 billion after seeing $1.1 billion flow out in September as some market-timing services turned negative on high-yield bonds.
The cash-flow figures reflect sales and redemptions, as well as net transfers between different types of funds. They do not include reinvested dividends.
Through the first 10 months of 1993, equity funds took in a total of $104.2 billion, up 34 percent from the $78 billion taken in during all of 1992, the previous record. For bond funds, the first 10 months showed net inflows of $103.8 billion, below the full-year record of $108.6 billion, set in 1986.
The flow to foreign stocks has followed strong performance in many foreign markets this year. At T. Rowe Price, Steve Norwitz, a spokesman, reported that 80 percent of the money going into stock funds was going into international funds, with most of that concentrated in two funds, the flagship International Fund and the New Asia Fund, which invests in Asian countries except Japan. New Asia grew from about $300 million in assets at the beginning of the year to $1.7 billion now.
At Fidelity, Neal Litvack, an executive vice president, said its Latin America and Emerging Markets funds were the biggest sellers.
Within the domestic markets, the riskier stock funds have seen something of a revival. The industry figures showed $2.4 billion went into aggressive growth funds in October, the highest since November of last year.

HEADLINE: A Re-usable Solution to Health Costs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Until recently, hospitals could mark up the price of disposable supplies like scrub gowns and certain instruments by 400 percent or so and bill the patient, paying little attention to the millions of dollars they spent a year on items used only once.
But that is no longer the case. Under pressure from the Clinton Administration and private payers to reduce spending, a growing number of hospitals are questioning the economics of these throwaway supplies, which are estimated to account for 80 percent of the $1.2 billion hospitals will spend this year on operating room equipment. 
 Hospitals also pay heavily to have medical waste carted to landfills.
"As cost and the environment become more of an issue, hospitals are revisiting the whole issue of whether they should be using disposable supplies," said Michael Neely, the president-elect of the American Society of Hospital Materials Management, a professional group.
These new concerns have set hospital suppliers scrambling. Vendors of disposables have in some cases offered to lower their prices to keep their contracts. Some are now plugging re-usable products. Meanwhile, a new industry has cropped up for laundering and sterilizing hospital garments.
In addition to cost and environmental concerns, worker safety is also driving the shift to re-usables. Under Federal worker safety rules, hospitals are legally responsible for safeguarding physicians, nurses and technicians in the operating room. That responsibility prompted the R Adams Crowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore to switch to a new type of re-usable, protective operating gown that it deemed to be safer than disposables.
 
Worry in Operating Room
 Tricia Prather, a senior operating room nurse, said there were concerns about contact with the blood of accident and crime victims arriving by helicopter and ambulance at Crowley's five operating rooms. They often required lengthy surgery with great loss of blood and there was no time to determine if they had AIDS or hepatitis B.
She said the center had changed to liquid-proof re-usable operating gowns after an orthopedic surgeon reported that a patient's blood had soaked through a supposedly impenetrable, disposable gown to her skin.
Even the lowliest items -- plastic trays, paper wrapping for sterilized instruments, and the flimsy paper berets that are worn in the operating room -- are getting intense scrutiny.
Some operating rooms are going back to stainless steel trays. Some are switching to gowns interwoven with strong plastic thread that cost $60 to $90 each but may last through 80 to 125 washings and sterilizings.
And some hospitals are also reviewing spending for throwaway versions of the tiny laparoscopic instruments that are frequently used to remove gall bladders and for other surgical procedures. Most of these minimally invasive instruments are thrown away, but hospital supply executives said sales of re-usable versions were rising. Baxter International, which sells re-usables and disposables, said re-usables had grown to $250 million to $300 million of the $1.1 billion market for laparoscopic instruments.
 
Questioning 'Sacred Cows'
 "All the sacred cows and traditional practices in hospitals are being questioned," said Jeff Cutler, the marketing chief for re-usable gowns at Baxter , the world's largest hospital supplier, which is based in Deerfield, Ill.
As the competition heats up, some suppliers of disposable goods have lowered prices and even offered to take back used plastics for recycling.
Lehigh Valley Hospital, an 800-bed teaching hospital in Allentown, Pa., recently notified the supplier of paper wraps for its sterile instruments that the hospital might switch to re-usable linens.
"They quickly dropped the price by 20 percent," Dr. Elliot Sussman, the president of the hospital, said. "We saved $50,000 a year."
Bill McFaul, the president of McFaul & Lyons, a hospital materials management consulting firm based in Trenton, said American hospitals "could save $750 million a year by better selection of appropriate reusable products."
 
Savings From Re-usables
 An independent study made two years ago found that switching to re-usables could save as much as 16.6 percent on supplies at some hospitals, said John Berks, the product marketing director of Voluntary Hospitals of America, a buying service for 900 hospitals.
Diana Lyons, a nurse who is the executive vice president of McFaul & Lyons, said the disposables were mainly an American phenomenon. Canadian hospitals, operating on tight budgets, have always reprocessed two-thirds of their sterile supplies, she said. The Europeans also have stayed loyal to re-usables.
An army of entrepreneurs is helping hospitals here make the transition. Many hospitals were built without laundries in the high-flying 1970's, when hospitals wallowed in easy money.
Now they are looking at starting in-house recycling or sending the garments for sterile cleaning out to huge computerized laundromats, many of which are operated by a handful of large supply companies.
 
Supplier Help Conversion
 Some hospitals have converted to re-usables with the help of Medline Industries, a family-owned hospital supplier based in Mundelein, Ill. Medline provides financing and will sometimes build a hospital a laundry.
The Standard Textile Company, a family-owned manufacturer based in Cincinnati, fueled the trend to free-standing sterilizing plants in the late 1980's. Standard, Baxter and Amsco International Inc., which makes sterilizing devices, have opened 20 new sterilizer laundries. At least 13 more are planned.
The Baltimore trauma center recently began renting re-usable operating gowns from Amsco, which opened a washing and sterilizing plant last January at Eldridge, Md., near the Baltimore-Washington Airport.
David A. Nelson, the chairman of Amsco, which had $498 million in sales in 1992 and is based in Pittsburgh, said the company had signed gown-processing contracts with more than 100 hospitals. He predicted that 70 percent of the operating gowns in the country's 6,000 hospitals would be re-usable within five years, reversing the current 80 to 20 ratio in favor of disposables.
 
Computer Inventory System
 The Eldridge plant serves 10 hospitals, some as far away as Philadelphia. A computerized, bar-coded system keeps the inventory separated by hospital.
Amsco will open its ninth center next month in Salt Lake City to service the Intermountain Health Care System. Wolfgang Peleschka, the management chief of Intermountain's materials, said the hospital chain hoped to eventually save $250,000 a year under the new system.
Mr. Nelson, who formerly headed Baxter's disposable textiles business, joked that he was "a born again recycler."
"Amsco has high hopes for re-usables; Baxter has only moderate hopes," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Baxter derived $4.5 billion of its $8.5 billion in revenues last year from the sales of supplies to American hospitals. Analysts said Baxter had about half the market for operating room sterile materials.
 
Competitive Markets
 Johnson & Johnson and Kimberly-Clark, which also make and sell disposable gowns for operating rooms, said they had no plans to expand into re-usables.
Baxter and Amsco are going toe to toe over re-usables in some markets. In Baltimore this month, the Cowley trauma center's sister operating room in the University of Maryland Medical Center chose Baxter's reusable gowns over Amsco's.
Jeanne Queen, an operations manager at the Maryland Medical Center, said the choice was partly based on civic concerns: Baxter was ready to open a sterilizing plant in the job-hungry inner city and join a three-sided arrangement with the Medical Center and a local minority-owned supplies distributor.
As for the miniature surgical instruments, the economics and safety of re-usables versus disposables is hotly disputed.
In a recent study commissioned by the United States Surgical Corporation, the largest maker of disposables, Deloitte & Touche, the accounting and consulting firm, found that single-use laparoscopic instruments were "a cost-effective alternative to re-usable instruments."
Some makers of laparoscopic instruments have developed products that combine re-usable and disposable components. Leon C. Hirsch, the chairman of United States Surgical, which had $500 million in sales of disposable instruments last year, said an important concern was to insure that the disposable parts were not re-used improperly.
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates surgical instruments and operating room gowns, recently announced proposals for tighter controls for new re-usable devices. Under the proposed rules, the manufacturers would have to show that the devices were still safe and effective after reprocessing.

HEADLINE: Homelessness Hitting Home: A Death on HUD's Doorstep

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Inside the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary Henry G. Cisneros was reminding a meeting of subordinates this morning that reducing homelessness was his agency's top goal.
Outside, 10 stories below, the police were carting away the corpse of a homeless woman who had died overnight at the bus stop across the street. 
 A dead homeless person at the doorstep of the nation's top officials on homelessness: There are people who would see that as a symbol of the Government's failures, and Mr. Cisneros is among them.
 
'I Know I'm Not Alone'
 The death of the woman, identified by the police as Yetta M. Adams, 43, coincided with a battle with White House budget officials over his desire to double the housing agency's annual budget on programs for the homeless, to $1.5 billion.
"You could describe me as a secretary who's shamelessly describing the death of this woman while talking about budget increases," he said in an interview later, "but I'm told there were homeless people outside who knelt in prayer at this woman's body. So when I raise my voice in search of funds, I know I'm not alone."
Democrats last year were scathing in their depiction of President George Bush as out of touch with America's grim realities, and Mr. Cisneros has gone as far as spending the night in a homeless shelter in New York to show he was not. But today he needed no field trip to grasp the harshness of city streets. Word of the death traveled through the department as fast as fire.
Outside, little could be learned about the woman who had died on a bench, beneath a blanket, surrounded by shopping bags and carrying medication. Quintin Peterson, a public information officer at the Police Department, described the woman only as "a person with no fixed address" who seemed to have died of natural causes. An autopsy will be performed, the police said.
Homeless people on the street nearby knew her as Brenda and said she had spent many nights sharing a heat grate a few blocks away.
Sharon Maeda, a deputy assistant secretary for public affairs, said she frequently passed Ms. Adams near a subway stop and chatted with her outside the HUD building.
"She was very polite and did not show the outward signs of being mentally ill or being on drugs or anything like that." said Ms. Maeda, who added that she had encouraged the woman to enter a shelter earlier this fall. "I told her it wasn't safe for her to be out alone as a woman. She said, well, she knew that, but she said she could take care of herself."
Another HUD employee, gazing out a headquarters window this afeternoon, grew sardonic counting seven police cars, five transit authority cars, two police motorcycles, a fire truck and an ambulance.
"It's just strange to see how many resources a person gets after they die -- not a fraction of that beforehand," she said.
The vendors who line the sidewalk where Ms. Adams was found say she had been lying under a blanket throughout the early morning as commuters streamed past. Finally, about 9 A.M., a city transit supervisor stopped at the bus stop shelter and tried to shake her awake.
Kim Tien, who runs a hot dog stand 10 yards away, said Ms. Adams had been carrying four shopping bags of belongings and wearing a money belt with bills, change and half a dozen vials of the medication.
"It's terrible," Ms. Tien said. "She's the homeless people. Sometimes she stopped by my stand."
 
Friends Remember
 On the same block, several homeless men remembered their companion fondly, though they could add little to the biography of the woman they called Brenda.
"I know Brenda about three years," said Johnny Gross, 33, who recalled that he had shared a heat grate with her on several nights. "All I know is she was a good lady and she didn't bother nobody. She helped other homeless people out."
Antonio Johnson, 37, paused from a day labor job distributing handbills to add to the street-corner eulogy. He said that the vials were for blood pressure medication and that Brenda had no history of the mental illnesses that can drive people to the streets.
 
'You've Got to Drink'
 "She was sharp in the mind," he said. "She had it all."
"She'd drink," he said. "You've got to drink out here to stay warm. She had problems, too, family problems, all kinds of problems."
Mr. Johnson said the area, filled mostly with Government buildings, sandwiched between a rail line and an Interstate highway, was popular with homeless people because of its safety. He said the woman even used to sleep on the grates there with a 3-year-old son, Darnell, although no on could confirm that detail.
"Nobody shooting nobody," he said, although he contended that the police sometimes moved the homeless from the grates.
Mr. Johnson was unaware that the people who work inside the towering concrete building nearby were responsible for policy on the homeless. He frowned as the news sank in. "Why don't they help us then?" he said.

 The city has been closing some of its shelters and many homeless people they the reamining ones are too dangerous to enter.
In September, Mr. Cisneros outlined a plan to turn the District of Columbia into a national model for serving homeless people.
The plan would spend $20 million over two years in an effort to shift the city's emphasis from emergency shelters toward social services and permanent housing.
There is no way of knowing how many homeless people die on the streets each year -- or how many die of exposure, as opposed to disease. But winter deaths of street people are a common occurrence in many cities, and advocates have even appeared before Congress carrying their cremated remains.
 
Officials Angry
 But today, HUD officials sounded every bit as angry and impatient as the advocates who have attacked the agency over the past decade.
"I don't think we have the right to feign surprise," said Andrew M. Cuomo, an Assistant Secretary who oversees the department's homelessness programs. "This nation has not remedied the situation in more than a decade. If this is allowed to go on, more and more people will die."
In the interview this afternoon, Mr. Cisneros complained that the District had not yet passed the local legislation it needs to begin spending the money. From Ms. Adams's limited biography, she seemed to fit the profile of the people the model is aiming to serve: those fearful of shelters and resistant to services.
Mr. Cisneros picked up a copy of Time magazine, with an article about a backlash against the homeless, and complained that the public was growing callous.
"A homeless person should not have to die on the streets, whatever the cause," he said.

HEADLINE: New Races (Their Own) for 2 Bush Sons

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
At a campaign stop at Olin Ordnance, a weapons factory in St. Petersburg, Fla., Jeb Bush talked to the employees about how he would like to abolish the Florida Department of Education and impose tougher penalties on teen-agers caught with guns.
Then the Republican candidate for governor asked if there were any questions. 
 "You're familiar with the Skull and Crossbones Society?" Jackie Miller, a secretary, asked. "I mean, Skull and Bones."
"Yeah, I've heard about it," he replied drily, about the Yale secret society to which both his father and grandfather belonged.
"And you're familiar with the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations?" she asked.
"Yeah," the candidate said, in a weary voice.
"Well, can you tell the people here what your family membership in that is?" she demanded. "Isn't your aim to take control of the United States?"
In its own surreal way, the moment perfectly captured the difficulties faced by Jeb Bush, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor in Florida, and his older brother, George, who is involved in the same pursuit in Texas, as they try to step out of the shadow of their famous father, George Bush.
The former President had been hit with the same wacky accusation about being "a One World tool of the Communist-Wall Street internationalist conspiracy" in his Texas Senate bid in 1964. In his autobiography, the senior Mr. Bush wryly noted that one John Birch Society pamphlet went so far as to suggest that Barbara Bush's father, the president of McCall publishing, was putting out a Communist manifesto called Redbook Magazine.
Jeb Bush told Ms. Miller politely that any implication that his family wanted to undermine America's sovereignty was insulting. "There are very few people who have served this country with the honor and distinction of my Dad," he said.
As he rode to another event afterward, the slender 6-foot-4 candidate observed, "As the son of a famous person, I carry the pluses and minuses of past wars."
Unlike the 40-year-old John Ellis Bush (known as Jeb), who faces some stiff primary competition, the 46-year old George Walker Bush (known as George W. or Junior), a managing partner in the Texas Rangers baseball team, seems to have an easy road to the Republican nomination. But once each is past the primaries, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida is considered more vulnerable than his counterpart in Texas, Ann W. Richards.

 If the tart-tongued oldest Bush son wins, he will have the satisfaction of running against the tart-tongued woman who mocked his father at the 1988 Democratic National Convention as a preppy with a silver foot in his mouth.
Ms. Richards has already been diminishing her potential rival by referring to him as Shrub, as in a small bush, and Junior. He is not technically a Junior because he has only three of his father's four names. As Ms. Richards drily observed to advisers, "He's missing his Herbert."
In Texas, where they like a little barbed wire in their political rassles, everyone is looking forward to 1994. "This is going to be a fun year, that's all," said State Senator David Sibley, who introduced George W. Bush at a Waco rally.
The older brother's advisers predict that Bill Clinton, who took the White House with the support of Ms. Richards, will be an albatross for the Governor. George W. denies there is any motivation of avenging the family name. "I bear no ill will personally toward the current Governor," he says, but he adds that there is more to running the state than "funny sound bites."
"I'm a proud child," he said at a rally in College Station, the home of his father's Presidential library, at Texas A&M University. "Being George Bush's son -- they say, is it a plus or a negative? It's a huge plus as far as I'm concerned, and by the time the campaign is over, people are going to know that, in this George Bush, they've got someone to be the governor who knows what it means to fight for values."
 
Benefits in Curiosity
 Although the Bushes also allude to the minuses of being related to a President who was decisively rejected by the public last year, many strategists consider their name their main selling points. It provides instant recognition and access to political and fund-raising networks, and allows them to finesse the fact that neither has held elective office. George lost a bid for Congress in 1978.
When a recent Texas Poll showed that George W. Bush was within eight percentage points of Ms. Richards, the Governor's supporters suggested that this was probably because many respondents mistook the son for the father.
Jeb Bush acknowledges that his "semi-celebrity" status helps. "It almost embarrasses me to say it, because I don't think I'm a celebrity by any stretch of the imagination, but I think I do get bigger crowds," he said. "There's more curiosity."
The younger brother said he drew his lessons in the '92 race from the Democrats. "My father served with distinction in a different time," he said. "But it's 1993, and the country has changed dramatically. The way the Clinton campaign used alternative means of communication -- it was about breaking the mold of how you campaign."
Imbued with the Bush creed of competition, the two brothers have been eager to run for years. As Jeb has noted, "We were taught never to sit on the sidelines."
When George W. Bush considered running for governor in 1990, his mother urged him against it while his father was still in the White House. And Jeb Bush likes to tell the story about how, when he was head of the Dade County Republican Party in 1986, he called his father to discuss a possible run for Congress.
The father rattled off points to consider: Would it be too much of a sacrifice for his wife and three children? Could he afford to keep two houses in Miami and Washington? Jeb decided to wait.
 
Drawbacks in a Double Race
 The novelty of two Bushes running for governor has spurred commentary about "Rockefeller-style dynasties," and memories of other Presidential offspring who tried the political route successfully (John Quincy Adams and Robert Taft) and unsuccessfully (Robert Todd Lincoln and Maureen Reagan).
Some strategists say it will be harder for Jeb Bush, who announced first and who has more political experience, including a stint as Florida Secretary of Commerce, now that his brother has entered the race.
"It hurts because it makes it seem more like a political grab by Tweedledee and Tweedledum, a matter of family obligation, rather than that they really want to do something for the people," said Ray Strother, a Democratic consultant.
Jeb Bush worries that, with George running, too, "it turns it into a People magazine story," but shrugs that he has "no control" over his brother.
Jeb's advisers said privately that he was annoyed at the way some of his campaign lines had been co-opted by George.
After Jeb Bush said, "I am running for governor not because I am George and Barbara Bush's son; I am running because I am George P. and Noelle and Jeb's father," George W. began saying: "I am not running for governor because I am George Bush's son. I am running because I am Jenna and Barbara's father."
Karl Rove, an Austin consultant working for George, laughingly acknowledges: "George heard Jeb use the line and thought it was so good, he stole it. He admits it."
Unlike the Kennedy clan, which has offered the same brand of liberal Democratic politics through several generations, the Bushes span the trajectory of Republican politics. Grandfather Prescott Bush, a Connecticut Senator, was an Eisenhower Republican. George Bush started as a hybrid of moderate Republicanism and the more conservative politics of his adopted state, and then leaped to the right as Ronald Reagan's Vice President.
The sons do not display their father's flexibility, sticking instead to the strict conservative line, which they attribute to their years in Texas. Like their father, they are fervent believers in a market economy. They oppose abortion, and they believe in strengthening local control over education and in boot camps for juvenile offenders.
As for adult sexual offenders, George W. Bush says, "I believe most are beyond rehabilitation. I wish they'd put them away and make them stay there."
It is odd to watch the brothers on the trail, reflecting bits and pieces of their parents. Unlike their father, they both speak in whole sentences.
George W. Bush is introduced as "a Yale graduate, a fighter pilot, a man who worked in the oil business in Midland." (His duty as a fighter pilot was in the National Guard.) Like dad before him, he boasts that he "knows what it means to meet a payroll." But when the Texas-reared George W. talks with a twang about "fixin' guvment" and "eatin' barbeque," it does not seem the stretch it did for his Greenwich-bred father.
Jeb Bush attended the University of Texas, not Yale, but, like his father, he graduated in two-and-a-half years and with a Phi Beta Kappa key, too. In an act that was a surprise to his patrician family, Jeb told his parents in 1974 he was marrying a Mexican named Columba Garnica whom he had met as an Andover student on a work-study program in Mexico. In addition, he converted from his family's Episcopalianism to Roman Catholicism. The couple settled happily in Miami, where Jeb became a partner in a commercial real estate business.
He is the image of his mother, especially when he smiles, but in political temperament, he is more like his father. (While George W. looks like his father, Barbara Bush has said the oldest boy gets his acerbic streak from her.)
Although there are Bushian flashes of impatience, Jeb Bush also has his father's congeniality and desire to charm. Asked about a bunch of thank-you notes he had been writing on monogrammed stationery, he grinned and said, "It's genetic, I guess."
For his part, George W. is not working hard to curb his spiteful side. He is still scorning the national political press that he claims treated his father unfairly, refusing to give a plane seat or an interview to a Washington-based reporter during a five-day opening campaign swing.
There are occasional flashes of cockiness and temper. At a rally in Waco, Jack Golden, a college student wearing a "Bush for Governor" sticker, tried to talk to the candidate, after he had finished a press conference, about prison sentences for drug users.
"You don't need to hold a press conference," Mr. Bush snapped at the student. "I'm the guy who holds a press conference."
His father's former political advisers give George W. mixed grades for his role in the Bush campaigns. They said he was loyal and worked hard, and they gave him points for being the one to dismiss John H. Sununu, the autocratic chief of staff. But they fault him for advising the President to put his 1992 campaign in the hands of a phlegmatic troika: Robert M. Teeter, Frederic V. Malek and Robert A. Mosbacher.
But George W. does have a short, snappy campaign speech, while his more earnest brother tends to get a bit bogged down in Al Gore-style talk about "visioning," "prioritizing," "empowering" and "sharing a good exchange of ideas."
 
An End to Retirement?
 As soon as they have had a chance to build up independent images, both men want their parents to campaign for them. Their father carried both Florida and Texas in the 1992 race, and the former First Lady is popular in each state.
Although it might seem soon for George and Barbara Bush to plunge back into the political fray, Jeb Bush said, "I called my Dad up last January and told him I was doing it, and he said, 'Go for it.' "
Writing to a reporter, the former President described his bittersweet feelings about passing the political torch. "There is no way I can possibly describe the feeling of pride that I have in my boys," he said. "Last year was not pleasant for any of us; and now, knowing what lies ahead, they are both willing to try. I am very proud of them both."
Although Mrs. Bush has said she found it painful to see her family exposed to press dissection during the White House years, she is showing her trooper side. "You bet I am going to campaign," she said recently.
Asked if his mother had given him any advice, Jeb Bush smiled her smile and replied: "She just said, 'Be plain-spoken and speak your mind.' "

HEADLINE: Yemeni Tribe Frees U.S. Diplomat

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen, Nov. 29

 BODY:
A United States diplomat was released late tonight by members of a Yemeni tribe who had abducted him in a dispute with the Government, Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakil said.
The diplomat, Haynes R. Mahoney 3d, was released at 10:30 P.M. and has returned to Sana, the capital, Mr. Mutawakil said. 
 "We have met all the demands of the kidnappers," he said in a telephone interview. "We pledge to carry them out."
The demands included payment to the tribe for an oil-pumping station used by the U.S.-Yemen Hunt Oil Company, back salaries for 150 tribe members who were discharged from the presidential guard, back salaries for a number of similarly discharged officers and an economic development plan for the tribe's region, said Saleh al-Tam, a provincial official of the Yemen Socialist Party, one of the country's main political groups.
On Thursday, five gunmen abducted Mr. Mahoney, who heads the United States Information Service here, after he left a reception at the Taj Sheba hotel.
Mr. Mutawakil and some influential tribal chiefs had negotiated with the tribe holding Mr. Mahoney in a desert stronghold at Gahm, 45 miles northeast of Sana.
The Saudi Arabian daily Asharq Al-Awsat, which monitors Yemen, reported today that authorities had seized "a number of relatives" of the tribal leader in an effort to speed the American's release. Tribal members, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the relatives included the sheik's son. But Government officials would not confirm or deny the reports. The same tribe seized 23 Western tourists last month for a couple of days.

HEADLINE: New Wing, New Hope at Brooklyn Museum

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Two years ago the Brooklyn Museum confronted a budget crisis that required cutting both its staff and its hours. But that was then. Tonight, the 96-year-old institution is giving a party for 2,300 guests to show off not only the $1 million reinstallation of its Egyptian collection, but also the $31 million renovation of its once-dusty, little-used West Wing.
The new West Wing, which opens to the public on Friday, inhabits the oldest section of the museum. The renovation, long anticipated, will provide 30,000 square feet of new gallery space on three floors, as well as a floor of office space. With a few minor exceptions, the West Wing has not served as an exhibition space since the 1930's, and was reserved for office use and storage. 
The renovation in the city-owned building, paid for by a new infusion of private and municipal funds, will increase the museum's gallery space by 20 percent. It was designed by the architects Arata Isozaki of Japan and James Stewart Polshek of New York. They have been working together on Brooklyn Museum designs since they won a competition in 1986 for a new master plan to readapt and modernize the building, which was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the late 19th century.
 
Brighter Prospects
 The reinstallation of the Egyptian collection, considered one of the finest in the world, is the centerpiece of the renovation of the West Wing, which marks the completion of the first phase of the Isozaki-Polshek master plan. Given the economic and political realities in New York, and barring a windfall from the city or from private donors, there is little likelihood that any major additions or reinstallations will be undertaken before the turn of the century.
Tonight's celebration is a triumph over the doomsday psychology of 1991, when the recession forced the museum to slash its staff by 63, shut its doors an extra day each week and lay off the entire work force for seven days in August, just to meet its budget.
"But 1991 was even a bad year for wine," said Robert T. Buck, the museum's director, "and since then, this institution has stopped hemorrhaging." While he eyes the city's projected budget shortfall warily, Mr. Buck points out that the museum's current annual operating budget of $15 million is nearly $1 million more than it was in 1991, and that about 10 of the eliminated positions have been reinstated.
Although the museum is still open only from Wednesday to Sunday, a reminder that its operating budget is still precarious, the museum has clearly increased its ability to tap major sources of financing. Among the major donors to the renovation and installation are Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, Martha A. and Robert S. Rubin, the Beatrice and Samuel A. Seaver Foundation, the Vincent Astor Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Booth Ferris Foundation and the J. M. Kaplan Fund. The remaining $17 million of the $31 million renovation was provided by New York City.
But if the museum still finds itself overshadowed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and if some Manhattan art lovers still find the journey to 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, a barrier, the museum's managers are in too festive a spirit to care, at least for now. The reopening of its West Wing is an occasion for hyperbole: "The most important event in the history of the Brooklyn Museum since the laying of its cornerstone," said Mr. Buck, who has been director since 1983.
 
The Long View
 To the museum, the completion of the West Wing is a punctuation mark in an architectural chronicle that began in 1897. McKim, Mead & White envisioned a grand structure with four great courtyards, but only a fourth of the plan was completed -- and only one of the courtyards constructed -- before support for Brooklyn-based projects waned.
Unlike the recent renovation of the Metropolitan Museum's 19th-century galleries, a reprise of an ornate Beaux-Arts style, the architects' choice for the Brooklyn Museum was "clean, serene spaces," said Mr. Isozaki, where "architectural details have been minimized in deference to the artworks."
In fact, the gallery design is the antithesis of the renovation at the Metropolitan; the white-walled Brooklyn rooms, framed by their horizontals of track lighting, have smooth granite baseboards and polished maple-strip floors. "The Metropolitan's new galleries were specifically designed to hold 19th-century paintings," said Mr. Polshek, "but the Brooklyn Museum galleries will hold works ranging from those 3,000 years old all the way up to the late 20th century."
"The curators," he said, "asked us for the largest and cleanest expanse of wall, so they could hang very large works of art. We didn't feel that Beaux-Arts details would be appropriate. We sought to offer a visual neutrality."
 
'Traditional Geometries'
 To Mr. Polshek, the design "echoes the principles of McKim, but not the vocabulary." The vaulted ceiling above the main gallery of the Egyptian collection "was inspired by the traditional geometries of the McKim plan," he said, as were other architectural details. For example, on each gallery floor, monumental limestone portals recall the museum's limestone construction.
In addition to rebuilding the West Wing, the Isozaki-Polshek design has added 10,000 square feet of new art storage space in the main building, as well as the 460-seat Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Auditorium, opened to the public in 1991.
This isn't the first time that modern architects have tried to do something different within the museum's shell. A brutal renovation occurred during the 1930's, when the museum's grand staircase was removed and the lobby, and some galleries, modernized. Subsequent additions to the museum were made in 1978 and 1987.
The continuation of the Isozaki-Polshek master plan will depend in part on the future of Brooklyn, just as the museum's well-being has always been tied to the economic health of the borough. The borough's apogee occurred during World War II, when economic activity, thanks to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Bush Terminals, was at a peak. The museum averaged a million visitors a year during those times of free admissions, in comparison to the 270,000 paid admissions it drew last year.
The subsequent economic decline of the borough, accompanied by the flight of much of Brooklyn's middle-class population to the suburbs, was symbolized by the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1957. This was directly evident to the museum: Ebbetts Field was only two blocks away.
 
The Egyptian Collection
 The focus of the new West Wing is the Egyptian collection in the third-floor gallery, an exhibition of more than 500 objects, selected from the museum's treasury of 8,000. One of those objects, a mummy, will be placed on view for the first time in a permanent exhibition. The collection has been, for the most part, in storage while renovations were under way during the last four years.
The new galleries are "an installation on religion as the motivation for art, and art as an expression of religion," said Richard A. Fazzini, the chairman of the museum's Egyptian, Classical and ancient Middle Eastern department.
The Egyptian installation includes a chronological display of masterpieces from the 13th century B.C. through Rome's conquest of Egypt in 30 B.C., as well as "Temples, Tombs and the Universe," an exhibition that uses objects from the collection to explore ancient Egyptian religion, cults and funerary practices.
 
Wood Evoking Sandtktktk
 Architecturally, the gallery's floors and cases of wood are meant to evoke sand; the cases seem to grow out of the floor. The brilliant white walls reflect light vibrantly "because Egyptian art was made to be seen in the sun," said James Romano, curator of the Egyptian collection.
The mummy is that of Thothirdes, a noblewoman from 600 B.C., about whom little is known. "We would not put an unwrapped mummy on view," said Mr. Romano. "But if you're going to have an installation titled 'Temples, Tombs and the Universe,' I think you've got to display a mummy."
Many Egyptian objects will be exhibited in vitrines for the first time, allowing them to be seen from all sides, like the cartonnage, or mummy casing, of Nespanetjerenepere, a priest of the god Amon. It was previously displayed so that only a frontal view was possible.
The museum's 14 conservators have spent years preparing the objects for viewing. One associate conservator, Christina Krumrine, spent three months alone restoring an important sandstone stele from the era of Rameses II.
As for restoring the mummy, it "was not creepy," said Ellen Pearlstein, a conservator at the museum. "We got so caught up in the problems of conservation, that somehow we never thought of it as a dead person."

Gauging the Power of Nationalism

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

The Wrath of Nations
Civilization and the Fury of Nationalism
By William Pfaff
256 pages. Simon & Schuster. $22.
In his last book, the eloquent "Barbarian Sentiments," the journalist William Pfaff suggested that America's efforts to remake the world in its own image have led to disasters like Vietnam, that American foreign policy has consistently failed to acknowledge the fierce and enduring power of nationalism around the world. His new book, "The Wrath of Nations," more or less takes up where "Barbarian Sentiments" left off, providing the reader with a succinct history of nationalism and its consequences both in the past and in the years to come. 
 Like the historian John Lukacs, who addressed similar questions in his recent book, "The End of the 20th Century and the End of the Modern Age," Mr. Pfaff sees nationalism as the most powerful political force of the 20th century, and perhaps of the 21st century as well.
The 20th century, he notes, began with World War I, "the greatest of all wars of nationalism," and is ending with world attention once again focused on the Balkans, a region whose distress, like that of the Middle East, "is the direct outcome of the destruction of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires in 1918" and their replacement by a series of ethnic states.
But if nationalism informs the violence erupting in places like the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, says Mr. Pfaff, it is also responsible for the destruction of the two bloodiest movements of 20th-century history: Communism and Nazism. Whereas Mr. Lukacs tends to regard Stalin and Hitler as extreme nationalists, Mr. Pfaff chooses to see Communism and Nazism as despotic forms of internationalism.
"They were resisted because they were evil, certainly," he writes, "their cruelty, and dehumanizing force, awaked moral resistance everywhere they touched. But the fundamental political force mobilizing resistance to Hitler was nationalism, and this was true long before even Germany's enemies had grasped the real nature of Nazism and its genocidal aims." In Mr. Pfaff's view, Churchill's "indomitable Englishness," de Gaulle's appeal to a France "dedicated to an exalted and exceptional destiny" and the patriotism of Dutch, Belgians, Norwegians, Czechs, Poles and others prepared to fight in 1940 and 1941 were what "halted Hitler and prepared his eventual defeat."
"Nationalism," he says, "proved as well to be the source of resistance to the postwar Soviet system in Eastern Europe, demonstrated in the East German uprising of 1953, the Hungarian Revolution and Polish mutiny in 1956, the Czechoslovak 'spring' in 1968, and the subsequent development of Solidarity in Poland and the dissident movements elsewhere. Outraged nationalism -- hatred for foreign occupation and domination -- powered the waves of protest in Eastern Europe in 1989 which culminated in the breaching of the Berlin wall."
In fact, says Mr. Pfaff, nationalism has long been regarded as "a progressive cause, a modern movement of the popular interest against empire or dynasty, a struggle against privilege." This attitude helped shape Woodrow Wilson's 1918 peace proposals and helped lead to the post-World War I partition of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman territories, a decision that would result, Mr. Pfaff writes, in the creation of "incoherent national states obsessed with their residual ethnic and national quarrels" and contribute "to the disorder culminating in the Second World War."
Yet after World War II, Mr. Pfaff goes on, "progressive hopes were again attached to nationalism, with respect to the liberation of the Asian and African populations of the European colonial empires." "It was generally held," he writes, "that granting them independence was a moral imperative upon the colonial powers, even if the new nations governed themselves badly."
In recent years, alternatives to nationalism have surfaced in efforts to enlarge the role of the United Nations and to create a kind of European commonwealth of democratic nations through assorted trade and economic agreements. Hopes for this sort of international cooperation flourished in the wake of the United Nations coalition to fight the gulf war, says Mr. Pfaff, but floundered with the failure of the United Nations, Western Europe and America to deal successfully with the current crisis in the Balkans.
"It was possible to see 1992-1993 as having terminated the postwar world," Mr. Pfaff writes. "It was possible to interpret the Yugoslav war as a blow to liberal internationalism equivalent to the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930's to deal with Fascist and Nazi aggression."
Although such sharp assessments help enliven a text that intermittently threatens to turn into a dry history lesson, some of Mr. Pfaff's other opinions are decidedly eccentric. He argues, for instance, that North America would be a better place if the United States had allowed the South to secede during the Civil War. And he contends that the African continent's immediate future would be brighter "if the international community would reimpose a form of paternalist neocolonialism in most of Africa, unpalatable as that may seem."
Mr. Pfaff does not even make an attempt to explain such opinions, but tosses them off as so much casual small talk. They ultimately distract the reader from the many valid and thought-provoking arguments in this timely book.

HEADLINE: Price Tag on National Health Plan's Going Up

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The Health Debate," your supplement on health care delivery (Nov. 14), makes me wonder why the disparate systems of Canada, Germany, Britain and Israel -- all of which offer universal health care, supported by taxes -- are awash in red ink. It is possible that the Clinton improvements to our uneven, more expensive system, if adopted, would also direct us toward bankruptcy. Why are all the systems in financial difficulty? 
 May I suggest that advances in medical science are responsible? Cataracts are not just removed, but lens prostheses are inserted; arthritic knees are not limped on by elderly aspirin poppers, but knees are replaced, and newer, more effective anti-inflammatory drugs are used. Heart attack victims need not recline in bed and wait to die in comparatively inexpensive open wards. They receive clot-dissolving drugs and other agents in intensive care units.
In my own specialty, neurology, advances in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuritis, spinal trauma, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease have revolutionized the field. Computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have replaced informed guesses about diagnosis, as well as dangerous and painful imaging tests.
These improvements are expensive. The costs cannot be controlled without limiting access of the ill to the most effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and reducing the development rate of medical science.
These two goals can be achieved by creating a large cadre of relatively unsophisticated primary care physicians and physician substitutes, with minimal access to and interest in specialist referral, and also by reducing support for biomedical research. Most of the potential beneficiaries of advanced care (all of us) will not welcome these changes.
The possibility that medical care's cost will rise to 20 percent of the gross national product is the finger wagged in our faces. How much should it be? Maybe 20 percent is not enough.
