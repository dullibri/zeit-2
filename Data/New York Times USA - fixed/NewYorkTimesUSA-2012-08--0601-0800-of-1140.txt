 BODY:
The deleveraging of America is well under way, as individuals and companies recover from the excess borrowing that helped to produce the boom and left many people vulnerable when the bust arrived. Household debt is down nearly $900 billion over the last four years, partly from repayments and partly from defaults.During the crazy times, homeowners could get mortgages that allowed them to pay less than the full amount of interest being charged, with the rest added to the principal. Commercial property owners generally paid the full amount of interest, but did not have to repay any principal until the loan matured in five or 10 years. For both homes and commercial properties, lenders were willing to rely on extremely optimistic appraisals.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reliance On Saudi Oil Goes Back Up

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- The United States is increasing its dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia, raising its imports from the kingdom by more than 20 percent this year, even as fears of military conflict in the tinderbox Persian Gulf region grow.The increase in Saudi oil exports to the United States began slowly last summer and has picked up pace this year. Until then, the United States had decreased its dependence on foreign oil and from the Gulf in particular.
This reversal is driven in part by the battle over Iran's nuclear program. The United States tightened sanctions that hampered Iran's ability to sell crude, the lifeline of its troubled economy, and Saudi Arabia agreed to increase production to help guarantee that the price did not skyrocket. While prices have remained relatively stable, and Tehran's treasury has been squeezed, the United States is left increasingly vulnerable to a region in turmoil.
The jump in Saudi oil production has been welcomed by Washington and European governments, but Saudi society faces its own challenges, with the recent deaths of senior members of the royal family and sectarian strife in the eastern part of the country, making the stability of Saudi energy and political policies uncertain. 
The United States has had a political alliance with the Saudi leadership that has lasted for decades, one that has become even more pivotal to Washington during the turmoil of the Arab spring and rising hostilities with Iran over that nation's nuclear program. (Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter regional rivals.)
The development underscores how difficult it is for the United States to lower its dependence on foreign oil -- especially the heavy grades of crude that Saudi Arabia exports -- even as domestic oil production is soaring. It is a development that has alarmed conservative and liberal foreign policy experts alike, especially with oil prices and Mideast tensions rising in recent weeks.
''At a time when there is a rising chance of either a nuclear Iran or an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, we should be trying to reduce our reliance on oil going through the Strait of Hormuz and not increasing it,'' said Michael Makovsky, a former Defense Department official who worked on Middle East issues in the George W. Bush administration.
Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow neck through which most Gulf oil is shipped, and the Iranian navy has held maneuvers to back up the threats. Most analysts say it is doubtful the Iranians would take such an extreme measure because that would block exports vital to the country's economy, but the United States Navy has been preparing for such a contingency.
Many oil experts say that the increasing dependency is probably going to last only a couple of years, or until more Canadian and Gulf of Mexico production comes on line.
''Until we have the ability to access more Canadian heavy oil through improved infrastructure, the vulnerability will remain,'' said David L. Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the Obama administration. ''The potential for an obstruction of the Strait of Hormuz therefore poses a physical threat to U.S. supply as well as a potential price shock on a global level.''
Obama administration officials said they were not overly worried for several reasons. In the event of a crisis, the United States could always dip into strategic petroleum reserves; domestic production continues to climb; and Gulf of Mexico refineries could be adjusted to use higher-quality, sweeter crude oil imported from other countries.
''There are going to be tensions in the Middle East whether that oil is going to the United States or going to somewhere else,'' said Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration. ''And if oil prices go up because of a problem in the Middle East, that causes a problem for the world in general and not one that is specific to the United States.''
In the United States, several oil refining companies have found it necessary to buy more crude from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to make up for declining production from Mexico and Venezuela, insufficient pipeline connections between the United States and Canadian oil sands fields, and the fallout from the 2010 BP disaster, which led to a yearlong drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.
''As refiners, we buy from wherever the supply is readily available and where we can get the best price,'' said Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero Energy, the largest domestic refiner.
The United States imported a daily average of more than 1.45 million barrels of Saudi crude over the first five months of this year, compared to a daily average of roughly 1.15 million barrels over the same period last year, according to Energy Department estimates. Similar increases have come from Kuwait and Iraq, even while total OPEC and non-OPEC imports declined. The United States has imported little Iranian oil in recent years.
In recent years, United States oil imports have been trending lower, although total imports are little changed from the end of last year. But the big change came in imports from the Persian Gulf, spiking to 2.6 million barrels a day in May from 1.9 million barrels a day last December, now roughly 23 percent of total imports, compared with about 17 percent before.
Domestic oil production has been surging the last three years and is up 10 percent this year. But most of the new production is coming from shale oil fields in North Dakota and Texas that produce high-quality sweet grades. Many of the refineries on the Gulf of Mexico coast are designed to refine the heavier oils that the United States has traditionally imported from Venezuela, Mexico and Canada.
Mexican and Venezuelan production has been sliding the last few years, and much of that oil has been replaced by Canadian oil from oil sands. While Canadian production has been increasing rapidly in recent years, there is not enough pipeline capacity.
There are also echoes from the disastrous BP Gulf of Mexico well explosion and spill in 2010, which led to a federal moratorium on Gulf drilling. Before the accident, Gulf oil production was 1.75 million barrels a day, and it was projected to increase to 2.2 million barrels a day by this year.
Instead, because of the yearlong halt on new drilling, production is about 700,000 barrels a day lower than forecast. Much of that oil is heavy and is being replaced by Saudi imports, experts said.
The boost in Saudi shipments to the United States also represents a swing for the kingdom, which had been shifting exports to China in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and recession.
''The U.S. market for sour crude is looking very good for Saudi Arabia this year while the Chinese market is looking pretty bad,'' said Edward Morse, Citigroup global head of commodity research. He noted that demand for crude in China grew by less than 1 percent over the first half of the year.
Saudi oil experts said the kingdom was merely following the markets.
''This is strictly, totally business,'' said Sadad Al Husseini, a former executive at Saudi Aramco, the state oil company. ''Saudi production is flat out. Where you send it is a matter of where you make the best profit.''

HEADLINE: Film and Technology Hub Planned in Brooklyn Navy Yard

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Hidden behind weeds and broken bricks, amid the hum of traffic from the nearby Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, lie 20 acres of abandoned grassy hills, crumbling Greek Revival mansions and Second Empire structures that few New Yorkers have ever seen.There is the home of Dr. E. R. Squibb, who built the first still for making pure anesthetic ether, and a grand naval hospital with antebellum staircases and soaring windows, where Confederate soldiers were reportedly imprisoned during the Civil War. There is a tennis court, barely visible through vines, with a sign warning users to wear proper attire, and a laboratory, an officers' club and even a morgue.
After decades of neglect, this hidden corner of the 300-acre Brooklyn Navy Yard, known as the Naval Annex Historic Campus, may be ready for a long overdue makeover. 
The nonprofit Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation and a private developer, Douglas C. Steiner, have reached an agreement, contingent on city, state and federal financing, to convert the hospital complex into a media, technology and film hub. Mr. Steiner, who owns the adjacent Steiner Studios movie and television production center, would connect the site to his property to create a 50-acre lot to be called a media campus. The project, which would cost nearly $400 million and take 12 years to build, would use the nine historical buildings on the site and create five new structures for a total of 328,000 square feet, housing media companies and academic programs. There would also be 100,000 square feet of new stages for film and TV, including the first underwater stage in the country and the first back lot on the East Coast to feature a New York City streetscape.
The developers estimate that the project will create 2,500 direct jobs, many of which would be high-paying union positions; 1,500 indirect jobs from ancillary services like carpentry and dry cleaning, and 2,600 construction jobs. When completed, the 50-acre media campus would employ some 6,000 New Yorkers, its backers say.
Mr. Steiner, whose Steiner Studios is the Navy Yard's largest tenant, has, since it opened in 2004, committed $185 million to build and expand it. He has agreed to commit just shy of $346 million for the hospital complex. He would be responsible for shoring up the historical buildings, erecting the new structures and finding the tenants.
To make the plan viable and to build out the site's infrastructure, including water, sewers and electricity, the developers are seeking $35 million from New York State and New York City and $2.5 million from the federal government.
Over the years, the site has been the focus of a series of failed proposals, most recently as a possible location for the city's applied sciences campus, which eventually went to Roosevelt Island. But the developers say they are hopeful that this project will have more traction.
Andrew H. Kimball, president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, said: ''This is a very unique and special part of the yard, and we have wanted to be careful, as the stewards, that we really have the right plan for it. And this time we feel like we do.''
There is growing demand for office space from technology and new media industries here, as well as the entertainment industry -- 23 prime-time television shows are based in New York City, compared with 7 in 2002, according to the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment. In addition, Mr. Kimball said, ''We have the right geography -- this is the only place in the city where you could do a 50-acre media campus of this kind, and we have the right mayor and governor who recognize that this will create the kinds of 21st century jobs that are critical to the city's economy.''
The public financing is an important piece of the project: Last month the developers applied to the Empire State Development Corporation's Regional Council for $17.5 million. It is petitioning the city for an equal amount, and expects feedback on the proposal in the fall.
Mr. Steiner serves on the board of the Regional Council, but has recused himself from the matter; another member of the Council, who insisted on anonymity because of the competitive nature of the process, said there was a good chance the hospital complex would receive the necessary financing.
Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said, ''The Brooklyn Navy Yard is an economic success story if there ever was one, and we are very proud that our investments there have yielded high-quality jobs in some of our fastest-growing industries, like film and TV production.''
''The medical campus,'' she added, ''has long represented a prime opportunity for development and we're very excited about the potential of this project.''
The 60,000-square-foot Greek Revival hospital, built in 1838 from Tuckahoe marble that may, according to the Navy Yard's museum, have been quarried by prisoners from Sing Sing, would be the campus's centerpiece. ''My dream is to have an anchor tenant like Google or Apple,'' said Mr. Steiner, who also envisions turning some of the smaller buildings on the site into writing bungalows that could be leased by production companies, producers and directors.
Mr. Steiner is also proposing several academic buildings at the site. Long Island University's graduate screenwriting program has a location at Steiner Studios, and Mr. Steiner is currently building a center for the Brooklyn College Graduate School of Cinema.
In addition, Mr. Steiner is hoping to build a Hollywood-style back lot, where filmmakers could recreate quintessential New York locations, like Chinatown in Manhattan or the interior of a subway station, that are otherwise hard to capture on film. The hope is that the back lot would not only spur more film production but also become a draw for tourists.
''There is no reason we couldn't see this become a stop for the double-decker tourist buses, with tourists coming to take photos and get a glimpse of a star,'' Mr. Kimball said.

HEADLINE: For Europe's Tepid Economy, a Lost Decade Looms

BYLINE: By JACK EWING;

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The euro zone is hurtling back into recession, economists declared after official figures this week portrayed a shrinking economy. But by some measures the downturn has been under way for years.With the exception of Germany, none of Europe's biggest economies have returned to the level of economic output they had at the beginning of 2008, before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States spread across the Atlantic, according to calculations by two U.S. economists, Peter Rupert and Thomas F. Cooley.
The figures suggest that Europe is already well into what could become a lost decade -- a period of pernicious stagnation and wasted potential that could have lasting effects on ordinary citizens.
Economic growth not realized represents investments in education that were never made, research that was never financed, businesses that failed and careers that ended too early or never got off the ground. 
''There are larger implications that people don't think about,'' said Mr. Rupert, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ''There is a huge decline in human capital.''
Just what marks the beginning and end of a recession is not always easy to define. One common definition is two consecutive quarters of falling output. By that standard, the euro zone is technically not yet in a recession.
Most economists agree, though, that a recession is also defined by other indicators like unemployment, industrial production and investment. The closest thing Europe has to an arbiter on the question is a committee of prominent economists convened by the Center for Economic Policy Research, a research organization in London.
By the committee's reckoning, the euro zone's last recession ended after the second quarter of 2009, the point at which the region hit bottom and began to grow again. The economists' panel, known as the Euro Area Business Cycle Dating Committee, has not yet begun to consider whether the euro zone is in recession again. But few people would argue that Europe, stricken by a self-inflicted debt crisis that began in 2010, has basked in prosperity recently.
''This is more than just a regular business cycle,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ''I can't think of a time in the postwar period in any major industrial countries where we have had a downturn resume before the previous cycle was over.''
Only Germany is wealthier than it was in the first quarter of 2008, when economic activity peaked. France is close, according to Mr. Rupert and Mr. Cooley, a professor at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. (The two publish a blog that tracks the business cycle, at european snapshot.com.)
Spain and Italy are both effectively back where they were in the darkest days of 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a financial crisis that undermined the world economy.
Both countries resumed growing in 2009, but stalled in the middle of last year. Since then Spain has had three quarters in a row of declining gross domestic product, while the Italian economy has been shrinking for a year. There is little doubt they are deep in recession. Some economists predict that France and even Germany could follow.
In contrast, the United States regained all the ground lost since 2008 at the end of 2011. But it took twice as long to do so than had been the case for any other recession since World War II, according to Mr. Cooley and Mr. Rupert. They estimate that, had the United States continued growing at the same average pace as it has since 1950, the country would be more than $1.5 trillion wealthier today.
While economists already knew that euro zone G.D.P. was still catching up with 2008, experts like Mr. Cooley and Mr. Rupert have been parsing the sometimes inconsistent statistics issued by European countries to show how broadly the downturn has affected Europe's largest economies in the form of rising unemployment, declining consumer spending and falling investment.
Mr. Weinberg and others warn that the euro zone is on the same path as Japan was in the 1990s, when failure to deal with weak banks led to a decade of stagnation.
''There are some really good analogies,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''The Japanese never fixed their banks. There is a lesson to Europe in this.''
When banks do not have adequate capital reserves, as is now the case with many, they hoard cash and are unwilling or unable to lend. The European Central Bank has gone to extraordinary lengths to supply banks with cash, offering three-year loans on easy terms. But the E.C.B. cannot compel those banks to issue loans to businesses, which would fuel expansion. Nor can it make them give credit to consumers to buy homes and cars.
In fact, E.C.B. surveys as well as money supply data show that banks remain reluctant to lend.
Attempts to fix this dysfunctional system have so far fallen short. The European Union has allocated â[#x201a]¬100 billion, or nearly $124 billion, to recapitalize ailing Spanish banks, but the money has not yet been spent, because the mechanisms to do so are not yet in place. The European Banking Authority has pressed weaker banks to rebuild their reserves, but many analysts say the agency's requirements are not strict enough to restore confidence in banks' health.
The social effects of so many years of poor economic performance are ''very worrisome,'' said Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor of economics at London Business School. ''We know that societies lose their cohesion when growth is very subdued.''
Comparisons to Japan's lost decade may not go far enough, she said, noting that young Europeans have been particularly hard hit by poor growth. In Spain, more than half of people aged 16 to 24 are jobless.
''That would be a lost generation more than a lost decade,'' said Ms. Reichlin, who is also a member of the committee at the Center for European Policy Research that attempts to determine when recessions begin and end.
Under the best of circumstances, it would be a year or two before the euro zone economy could be expected to recover. And that will happen only if European leaders make the right decisions -- a questionable assumption -- and demand from Asia and the United States strengthens.
Leaders in Brussels and European capitals have pledged to improve budgetary discipline, remove government obstacles to growth and strengthen the banking system by establishing a common regulator at the E.C.B.
But progress toward these goals has been slow, held up by reluctance by countries like Italy to make changes and by countries like Germany to provide financing. Implementation of the European rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, has been held up by a lawsuit brought by a German citizens' group that will not be resolved until the country's Constitutional Court rules on Sept. 12.
And German voters remain opposed to measures economists say are needed to hold down borrowing costs for weaker countries like Spain, including some form of common debt.
Forecasts of euro zone growth are even trickier than usual because the economic pattern is unlike anything Europe has experienced in the past.
For example, Europe typically tracks the U.S. economy with a slight time delay, but now seems to have decoupled. In addition, the wealthier member states of the European Union used to move more or less in unison. But now Italy is doing much worse than France, not to mention Germany.
Under more pessimistic forecasts, the decline could last for years.
Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics warns that even depression cannot be ruled out, if poor policy leads to a string of bank failures.
A breakup of the euro currency bloc, which many economists consider a serious risk, would have incalculable consequences.
''In the euro area, the main uncertainty is over if and how the current debt crisis can be resolved and whether a breakup of the euro can be avoided,'' Joachim Fels and Manoj Pradhan, economists at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.
Some of the decline in euro zone economic output reflects lower government spending, as political leaders struggle to cut national deficits. In countries like Italy and Greece, where governments have a reputation for being wasteful, spending cuts could theoretically benefit the economy in a few years by eliminating bureaucracy that gets in the way of entrepreneurs.
Recessions can even be beneficial, in a way. They punish inefficient business practices and imprudent lending. But that is true only up to a point.
''When people talk about the cleansing effect of recessions,'' Mr. Rupert of the University of California said, ''those aren't five-year recessions.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The deleveraging of America is well under way, as individuals and companies recover from the excess borrowing that helped to produce the boom and left many people vulnerable when the bust arrived. Household debt is down nearly $900 billion over the last four years, partly from repayments and partly from defaults.During the crazy times, homeowners could get mortgages that allowed them to pay less than the full amount of interest being charged, with the rest added to the principal. Commercial property owners generally paid the full amount of interest, but did not have to repay any principal until the loan matured in five or 10 years. For both homes and commercial properties, lenders were willing to rely on extremely optimistic appraisals.
For property buyers, those days are gone, 
But for some borrowers, it is still possible to borrow now and pay nothing for decades.
There is a furor in California because the Poway Unified School District, in San Diego County, borrowed money last year on terms that even Countrywide would have laughed at during the boom. It will not pay a dime of interest or principal for more than two decades. Only then will it begin to service the bonds.
It is paying a high price. Although it has a good credit rating -- Aa2 at Moody's and AAâ[#x20ac]" at Standard & Poor's -- it will eventually pay tax-exempt interest of up to 6.8 percent for the borrowings. When it issued more conventional bonds last year, it paid rates that were much lower, ranging up to just 4.1 percent.
For borrowing $105 million in 2011, taxpayers -- or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the children and grandchildren of today's taxpayers -- will pay $877 million in interest between 2033 and 2051.
In San Diego, the bond issue first gained attention on The Voice of San Diego, a Web-based publication, which published an article this month headlined ''Where Borrowing $105 Million Will Cost $1 Billion: Poway Schools.'' As the Voice noted, others, including Joel Thurtell, a Michigan blogger, had written outraged articles about the bond issue. But it was the Voice article that attracted national attention, including a report on CNBC.
It turns out the Poway bond issue is not unique. This kind of borrowing has been going on for years, particularly in California, where the tax revolt that began with Proposition 13 in 1978 has made it harder and harder to finance education or other local government services. Assorted propositions approved by voters have made it very difficult to raise taxes at all.
According to a Thomson Reuters database, school districts issued nearly $4 billion in such bonds last year, and have sold almost $3 billion more this year. Back in 2006, when the credit boom was in full bloom, $9 billion worth of so-called capital appreciation bonds were sold.
The Poway issue is unusual in delaying interest payments for so long, but there have been others. Its neighbor, the San Diego Unified School District, borrowed $150 million in May, promising to begin payments in 2032.
School districts' logic for borrowing for construction projects always was that those who benefit should pay for a construction project. In the case of the Poway bond, however, it is at least possible that it will be the children of today's students who end up paying the bill. By then, many of these school buildings may be obsolete, or at least in need of another refurbishing.
In a statement, the Poway district pointed out that the bond issue was the fifth part of a plan to modernize the 24 oldest schools in the district, adding that while that bond ''has a total repayment ratio of 9.3 times the principal amount,'' the overall borrowing program has a repayment ratio of just 4.2. That means that for every dollar borrowed, $3.20 in interest will be paid.
To put that into perspective, a 30-year mortgage at the same 6.8 percent interest rate would require $1.35 in lifetime interest payments for each dollar borrowed, or a repayment ratio of 2.35.
''The most important value received from the building program that is difficult to quantify is the educational value of providing today's students with quality learning facilities,'' said John Collins, the superintendent of the district, which has 34,000 students. ''It is also difficult to calculate the dollar value of savings realized by avoiding the inflated construction costs of postponing the completion of the building program for a decade or more.''
Your guess may be as good as his as to just how inflated those costs will be. But it is hard to believe that the district would not have been better off borrowing on terms that called for repaying the loan more quickly. The interest rate would have been lower, and the power of compound interest would not have caused the total payments to rise into the stratosphere.
But the option of getting reasonable financing may not have been available to the Poway district, or to many of the other districts that have resorted to these capital appreciation bonds. Poway officials had promised not to raise taxes, and this way they won't have to. At least not until 2033. They set the payments to begin after earlier bonds are paid off.
Nationally, it appears that fewer and fewer school districts have been able, or willing, to find ways to finance new buildings -- or even to pay teachers, as property tax revenue plunged with the deflating of the housing bubble and pinched states reduced assistance. State and local governments are spending less and employing fewer people now than they were before the recession. Adjusted for inflation, state and local investment in buildings and other assets is at the lowest level since 1998. Over the last 30 months, the economy has gained about half a million jobs in manufacturing, and lost nearly as many in state and local government.
Should districts issue such bonds? It is not an easy question to answer. Much of this expensive borrowing is a result of local officials searching for a way to meet their responsibilities at a time when opposition to taxes has become a mantra. This generation will not pay for what it needs, so some of its leaders have decided to saddle future generations with the bills.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He Paid At Least 13% In Income Taxes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney said Thursday that he paid at least 13 percent of his income in taxes each year during the past decade, again confronting a vexing issue that Democrats have used to portray him as out of touch with middle-class values.Calling the interest in his personal tax returns ''small-minded'' in light of the nation's problems, Mr. Romney said that he had nonetheless examined the last 10 years of his personal tax returns after Democrats suggested that he might not have paid anything at all in some years.
''Every year, I've paid at least 13 percent,'' he said, referring to his effective federal income tax rate, which is a higher effective rate than most people pay. 
Mr. Romney's decision to address the tax question on Thursday appeared to be an off-the-cuff attempt to put the nettlesome issue behind him once and for all. But at least initially, it had the opposite effect. Democrats seized on his comments to revive the issue and to once again demand proof of his claims by releasing multiple years of his tax returns.
''We would say: 'Prove it, Governor Romney,' '' said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for President Obama.
The re-emergence of the tax issue consumed another day of the campaign and added to the sense of a shift in direction for a candidate who had once steadfastly refused to talk about anything other than job losses during Mr. Obama's tenure, the unemployment rate and the nation's growing debt.
Now, after Mr. Romney's decision to name Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice-presidential choice, the campaign is instead waging an aggressive battle on Medicare, welfare and Mr. Obama's character. That change in focus can be seen in the campaign's ads and in Mr. Romney's speeches. And it stands in contrast to the approaches of some Republican Congressional candidates, who said Thursday that they intended to wage their own campaigns strictly on economic issues.
''We are staying on our message,'' said Chris Collins, the Republican candidate in New York's 27th District, near Buffalo. Mr. Collins said that Republicans should welcome the Medicare debate, but that in his own campaign, ''every time anything comes up, I bring it back to the economy, the economy, Obamacare.''
Richard Tisei, a Republican running in Massachusetts' Sixth District, said that for Mr. Romney and Republicans, ''ultimately, the campaign is going to be about the state of the economy.''
Mr. Romney made the remarks about his taxes on Thursday at a hastily arranged news conference at an airport in South Carolina, where he sought to amplify the Medicare argument he has been making in earnest since selecting Mr. Ryan. To drive home his point on the difference in the approaches to Medicare by the Republican ticket and the Obama administration, Mr. Romney drew numbers on a white board positioned on an easel before television cameras.
It was a moment that delighted aides back at his campaign headquarters in Boston -- until Mr. Romney answered a reporter's question about his income taxes. For the rest of the day, his statement that he has paid at least 13 percent in federal income taxes over the past decade received more attention than his original statement on Medicare.
Democrats have hounded Mr. Romney for months about his tax returns. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has asserted -- without providing any proof -- that Mr. Romney paid no taxes in some years, presumably by using offshore tax shelters and other legal accounting measures.
Mr. Romney had already denounced the remarks as false. But he has steadfastly refused to release more than his full return for the 2010 tax year and a short summary of taxes he paid in 2011. In an interview on NBC's ''Rock Center'' that was broadcast Thursday night, Ann Romney stood by her husband's refusal, saying that further releases would simply provide ''ammunition'' for Democrats.
''The more we get attacked, the more we get questioned, the more we get pushed,'' Mrs. Romney said. ''There's going to be no more tax releases given. Mitt is honest. His integrity is just golden.''
In an interview last month, Mr. Romney was asked whether he had ever paid a tax rate lower than the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010.
''I haven't calculated that,'' he told David Muir of ABC News. ''I'm happy to go back and look, but my view is I've paid all the taxes required by law.''
In saying that he paid a tax rate of at least 13 percent, Mr. Romney and his wife would still have had a higher income tax rate than most households. More than 46 percent of households did not pay any federal income tax in 2011 because their income was low enough that deductions and credits reduced their bill to zero. Even a typical household making $100,000 a year would pay closer to a 10 percent average federal income tax rate than a 15 percent rate, Congressional Budget office data suggest.
For many middle-class households, however, other taxes -- like payroll taxes and state and local taxes -- typically cause their total annual tax rate to rise to 20 percent of their income and higher. For Mr. Romney, these other taxes most likely had only a small effect on his total tax rate, because much of his income came from investments, which is generally taxed at a lower rate than wage income.
In 2011, Mr. Obama and his wife reported an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5 percent. In 2010, their rate was just over 26 percent.
In the brief exchange with reporters in South Carolina, Mr. Romney used a black marker to sketch out his assertion that the president had cut $716 billion out of the Medicare program ''to fund Obamacare.'' But the tax question came a few moments later, and he eagerly answered it.
''Campaigns don't control their own destiny,'' said Dave Carney, a Republican strategist who managed the presidential campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. ''You can talk about what you want, but you have to be relevant to the ongoing discussion.''

HEADLINE: In Drought, A Debate Over Quota For Ethanol

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Three big intertwined but rival agribusinesses -- corn farmers, meat and poultry producers, and biofuel refineries -- are in a political fight to protect their interests as a drought ravages corn producers and industrial consumers alike.At issue is whether to suspend a five-year-old federal mandate requiring more ethanol in gasoline each year, a policy that has diverted almost half of the domestic corn supply from animal feedlots to ethanol refineries, driven up corn prices and plantings and created a desperate competition for corn as drought grips the nation's farm belt.
Meat producers are demanding that the Obama administration waive the ethanol quota to ease rising feed prices. But ethanol producers worry that the loss of the quota will undermine the ethanol industry and do little for corn farmers but drive down the price of their stunted harvest. 
The meat industry, backed by several governors, lawmakers and even international food agencies, argues that the quota has distorted grain markets by sucking up corn when ranchers can least afford it.
But the ethanol industry says that its corn consumption is down 12 percent since the start of the summer and that weekly ethanol production is at a two-year low. As corn prices have risen, refineries have scaled back production, idled dozens of plants and sold ethanol inventories. As a result, the industry may consume 10 percent less of this summer's crop than last year's, government and industry officials said.
''The market is already responding to the reality of this drought,'' said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who supports the quota, citing the recent decline in ethanol production.
Meat and poultry producers countered that the government was still ''picking winners and losers,'' and urged the Obama administration to ''let the market work and embrace free market principles,'' as J. D. Alexander, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, put it when he announced a petition to waive the quota two weeks ago.
Four governors, dozens of senators and scores of House members have petitioned the administration to waive the standard.
Corn growers, caught in a political tug of war between their biggest customers, are asking the government to move cautiously, if at all. (Many ethanol refineries are owned by corn farmers.)
''We have great concern and empathy for not only our members who are suffering, but all who we supply,'' said Garry Niemeyer, president of the National Corn Growers Association, in a statement on Wednesday. ''This includes the domestic livestock sector, our export customers, the domestic food industry and the ethanol industry.''
The corn farmers said a waiver should be allowed only if careful study showed a severe economic impact.
The Obama administration seems inclined not to interfere. The president ''has been a strong believer in ethanol,'' a spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, said during Mr. Obama's trip to Iowa this week. ''He absolutely believes in it -- he thinks it's a driver of the economy here and a key component of renewable energy.''
Mr. Vilsack was even more forceful in a speech in Omaha to a conference of the American Coalition for Ethanol last week, just as his agency released a dire new crop forecast.
He urged ethanol advocates to fight back against opposition to the fuel quota, calling it ''a concerted, well-financed, organized and strategically thought-out campaign against this industry.''
''There are members of Congress who have publicly displayed their support to the opposition,'' Mr. Vilsack said. ''There needs to be a corresponding set of politicians who stand up and say, 'Wait a second -- this is important to the country. This is a job creator.' ''
Support for the ethanol industry, which blossomed because of a system of tax breaks followed by the fuel mandate, has long been bipartisan, and the current debate is split more along regional than partisan lines.
When Iowa's agriculture secretary, William Northey, a Republican, accompanied Mitt Romney on a campaign visit to Iowa, they talked about the tensions over corn and ethanol. ''My point was, right now the market is working,'' Mr. Northey was quoted by The Des Moines Register as saying. He added that with corn prices high, ''ethanol plants are slowing down because their margins are not as good.''
Indeed, a number of ethanol refineries reported losses this week for the most recent fiscal quarter, citing rising prices as a result of the corn shortage.
The industry fears that whatever stability the mandate provides would vanish if it were waived, even temporarily.
The renewable fuel standard requires more than 13 billion gallons of ethanol to be used in gasoline this year and nearly 14 billion gallons to be used next year -- the equivalent of nearly 5 billion bushels of corn each year.
On Aug. 10, in a sharply reduced forecast, the Agriculture Department said the corn crop would be the lowest in seven years. The news drew worldwide attention, and corn prices hit new highs. But another statistic was barely noted, except by specialists: the department predicted that the use of corn by the ethanol industry would also decrease 10 percent in the forecast year, to 4.5 billion bushels.
From July to August, as they observed the drought's effects, government inspectors reduced their forecast of corn used for ethanol in the year by 400 million bushels. The forecast of corn used for livestock feed declined by 725 million bushels as ranchers culled their herds and flocks.
The ethanol industry is quick to point out that about a third of the corn it uses is converted not to ethanol, but to highly nutritious livestock feed, including a byproduct known as distillers grains. Taking that into account, the group said, the amount of corn that goes to animals will decline 13 percent this year, and the amount that goes to vehicles will drop 8 percent.
Whatever ripple effects are felt in food or gasoline prices, a group of Purdue University economists said on Thursday as they presented a study of a possible waiver, the drought has already done its economic damage. The only thing policy makers can accomplish, the economists said, is to distribute the harm across the various affected sectors.

HEADLINE: Israel's Iran Itch

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Hmm, it's August, things are quiet, time for another wave of hysteria over an imminent Israeli attack on Iran. We've seen this movie for a decade -- Israel's ''red line'' on the Iranian nuclear program has proved of spandex-like elasticity.(I sometimes imagine the size of the explosion if all the words devoted to the Iranian nuclear program since 2000 were placed in a large container and detonated.)
Israeli newspapers are full of reports that home-front preparedness is inadequate. Only 53 percent of Israelis, they say, have gas masks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has just appointed Avi Dichter, a former head of Shin Bet -- the Israeli equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- as the new home-front minister to address these concerns. 
Dichter, by the way, has joined a host of former security and intelligence chiefs in saying that for Israel to lead an offensive against Iran would be a ''total mistake.''
Wise words; but they have done nothing to dampen the attack-looming chatter of these summer doldrums, with the U.S. election less than 100 days away. One theory in Jerusalem is that the run-up to Nov. 6 is a good moment to attack because President Obama, despite his misgivings, would have no choice but to get behind the Jewish state or lose votes.
Netanyahu is doing nothing to dispel the rumors. Why should he? They provide leverage for tougher Iran sanctions and have no downside for Israel other than creating an impression that, on Iran, it has cried wolf.
Consider this recent post on the International Herald Tribune's Latitude blog from Shmuel Rosner, the political editor of the Jewish Journal: ''I got home Monday evening to find in my mailbox an official reminder: Did we have enough gas masks for the whole family?''
Rosner continues: ''These days, Israeli media outlets are competing with one another to run scare stories: Are there enough shelters in Jerusalem for all residents? Does the new text-message missile alert system work properly?''
The Netanyahu government is happy enough with this state of fear: It seeks uncertainty. It takes a rightly skeptical view of the talks on Iran's nuclear program between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. These have gone over familiar ground -- Iranian offers to stop enrichment to 20 percent and eliminate its stockpile of such uranium against a lifting of sanctions and recognition of its right to enrich to a much lower level -- without moving the ball.
Let's get real: A deal in a U.S. election year is out of the question. Obama will not do it. He is not going to hand the Republicans ammunition on a plate.
Moreover, the Iran led by the Brezhnevian Ayatollah Khamenei is incapable of clear decision-making. It is a nation in the image of its noisy president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (remember him?): a lot of bluster over not much. It is given to what James Buchan has called ''lachrymose intransigence.'' Khamenei is a septuagenarian supposedly standing in for the Prophet. The average age of his wired population is 27. Try getting that system to function.
As Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told me, a deal is unthinkable because ''the possibility of ever aligning Israeli psychology, Iranian ideology and the American political calendar is infinitely remote.''
So what should Israel do? Israeli security is incompatible with an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon that says it is bent on the destruction of the Jewish state: That, given history and psychology, is the reality of the situation.
But a unilateral Israeli attack on Iran today would be disastrous. It unites Iran in fury; locks in the Islamic Republic for a generation; gives a substantial boost to the wobbling Assad regime in Syria; radicalizes the Arab world at a moment of delicate transition; ignites Hezbollah on the Lebanese border; boosts Hamas; endangers U.S. troops in the region; sparks terrorism; propels oil skyward; rocks a vulnerable global economy; triggers a possible regional war; offers a lifeline to Iran just as sanctions are biting; adds a never-to-be-forgotten Persian vendetta to the Arab vendetta against Israel; and may at best set back Iran's nuclear ambitions a couple of years or at worst accelerate its program by prompting it to rush for a bomb and throw out International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.
Such damage may not amount to an existential threat to Israel -- the phrase is overused. It would be a devastating strategic error.
Don't do it, Bibi.
I do not say this lightly. All the talk of gas masks reflects real Israeli fears, even if they are artfully stoked. Israel must keep in mind that no U.S. president can accept the current Iranian regime going nuclear: Obama has been explicit about this.
Iran is not enriching uranium, as it claims, for a power plant of epic dysfunction. But nor has it yet united the various elements needed to make a bomb. If it ever makes the decision to do so, I expect the U.S. military response to be swift and devastating. The wise choice for Israel is therefore patience.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Jobless Regroup to Fight the Odds

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
CORONA, Calif. -- The analysts pore over the numbers every month, the full menagerie of economic indicators. President Obama and Mitt Romney trade barbs over who is at fault for a sluggish recovery. But here, in a region with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, other numbers often loom larger.There are the roughly 1,600 résumés that Byron Reeves has sent out since he lost his job in accounting nearly four years ago, and the paltry 10 or so interviews they have produced. There is the $300 check that Yundra Thomas could not write to send his daughter to band camp, because he has been out of work for six months.
Each week, Mr. Reeves and Mr. Thomas gather with 40 or so other unemployed workers in a small, barren and fluorescent-lit room here, in a kind of self-help program that is part of California's official effort to help residents find jobs. Most have been unemployed for months or years. Time spent with them at several gatherings over many months reveals a postrecession landscape where grim frustration battles with the simple desire to find a way out. 
They were once advertising executives, engineers, social workers, teachers and purchasing managers. Now they come week after week, dressed for the office, carrying binders full of résumés and leads for potential jobs. They refine what they call their ''60-second commercial'' -- a way to pitch themselves to nearly anyone they meet. When the three-hour meetings end, they mosey over, some reluctantly, to a table packed with day-old bread donated by a supermarket.
With a state unemployment rate of 10.7 percent, California officials struggle to find ways to get people back to work. In the sprawling suburbs east of Los Angeles that make up the Inland Empire, the job market seems more upbeat than it has been for months, but unemployment remains at 12.6 percent.
''You come in thinking you know everything, because you've been working for years,'' Mr. Reeves, 55, said after one recent meeting. ''You think you'll bounce back quickly. Then, after a while, you get nothing and realize that in your entire career you've only had three or four jobs. So maybe asking other people what they're doing would help.''
Finding a job is particularly difficult for people like those who gather here each week. These are not unskilled workers looking for entry-level jobs. They are men and women in their 40s and 50s who were midlevel managers with salaries that made them comfortable enough to buy homes and take vacations. Nearly all have college diplomas, and some have advanced degrees.
The group, called Experience Unlimited in a nod to its members' abilities, functions as much as a support group as a training ground; participants offer each other encouragement that the next interview will turn out better as quickly as they exchange tips on résumé writing and networking. Less educated workers are still much more likely than college graduates to find themselves among the long-term unemployed, but that is little comfort to those like Mr. Reeves and Mr. Thomas.
At times, even with the most optimistic intentions, job-seeking can feel almost crushingly absurd. One recent morning, a human-resource manager for the local branches of the Lowe's home-improvement chain made a pitch for floor sales jobs.
''What we're looking for is someone who enjoys interacting with customers and closing the sale, so as long as you have some experience with customer service, we have a lot of opportunities,'' the recruiter, Nikki Koontz, said in a cheery voice. Skeptical looks were obvious on many faces in the room.
''Won't you just say we're overqualified?'' one woman wondered.
''Is there really the ability to move up the ranks?'' another asked.
Some softened when Ms. Koontz said that she, too, had been laid off not too long ago, and that her job at Lowe's involved a pay cut.
These are practical matters. Nobody directly asked how much the jobs would pay. (Answer: roughly $12 an hour, with benefits.) For many in the group, that would mean less money than they get from unemployment.
Roughly half the group still receives unemployment checks, and many have had multiple extensions to take them to the maximum of 99 weeks. Others were forced off the unemployment rolls this spring, when California did not meet the complex requirements for the extended benefits. Far more will lose their benefits within the next few months.
In California, nearly 930,000 people have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks, roughly 45 percent of the total who are unemployed, according to state figures. An analysis by Beacon Economics, a consulting group in Los Angeles, found that the unemployed in the Inland Empire go for 55 weeks on average without a job, about 14 weeks longer than the average in the rest of the state.
Trish Polson, the director of Experience Unlimited in Corona, estimates that a third of the participants would ''take anything they could.'' The rest may have stopped holding out hope for the ''perfect job,'' but they remain reluctant to take something that pays, say, half the salary they once made or seems far below their qualifications.
''Your whole life your job defines who you are,'' said Mr. Thomas, 48, who was laid off from his position as an advertising manager in February. ''All of the sudden that's gone, and you don't know what to take pride in anymore.''
In the months since he lost his job, Mr. Thomas has gotten up each day and dressed in the same kind of crisp shirts he wore to the office. He still has not told his 11-year-old daughter directly that he is out of work, instead making sure to offer her treats like ice cream cones so she does not worry that anything has changed.
Mr. Thomas is one of the most engaged and gregarious participants in the group, frequently leading workshops on interviews and interpersonal skills. For him and many others, this is their new job.
''A lot of people don't come here until they've spent some time at home licking their wounds,'' Ms. Polson said. ''By the time they get here, the hardest thing is for them to check their ego at the door. They think they can do it alone. Their pride hasn't been hurt enough yet.''
But most of the time, that changes rather quickly.
Mr. Reeves lost his job at a distribution company in 2008. He had been laid off once before, a few years earlier, and assumed this time would be just the same -- a few weeks of searching before finding a new job. But after two years, he had just one interview. His unemployment checks stopped coming long ago, and food stamps are a part of his life now.
Eventually, he moved into his mother's home here, where he wakes up most mornings by 6 and walks to the library every weekday. Tuesdays, though, are reserved for the group.
''The only thing I can do is get out of the house and keep looking,'' he said. ''I can't allow myself to get lazy, because giving up would just make me more depressed.''

HEADLINE: The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Race for President

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
For about, oh, two minutes, there was talk last weekend that the debate dominating the presidential race would take on a more elevated tone now that Mitt Romney had selected an avowed fiscal hawk, Representative Paul D. Ryan, as his running mate.The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges seriously.
Then Tuesday (and Wednesday and Thursday) happened. 
President Obama made a joking allusion to Mr. Romney's putting Seamus, the family dog, on the roof of his car; Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of demeaning his office with a campaign of ''division and anger and hate,'' born of Chicago no less. And it was all sliding back down the banister.
However genuine the latest heated disagreements may be, they do not happen by mistake in presidential politics.
There is strategy in the broadsides: Mr. Obama, faced with continuing high unemployment, is seeking to paint Mr. Romney as unqualified to replace him. Mr. Romney, faced with an opponent whose ''likability'' may be a potent inoculation against voters' economic frustrations, is seeking to strip that away.
Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol. Mr. Obama would seem to have the most to lose, given that his 2008 campaign successfully created a perception that he was a different kind of candidate, one of hope and change. ''Clearly, the Barack Obama who existed four years ago -- who thought we should rise to a higher level -- has disappeared,'' said Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Stevens blamed Mr. Obama's team for pushing the debate to its current level when it failed to disavow an advertisement introduced last week by the ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action. It features a steelworker who essentially attributes his wife's death by cancer to the decision by Mr. Romney's investment firm, Bain Capital, to close his plant, ending his health insurance.
The implication was false: the man had lost his job years before she became sick. Mr. Stevens said Mr. Obama had a duty to criticize the ad publicly. ''You've never in history had a president's organization,'' he said, ''supporting an ad accusing another candidate of being responsible for someone's death.''
The Obama campaign sees it differently.
''Does the word 'chutzpah' mean anything to you?'' said David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser. ''Mitt Romney and his allies have repeatedly questioned the president's Americanism. He stood by silently while a supporter accused the president of treason.''
As Mr. Romney and his supporters have used every possible opportunity this week to portray Mr. Obama and the Democrats as playing in the political gutter, they have been confronted with their own deeds and actions. After all, Mr. Romney declared ''this ain't beanbag'' after Newt Gingrich complained last winter about harsh attack ads from a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney -- including one that falsely said that Mr. Gingrich had voted to finance a program supporting China's one-child policy.
Former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, a leading surrogate for Mr. Romney, appeared on the Fox News Channel show ''Hannity's America'' on Wednesday to say that the Obama campaign was ''getting dirty.'' But he also recently suggested that Mr. Obama ''learn how to be an American.''
He apologized for that, but on Tuesday, he questioned whether Mr. Obama had developed a Southern ''drawl'' in ''southern Indonesia,'' or ''is it just as phony as his jaunt when he runs up and down Marine One.''
Mr. Sununu's more liberal counterpart, Juan Williams, hit back at Mr. Sununu by noting that the Romney campaign had run an ad falsely charging that Mr. Obama planned to do away with work requirements for welfare recipients. That spot earned a ''pants on fire'' designation from the nonpartisan Web site Politifact, a service of The Tampa Bay Times.
As that commercial made its way onto television stations in swing states, it ran against an Obama campaign ad, which earned its own ''pants on fire'' badge. It falsely accused Mr. Romney of backing ''a bill that outlaws all abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.'' Mr. Romney has said that abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest and when it would save the mother's life.
All the while, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada continued to push his case about Mr. Romney's refusal to release more than two years of tax returns, claiming that the Republican candidate had not paid taxes for a decade. His secret source, he said, was connected to Bain. When Mr. Romney said Thursday that he had never paid an effective federal tax rate of less than 13 percent, he added, ''I'm sure waiting for Harry to put up who it was that told him what he says they told him.''
In fact, leading up to the Ryan announcement, the presidential campaign of 2012 was being fought almost entirely on specious grounds. Asked whether he believed the two campaigns were addressing the substantive issues of the day just a few hours before the news about Mr. Ryan broke, Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, and an architect of the bipartisan budget plan known as Simpson-Bowles, wrote in an e-mail, ''Are you kidding?''

HEADLINE: Sales at Wal-Mart, Though Still Rising, Suggest Wary Shoppers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Consumers in the United States still seem to be holding their breath.Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer by far, reported quarterly results on Thursday that its executives said reflected a strained consumer, adding a sober note to more upbeat earnings reports from other retailers this week.
''Consumers aren't panicked about the economy, but they are worried,'' Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, wrote in a research note. Sales growth for top retailers slowed to 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a year ago, according to Mr. Johnson's analysis. In the first quarter, sales rose 6.2 percent compared with a year earlier. (Thirty of the 40 major retailers he tracks have reported quarterly results so far.) Consumers ''are still buying, but they're buying less and they're buying closer to need,'' he wrote. 
Wal-Mart's results suggested that shoppers in the United States -- particularly low- and middle-income shoppers -- remained stretched thin and wary about splurging. Sales at the company's stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent in the United States, which was its fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth domestically. However, executives said that did not mean the American shopper was feeling especially cheery.
''I don't think the economy's helping us,'' Charles M. Holley Jr., Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters. Customers are still very concerned about employment, gas prices and food inflation, he said. ''If anything, our consumer's probably being a little more stretched because of gas prices.''
The company's overall revenue increased 4.5 percent, to $114.3 billion, for Wal-Mart's second quarter, which ended July 27. Analysts had expected higher sales, of $115.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data, and Wal-Mart said currency fluctuations were largely to blame for the difference. Profit increased to $4.02 billion, or $1.18 a share, from the second quarter of 2011, a penny above what analysts were expecting. The company increased its earnings-per-share guidance for the full year to $4.83 to $4.93, up from the $4.72 to $4.92 it had issued earlier.
Wal-Mart said that currency fluctuations lowered net sales by $2.2 billion. Without currency fluctuations, net sales, excluding membership and other revenue, would have been $115.7 billion, about in line with analysts' estimates. Shares in the company fell about 3 percent on Thursday.
Sears Holdings, which also reported quarterly earnings on Thursday, cited several reasons for its big drop in same-store sales, which declined 2.9 percent at Sears stores and 4.7 percent at Kmart stores. The company said that was because of lower volume in its clearance sales and less demand for electronics and lawn and garden items.
Revenue at Sears Holdings declined 6.6 percent to $9.5 billion for the quarter. The company's loss of $132 million, or $1.25 a share, was improved from its loss of $146 million a year ago, thanks to cost-cutting.
Not all of the signs are dour. Quarterly reports from Target, Macy's, Home Depot and other large retailers this week, and a government report showing strength in consumer spending in July, painted a more optimistic picture.
Target posted a same-store sales increase of 3.1 percent and said that shoppers were starting to buy discretionary items again, though it said staples were still very popular. ''We believe our guests will continue to be both cautious and resilient, shopping and spending at Target in disciplined ways,'' the company's chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, told analysts.
At Home Depot, which reported a 2.6 percent rise in same-store sales in the United States, consumers were pursuing small projects around the house, and executives said the housing market appeared to be stabilizing. Macy's reported a 3 percent increase in revenue.
Strong results from both Nordstrom and Saks this week suggested that well-heeled shoppers were feeling confident. And Commerce Department data for July, released this week, showed an increase of 0.8 percent in retail sales, which exceeded analyst expectations and followed three months of negative figures.
In a reminder of just how giant Wal-Mart is, William S. Simon, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in prepared remarks that the United States division's 0.4 percent increase in comparable-store traffic from a year ago represented 80,000 additional customers each day of the 13-week quarter.
Still, Wal-Mart's results suggested that midrange and low-end American consumers were still hesitant about spending money. Customers are responding to marketing that emphasizes cheap prices, Mr. Simon said, and executives said customers here were still living paycheck to paycheck.
Internationally, Wal-Mart's sales continued to grow at a quick clip, increasing 6.4 percent to $32 billion. That was a slower increase than usual -- in the first quarter, for instance, international sales rose 15 percent. And for the first time internationally, Wal-Mart executives pointed to a ''paycheck cycle'' -- when customers spend little as their paychecks run out and restock on basics once a new check arrives.
The company is in the midst of an investigation involving its Mexican subsidiary and, possibly, other foreign units. In April, The New York Times reported that executives at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., had received credible evidence about bribery allegations in 2005 and 2006 in Mexico, but shut down an internal investigation into the issue. Bribery of foreign officials is illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have opened investigations into the matter. Wal-Mart is conducting its own internal investigation into the Mexico allegations, and the company suggested in May that it was examining potential misconduct in other foreign subsidiaries.
This week, two congressmen sent a letter to Michael T. Duke, Wal-Mart's chief executive, reiterating a request for a meeting. The congressmen said that they had obtained internal documents, ''including internal audit reports, from other sources suggesting that Wal-Mart may have had compliance issues relating not only to bribery, but also to 'questionable financial behavior' including tax evasion and money laundering in Mexico.''
Mr. Holley said that Wal-Mart was not aware of any investigations regarding tax evasion or money laundering in Mexico. Company representatives have briefed Congressional staff members twice, he said.
The company spent $34 million in the quarter on expenses related to outside advisers on issues related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, like the law firms it has hired to investigate the matter, and said it expected those expenses to continue throughout the year.

HEADLINE: Few Voters Are Truly Up for Grabs, Research Shows

BYLINE: By REBECCA BERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Curtis Napier, a 52-year-old father of two in Lima, Ohio, belongs to a much-discussed group of Americans that is far smaller than is often realized: He is a true swing voter.He voted for George W. Bush in 2004 and for Barack Obama in 2008. With three months remaining in the campaign between President Obama and Mitt Romney, Mr. Napier said, ''I may not just vote for either one of them.''
About one-third of Americans describe themselves as independent voters, creating a widespread impression that a large group of Americans will provide the decisive swing votes in this year's election. But that impression is misleading, polling experts and political scientists say.
Many self-described independents -- close to half, according to surveys -- reliably vote for one party or the other. And many true swing voters live in states, like California or Texas, where no analyst doubts the outcome in November. 
In spite of clichés about Nascar dads and Walmart moms, the actual share of voters nationally who are up for grabs is probably between just 3 percent and 5 percent in this election, polling experts say. The Obama and Romney campaigns are expected to spend on the order of $2 billion, in part to try to sway this tiny share of the electorate.
''There's a very small slice of people who are genuinely undecided, but it's enough to win the presidency,'' said Rich Beeson, the political director for Mr. Romney's campaign.
The share of swing voters may even have declined in recent years, as many voters have become more reliably partisan. A report by the Pew Research Center found that self-identified Democrats are more liberal than in the past and self-identified Republicans are more conservative.
A decline in swing voters would help explain why Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have stayed within just a few points of each other, across many polls, despite months of a gyrating economy and attacks on both candidates.
It is still unknown whether the selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as Mr. Romney's running mate will provide him with a bump in the polls. But so far, the Gallup tracking poll has not indicated any immediate bump, even though vice-presidential choices have historically provided one.
In close races in particular, cable news pundits and political observers revel in swing-voter guesswork, but the ensuing portrait is often more composite sketch than photograph.
''There is so much pop psychology surrounding swing voters, but there is very little evidence that there are key demographics in the population that are inherently swing voters,'' said John Sides, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University. ''That doesn't mean that in a particular election you can't drill down, down, down, down and identify a group of swing voters. But how big is that group really, and is that group a swing group in a chronic sense? Probably not.''
Part of the difficulty in identifying swing voters derives from confusion about the term ''swing voter'' itself. These voters might describe themselves as ''undecided,'' for example, or as ''persuadable.'' Often, they call themselves ''independents,'' although many who identify that way are not.
Myths about the behavior of these voters are pervasive and persistent: For example, that undecided voters break for the challenger as Election Day nears. (Data have shown this is often not the case.)
Among those whose past behavior suggests they are up for grabs this year, a few demographics are well represented. Many of those swing voters will be younger, or will not have graduated from college. More swing voters will be women than men.
In three tossup states -- Colorado, Florida and Nevada -- Hispanics could make up as much as one-fifth of the swing vote. And non-college graduates will make up roughly 57 percent of swing voters in battleground states this year, according to one Democratic pollster, whose estimates were confirmed within a few points by a Republican.
Of likely swing voters, white non-college voters are ''particularly low-information voters who don't pay attention to the daily political back-and-forth, so their opinions are driven by their economic situation,'' said Jefrey Pollock, the president of Global Strategy Group, a polling firm for Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama ''super PAC.'' Many, he said, are ''fond of the president personally, but skeptical about their economic prospects.''
A senior Romney aide, who requested anonymity discussing strategy, says the campaign's microtargeting has identified specific swing-voter-rich counties in swing states: In Virginia, for example, a large number of swing voters are concentrated in Fairfax County, just outside the District of Columbia; in Ohio, by contrast, undecided or persuadable voters are scattered throughout the state. In some cases, demographic patterns emerge: In Arapahoe County, Colo., just outside Denver, the majority of swing voters will probably be women, the aide said.
Among these swing voters, only some are genuinely torn about whom to support but are certain they will vote, and a significant number favor a political party and will vote for the candidate of that party or not at all.
Mr. Napier, the swing voter from Ohio, said last month that he might fall into the latter category this year, but that he did not yet have enough information to decide. Between working full time for a fabrication company and attending school part time for a degree in manufacturing engineering, he said consideration of the presidential election was an afterthought.
In 2008, Mr. Napier drew much of his information from the presidential debates, in which, he says, ''McCain seemed to be distracted most of the time when he talked, and Obama seemed to be an educated man who has focus.''
Swing voters often form their opinions about candidates based on emotional intangibles and a few events, like the debates. Candidates may have just one chance to make an impression on these voters, and not always on the campaigns' terms.
''With these voters, they're only paying half attention, but all of these outside events have an effect,'' said Neil Newhouse, the head of polling for Mr. Romney's campaign.
Vying for the attention of these voters, the campaigns will wage a violent tug of war, which will include television advertising, digital strategy and vast ground operations.
''I really do believe that the average swing voter in these states -- people are going to see all these ads and, at some point, they're going to have a conversation with their friends and family and neighbors about how they're going to vote, and we're going to be there,'' said Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager.
But for all of the money and resources that will be spent to persuade swing voters, experts agree that the attention could prove unrequited.
''I'm fairly certain about one thing: if turnout is lower in 2012 than in 2008 (which is not so unlikely), then there will be fewer 'swing voters' turning out,'' Markus Prior, an associate professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, wrote in an e-mail. ''In lower-turnout elections, you will find a higher share of committed partisans.''
Indeed, the possibility that partisan voters will drive this year's election outcome is likely enough that it raises the question of whether swing voters are worth the attention they will receive.
''There's a constant debate in politics between turnout and persuasion, but the reality is, in close elections both things are important,'' said Geoff Garin, a consultant for Priorities USA Action. ''A campaign ignores one in favor of the other at its great peril.''

HEADLINE: Examining the Factors Behind Disappointing Economic Growth

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How important are demographic trends to the great growth slowdown of the last 12 years? 

 BODY:
Economic growth in the United States has been disappointing for more than a decade now. Some of the reasons are complex and hotly debated, and will be the subject of a series of posts here starting next week. But one of the reasons is not mysterious at all. It simply reflects demographic changes.
The share of Americans who are working age - old enough to be out of school but young enough not to be retired - is no longer growing. Only about 53 percent of the population was between the ages of 25 and 64 last year, unchanged from 2007 and up only slightly from 52 percent in 1997. Between 1967 and 1997, by contrast, the share grew 8 percentage points, to 52 percent from 44 percent. As more baby boomers retire, the share will begin to fall.
Fewer people of working age means, obviously enough, fewer workers. It also means fewer potential entrepreneurs creating new businesses that hire people. 
And aging isn't the only demographic weight holding back the economy. For most of the 20th century, the share of women in the labor force was rising. It reached 60 percent in 1997, up from just 32 percent in 1948. 
But the share isn't rising anymore. It fell below 60 percent in the 2001 recession, spent most of the last decade around 59 percent and, in the long aftermath of the financial crisis, was only 57.6 percent last month. 
The same logic applies to the female trends as the overall population trends: absent an ever-growing flow of new workers, the economy will struggle to grow as quickly.
How important are these demographic trends to the great growth slowdown of the last 12 years?
The reason that the statistic known as productivity receives so much attention is because it measures economic growth while controlling for demographics. Productivity is simply average hourly output across the economy. It is not directly affected by how many people are working.
When you look at the productivity trends, they are not quite as grim as the economic growth trends. The growth rate has fallen sharply over the last decade but it is not at a 60-year low. The average annual growth of productivity over the last decade, 1.9 percent, is somewhat below the average rate of the last 60 years, 2.2 percent.
From the mid-1990s to the early part of last decade, by comparison, productivity was growing at its fastest rate since the 1960s. So the drop-off in the past decade has been sharp.
By extension, it seems clear that demographics are an important reason that the American economy has slowed but only one part of a much bigger story.
Our mission next week will be to dig into that story. We will begin exploring the causes of the slowdown in Americans' income growth, a result of both the slowdown in economic growth and a rise in inequality. Based on the hundreds of reader comments on our initial Agenda post and on follow-up conversations with economists, I came up with a list of 14 major potential causes.
We will post the list on Monday and invite readers to tell us which causes they believe are the most important. We'll also tell you what we are hearing about the list from a range of the country's top economists.

HEADLINE: New Hedge Funds Abound, Despite Tepid Industry Performance

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: More new hedge funds started in the first quarter of this year than in any quarter since 2007, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Some newcomers as well as industry veterans are branching out on their own. 

 BODY:
It's been a rough couple of years to be a hedge fund. Weak performance, enhanced regulation and an aggressive crackdown on insider trading have cast a harsh spotlight on the industry. 
Not that you'd know it by looking at the new crop of traders leaping into the profession. More new hedge funds started in the first quarter of this year than in any quarter since 2007, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
There are many reasons for the surge. The industry, despite disappointing returns, remains a destination for large swaths of institutional money. Pension funds, endowments and wealthy families continue plowing billions into hedge funds every year, swelling overall industry assets to more than $2 trillion. With that kind of money, the economics are extremely attractive for upstarts who think they can raise big sums. 
At the same time, talent is fleeing the big Wall Street banks. New regulations put into place after the financial crisis forced banks to close down their proprietary trading desks, leaving dozens of traders looking for their next act. Many of them decided to try their hands at starting hedge funds. New funds are also in vogue as investors tire of bigger, more established managers who have demonstrated lackluster performance.
But the success rate of new hedge funds is low. Those with ambitions to be the next Bridgewater Associates are plenty; those who succeed are rare.Though 304 funds were started in the first quarter of the year, 232 were liquidated in the same period. Most of them are anonymous funds, largely managing the money of friends and family. 
The hedge fund industry "is like the restaurant business: everyone wants to start one but they aren't prepared for the high level of failure," said Omeed Malik, head of the emerging manager program at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. "One thing the vast majority of the top emerging managers have in common is the three P's: pedigree, performance and product."
Among the more prominent new funds created by well-known firms includes one from Renaissance Technologies, as AR magazine reported this week. But a number teams have left bigger hedge funds recently to start their own shops. 
Some of these so-called spinoffs are seasoned industry veterans and are expected to attract real money. Others are newcomers who are starting with family cash and may need to prove their mettle quickly if they want to attract other investors.
SAC Capital, the behemoth hedge fund run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen, has had two groups of veterans leave the firm recently. Such departures are typical for a firm the size of SAC, which has more than 100 portfolio managers, and numerous hedge fund managers can trace their lineage to SAC, a nearly 20-year-old shop based in Connecticut.
Among the new funds are Adams Hill Capital, started by Andrew Schwartz, who was a longtime portfolio manager at SAC, where he ran a highly successful equity fund focused on global resources. He will take with him two analysts and a trader, according to people familiar with the fund. Another SAC alumnus is also heading out with four analysts from his team. Jos Shaver, who arrived at SAC in 2008, is relaunching a hedge fund he ran before the financial crisis. At SAC, he has run a stock fund focused on utilities. 
John Lennon, 29, left JAT Capital, where he was a senior analyst, to start his own shop, Pleasant Lake Partners. He has hired a former Goldman Sachs partner, David Mastrocola, to be the firm's president.
Jeff Lignelli left Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund started by David Tepper, to start Incline Global Management this April. A former partner at Appaloosa, Mr. Lignelli has the rare stamp of approval from Mr. Tepper, who made an initial investment with his former employee. The firm now manages just over $100 million.
Even some less-seasoned financiers are trying their skills. Schuster Tanger, a scion of the Tanger family, which built substantial wealth running nationwide shopping outlet malls, is starting a fund at the age of 26. Mr. Tanger, a former Third Point analyst, will team up with Josh Packwood, a former associate at Citadel who was the first white valedictorian of the predominantly black Morehouse College. The new fund, Red Adler, was started with a $30 million initial investment from Mr. Tanger's family.

HEADLINE: Former Chief of Peregrine Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Russell Wasendorf Sr., the former chief executive of the failed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, pleaded not guilty on Friday to lying to federal regulators. He has been charged with 31 counts of deceiving regulators about the value of his customers' accounts. 

 BODY:
The former chief executive of the failed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, who last month wrote a note admitting that he had committed a long-ranging investment fraud, pleaded not guilty on Friday to lying to federal regulators.
Federal prosecutors charged Russell Wasendorf Sr., the former head of Peregrine, with 31 counts of deceiving regulators about the value of his customers' accounts. If convicted, he would face a maximum prison sentence of 155 years.
Last month, police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where Peregrine was based, found Mr. Wasendorf unconscious in his car after a suicide attempt. Alongside him was a note confessing to embezzling more than $100 million from clients and defrauding the firm's banks. The authorities arrested him, and regulators discovered a customer fund shortfall at Peregrine of at least $200 million.
As the government continues to examine Peregrine's collapse, prosecutors are expected to seek additional charges against Mr. Wasendorf. Even with his earlier admission of wrongdoing, a not-guilty plea is not unusual at this stage of the case. He can try to strike a plea agreement with prosecutors by helping with the investigation, including tracking down missing customer money.
During the 10-minute arraignment proceeding in Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. Wasendorf stood quietly as his lawyer, Jane Kelly, entered the plea. He was dressed in orange prison garb, his hands and legs shackled, according to Bloomberg News.
Ms. Kelly did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
The charges against Mr. Wasendorf came just months after MF Global, the now-defunct futures brokerage firm, could not locate more than $1 billion in client money. Together, the two collapses highlighted regulatory holes and insufficient financial protections in the futures industry, which largely consists of money management firms that trade contracts in commodities, currencies and interest rates.
"These have been huge blows to the industry and we're looking at a variety of solutions that will better protect customer funds," said Walter Lukken, the president of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group. Mr. Wasendorf was a prominent figure in the futures business. He served on an advisory committee at the National Futures Association, one of the industry's primary regulators. His son, Russell Wasendorf Jr., served as the president of Peregrine, which also did business as PFGBest.
The elder Mr. Wasendorf also loomed large in Cedar Falls, a town with 40,000 people. An Iowa native, he moved his business from Chicago - the epicenter of the futures markets - to Cedar Falls and spent about $18 million on its new headquarters there.
Peregrine came undone last month after the National Futures Association instituted changes to its auditing process that allowed the regulator to get information about the firm's accounts directly from its banks. The association started putting the new system into effect on the morning that Mr. Wasendorf tried to kill himself.
In his confession note, Mr. Wasendorf said he acted alone. No other Peregrine executives have been charged in the case.

HEADLINE: In Report, British Officials Question Testimony of Barclays Chief

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The report also challenges some of Robert E. Diamond Jr.'s assertions about the bank's relationship with regulators and raises questions about the culture and top leadership at the bank. 

 BODY:
LONDON - In a report released early Saturday in London, British politicians said the former Barclays chief Robert E. Diamond Jr. had not provided lawmakers a full account of the actions inside the bank during recent hearings into the rate-rigging scandal.
The report also challenges some of Mr. Diamond's assertions about the bank's relationship with regulators. It also questioned the top leadership at the bank and the candor of Mr. Diamond's testimony.
"Mr. Diamond's evidence, at times highly selective, fell well short of the standard that Parliament expects," Andrew Tyrie, the British politician who led the recent hearings, said in a separate statement.
Documents released by local authorities show that officials had questioned the culture at the top of the British bank as far back as 2010, though Mr. Diamond had said regulators were happy with the firm's leadership.
The doubts about Mr. Diamond's testimony come after several of Barclays' senior executives, including its chairman, resigned last month. The firm agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and
British authorities over the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, one of the world's most important benchmark rates.
British lawmakers had called several of the firm's executives and the country's leading regulatory authorities to testify before Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which had been investigating the Libor scandal at Barclays.
The lawmakers' latest report criticized Mr. Diamond's recollection of concerns that regulators had raised when he was appointed chief executive, as well as issues with the culture at the British bank.
Also in his testimony, Mr. Diamond had said British authorities were pleased with his relationship with the Financial Services Authority, the country's regulator. The regulators, however, testified that they had challenged the firm's attitude toward risk and had called on Mr. Diamond to distance himself from colleagues in Barclays' investment banking unit. In the latest report, it appears that lawmakers mostly sided with the authorities.
"It seems to us inconceivable that Mr. Diamond could have believed that the F.S.A. was satisfied with the tone at the top of Barclays," the report said.
Mr. Diamond issued a sharply worded rebuke of the report.
"I am disappointed by, and strongly disagree with, several statements by the Treasury Select Committee," Mr. Diamond said in a statement on Saturday. "There is little dispute that Barclays was both aggressive in its investigation of this matter and engaged in its cooperation with the appropriate authorities."
The latest report also questioned the importance of a conversation that Mr. Diamond held with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in 2008.
The discussion focused on the firm's Libor submissions, and led to Jerry del Missier, a senior Barclays official, to ask some of the firm's employees to alter their Libor rates. Mr. del Missier said he believed that he was acting on instructions from British government officials, though Mr. Tucker dismisses that contention.
Lawmakers said that Barclays' employees had been manipulating rate submissions since 2007, and that Mr. del Missier's ability to alter submissions showed a lack of regulatory compliance.
"It remains possible that the entire Tucker-Diamond dialogue may have been a smokescreen put up to distract our attention," the report said. Poor judgment by the firm's board led to a lack of controls, which could have stopped the rate manipulation from taking place, according to the report.
A Barclays spokesman said that the bank did not agree with all the report's findings but was conducting an independent review of its business practices.
The report also highlighted failures by the Financial Services Authority to address the manipulation of Libor.
Concerns that firms were altering their Libor submissions were first brought to the attention of authorities in late 2007, according to regulatory filings. But British officials joined their American counterparts in investigating the abuses only in early 2010.
Adair Turner, chairman of the authority, told British lawmakers last month that regulators had not perceived Libor to be a major area of risk during the recent financial crisis.
"The manipulation was spotted neither by the F.S.A. nor the Bank of England at the time," Mr. Tyrie said. "That doesn't look good."
The British government is reviewing how Libor will be set in the future. The inquiry may lead to greater regulatory oversight of the rate, while lawmakers are considering new laws that would make the manipulation of benchmark rates a criminal offense.
American and international authorities also continue to examine the actions of other global financial institutions, including Citigroup and HSBC. New York and Connecticut state regulators announced on Wednesday that they were widening their own rate-rigging investigations.

HEADLINE: When Social Media Marketing Doesn't Work for You

BYLINE: MELINDA F. EMERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Like a lot of business owners, John Lacher, a private investigator, has struggled getting started with social media. Is he doing something wrong? 

 BODY:
John Edgar Lacher owns the J.Edgar Investigation Agency and is an avid reader of this blog. Recently, he left the following comment on one of my posts, "Using Social Media to Test Your Idea Before You Try to Sell It."
The social media thing such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others have done nothing for me. Personally, I think it is all just another money trap. I have spent thousands of dollars on marketing such as SEO, adwords, etc with little or no results. Everyone has got their hand out but no one has the ability or the experience much less the interest to help someone. Everyone is wrapped up in their own little world tweeting and facebooking. I have better luck with face-to-face meetings and referrals from people that know me. I would much rather spend the time and money with a face-to-face meeting than anything else.
In part because I think there are a lot of people who feel the same way Mr. Lacher does, I decided to contact him to discuss his experiences. 
It turns out he is a licensed private investigator with an office in San Diego. In business since 2008, Mr. Lacher, 64, started the agency after being laid off by American International Group at the start of the Great Recession. He specializes in insurance claims investigations, but he also investigates fraud, theft, property damage, or elder abuse. And if you think your spouse has been cheating, he can look into that, too.
Private clients have been his biggest source of revenue, but things are rough right now (he has been supporting himself with his Social Security checks). He knows he started his business at a difficult time, and he says the competition in California for P.I. work is intense. "There's a lot of retired law enforcement, ex-military and former F.B.I. agents who have come to this area," he said, "and it's hard to compete with their credentials."
So far, he hasn't found social media to be of much help. He canceled his Facebook page, because he felt it was more personal than business, and he didn't think he needed to be there. "I had a lot of people who would ask questions about how I do private investigations, but I never got a single client from it," Mr. Lacher said. "I got a bunch of stupid comments from people, which was really annoying."
He is on Twitter but has only tweeted a few times. He has had the most success with LinkedIn, where he has a premium account that costs $24.95 a month. He says he invested in it because business has become global. "I started using LinkedIn a year or so ago, I am a premium member so I can see the profile of people that I would not have access to. I have 650 connections to date. It's a great asset for me to be able to do business intelligence. I have not been getting any business from LinkedIn yet, but I am hopeful."
A year ago, he invested $94 a month in a Web site he got through Web.com. Disappointed, he pulled it down after six months. Then he decided to build his own site, which is still up. Six weeks ago, he gave a webinar on GotoMeeting.com, offering a session on Investigation 101. He was thrilled with the attendance but didn't win any business from that, either.
He has thought about trying Google AdWords, but some of his colleagues in the business cooled him on the idea. "I was concerned about doing Google AdWords because people were commenting on an industry listserv that competitors were clicking on the ads from other private investigators to drive up the budget." So he hasn't tried that yet.
After discussing his frustrations, he asked me. "Where do you start first? Where do I put the money at?"
There are five steps that I think everyone should take if they are serious about using social media as a marketing strategy, but there are always a few things to consider. Social media marketing is a long tail strategy for a small business -- it can take a lot longer than six months to see results. And it starts with a strong Web site.
Even once you have connected with someone, social-media-networking takes considerably more time than face-to-face networking. I believe it takes seven quality contacts before you can start talking commerce, but I've read industry estimates as high as 21 meaningful contacts before you can close business. Here are the five steps I suggested for Mr. Lacher.
Invest in a real Web site: Mr. Lacher's site is not helping his brand. Just as you would never call a plumber to do a carpenter's job, you have no business developing your own Web site (unless that is your business). Hire a professional. For $500 to $1,500, you can get a basic WordPress Web site or blog site that will represent your business well. Your site should have helpful content and at least three to five ways to engage potential customers, including offering an e-book download, newsletter sign-ups and free webinar sign-ups.
Know your keywords: No search-engine optimization campaign will work if you don't have the right keywords. You need to know how your target customers search for services online. Free tools like Wordtrakker and Google Keyword Tool can help.
Use a listening strategy: As a small-business owner, you can't be everywhere in social media, but where you should be is where your target customers are hanging out. LinkedIn is the right place for Mr. Lacher. Keep spending time there, start using the Answers area to demonstrate expertise. Join groups where target customers belong, and share helpful information. Post your webinar materials through SlideShare to amplify your content.
Start blogging: Once you get your site fixed, start blogging. The best way to demonstrate your expertise is to share techniques and success stories. Be sure to use your keywords in your blog posts.
Share helpful content: One of the best ways to attract clients with social media is to position yourself as a resource. And don't just share your own content -- be generous and share the information of others in your industry. It's a great way to build strategic alliances and make friends.
Mr. Lacher wants to grow his agency to the point where he could hire two people full-time who would be licensed under him. Right now, he is looking for a bilingual woman to help him with marketing.
What have you found difficult to do in getting started in social media? Have you been able to figure it out?

HEADLINE: Calls Escalate for Presidential Debate Aimed at Hispanics and People of Color

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: The head of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies sent a letter to the debate commission urging them to hold a debate moderated by Hispanics or people of color. 

 BODY:
The calls for an additional presidential debate moderated by (and aimed at) people of color escalated on Friday.
Ralph B. Everett, the chief executive of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research and analysis center that focuses on the socioeconomic status of African Americans and other people of color, sent a letter to Janet H. Brown, executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates. He urged her to reconsider the commission's rejection of a plea by Univision to stage a presidential debate moderated by its own Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena, or another host of Hispanic origin.
"It has long been the practice of the television industry to avoid placing people of color in front of the camera," Mr. Everett wrote. He said he hoped the commission would embrace Univision's proposal "by adding more debates to the calendar."
On Wednesday evening Mr. Ramos used the nightly Univision newscast to invite President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney to participate in a "forum" on the Spanish-language network.
"We ask it to reconsider its decision to deny Univision's request for a forum to be hosted by two of the nation's most respected journalists," Mr. Everett said in his letter.
Ms. Brown was not immediately available to comment on the letter.
A large portion of Hispanic viewers gets its news exclusively from Spanish language television and radio. Mr. Everett ticked off data points in his letter as evidence that people of color need the candidates to address issues of pressing importance to them. While the nation's overall employment rate was 8.3 percent in July, the rates for African Americans and Hispanics was 14.1 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: On CCTV America, Some China Stories Recede From View

BYLINE: JACOB FROMER


HIGHLIGHT: A study of its archives shows that CCTV America, an outpost of the Chinese state-controlled broadcaster, tends to avoid news of dissidents or disgraced officials. 

 BODY:
Although they come from opposite ends of the Chinese political spectrum, for two months this spring Bo Xilai, a Communist Party official who was dismissed from his post, and Chen Guangcheng, a blind, activist lawyer who fled house arrest in his village, shared one important trait: they were the most closely watched Chinese men in the world. 
When Mr. Bo fell from power in March and Mr. Chen made an unlikely escape from house arrest the following month -- eventually seeking refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing -- their stories were documented in minute detail in American newspapers, magazines and Twitter feeds. That is, with one notable exception: on CCTV America's weekend news program produced in Washington by China's state broadcaster, neither man's plight made the headlines. As my colleague Andrew Jacobs reports, CCTV America failed to feature either man's story. 
Here is a look at what the program did cover as those major events unfolded.
March 15: Bo Xilai Ousted From Communist Party
 The brash Communist Party chief of the Chongqing municipality in China's southwest was removed from his post. It was the most high-profile dismissal of a Chinese official in years, ending his political ambitions and complicating the once-a-decade national leadership transition that will take place in the fall. 
Here are the headlines from CCTV America's China-related stories that weekend:
 Chinese Special Envoy to Syria Returns From Trip to Damascus; China Concerned About Upcoming North Korean Missile Launch; Chinese Surveillance Ships Return From Diaoyu Islands; Important Commercial Relationship Between Brazil and China.
 More Concern Over Upcoming North Korean Missile Launch; Chinese Authors Sue Apple; Beijing Subway Overhaul; First Chinese-American Congresswoman.
April 22: Chen Guangcheng Escapes From House Arrest
 The blind rights lawyer scaled the wall of his compound, evaded his guards, and fled with a driver to the American Embassy in Beijing. The result was an intense diplomatic standoff between the United States and China just as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner were preparing to arrive in Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.
Here are the China-related headlines on CCTV America the weekend after Mr. Chen's escape became public:
 New China-Russia Trade Contracts; Strategic Economic Dialogue Ready to Start; Terracotta Warriors on Exhibit in New York.
 Ongoing China-Philippines Naval Dispute at the Huangyan Islands.
May 2: Chen Guangcheng Released From U.S. Embassy
 After days of heated diplomatic negotiations and numerous vacillations by an exhausted Mr. Chen about whether to leave the embassy, the blind dissident agreed to move to a nearby hospital where he reunited with his family and told reporters that he wanted to leave China.
Here is what CCTV America saw as the China-related stories the weekend after Mr. Chen left the embassy:
 Chinese-U.S. Officials Hold Talks at Strategic Economic Dialogue.
 China Consumer Price Index Update; Toyota's Ambitious Plans for China.
A CCTV employee told The Times that the program did record a segment about Mr. Chen that included footage of his stay at the hospital, but no such segment appears in the archived episodes available on CCTV America's Web site.

HEADLINE: Changes Atop Egypt's Government Create Uncertain Path for United States

BYLINE: DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: Recent developments in Egypt have brought United States policy makers closer than ever to a confronting a situation that has haunted American relations with Egypt for more than 30 years: a government truly controlled by the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood. 

 BODY:
During the first months of Barack Obama's stint in the United States Senate and the beginning of President George W. Bush's second term, an Egyptian general wrote a thesis for the Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Pa., offering American policy makers advice about how to manage relations with the Middle East.
The author, Brigadier General Sedky Sobhy, was elevated to chief of staff of Egypt's military this week as part of reshuffle of top defense officials by President Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader and the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood. General Sobhy now helps oversee the military institution that has been the closest United States ally in Egypt and the region. And his paper, first reported by the journalist Issandr el Amrani on his blog the Arabist, and which we wrote about in Friday's Times, is a vivid reminder of how fast the landscape of the region is changing in ways that may challenge whoever occupies in the White House.
United States policies in the Middle East were contradictory and unsustainable, General Sobhy wrote. Opposition to America's military presence in the Gulf, its interventions in the Muslim countries and its "one-sided" support for Israel had inspired an endless recruiting pool of Islamist radicals and "immersed" Washington in an "asymmetrical" global war against terrorists with no foreseeable goal or endpoint. United States policies and the Western hostility to Islam belied Washington's stated commitment to democracy. The best solution, the general wrote, was an all but complete withdrawal of United States forces from the region, to be accompanied by economic assistance, more forceful support for the Palestinian peace process, and "the impartial application of international law." 
Neither Mr. Obama nor Mitt Romney have ever publicly considered such a sweeping reconfiguration of America's role in the region; for one thing, it would shock and alarm United States allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia because it would remove a potential check on Iranian power. At the same time, however, General Sobhy's views reflect the overwhelming Egyptian (and Arab) public as well as the past positions of the new president. So his War College essay is useful reminder of the complexities Arab democracies present to American strategy in the region. 
Indeed, just as the United States campaign turned briefly to the foreign policy dilemmas of the changing Middle East - with Mr. Romney visiting Jerusalem on the heels of two cabinet secretaries shoring up the Obama administration's support in Tel Aviv -- events on the ground in both Egypt and Syria were already revising the strategic questions arising from the Arab spring.
This update to the Agenda project will take stock of the changes in Egypt and another one will turn to Syria.
General Sobhy's appointment as Army chief of staff capped a dizzying week in Egypt. It began with the worst attack by Islamist terrorists in more than a decade and ended in consolidation of power by Egypt's main Islamist group, Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.
The terrorist attack, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers near the Sinai border with Israel, set off the first crisis of Mr. Morsi's two-month-old presidency. But some analysts, including some in the Obama administration speaking on condition of anonymity, argue that the response bodes well for the young government. Although the Muslim Brotherhood issued a statement at least suggesting that Israel may have been responsible for the attacks -- playbook political demagoguery in Egypt -- Mr. Morsi resisted that temptation. He vowed to crack down on the Islamist militants responsible and Hamas -- the militant Palestinian offshoot of the Brotherhood that controls the Gaza strip -- denounced the attacks as well.
In a sign of regional stability, Israeli leaders did not allow themselves to be baited into a conflict with Egypt, an obvious potential goal of the attack near the border. And some Israeli analysts praised Mr. Morsi for standing against the militant Islamists, though scholars of the Muslim Brotherhood note that it has opposed the use of violence since Egypt's 1952 revolution against the British-backed monarchy.
The political aftershocks of the attack, however, have also brought United States policy makers closer than ever to a confronting a situation that has haunted American relations with Egypt for more than 30 years: a government truly controlled by the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood. Before the attacks, Egypt's top military leaders -- traditionally Washington's closest allies in Cairo -- had drastically constrained the power of Mr. Morsi and the Brotherhood. In the final days of martial law, the generals used the pretext of a court decision to dissolve the parliament and then issued a decree granting to themselves all budgetary and lawmaking power.
But amid the military's embarrassment over the attack, Mr. Morsi, with the consent of the top generals, appeared to redouble his own power. He announced that the defense minister and the former chief of staff would leave their posts and become his advisers. And he rescinded the military's power grab, claiming most power for himself until the election of a new parliament.
In public statements, the Obama administration called the reshuffle a welcome sign that Mr. Morsi and the generals were sharing power effectively. A shift of authority from the Mubarak-appointed generals to the newly elected president is, after all, a step toward democracy. But what checks on Mr. Morsi may remain are now thoroughly obscured from view, in shadowy, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the generals, including the former defense officials-turned-presidential advisers, Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and his chief of staff, General Sami Anan.
Already some in Washington are raising alarms about what the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood will mean for United States interests in the region. Some have suggested that the 2005 essay by the new chief of staff, General Sobhy, augurs a meeting of the minds between the military and the Brotherhood on a turn away from Washington.
"If historical precedent is any guide, Morsi's shake-up at the Egyptian Ministry of Defense will be followed by a strategic realignment between Cairo and Washington," the scholar Steven A. Cook wrote on the Web site of the journal Foreign Affairs.
"It thus stands to reason that Morsi's sacking of Egypt's top national security and defense officials might in part represent a shift in Egyptian foreign policy away from the United States," Mr. Cook wrote. "Toward what country, however, remains unclear. There is no other power that could be Egypt's patron, yet Cairo might not need one. Egypt, representing a quarter of the Arab world and strategically located on the Suez Canal and Afro-Asian rift -- is a power in its own right."
The military appointments "might signal a desire to pursue a foreign policy more befitting of Egypt's prestige, an approach to the world that does not privilege any particular foreign relationship over another and that is geared toward maximizing Egypt's national interests in contrast to what many perceive to be the record of the last three decades." If so, the United States should begin to expect Cairo to be more of a strategic gadfly than a reliable ally, Mr. Cook said, much as it was during the Arab nationalist era of Gamal Abdel Nasser- when Egypt drifted closer to the Soviet Union as Washington stood by Israel.
A previous version of this post referred incorrectly to the college where the Egyptian general Sedky Sobhy wrote a paper on American foreign policy in the Middle East. It was the Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Pa., not the National War College in Washington.

HEADLINE: Baseball Hall of Fame Player Settles Insider Trading Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Eddie Murray, the former Baltimore Orioles player, of illegally trading on a tip on a $2.8 billion merger. 

 BODY:
On the standout Baltimore Orioles baseball teams of the late 1970s, Eddie Murray, the Hall of Fame first baseman, shared the infield with the all-star third baseman Doug DeCinces.
Federal regulators say that decades later, the two close friends shared something else: illegal stock tips.
Mr. Murray was charged on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading ahead of a merger announcement after receiving advanced word of the deal from Mr. DeCinces.
The S.E.C. said that Mr. DeCinces had received the tip from James V. Mazzo, the former chairman and chief executive of Advanced Medical Optics, an eye care company that Abbott Laboratories acquired for nearly $3 billion in 2009.
Mr. Murray, who was among the 10 highest paid players in the National League in 1991, when he signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets for $7.5 million, made about $235,000 in illegal gains by buying shares of Advanced Medical Optics ahead of the deal and then selling his stake after it was announced, the S.E.C. said. Mr. Murray agreed to settle the case by paying $358,000 in disgorged profits and penalties without admitting or denying the charges. 
"It is truly disappointing when role models, particularly those who have achieved so much in their professional careers, give in to the temptation of easy money," said Daniel M. Hawke, a senior S.E.C. enforcement lawyer.
Michael J. Proctor, a lawyer for Mr. Murray, said that his client "is an honorable and ethical man who is settling this to put the matter to rest and move on with life."
The charges against Mr. Murray come a day after federal regulators charged another sports figure, the former University of Georgia football coach Jim Donnan, with running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded fellow coaches and his former players.
The latest cases add to the spate of lawsuits brought by the commission against athletes. Last December, the former Chicago Bears receiver Willie Gault was accused of artificially inflating the stock of a company he helped run. He has denied the claim.
The charges on Friday also add to the increasing number of insider trading cases brought over the last several years. Both the Justice Department and the commission have made rooting out illegal trading a priority. They have brought more than 100 cases against individuals since the financial crisis.
Mr. Mazzo, 55, ranks among the most prominent corporate managers charged with insider trading. Unlike Mr. Murray, Mr. Mazzo is fighting the charges. His stock tip allowed Mr. Murray, Mr. DeCinces and others to earn about $2.4 million in profits, the S.E.C. said.
"He flatly and unequivocally denies the S.E.C.'s allegations," said Richard Marmaro, a lawyer for Mr. Mazzo. "Mr. Mazzo has a spotless reputation for professionalism, integrity and service to his community, built up over a career of 30 years. The notion that he would put all that at risk to give a single friend inside information is absurd."
Earlier this year, Mr. Mazzo announced that he would retire at the end of 2012 from Abbott, where he serves as a senior executive in the company's eye care unit. An Abbott spokesman said the charges were a personal matter for Mr. Mazzo and that he would remain an employee of the company until year-end.
The S.E.C.'s complaint details repeated contact and communication between Mr. Mazzo and Mr. DeCinces around the time of merger discussions between Advanced Medical Optics and Abbott. In one instance, just days before the merger announcement, the two were golfing at the same country club in Orange County, Calif., and there are records of two calls from Mr. DeCinces's mobile phone to Mr. Murray's.
The accusations against Mr. Murray and Mr. Mazzo represent the second round of charges related to the Advanced Medical Optics-Abbott combination. The commission brought its initial charges last year against Mr. DeCinces and three others. Mr. DeCinces, like his former teammate, also paid a large fine to settle the case against him.
Mr. Murray, 56, is one of only four Major League Baseball players to finish his career with at least 500 homers and 3,000 hits. Last Saturday, the Orioles unveiled a bronze sculpture of Mr. Murray at Camden Yards, the Baltimore stadium where the team plays.

HEADLINE: On Energy Policy, a Week of Venus and Mars

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney praised fossil fuels, especially coal, while President Obama emphasized the creation of wind power jobs. 

 BODY:
Support for green energy is emerging as one of the starker divides in the presidential race, raising questions about the renewable energy sector's ability to thrive.
Visiting critical swing states, the candidates tailored their messages to two very different energy constituencies. President Obama went to Oskaloosa, Iowa, to highlight the 7,000 wind industry jobs created in the state and criticize Mitt Romney for opposing the renewal of a wind energy tax credit that is set to expire at the end of the year.
"At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind energy producers," the president said during a stop on a farm that has several wind turbines. Accusing Mr. Romney of dismissing new sources of energy like wind as imaginary, Mr. Obama said: "If he knew what you've been doing, he'd see that in places like Newton, where a few years ago, a Maytag plant shut down and jobs dried up, folks are now back to work manufacturing enormous new towers and blades for some of the most high-tech wind turbines on the planet."
For his part, Mr. Romney traveled to the tiny coal-mining town of Beallsville, Ohio, a state that produces and consumes a lot of coal. There, he told a crowd of miners that Mr. Obama's policies had raised the cost of energy and hurt the coal industry, which he would strive to protect if elected. 
"We have 250 years of coal," he said., "Why the heck wouldn't we use it?" 
The coal industry, which like the wind and solar power industry has been hurt by competition from the low price of natural gas, has been objecting to new environmental regulations that it says make it all but impossible to build new coal-fired plants. Mr. Romney also promised that the nation would rely only on North American energy by the end of a second Romney term. 
Although Mr. Obama has backed off from his 2008 promise to make climate change part of the national conversation, his administration has aggressively supported the development of green industries through the stimulus act, government purchasing, subsidies and mandates, and the amount of renewable energy produced across the country has significantly expanded. Although Mr. Romney has expressed support for clean technology, he has been signaling that he would shift away from government involvement in the alternative energy arena in favor of emphasizing the exploitation of fossil fuels. 
Indeed, in laying out the economic benefits of domestic energy production, his campaign Web site sticks to fossil fuels. "Before the first barrel of oil is pumped out of the ground, entire industries are hard at work creating the equipment and providing the services used in drilling, production and the long chain of supporting industries that brings energy from inside the earth to the consumer," it says. 
"The United States is blessed with a cornucopia of carbon-based energy resources," it says. "Developing them has been a pathway to prosperity for the nation in the past and offers similar promise for the future."
What kind of energy conversation or debate do you think the candidates should be having? Are the nation's energy mix or energy investments in your state potent issues for you this year?

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan and Tax Policy

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What's wrong and right about the Ryan approach to taxes. 

 BODY:
Scott Galupo, the former Capitol Hill staffer turned blogger for the American Conservative, responds to my last post on Paul Ryan's policy record, mixing some praise for Ryan with the following critique:
My problem with Ryan isn't on the entitlement reform side; it's on the revenue side. His assumption that another round of supply-side tax cuts will spark growth and unleash pent-up consumer demand strikes me as just as wooly-headed as the Tea Party freshmen's knowledge of the federal budget.
And it's this outmoded Kemp-ism that undermines his best idea, i.e., premium support. If Ryan and the GOP would have agreed to a sensible compromise on new revenue - which can be accomplished without the higher marginal tax rates that Obama calls for - then a deal on Medicare would have been far more likely.
I agree with Galupo's first point; I'm more doubtful about the second one. Ryan's supply-side zeal is probably his most significant weakness as a policy entrepreneur: Like most Reaganites, he has a Kemp-ian belief in the growth-unleashing power of lower marginal tax rates, but he's operating in an era when (thanks to Kemp and Reagan) those rates are already low enough that there's a lot less to be gained from slashing them even further. This doesn't mean that some kind of rate-lowering, base-broadening tax reform isn't still a good idea - it is, and Ryan's right to champion it. But it isn't the only good idea in the world, and the disappointing returns to the Bush-era tax cuts strongly suggest that the interests of the investor class are not always identical to the interests of middle-income Americans, and that the goal of lower rates needs to be balanced against other policy objectives.
Hence my persistent argument that the right needs to embrace a kind of small-government egalitarianism, which focuses on means-testing entitlements and ending corporate welfare and capping upper-income tax breaks (all ideas that Ryan supports) but then plows some of the savings into payroll tax cuts or a family-friendly tax reform or an expanded earned income tax credit, rather than just using them to keep (ahem) Mitt Romney's taxes as low as possible. This has always been my biggest problem with the Ryan budget: In an age of stagnating incomes in the middle and reduced mobility at the bottom, its proposed reform of the welfare state doesn't do enough to foster equality of opportunity.
But on the question of how much money the government should take in overall, I think Ryan's approach has been much more defensible. Yes, new tax revenue may ultimately be required, but it isn't clear why conservatives should pre-emptively concede, say, a leap from 18 percent to 21 percent of G.D.P. in the hopes that this concession will persuade Democrats not to demagogue premium support. The Ryan budget is ultimately a negotiating position, not a final blueprint, and if the conservative goal is to end up with, say, tax revenue at 21 percent of G.D.P. rather than the 25 percent that many liberals would endorse, then starting the negotiations with a bid in the 18-19 percent range makes a fair amount of sense.
It's pretty clear from Ryan's comments during Pat Toomey's attempt to broker a Supercommittee deal that he would in fact accept a modest revenue hike in a deal that made modest changes to entitlements (retirement-age increases, etc.), and my guess is that he would have accepted something more like the higher Simpson-Bowles revenue range if premium support had been on the table in the deficit commission's negotiations. (It wasn't, which is why he and Alice Rivlin crafted their own side Medicare/Medicaid proposal.) One can differ with his judgment on these points - I thought Republicans should have been willing to concede a little more in the debt ceiling/supercommittee negotiations, for reasons I elaborated on here and here - but as an overall negotiating strategy it isn't as unreasonable as Galupo suggests. And since I have seen no real evidence that this White House or the Democratic leadership in Congress were ever willing to consider premium support, with or without new revenue, I'm not persuaded that the kind of deal Galupo sketches out above was ever within reach anyway, no matter how much more "sensible" Ryan was willing to be.

HEADLINE: Obama Ad Attacks the Romney Campaign on Women's Issues

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: Being broadcast in Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Ohio and Nevada, the ad tries to draw a contrast between President Obama and the Republican ticket on women's health. 

 BODY:
9:58 p.m. | Updated 
The Obama campaign, trying to shore up the president's support among female voters in crucial swing states, is hitting Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan in a new ad that targets their positions on a number of issues important to voters who support abortion rights. 
Being broadcast in Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Ohio and Nevada, the ad, called "The Same," tries to draw a contrast between Mr. Obama and the Republican ticket on social issues -- women's health in particular -- which Democrats believe will be critical in November.
The ad accuses Mr. Romney of promising to get rid of Planned Parenthood, a family-planning group, and of backing proposals that would take away a woman's right to choose. It touts Mr. Obama for fighting Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.
"No misleading ad can change the fact that President Obama's economic policies have devastated women and their families," said Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. "Under President Obama, hundreds of thousands of women have lost their jobs, poverty among women is the highest in nearly two decades and half of recent graduates can't find a good job. Women and their families have struggled in the Obama economy, and Mitt Romney has a plan for a stronger middle class that will jumpstart the economy, bring back jobs and help women across the country."

HEADLINE: Health-Care Reform and the 'Doctor Shortage'

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How many doctors are needed to serve the population, and what the impact of health care reform would be on that, are much debated but hard to measure, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
"Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen With Health Law," read the alarming headline of a recent article in The New York Times.
The article cites a study by the authoritative Association of American Medical Colleges, according to which by 2025 the nation's demand for doctors active in patient care will be 916,000, while the projected supply is 785,400. The report thus anticipates a shortage of 130,600 patient-care doctors, of which about half represent primary-care physicians. 
These figures assume that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will be implemented as intended. According to the Times article, the association has estimated that the extension of health-insurance coverage under the new law to slightly more than 30 million otherwise uninsured Americans will increase the doctor shortage by 30,000 for any future year, beginning in 2015.
That would double the projected shortage of doctors in 2015, to about 60,000 from a shortage of about 30,000 and would raise the shortage in 2025 from 100,000 without the act to 130,000 after full implementation of the act.

Opponents of the health care law see in these numbers one more useful piece of ordnance. In this case the protest appears to be that we, the well insured, should not be asked to share already scarce health care resources with millions of currently uninsured Americans now adding their claim to these same already scarce resources.
Sometimes this critique is styled as concern for the poor, on the strange theory that having no insurance coverage and ability to pay for care is better than having insurance coverage but having to wait for a doctor's appointment to get non-emergency care.
At its extreme, this argument is amplified by the prediction, reportedly based on opinion surveys, that large numbers of practicing doctors will hang up their shingles in despondent response to the law.
It is probably much easier, however, to talk in an opinion survey about quitting than it is actually to walk away from net practice incomes that even at their lower ranges place American doctors among the top 5 percent of families in the nation's income distribution. That place is unlikely to change under the health care law.
Would all these disillusioned doctors find lucrative employment in the already shrinking financial sector, the only other industry in which they could assuredly garner such high (or even higher) incomes, as some people with medical degrees now do?
Be that as it may, a more fundamental question is what do we mean by a "doctor shortage"? How is it defined and measured?
Consider the doctor-to-population ratios we see across the United States. The chart below provides s snapshot (charts exhibiting these ratios for all states are also available.) Similarly wide dispersions of the ratio prevailed decades ago across roughly the same states, albeit at lower levels for each.
Take Massachusetts, which for decades has had the second-highest doctor-to-population ratio in the nation, after the District of Columbia. One would imagine that residents of that state would consider themselves comfortably well endowed with doctors - perhaps even excessively endowed.
Not so.
An Internet search for "physician shortage Massachusetts" brings up recent articles with dire forecasts of a looming shortage in that state. They note ominously that RomneyCare, the state-based cousin of and model for ObamaCare, has overburdened an already taut health care supply in Massachusetts.
Nationwide, and in Massachusetts, the doctor shortage is said to be most acute in primary care, a lament that is decades old. Curiously, society's response to that perception has been to let the incomes of primary-care doctors fall relative to specialty incomes.
Although the net incomes of primary-care doctors still rank comfortably in the top 5 percent of income distribution, primary-care doctors have long been and remain the lowest paid of all medical specialties. How can we explain this?
Either Americans are insincere in their lament over the shortage of primary-care doctors and deep down do not value their work as much as they say, or they have forgotten that rudimentary tenet of basic economics: you get what you pay for.
(To its credit, the Affordable Care Act does call for raising the fees paid primary-care doctors under Medicaid to the typically higher level of fees paid under Medicare, to lift the relative incomes of primary-care doctors somewhat. But it is a small gesture and, in any event, will take years before that has any effect on the relative supply of these doctors.)
Leaving that puzzle aside, the chart above raises another series of questions:
1. If, as is said, Massachusetts does not have enough doctors to care properly for the state's residents, what about all the other states in the union? For example, are the governors and legislatures of California and Ohio reckless in letting their populations languish with those states' much lower doctor-to-population ratios, not even to speak of Arkansas and Texas?
2. Should these states' now lower doctor-to-population ratios be raised to the Massachusetts level and, indeed, above it, to offer state residents a fully responsible health care delivery system, now and in the future?
3. How much would it cost to move the rest of the United States to the Massachusetts level?
4. Or could there be something inefficient in the way Massachusetts doctors operate?
I will contemplate these questions, as I hope you will, and I look forward to your comments.
In the meantime, let me note that I am not the only Doubting Thomas on this issue. Jonathan Cohn of The New Republic has remarked on it, as has Eugene Steuerle in his series of briefs "The Government We Deserve."

HEADLINE: In Report, British Officials Raise Questions on Testimony of Barclays' Chief

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - In a report released early Saturday in London, British politicians said the former Barclays chief Robert E. Diamond Jr. had not provided lawmakers a full account of the actions inside the bank during recent hearings into the rate-rigging scandal.The report also challenges some of Mr. Diamond's assertions about the bank's relationship with regulators. It also questioned the top leadership at the bank and the candor of Mr. Diamond's testimony.
"Mr. Diamond's evidence, at times highly selective, fell well short of the standard that Parliament expects," Andrew Tyrie, the British politician who led the recent hearings, said in a separate statement. 
Documents released by local authorities show that officials had questioned the culture at the top of the British bank as far back as 2010, though Mr. Diamond had said regulators were happy with the firm's leadership.
The doubts about Mr. Diamond's testimony come after several of Barclays' senior executives, including its chairman, resigned last month. The firm agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and
British authorities over the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, one of the world's most important benchmark rates.
British lawmakers had called several of the firm's executives and the country's leading regulatory authorities to testify before Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which had been investigating the Libor scandal at Barclays.
The lawmakers' latest report criticized Mr. Diamond's recollection of concerns that regulators had raised when he was appointed chief executive, as well as issues with the culture at the British bank.
Also in his testimony, Mr. Diamond had said British authorities were pleased with his relationship with the Financial Services Authority, the country's regulator. The regulators, however, testified that they had challenged the firm's attitude toward risk and had called on Mr. Diamond to distance himself from colleagues in Barclays' investment banking unit. In the latest report, it appears that lawmakers mostly sided with the authorities.
"It seems to us inconceivable that Mr. Diamond could have believed that the F.S.A. was satisfied with the tone at the top of Barclays," the report said.
Mr. Diamond issued a sharply worded rebuke of the report.
"I am disappointed by, and strongly disagree with, several statements by the Treasury Select Committee," Mr. Diamond said in a statement on Saturday. "There is little dispute that Barclays was both aggressive in its investigation of this matter and engaged in its cooperation with the appropriate authorities."
The latest report also questioned the importance of a conversation that Mr. Diamond held with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in 2008.
The discussion focused on the firm's Libor submissions, and led to Jerry del Missier, a senior Barclays official, to ask some of the firm's employees to alter their Libor rates. Mr. del Missier said he believed that he was acting on instructions from British government officials, though Mr. Tucker dismisses that contention.
Lawmakers said that Barclays' employees had been manipulating rate submissions since 2007, and that Mr. del Missier's ability to alter submissions showed a lack of regulatory compliance.
"It remains possible that the entire Tucker-Diamond dialogue may have been a smokescreen put up to distract our attention," the report said. Poor judgment by the firm's board led to a lack of controls, which could have stopped the rate manipulation from taking place, according to the report.
A Barclays spokesman said that the bank did not agree with all the report's findings but was conducting an independent review of its business practices.
The report also highlighted failures by the Financial Services Authority to address the manipulation of Libor.
Concerns that firms were altering their Libor submissions were first brought to the attention of authorities in late 2007, according to regulatory filings. But British officials joined their American counterparts in investigating the abuses only in early 2010.
Adair Turner, chairman of the authority, told British lawmakers last month that regulators had not perceived Libor to be a major area of risk during the recent financial crisis.
"The manipulation was spotted neither by the F.S.A. nor the Bank of England at the time," Mr. Tyrie said. "That doesn't look good."
The British government is reviewing how Libor will be set in the future. The inquiry may lead to greater regulatory oversight of the rate, while lawmakers are considering new laws that would make the manipulation of benchmark rates a criminal offense.
American and international authorities also continue to examine the actions of other global financial institutions, including Citigroup and HSBC. New York and Connecticut state regulators announced on Wednesday that they were widening their own rate-rigging investigations.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Former Chief of Peregrine Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The former chief executive of the failed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, who last month wrote a note admitting that he had committed a long-ranging investment fraud, pleaded not guilty on Friday to lying to federal regulators.Federal prosecutors charged Russell Wasendorf Sr., the former head of Peregrine, with 31 counts of deceiving regulators about the value of his customers' accounts. If convicted, he would face a maximum prison sentence of 155 years. 
Last month, police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where Peregrine was based, found Mr. Wasendorf unconscious in his car after a suicide attempt. Alongside him was a note confessing to embezzling more than $100 million from clients and defrauding the firm's banks. The authorities arrested him, and regulators discovered a customer fund shortfall at Peregrine of at least $200 million.
As the government continues to examine Peregrine's collapse, prosecutors are expected to seek additional charges against Mr. Wasendorf. Even with his earlier admission of wrongdoing, a not-guilty plea is not unusual at this stage of the case. He can try to strike a plea agreement with prosecutors by helping with the investigation, including tracking down missing customer money.
During the 10-minute arraignment proceeding in Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. Wasendorf stood quietly as his lawyer, Jane Kelly, entered the plea. He was dressed in orange prison garb, his hands and legs shackled, according to Bloomberg News.
Ms. Kelly did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
The charges against Mr. Wasendorf came just months after MF Global, the now-defunct futures brokerage firm, could not locate more than $1 billion in client money. Together, the two collapses highlighted regulatory holes and insufficient financial protections in the futures industry, which largely consists of money management firms that trade contracts in commodities, currencies and interest rates.
"These have been huge blows to the industry and we're looking at a variety of solutions that will better protect customer funds," said Walter Lukken, the president of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group. Mr. Wasendorf was a prominent figure in the futures business. He served on an advisory committee at the National Futures Association, one of the industry's primary regulators. His son, Russell Wasendorf Jr., served as the president of Peregrine, which also did business as PFGBest.
The elder Mr. Wasendorf also loomed large in Cedar Falls, a town with 40,000 people. An Iowa native, he moved his business from Chicago - the epicenter of the futures markets - to Cedar Falls and spent about $18 million on its new headquarters there.
Peregrine came undone last month after the National Futures Association instituted changes to its auditing process that allowed the regulator to get information about the firm's accounts directly from its banks. The association started putting the new system into effect on the morning that Mr. Wasendorf tried to kill himself.
In his confession note, Mr. Wasendorf said he acted alone. No other Peregrine executives have been charged in the case.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Recovery in U.S., Though Lackluster, Trumps Europe's

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE economic recovery from the 2007-9 recession has been a slow one in the United States, prompting much grumbling.But at least the recovery is continuing. Figures released this week showed that many European countries have entered new recessions, and that the slowdown is spreading from the peripheral countries of the euro zone to others. Belgium and the Netherlands are among the nations that reported their economies were smaller in this year's second quarter than they were a year earlier. In Finland, which like the Netherlands had been among the loudest in calling for austerity in the peripheral countries, the economy shrank in the quarter. 
The French economy is stagnating, with no growth for nine months, and the German recovery is losing vigor. It was up a paltry 1 percent over the most recent four quarters.
In that company, the disappointing 2.2 percent growth in the United States over the same period seems almost vigorous.
The accompanying charts show the change in gross domestic product since the world economy bottomed in the second quarter of 2009. Germany leads the way among the countries shown, with a gain of 8.9 percent. The euro zone as a whole is up just 3.5 percent over those three years, and its G.D.P. has declined over the last year.
But even those modest figures may overstate the strength of the economies, at least as seen by those who live in them. As the name suggests, G.D.P. figures reflect a country's production, including exports. Another statistic, called domestic demand in Europe and gross domestic purchases in the United States, reflects what is bought in a country. Throughout Europe, that figure has risen less than the G.D.P. figures.
In the United States, on the other hand, domestic purchases in the second quarter were 7.4 percent larger than they were three years earlier, while G.D.P. was up 6.7 percent.
Most European countries have yet to estimate domestic demand for the second quarter. In the euro zone as a whole, the first-quarter figure was only 0.9 percent higher than it had been at the bottom. All of that gain reflected German buying; domestic demand in the rest of the zone is now lower than it was at the 2009 low.
The charts show figures for the four largest economies in the euro zone -- Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- as well as for the euro zone itself. They also show the three largest non-euro developed economies -- the United States, Britain and Japan.
Those relative performances are also shown by stock prices in the various countries. The MSCI indexes, developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International and reflecting performance in dollars, show that the United States market was up by nearly two-thirds in mid-August from its level at the end of June 2009, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Despite recent weakness in the British economy, its stock market has risen nearly 50 percent.
By contrast, the German market was up about a quarter and French stocks gained about 13 percent. The Japanese market rose less than 5 percent. Investors in Italian and Spanish stocks lost money over the period.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Measuring Recoveries: Since June 2009, when major developed economies hit bottom after the credit crisis, Germany has seen the largest increase in gross domestic product. Even those euro countries that are now in recession have generally not fallen back to 2009 levels. But using another measure known as domestic demand, which reflects the level of final sales within a country, Italy and Spain have now fallen below where they were in 2009. Stock prices, another measure of the extent of economic recovery, have risen the most in the United States. (Sources: Eurostat

HEADLINE: Draft Horse That Bolted May End Up On Easy St.

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
Oreo, the runaway horse who dumped his carriage driver and two passengers near Columbus Circle on Thursday, may have bolted his way into an easier lifestyle.Until that moment, Oreo, a 6-year-old draft gelding, had a typical story.
Like many of his fellow carriage horses, he was born in Pennsylvania. He had worked his trade for five years, gobbling several bags of carrots each night. 
On Thursday, he was pulling his red-and-white carriage with its jaunty flower bouquet near Central Park, as he usually did, but that afternoon turned out to be anything but usual.
Something spooked him so badly that he took off running through the busy intersection at Columbus Circle, shedding his passengers, his driver and his carriage before being caught on Ninth Avenue. (The driver, Mehmet Dunbar, and a male passenger who was also injured, were released from the hospital by Friday morning.)
Oreo, who is young by draft-horse standards, was destined to pull carriages for at least several more years. But his owner, Frank Nolan, has decided a midcareer change may be in order, said Stephen Malone, a longtime carriage driver and spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Association of New York.
''When a horse suffers a traumatic experience like that, we don't want anything to happen in the future,'' Mr. Malone said. Though Oreo suffered no more than a scratch or two, Mr. Malone said, he will most likely need several weeks to recover and readjust to city noise.
Standing 16 hands high and weighing 1,700 pounds, Oreo has a deep brown splashing the front of his white body. He was examined by two veterinarians on Thursday and suspended from carriage work for seven days, Mr. Malone said. A spokesman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which monitors New York's carriage horses, said that if Oreo were to work again, he would have to pass a full examination.
Oreo has several options. He may pull carriages in less urban settings, freelance in parades and weddings, or even try the trail-riding business. Or he could go private: Mr. Malone said the stables had already fielded several calls from people wanting to give Oreo a new home, possibly buying him for leisure.
But for a glimpse of what probably lies in store for Oreo, one need only look to Paddy, a 17-year-old Percheron who retired in May after 12 years in the carriage force. He is living out his days at Blue Star Equiculture, a draft-horse sanctuary and organic farm in Palmer, Mass., that takes in New York carriage horses.
If Paddy's months in the green pastures of central Massachusetts are any indication, a life of pleasure may await Oreo.
''Paddy has a girlfriend,'' said Pamela Rickenbach, Blue Star's director. ''He's having a great time.''
The ''girl'' in question is a Belgian named Cami, rescued by Blue Star from a New Jersey auction house known for sending horses to the slaughterhouse. In her first months at the farm, Cami refused to eat and watched the road as if pining for her former owner, Ms. Rickenbach said. But since Paddy arrived, the two have been inseparable, and Cami has put on 150 pounds.
Paddy, a tall, white horse, keeps active, marching in local parades and teaching younger horses to stand in a harness. He is also something of a celebrity: Ms. Rickenbach said people have come from all over the Northeast to visit him.
Oreo may be dreaming of greener pastures, but some animal rights groups expressed concern that many carriage horses ultimately end up in slaughterhouses. Carriage horse owners say they try to avoid that fate for their animals, though.
Meanwhile, Oreo probably does not know that he has become a flash point in the reignited debate over New York's carriage horses. Several animal rights groups and anti-carriage groups are backing previously proposed City Council legislation that would either ban horse-drawn carriages or replace them with ''horseless carriages,'' electric cars driven by the former carriage drivers.
Scott Levenson, a spokesman for New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets, one of the groups fighting for the legislation, said hundreds of people had contacted his group after hearing about Oreo's getaway. Last year, there were at least seven instances of a horse getting spooked, colliding with a vehicle or collapsing, events that animal advocates say harm the horses and endanger the public. The group's online petition that supports the City Council legislation had gathered more than 91,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon, up from about 86,000 on Wednesday.
But the legislation lacks support from crucial city officials, including the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
''In our society, we have, from cave-man times, used animals as part of our economy. We eat them,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview on WOR-AM on Friday morning. Of the horse-drawn carriages, he said, ''I think it's something that a lot of tourists really love. It makes New York, New York.''
Oreo, for his part, had little to contribute. In his stall at the Clinton Park Stables on Friday afternoon, he tore hay from his feeder and stoically accepted the pats from the reporters and photographers who came to see him, ready, it seemed, for a quieter life.

HEADLINE: Illinois Legislators Fail to Agree on Pension Package

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Illinois lawmakers, who gathered at the Capitol in Springfield for a special session on Friday, failed to reach agreement on a pension package aimed at addressing the state's ballooning fiscal problems.Pension costs in Illinois now account for 15 percent of a $33.7 billion budget that Gov. Pat Quinn signed in June, compared with 6 percent a few years ago. All told, the state is on the hook for more than $83 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, the worst of any state in the country.
No one in the state denies the crisis at hand. But the protracted fight over how to fix it has been a struggle for Mr. Quinn, a Democrat who is caught between angry unions that helped elect him in 2010 and Republicans asking for deeper cuts as concern grows that bond rating agencies could downgrade the state if a compromise cannot be reached. 
''Today is a disappointing day for Illinois taxpayers,'' Mr. Quinn said in a statement on Friday evening. ''The only thing standing between our state and pension reform is politics.''
States hit hard by the recession across the country have been tinkering with their pension programs in recent years in an effort to fix long-term financing problems as millions of baby boomers reach retirement. Between 2009 and 2011, 43 states enacted some form of major alterations to their retirement plans for public employees and teachers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Such laws were a rarity before 2005.
Lawmakers in Illinois have over the years voted to skip contributions to the state's pension funds, choosing to use the money for services and other budget essentials instead. For months, they have been divided over new legislation to shore up their pension shortfalls.
One measure would give state employees a grim choice: keep the current 3 percent compounded cost-of-living adjustment to their retirement checks each year and lose state-sponsored health insurance, or keep health insurance, but with lesser annual increases.
That plan, which failed to come to a vote in the General Assembly after negotiations broke down on Friday, would have eliminated the state's unfunded liabilities over the next 30 years, according to the governor's budget office.
Union leaders vehemently opposed the bill and said the governor was making public workers carry the burden of a problem that they did not cause. They have suggested closing corporate tax loopholes to help raise state revenue.
At the Illinois State Fair this week, a crowd of union-led protesters, upset with the governor's proposal, booed throughout his speech as a plane flying overhead pulled a sign that read ''Gov. Quinn -- Unfair to Workers.'' Some were demonstrating again at the State Capitol on Friday.
''You would think a Democratic governor would be on the side of the working people,'' said Henry Bayer, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, a public services workers' union in Illinois, calling the proposed cuts ''a Republican program.''
But Mr. Quinn has not felt much love from state Republicans either. They say the proposed cuts are not comprehensive enough because they do not address pensions for teachers, university employees or judges.
''These pension systems in Illinois are on the brink of near collapse,'' said Tom Cross, the House Republican leader, stressing the need to ''do it right.''
A scaled-back pension bill was debated on the House floor on Friday that would have only altered elected officials' pension benefits as a ''first step.'' But even that failed to come to a vote in the Democrat-dominated legislature after it became clear it could not get enough support.
The governor's budget office, meanwhile, projects that the state's pension debt continues to grow by $12.6 million each day the debate continues.

HEADLINE: A College Lifts a Hurdle For Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
DENVER -- Monday is the first day of the school year for Metropolitan State University of Denver, a compact, urban campus in the heart of the city's downtown.It also signifies the dawn of a controversial new policy for this institution of 24,000. Among the crowd of students who will show up for class next week are dozens of illegal immigrants who, as part of a specially tailored tuition rate, can now qualify for a reduced fee if they live in Colorado.
The new rate, approved by the university's board of trustees in June, has garnered praise from immigrant rights advocates here who have tried for years to get legislation passed that would allow state colleges to offer discounted tuition to local, illegal immigrant students. 
But the policy has also drawn the ire of conservatives who are threatening to sue the university to keep the rate from being put in place and have accused Metro State of openly defying Colorado law.
Stephen Jordan, Metro State's president, said the board took action after Colorado lawmakers failed to pass a similar tuition proposal this year. ''Clearly, from our perspective, these are young people who were brought here of no accord of their own,'' he said.
''I think what our board was saying was, 'Why wouldn't we want to provide an affordable tuition rate for these students?' '' he added. ''So that they can get a college degree and become meaningful contributors to the economy of Colorado.''
Under the new rate, illegal immigrants will pay $7,157.04 per year at Metro State. That is nearly $3,000 higher than the tuition for legal Colorado students but about $8,000 lower than what out-of-state students pay.
Only those students who attended high school in Colorado for at least three years and received their high school or general equivalency diplomas here are eligible. So far, more than 100 have qualified, university officials said.
Dalia Quezada, 18, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, will start her freshman year at Metro State on Monday.
Ms. Quezada, whose family brought her to the United States when she was 6, said she could not afford college if not for the discount.
''My dream was always to attend a big university,'' she said. ''But realistically, it was too expensive. But when Metro made the change, it opened up an opportunity. It's like my dream is becoming a reality.''
Still, in a state where about 20 percent of residents are Hispanic and where the tuition issue generates rancor in the legislature, the new policy has provoked a furor, largely among Republican lawmakers.
On June 20, university officials were called before a hearing of the legislature's Joint Budget Committee to defend their plan.
That same week, Colorado's attorney general, John W. Suthers, issued a nonbinding legal opinion criticizing the policy.
''The decision by Metropolitan State College of Denver to proceed on its own to create a new tuition category, undeterred by the legislature's repeated rejection of specific authorizing legislation, is simply not supported by governing law,'' Mr. Suthers said in a statement at the time.
According to the Higher Education Alliance, a coalition of Colorado groups that supports the new policy, 13 states offer in-state tuition for students who are in this country illegally. But opponents have defeated similar measures in Colorado six times.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Suthers, a Republican, declined to address Metro State's tuition rate, saying in an e-mail that the attorney general's office would not comment on ''matters that may potentially be litigated.''
Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman and presidential candidate who now heads the Rocky Mountain Foundation, a conservative research organization, said his group intended to sue the university in the next few months.
Mr. Tancredo, a fierce proponent of tightening immigration laws, said: ''There was a proposal to allow this in the legislature. It failed. In its failure, it seems to me that a pretty strong signal was sent that you can't do this in the absence of law.''
Terrance Carroll, a Metro State board member and former Democratic speaker of the state House of Representatives, said there was always a concern about legal action, but the school remained confident the policy was lawful.
University officials also said they were heartened by President Obama's executive order deferring deportation of young illegal immigrants who have been in the United States since they were children.
Though the deferral program, which began accepting applications this week, does not directly affect Metro State, advocates hope it will help bolster support to expand the tuition policy to other Colorado colleges.
Sarahi Hernández, 19, who is poised to start her sophomore year at Metro State, said the reduced tuition would allow her to focus on school, rather than worrying about drumming up enough money to enroll.
''It doesn't mean I won't have to work,'' Ms. Hernández said. ''But it will allow me to get my dream going.''

HEADLINE: Baseball Hall of Famer Settles Insider Trading Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
On the standout Baltimore Orioles baseball teams of the late 1970s, Eddie Murray, the Hall of Fame first baseman, shared the infield with the all-star third baseman Doug DeCinces.Federal regulators say that decades later, the two close friends shared something else: illegal stock tips.
Mr. Murray was charged on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading ahead of a merger announcement after receiving advanced word of the deal from Mr. DeCinces. 
The S.E.C. said that Mr. DeCinces had received the tip from James V. Mazzo, the former chairman and chief executive of Advanced Medical Optics, an eye care company that Abbott Laboratories acquired for nearly $3 billion in 2009.
Mr. Murray, 56, made about $235,000 in illegal gains by buying shares of Advanced Medical Optics ahead of the deal and then selling his stake after it was announced, the S.E.C. said. Without admitting or denying guilt, Mr. Murray agreed to settle the case by paying $358,000 in disgorged profits and penalties.
"It is truly disappointing when role models, particularly those who have achieved so much in their professional careers, give in to the temptation of easy money," said Daniel M. Hawke, a senior S.E.C. enforcement lawyer.
Michael J. Proctor, a lawyer for Mr. Murray, said that his client "is an honorable and ethical man who is settling this to put the matter to rest and move on with life."
The charges against Mr. Murray come a day after federal regulators charged another sports figure, the former University of Georgia football coach Jim Donnan, with running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded fellow coaches and his former players.
The latest cases add to the spate of lawsuits brought by the commission against athletes. Last December, the former Chicago Bears receiver Willie Gault was accused of artificially inflating the stock of a company he helped run. He has denied the claim.
The charges on Friday also add to the increasing number of insider trading cases brought over the last several years. Both the Justice Department and the commission have made rooting out illegal trading a priority. They have brought more than 100 cases against individuals since the financial crisis.
Mr. Mazzo, 55, ranks among the most prominent corporate managers charged with insider trading. Unlike Mr. Murray, Mr. Mazzo is fighting the charges. His stock tip allowed Mr. Murray, Mr. DeCinces and others to earn about $2.4 million in profits, the S.E.C. said.
"He flatly and unequivocally denies the S.E.C.'s allegations," said Richard Marmaro, a lawyer for Mr. Mazzo. "Mr. Mazzo has a spotless reputation for professionalism, integrity and service to his community, built up over a career of 30 years. The notion that he would put all that at risk to give a single friend inside information is absurd."
Earlier this year, Mr. Mazzo announced that he would retire at the end of 2012 from Abbott, where he serves as a senior executive in the company's eye care unit. An Abbott spokesman said the charges were a personal matter for Mr. Mazzo and that he would remain an employee of the company until year-end.
The S.E.C.'s complaint details repeated contact and communication between Mr. Mazzo and Mr. DeCinces around the time of merger discussions between Advanced Medical Optics and Abbott. In one instance, just days before the merger announcement, the two were golfing at the same country club in Orange County, Calif., and there are records of two calls from Mr. DeCinces's mobile phone to Mr. Murray's.
The accusations against Mr. Murray and Mr. Mazzo represent the second round of charges related to the Advanced Medical Optics-Abbott combination. The commission brought its initial charges last year against Mr. DeCinces and three others. Mr. DeCinces, like his former teammate, also paid a large fine to settle the case against him.
Mr. Murray is one of only four Major League Baseball players to finish his career with at least 500 homers and 3,000 hits. Last Saturday, the Orioles unveiled a bronze sculpture of Mr. Murray at Camden Yards, the Baltimore stadium where the team plays.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In the Calm Of Summer, Stocks Climb Gingerly

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Stocks approached their highest levels of the year on Friday in the wake of some mildly encouraging economic data, closing out their sixth-straight positive week.Technology companies have led the markets' rise. Apple's stock hit an all-time high above $648 on Friday, bringing its market capitalization to $607 billion, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index having the best performance of the day -- and for the year, up just over 18 percent since January. The surge, however, has not helped Facebook, whose shares fell to $19.05, the lowest level since the company went public in May.
The appetite for riskier assets has come alongside an even sharper turn away in recent weeks from the most popular haven, United States Treasury bonds. The interest rate on the 10-year government bond has risen to 1.81 percent, from 1.4 percent, since late July, pulling up mortgage rates for consumers after months of declines. 
The stock market rally in the United States and Europe has been built out of a series of small moves upward that have come since the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said in July that he would do ''whatever it takes'' to support the euro, dispelling concerns that the Continent's single currency would fall apart.
There have also been some promising economic reports, including one on Friday showing that the confidence of American consumers unexpectedly rose in August after two down months. But there are few signs that the United States or European economies have strengthened significantly. This has many investors waiting for the next jarring event out of Europe or for a disappointing report on the United States economy. ''It just seems we have many, many opportunities to get it wrong, and the markets are assuming we get it all right,'' said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 0.19 percent, or 2.65 points, to 1,418.16 on Friday. It is now up nearly 13 percent for the year and needs to gain less than a point to overtake the high for the year hit in April.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 0.19 percent, or 25.09 points, at 13,275.20. The Nasdaq index rose 0.46 percent, or 14.20 points, to 3,076.59.
The summer calm is in stark contrast to the same time last year, when markets were swinging wildly amid the downgrade of United States debt and fears that Greece would default on its bonds and the United States was headed for a double-dip recession. Since those lows, American stocks are up over 25 percent.
The index that is used to track the volatility of the markets, referred to as the VIX, fell this week to 13.45, its lowest level since 2007. It had risen to a high of 48 last August.
Earlier this summer, it appeared that Wall Street would again have its vacation season ruined as concerns about Spain's economy threatened to force the country to leave the euro. Most of the credit for the change in sentiment since is given to Mr. Draghi of the European Central Bank. His message in July about supporting the euro was reinforced this week by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who praised Mr. Draghi in a visit to Canada.
Since Mr. Draghi's comments, the main Spanish stock index is up almost 15 percent and the yields on Spanish government bonds have fallen sharply, with the 10-year bond interest rate dropping to 6.4 percent on Friday, from a high of 7.5 percent last month.
But European leaders have managed to temporarily calm the markets at several times over the last few years, only to see the problems re-emerge. Many economists are nervously awaiting a September ruling from a German court on the constitutionality of the European rescue fund that was announced this summer and that is seen as a crucial element in any recovery.
Even if the court approves the program, there are still fundamental weaknesses in the Spanish, Italian and Greek economies, which do not appear to be improving as the governments continue to cut their budgets. The Spanish central bank said Friday that the number of bad loans in the country grew in the first half of the year.
''The Europeans have repeatedly said, 'We have a plan to calm the situation,' and then it failed,'' said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. ''You certainly can't ignore that history. But at the same time, at this moment this plan looks a bit more convincing.''
In the United States, investors were encouraged by reports this week showing that retail spending rose in July for the first time in four months. And the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been falling slightly after jumping earlier this summer. But the Federal Reserve banks in Philadelphia and New York both said this week that manufacturing in their regions continued to decline. This has led economists to stick to their projections of slow growth through the rest of the year.
''I don't think the fundamentals have improved a lot,'' said Kevin Giddis, the head of bond trading at Morgan Keegan.
Looking ahead, many analysts say they are worried that even the current slow rate of growth could be jeopardized by the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of the year, when taxes are scheduled to rise if Congress takes no action. No one in the investing world is expecting Congress to take any steps to help the economy before the election in November.
The discouraging economic data earlier this summer had increased the probability that the Federal Reserve would provide more monetary stimulus for the economy. And the prospect of the central bank buying government bonds pushed other investors to do the same, driving down yields to historic lows.
Even though the recent improvement in the economic outlook has been slight, it has been enough to convince many investors that the Fed is not likely to take action anytime soon. This has been the primary explanation given for the sharp rise in government bond yields of the last three weeks.
But many bond investors have said that they are not selling their holdings yet. David Ader, a bond strategist at CRT Capital Group, said that the recent spike in bond yields was largely related to the slowness of the summer trading environment. He said that with fewer people at their trading desks, when one person decides to sell, it pushes the price up more.
''Let's not confuse a change in prices for a change in facts,'' Mr. Ader said. ''We have not gotten a lot of new information.''

ATLANTA -- Molly Rose Freeman gasped at the size of her wall: 180 feet long, 20 feet tall, a street artist's dream.When she arrived in Atlanta on Wednesday, the subway underpass was blank concrete, speckled with dirt, spiderwebs and weeds. By Sunday, Ms. Freeman, a 25-year-old Memphis muralist, will have turned it into her latest artwork: a lattice of blue and pink shapes, brightening a once-dull roadway.
She will also have joined an assault on blight in Atlanta. Here in a city with one of the nation's highest foreclosure rates, a project called Living Walls commissions artists to spruce up recession-hit neighborhoods. 
While traditional graffiti may often be seen as a sign of urban decay, these murals -- sprawling, brightly colored portraits and designs -- aim to instill some optimism.
The Atlanta-based project, which began last week and ends Sunday, gives 28 artists their own spaces: sides of buildings, foreclosed houses and subway underpasses. All paintings are done with owners' permission and city permits, in neighborhoods like the crumbling Edgewood district, not far from where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. grew up.
''Painting a mural is not just saving money for the wall owner,'' said Monica Campana, who helped found the project in 2010. ''It's giving a new look to a block, and it may be helping the neighborhood economically.''
This year, its third, Living Walls has invited only female muralists. The goal is to showcase the creations, in aerosol and latex paint, of women from around the world, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Italy and Spain. The project, which includes lectures and parties celebrating street art, is also meant as an alternative to larger conferences, like Art Basel Miami or the Congress for the New Urbanism.
As Living Walls has grown in scope and recognition, its sponsorship has expanded to include a prominent law firm, the Museum of Design Atlanta and the W Hotel, where the artists receive free lodging. And there are other signs of Atlanta's embracing street art. A 22-mile loop of jogging trails and public parks under construction around the city now features an array of commissioned works. ''We're not New York, we're not L.A., we're not Miami, with the history of street art,'' Ms. Campana said. ''But in a sense, that's what's appealing: you can bring street art to a new city.''
The city has also redoubled efforts to rub out a different form of street art: illegal graffiti. Two years ago, the mayor created a graffiti task force and the Atlanta police dedicated a full-time officer to track down the most prolific offenders. Last October, the city arrested seven men between 19 and 29 who they said were responsible for 800 acts of graffiti vandalism. They received fines and probation.
One of those arrested, Josh Feigert, 28, sees a double standard in the city's embrace of projects like Living Walls, while it cracks down on graffiti. ''It seems hypocritical,'' he said. ''I would hope people would learn a little more about graffiti, and that it is an art form, as well.''
But a police spokesman, Carlos Campos, said it was not the department's job to determine the line between art and graffiti.
''If someone spray-paints on a piece of property that doesn't belong to them, without permission, that is a crime,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter how beautiful or artistic it is.''
R. J. Rushmore, a blogger who created a popular site called Vandalog about street art, said the form was so dominated by men that he had mistakenly assumed that some new, anonymous artists were men.
''This really bucks the trend of it being a boy's club,'' he said.
Shanda Rogers is a makeup artist at a salon in the East Atlanta neighborhood where one of the murals was painted. A formerly drab wall is now covered with the bright zigzags and the smiling faces of three Jamaican children.
''It just makes me want to dance,'' Ms. Rogers said. ''This whole neighborhood feels different.''
Even once-skeptical neighborhoods have embraced the murals. Rodney Bowman, a carpenter, had grown so frustrated by illegal graffiti artists that he spent a night in a tree waiting to catch the vandals who struck at a nearby church. But he found a mural by Living Walls to his liking.
''Graffiti is just some scrawl,'' he said. ''But this is beautiful. This is art.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Currency Traders Find a Haven in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROSENBERG and ANNIE LOWREY; Matthew Rosenberg reported from Kabul, and Annie Lowrey from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- With American and European sanctions spurring a currency crisis in Iran, officials say a growing number of Iranians are packing trucks with devalued rials and heading to the freewheeling currency market next door in American-occupied Afghanistan, to trade for dollars.The rial has lost more than half its value against the dollar, and cross-border bank transfers and currency exchanges have become difficult, as sanctions have slashed Iran's vital oil revenue and cut the country off from international financial markets. Iranian businesses and individuals are desperate to avoid further losses, by converting their money and moving it out for safekeeping. At the same time, the government is trying to find alternate ways to bring in hard currency.
Enter Afghanistan, where dollars function as a second national currency after years of Western spending and where financial oversight is so lax that billions of dollars in cash leave the country every year. Though Afghan and Western officials say they cannot put a precise figure on the trade with Iran, they see it as a potential challenge to the sanctions, and one that the United States, as Afghanistan's main benefactor, helped create.
The Iranians are ''in essence using our own money, and they're getting around what we're trying to enforce,'' one American official said. 
It is a new iteration of an enduring problem in Afghanistan, where Western officials are already struggling to quell a storm of corruption that has undercut the war effort. In the years since the invasion, the country has become a smuggler's dream, with a booming opium economy and pervasive government graft that is widely believed to be a factor in funneling Western aid money to the Taliban.
On its own, the rush of Iranian money to Afghanistan is unlikely to be enough to undercut the sanctions, which are the cornerstone of Western efforts to coerce Iran into abandoning its nuclear program. But it is clear that American officials are worried. In one indication, President Obama last month quietly strengthened the sanctions by giving the Treasury Department the capacity to punish any person who buys dollars or precious metals, like gold, on behalf of the Iranian government.
''We are taking steps to make it more difficult for the government of Iran to satisfy its heightened demand for dollars -- and making it clear to anyone who provides dollars to the government that they face sanctions,'' said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
Afghan money traders said they were told this month by American officials to not conduct business with Arian Bank, an Afghan bank owned by a pair of Iranian banks. The Treasury Department has maintained sanctions against the Afghan and Iranian banks in the past few years, and the traders said they had been recently told that the Afghan bank was being used by the Iranian government to move cash in and out of Afghanistan.
Western and Afghan officials, as well as traders in Afghan money markets, said that a number of Iranians had started seeking to buy dollars and euros with their rials as American and European sanctions tightened over the past year.
The purchases are part of efforts by wealthy and middle-class Iranians to protect their savings and business profits by moving them offshore. But with legitimate transfers out of Iran virtually impossible because of the sanctions, Iranians are instead converting their rials in Afghanistan, and then moving the money to banks in the Persian Gulf and beyond.
''The middle class is in a panic about what to do right now,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economist at Virginia Tech and an expert on Iran's economy.
More troublingly, in the eyes of Western officials, the Iranian government is seeking to bolster its reserves of dollars, euros and precious metals to stabilize its exchange rates and ensure that it can pay for imports. Iran had about $110 billion in foreign currency and precious metal reserves in 2011, and those are believed to be dwindling now.
Afghan traders have proved more than willing to trade dollars for rials, usable as a currency in many parts of western Afghanistan, at advantageous exchange rates.
Hajji Najeeb Ullah Akhtary, the president of Afghanistan's Money Exchange Union, an association of traditional money transfer and exchange businesses that are known as hawalas, said he and his members had seen a steady increase in Iranians bringing cash into Afghanistan over the past year. That comes on top of routine transfers made by Afghans living and working in Iran, including more than one million impoverished refugees, and the regular supply of rials that circulates in Afghanistan.
The cash ''comes across in trucks,'' he said, with transfers arranged by Afghan middlemen who take a 5 to 7 percent commission.
Iranians were converting rials into dollars in Kabul, the western border city of Herat and in the southern cities of Kandahar and Ghazni, Mr. Akhtary said. The transactions were largely conducted through hawalas, which allow people to transfer large sums of money for small fees to relatives or business associates in distant locales within minutes. The dealers in various places cover one another to make the system work, and settle up after the fact.
The markets are often ramshackle affairs that give little hint of the vast sums being moved. Kabul's hawala market, for instance, is little more than a few dingy lanes hidden away on the banks of the Kabul River, a trickle of fetid water that winds along trash-strewed banks. But it does huge business. Outside its storefronts, men sit on the pavement behind rickety tables piled high with afghanis, Pakistani rupees, American dollars and Iranian rials, among other currencies.
One hawala dealer, Hajji Ahmed Shah Hakimi, said two routes were primarily used to bring cash in from Iran: one directly across the border with Iran and another through Pakistan.
Both he and Mr. Akhtary insisted that they were not involved in smuggling cash for Iranians or anyone else, but that other hawala traders were.
Mr. Hakimi said the sanctions on Iran were seen in Afghanistan as an American issue, and that is why some Afghans had no problem smuggling money for Iranians. Some Afghan officials echoed that view, saying the Iranian money flow was not a top concern, though the broader problem of bulk cash smuggling was.
The flow of cash in and out of Afghanistan goes largely unmonitored and unimpeded, a ''country-sized'' money-laundering operation, said a European forensic auditor who has tracked financial crime in Afghanistan and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In 2011, an estimated $4.6 billion, a sum equivalent to roughly a third of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, was stuffed into suitcases, shrink-wrapped onto pallets or packed into boxes and flown out of Kabul's airport on commercial airline flights, most of them headed for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, according to the central bank.
Though new rules and better enforcement have begun to cut into the cash flying out of Kabul, it is anyone's guess how much moved out of Afghanistan overland on trucks or on twice-weekly flights to Dubai from Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, said an Afghan official who tracks suspicious financial transactions and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
''Kandahar?'' he said. ''We have no idea what is going there.''

HEADLINE: Obama Aide Says 5 Years of Romney Taxes Would Suffice

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A day after Mitt Romney said that he paid at least 13 percent of his income in taxes each year, President Obama's campaign manager on Friday said five years' worth of Mr. Romney's tax returns would satisfy Democrats.Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, offered a deal in an open letter to his counterpart, saying that if Mr. Romney released his tax returns from 2007 to 2011, Democrats would promise not to demand any more.
''If the governor will release five years of returns, I commit in turn that we will not criticize him for not releasing more -- neither in ads nor in other public communications or commentary for the rest of the campaign,'' Mr. Messina wrote to Matt Rhoades, Mr. Romney's campaign manager.
Mr. Messina said the offer should satisfy Mr. Romney's oft-stated concerns that his adversaries will always continue to ask for more and more. But Mr. Messina pointedly did not promise that Democrats would hold their fire on the contents of the tax returns. 
He said a release of five years would ''help answer outstanding questions raised by the one return he has released to date, such as the range in the effective rates paid, the foreign accounts maintained, the foreign investments made, and the types of tax shelters used.''
Mr. Rhoades was quick with a response Friday morning, but did not say whether Mr. Romney would commit to a release of any additional tax returns.
''It is clear that President Obama wants nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney's tax returns instead of the issues that matter to voters, like putting Americans back to work, fixing the economy and reining in spending,'' Mr. Rhoades wrote in a response released to reporters. ''If Governor Romney's tax returns are the core message of your campaign, there will be ample time for President Obama to discuss them over the next 81 days.
The offer came a day after Mr. Romney once again confronted the vexing issue of his taxes, which Democrats have used to portray him as out of touch with middle-class values.
Mr. Romney made the remarks at a hastily arranged news conference at an airport in South Carolina, calling the interest in his personal tax returns ''small-minded'' in light of the nation's problems. Nonetheless, he said that he had examined the last 10 years of his personal tax returns after Democrats suggested that he might not have paid anything at all in some years.
''Every year, I've paid at least 13 percent,'' he said, referring to his effective federal income tax rate, which is a higher effective rate than most people pay.
Mr. Romney's decision Thursday to address the tax question appeared to be an off-the-cuff attempt to put the nettlesome issue behind him once and for all. But at least initially, it had the opposite effect. Democrats seized on his comments to revive the issue and to once again demand proof of his claims by releasing multiple years of his tax returns.
The re-emergence of the tax issue consumed another day of the campaign and added to the sense of a shift in direction for a candidate who had once steadfastly refused to talk about anything other than job losses during Mr. Obama's tenure, the unemployment rate and the nation's growing debt.
Now, after Mr. Romney's decision to name Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice-presidential choice, the campaign is instead waging an aggressive battle on Medicare, welfare and Mr. Obama's character. That change in focus can be seen in the campaign's ads and in Mr. Romney's speeches. And it stands in contrast to the approaches of some Republican Congressional candidates, who said Thursday that they intended to wage their own campaigns strictly on economic issues.
''We are staying on our message,'' said Chris Collins, the Republican candidate in New York's 27th District, near Buffalo. Mr. Collins said that Republicans should welcome the Medicare debate, but that in his own campaign, ''every time anything comes up, I bring it back to the economy, the economy, Obamacare.''
Richard Tisei, a Republican running in Massachusetts' Sixth District, said that for Mr. Romney and Republicans, ''ultimately, the campaign is going to be about the state of the economy.''
At the news conference Thursday, Mr. Romney had sought to amplify the Medicare argument he has been making in earnest since selecting Mr. Ryan. To drive home his point on the difference in the approaches to Medicare by the Republican ticket and the Obama administration, Mr. Romney drew numbers on a white board positioned on an easel before television cameras.
It was a moment that delighted aides back at his campaign headquarters in Boston -- until Mr. Romney answered a reporter's question about his income taxes. For the rest of the day, his statement that he has paid at least 13 percent in federal income taxes over the past decade received more attention than his original statement on Medicare.
Democrats have hounded Mr. Romney for months about his tax returns. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has asserted -- without providing any proof -- that Mr. Romney paid no taxes in some years.
Mr. Romney had already denounced the remarks as false. But he has steadfastly refused to release more than his full return for the 2010 tax year and a short summary of taxes he paid in 2011. In an interview on NBC's ''Rock Center'' that was broadcast Thursday night, Ann Romney stood by her husband's refusal, saying that further releases would simply provide ''ammunition'' for Democrats.
''The more we get attacked, the more we get questioned, the more we get pushed,'' Mrs. Romney said. ''There's going to be no more tax releases given. Mitt is honest. His integrity is just golden.''
In an interview last month, Mr. Romney was asked whether he had ever paid a tax rate lower than the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010.
''I haven't calculated that,'' he told David Muir of ABC News. ''I'm happy to go back and look, but my view is I've paid all the taxes required by law.''
In saying that he paid a tax rate of at least 13 percent, Mr. Romney and his wife would still have had a higher income tax rate than most households. More than 46 percent of households did not pay any federal income tax in 2011 because their income was low enough that deductions and credits reduced their bill to zero. Even a typical household making $100,000 a year would pay closer to a 10 percent average federal income tax rate than a 15 percent rate, Congressional Budget office data suggest.
For many middle-class households, however, other taxes -- like payroll taxes and state and local taxes -- typically cause their total annual tax rate to rise to 20 percent of their income and higher. For Mr. Romney, these other taxes most likely had only a small effect on his total tax rate, because much of his income came from investments, which is generally taxed at a lower rate than wage income.
In 2011, Mr. Obama and his wife reported an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5 percent. In 2010, their rate was just over 26 percent.
In the brief exchange with reporters in South Carolina, Mr. Romney used a black marker to sketch out his assertion that the president had cut $716 billion out of the Medicare program ''to fund Obamacare.'' But the tax question came a few moments later, and he eagerly answered it.
''Campaigns don't control their own destiny,'' said Dave Carney, a Republican strategist who managed the presidential campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. ''You can talk about what you want, but you have to be relevant to the ongoing discussion.''

HEADLINE: Conservative Elite in Capital Pay Heed to Ryan as Thinker

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the debate over the federal deficit roiling last year, David Smick, a financial market consultant, held a dinner for a bipartisan group of connected budget thinkers at his expansive home here.At the table were members of the city's conservative policy elite, including Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard.
But that evening, none drew more attention than a relatively new member of that best-of class: Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and now Mitt Romney's running mate, who spoke passionately about the threat posed by the national debt and the radical actions needed to rein it in. 
''I thought, 'This is the one guy in Washington paying attention,' '' said Niall Ferguson, the Harvard economic historian and commentator, who spent some of the rest of that evening, along with Mr. Kristol, trying to persuade Mr. Ryan to run for president.
Much has been written about Mr. Ryan's intellectual influences: canonical conservative thinkers like Friedrich von Hayek, the Austrian economist, and Ayn Rand, the novelist and philosopher. Mr. Ryan's enthusiasm for them dates at least to his days as a precocious undergraduate at Miami University in Ohio.
But since first coming to Washington in the early 1990s, Mr. Ryan has been closely tied to an intellectual world more concerned with the political agenda of low taxes, light regulations and small government than philosophical ruminations on work and freedom.
And since his emergence as the key Congressional Republican on the budget issue, Mr. Ryan has become a particular favorite of -- and powerful influence on -- the intellectuals, economists, writers and policy makers who are at the heart of Washington's conservative establishment.
Mr. Ryan ''is the good think-tanker-as-politician,'' said Stuart Butler, the director of the Center for Policy Innovation at the Heritage Foundation, a right-of-center research institution. ''When I'm having a discussion with Ryan, I'm talking to someone who knows the material as well as, if not better than, I do.''
Mr. Kristol, who has been one of Mr. Ryan's loudest boosters in Washington, said, ''He's a guy who, unlike 98 percent of members of Congress, can sit in a conference room or around the dinner table with 6 or 10 people from think tanks and magazines and more than hold his own in a discussion.''
Aides and confidants of Mr. Ryan describe him as an earnestly interested, tactically minded policy thinker, with a deep knowledge of budget numbers and close ties with the right's influential policy heavies.
In his 20 years in Washington, Mr. Ryan has pursued ties with two groups of thinkers in particular: policy scholars at research groups like the American Enterprise Institute and commentators like Mr. Kristol and George F. Will of The Washington Post. The reputation for wonkiness is merited, people close to Mr. Ryan said. He goes home with a stack of white papers. He calls economists when he has questions about their budget projections or ideas.
He also athletically argues for his policy ideas among the city's policy elite in the white-tablecloth lunches, Capitol Hill meetings, private dinners and retreats where consensus gets formed.
''He's unusual,'' Mr. Kristol said. ''The only member of Congress I can remember like that is Pat Moynihan,'' he said, referring to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who was known for his reaching intellect.
Early in his career, Mr. Ryan worked at a nonprofit advocacy group, Empower America, now part of FreedomWorks, after college and a brief stint on the Hill.
Two of its founders, William J. Bennett, the former education secretary and current talk radio host, and Jack Kemp, the former housing secretary and 1996 Republican vice-presidential candidate, became important mentors to Mr. Ryan. Mr. Kemp died in 2009.
Mr. Kemp ''taught me that big ideas are the best politics,'' Mr. Ryan told National Review. ''They will always be challenged, and they will sometimes be controversial, but you have to do what you think is right, what you're passionate about, and be a strong advocate for it. If you do that, you can shift the debate in a major way.''
While Mr. Ryan is sometimes compared to Mr. Kemp because of their similar energetic and affable styles, Mr. Ryan's bedrock belief in smaller government has sometimes placed him to the right of his mentors.
Mr. Kemp ''wasn't hostile to budget cuts, but he certainly wasn't enthusiastic about them,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a budget expert who worked on Mr. Kemp's staff and has known Mr. Ryan for two decades. ''Jack just never thought that was important. He thought growth was important. He never proposed spending cuts to pay for tax cuts or anything like that.''
The embrace by conservative policy elites began after Mr. Ryan became a prominent voice pushing for the privatization of the Social Security system during the George W. Bush administration. Despite his lack of seniority -- and in no small part because of his already firm reputation as an economic policy thinker -- Mr. Ryan became the top Republican on the budget committee in 2007 and then its chairman when Republicans retook the House in 2010.
In 2008, he released the first iteration of his budget, the ''Roadmap for America's Future.'' It won plaudits in a right-of-center policy world that had gotten used to politicians watering down its ideas and acquiescing to a bloated federal budget through the Bush years.
''Probably more than any other member of Congress, he says, 'What if we really try to apply conservative principles, limited-government principles, to legislation? Let's see how far we can get, given the political realities,' '' said Michael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute, who described Mr. Ryan as a contrast to other Republicans who are quick to abandon small-government proposals under pressure from industries or interest groups.
''He's worried about much more than the budget arithmetic, about the kind of government that we are going to have in America,'' said Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center here and a favored policy thinker of Mr. Ryan.
''He's a politician, not an O.M.B. economist,'' Mr. Levin said, referring to the Office of Management and Budget at the White House.

HEADLINE: In Policy Shift, Fewer Teachers Are Given Tenure

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Nearly half of New York City teachers reaching the end of their probations were denied tenure this year, the Education Department said on Friday, marking the culmination of years of efforts toward Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's goal to end ''tenure as we know it.''Only 55 percent of eligible teachers, having worked for at least three years, earned tenure in 2012, compared with 97 percent in 2007.
An additional 42 percent this year were kept on probation for another year, and 3 percent were denied tenure and fired. Of those whose probations were extended last year, fewer than half won tenure this year, a third were given yet another year to prove themselves, and 16 percent were denied tenure or resigned.
The totals reflect a reversal in the way tenure is granted not only in New York City but around the country. While tenure was once considered nearly automatic, it has now become something teachers have to earn. 
A combination of factors -- the education reform movement, slow economies that have pinched spending for new teachers, and federal grant competitions like Race to the Top that encourage states to change their policies -- have led lawmakers to tighten the requirements not only for earning tenure, but for keeping it.
Idaho last year did away with tenure entirely by passing a law giving newly hired teachers no expectation of a contract renewal from one year to the next. In Florida, all newly hired teachers now must earn an annual contract, with renewals based upon their performance.
Last month in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation overhauling the nation's oldest tenure law and making it easier for teachers to be fired for poor performance.
''There has been a sea change in what's been happening with the teacher tenure laws,'' said Kathy Christie, a senior official with the Education Commission of the States, a policy organization funded by state fees and grants. ''In 2011 there were 18 state legislatures that addressed some component of teacher tenure and many of them in a significant way, and that is enormous.''
In New York City and many other districts, tenure decisions are increasingly based on how the teachers' students score on standardized tests, as well as mandatory classroom observations by principals or other administrators.
''It is an important movement because what we know is that when schools improve, a lot of the improvement relates back to having really strong teachers organized around a common vision,'' said Shael Polakow-Suransky, the city Education Department's chief academic officer. ''I think New York City has some of the best teachers in the country. It is a good place. People want to be here. So we are very fortunate. But we also want to keep pushing them, just like we want to keep pushing our kids.''
Tenure does not afford any advantages in pay or job assignments, or guarantee permanent employment. Its most important benefit is to grant teachers certain protections against dismissal without justification, including the right to a hearing before an arbitrator. Teachers and their unions embrace tenure as an important defense against indiscriminate or politically tinged hiring and firing.
Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teacher's union, said that he had always supported a ''rigorous but fair'' process of granting tenure. But, he said, large numbers of teachers were quitting the profession early in their careers, a sign that the city had not yet figured out how to help them succeed.
According to the union, of the 5,231 teachers hired in the 2008-9 school year, nearly 30 percent had quit by the end of their third years. There are roughly 75,000 teachers in New York City schools, the nation's largest public school system.
''If New York City hopes to have a great school system, it will need to come up with better methods of helping teachers develop, not only at the beginning but throughout their careers,'' Mr. Mulgrew said.
Mr. Polakow-Suransky said it was not uncommon in the United States for teachers to leave the profession in the first few years, when things are the toughest. Every new teacher in New York receives mentoring in the first year, as a ''support system,'' he said. ''But if someone is not making it, and not happy, or the principal says, 'You are not cut out for this,' it is likely that they move on to something else, and that is not a bad thing,'' he said.
Joel I. Klein, the former schools chancellor, began nudging principals several years ago to judge teachers more critically when deciding on tenure, and the percentage of denials slowly rose. But in 2010, when the mayor set about ''ending tenure as we know it so that tenure is awarded for performance, not taken for granted,'' 89 percent of teachers were still receiving it after their three-year probations ended.
The city's Education Department now has a team that trains principals in gathering the kind of evidence needed to assess a teacher's skills. It also developed a rubric in which teachers were rated on a four-point scale in each of three categories: the teacher's practice, based in part on classroom observations; students' learning, which is judged largely on test score improvement; and the contributions the teacher makes to the school community.
In each of those, teachers receive a rating of highly effective, effective, developing or ineffective, officials said. There is no hard rule on how many ''effectives'' or ''highly effectives'' are needed to gain tenure, which 2,186 teachers earned this year.
The new system began to take full effect last year, when only 58 percent of teachers gained tenure after three years, and an additional 39 percent had their probations extended. There is no limit to the number of years the city can extend a teacher's probation, though officials of the Education Department and the union said they had not heard of any teacher receiving more than three extensions.
One special education teacher in Queens who was given a second one-year extension this year said that school officials cited improvements she needed to make but were short on details of what criticisms her principal had. ''No specifics were ever given,'' said the teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.
Also, she said, the new tenure evaluations were dividing teachers and lowering morale, with some newer teachers feeling punished for the smattering of more experienced ones they saw as using tenure as a ''safety net,'' but putting forth less effort in the profession.''The bigger picture is that they are trying to end tenure,'' the teacher said.
The nationwide shift on tenure has been remarkable for its speed and breadth, said Sandi Jacobs, vice president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. It was awarded ''virtually automatically'' in most states as recently as 2009, she said.
''Tenure was looked at as much more of a sacred cow,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''Once states started to move on it, then the dominoes started to fall in other states.''

HEADLINE: Deluded Individualism

BYLINE: FIRMIN DEBRABANDER


HIGHLIGHT: Why do we continue to insist on our independence and self-determination - stubbornly, irrationally and often recklessly? 

 BODY:
There is a curious passage early in Freud's "Ego and the Id" where he remarks that the id behaves "as if" it were unconscious. The phrase is puzzling, but the meaning is clear: the id is the secret driver of our desires, the desires that animate our conscious life, but the ego does not recognize it as such. The ego - what we take to be our conscious, autonomous self - is ignorant to the agency of the id, and sees itself in the driver seat instead. Freud offers the following metaphor: the ego is like a man on horseback, struggling to contain the powerful beast beneath; to the extent that the ego succeeds in guiding this beast, it's only by "transforming the id's will into action it were its own."
By Freud's account, conscious autonomy is a charade. "We are lived," as he puts it, and yet we don't see it as such. Indeed, Freud suggests that to be human is to rebel against that vision - the truth. We tend to see ourselves as self-determining, self-conscious agents in all that we decide and do, and we cling to that image. But why? Why do we resist the truth? Why do we wish - strain, strive, against the grain of reality - to be autonomous individuals, and see ourselves as such?
Perhaps Freud is too cynical regarding conscious autonomy, but he is right to question our presumption to it. He is right to suggest that we typically - wrongly - ignore the extent to which we are determined by unknown forces, and overestimate our self-control. The path to happiness for Freud, or some semblance of it in his stormy account of the psyche, involves accepting our basic condition. But why do we presume individual agency in the first place? Why do we insist on it stubbornly, irrationally, often recklessly?

I was reminded of Freud's paradox by a poignant article in The Times a few months back, which described a Republican leaning district in Minnesota, and its constituents' conflicted desire to be self-reliant ("Even Critics of the Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It," Feb. 11). The article cited a study from Dartmouth political science professor Dean Lacy, which revealed that, though Republicans call for deep cuts to the safety net, their districts rely more on government support than their Democratic counterparts.
In Chisago County, Minn., The Times's reporters spoke with residents who supported the Tea Party and its proposed cuts to federal spending, even while they admitted they could not get by without government support. Tea Party aficionados, and many on the extreme right of the Republican party for that matter, are typically characterized as self-sufficient middle class folk, angry about sustaining the idle poor with their tax dollars. Chisago County revealed a different aspect of this anger: economically struggling Americans professing a robust individualism and self-determination, frustrated with their failures to achieve that ideal.
Why the stubborn insistence on self-determination, in spite of the facts? One might say there is something profoundly American in this. It's our fierce individualism shining through. Residents of Chisago County are clinging to notions of past self-reliance before the recession, before the welfare state. It's admirable in a way. Alternately, it evokes the delusional autonomy of Freud's poor ego.
These people, like many across the nation, rely on government assistance, but pretend they don't. They even resent the government for their reliance. If they looked closely though, they'd see that we are all thoroughly saturated with government assistance in this country: farm subsidies that lower food prices for us all, mortgage interest deductions that disproportionately favor the rich, federal mortgage guarantees that keep interest rates low, a bloated Department of Defense that sustains entire sectors of the economy and puts hundreds of thousands of people to work. We can hardly fathom the depth of our dependence on government, and pretend we are bold individualists instead.
As we are in an election year, the persistence of this delusion has manifested itself politically, particularly as a foundation in the Republican Party ideology - from Ron Paul's insistence during the primaries that the government shouldn't intervene to help the uninsured even when they are deathly ill, to Rick Santorum's maligning of public schools, to Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as a running mate. There is no doubt that radical individualism will remain a central selling point of their campaign. Ryan's signature work, his proposal for the federal budget, calls for drastic cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Pell grants and job training programs, among others. To no surprise, as The New Yorker revealed in a recent profile of Ryan, the home district that supports him is boosted by considerable government largesse.
Of course the professed individualists have an easy time cutting services for the poor. But this is misguided. There are many counties across the nation that, like Chisago County, might feel insulated from the trials of the destitute. Perhaps this is because they are able to ignore the poverty in their midst, or because they are rather homogeneous and geographically removed from concentrations of poverty, like urban ghettos. But the fate of the middle class counties and urban ghettos is entwined. When the poor are left to rot in their misery, the misery does not stay contained. It harms us all. The crime radiates, the misery offends, it debases the whole. Individuals, much less communities, cannot be insulated from it.
Thanks to a decades-long safety net, we have forgotten the trials of living without it. This is why, the historian Tony Judt argued, it's easy for some to speak fondly of a world without government: we can't fully imagine or recall what it's like. We can't really appreciate the horrors Upton Sinclair witnessed in the Chicago slaughterhouses before regulation, or the burden of living without Social Security and Medicare to look forward to. Thus, we can entertain nostalgia for a time when everyone pulled his own weight, bore his own risk, and was the master of his destiny. That time was a myth. But the notion of self-reliance is also a fallacy.
Spinoza greatly influenced Freud, and he adds a compelling insight we would do well to reckon with. Spinoza also questioned the human pretense to autonomy. Men believe themselves free, he said, merely because they are conscious of their volitions and appetites, but they are wholly determined. In fact, Spinoza claimed - to the horror of his contemporaries -that we are all just modes of one substance, "God or Nature" he called it, which is really the same thing. Individual actions are no such thing at all; they are expressions of another entity altogether, which acts through us unwittingly. To be human, according to Spinoza, is to be party to a confounding existential illusion - that human individuals are independent agents - which exacts a heavy emotional and political toll on us. It is the source of anxiety, envy, anger - all the passions that torment our psyche - and the violence that ensues. If we should come to see our nature as it truly is, if we should see that no "individuals" properly speaking exist at all, Spinoza maintained, it would greatly benefit humankind.
There is no such thing as a discrete individual, Spinoza points out. This is a fiction. The boundaries of 'me' are fluid and blurred. We are all profoundly linked in countless ways we can hardly perceive. My decisions, choices, actions are inspired and motivated by others to no small extent. The passions, Spinoza argued, derive from seeing people as autonomous individuals responsible for all the objectionable actions that issue from them. Understanding the interrelated nature of everyone and everything is the key to diminishing the passions and the havoc they wreak.
In this, Spinoza and President Obama seem to concur: we're all in this together. We are not the sole authors of our destiny, each of us; our destinies are entangled - messily, unpredictably. Our cultural demands of individualism are too extreme. They are constitutionally irrational, Spinoza and Freud tell us, and their potential consequences are disastrous. Thanks to our safety net, we live in a society that affirms the dependence and interdependence of all. To that extent, it affirms a basic truth of our nature. We forsake it at our own peril.

HEADLINE: In Inelastic South Carolina, Change Is Unlikely

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: For almost three decades, South Carolina has held firm as a majority Republican state with a sizable Democratic minority and few swing voters. 

 BODY:
In 1984, Massachusetts voted for Ronald Reagan. In 1988, California voted for George H. W. Bush. In 1992 and 1996, Kentucky voted for Bill Clinton.
Needless to say, many states have had a substantial change of heart in the past 20 or 30 years.
South Carolina has not. For almost three decades, the Palmetto State has been nothing if not consistent. Relative to the national popular vote, the Republican presidential candidate has carried South Carolina - starting in 1984 - by 10 percentage points, then 16, 14, 15, 16, 15 and 16 in 2008. And all signs point to Mitt Romney winning South Carolina by a double-digit margin this year.
While migrations and immigrations, policy proposals and personalities have come and gone, and shifted the politics of many states, South Carolina has held firm, a majority Republican state with a sizable Democratic minority.
But it is not as if the Palmetto State hasn't undergone any demographic changes. Rather, those changes have tended to balance out, leaving no net effect on the state's political leanings, Mr. Tompkins said. Furthermore, South Carolina has few real swing voters. It was the 3rd least elastic state; its partisan voting blocs are remarkably stable.
In presidential elections, the state is consistently about 55 percent Republican, comprised of social conservatives in the Upstate and traditional suburban conservatives in the Lowcountry, and 40 to 45 percent Democratic, consisting of rural and urban African-Americans and urban whites in the Midlands and Charleston.
"We're a 55-45 state - dependably so in statewide races,"
From 2000 to 2010, no state's Hispanic population grew faster than South Carolina's, more than doubling to 5 percent. That's not a huge share of the state, but, because Hispanic voters tend to favor Democrats by large margins, one might expect the state to shift at least slightly to the left.
At the same time, however, a Republican-friendly demographic has also been moving into the state. Affluent retirees, overwhelmingly white, have been moving to South Carolina in large numbers, particularly in communities on the coast.
And Hispanics tend to vote at much lower rates than the Republican-leaning retirees, "so what at first glance appears to be an advantage for the Democrats is largely negated," Mr. Oldendick said.
Upstate South Carolina, around Greenville, is heavily Republican. A large share of voters in Upstate are Evangelical Christians, and the Tea Party is popular there. The region is still one of the nation's largest textile producers, but the industry is a shadow of its former self. Automobile companies, like BMW, have moved in to fill part of the gap.
The only area of the state dominated by Democrats is the Midlands, where African-Americans are a majority in about a dozen rural counties and the largest population center in the region, Columbia, is home to the main University of South Carolina campus. Moderate, well-educated voters in Richland County, where Columbia is, make it a reliable source of Democratic votes.
The Lowcountry includes Charleston, where the Port Charleston Harbor is a major engine of the state's economy. The Charleston area also has a strong libertarian streak, Mr. Tompkins said. Farther north, retirees have flocked to beach communities along the Grand Strand, where tourists also provide a steady boost to the economy in destinations like Myrtle Beach.
The Bellwether: Beaufort County
Fast-growing Beaufort County includes Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, the resort town of Hilton Head and the perfectly preserved architecture of Beaufort itself. Naturally, the military and tourism are two of Beaufort County's most significant industries.
In the last three elections, Beaufort County has been a slightly Republican-leaning bellwether of South Carolina's statewide vote, supporting the Republican presidential candidate in each election by one or two percentage points more than the state as a whole.
The Bottom Line
The FiveThirtyEight model currently makes Mr. Romney a 99 percent favorite in South Carolina, projecting a 55 to 44 percent win over President Obama. That isn't far off from the final vote in 2008, when Sen. John McCain carried the state 54 to 45 percent over Mr. Obama.
Those margins might not seem that wide for such a consistently red state. In 2008, Mr. McCain carried other states by much larger margins.
But it is likely a mistake to misinterpret the relative narrowness of the Republican advantage in South Carolina as a sign of potential competitiveness, both Mr. Oldendick and Mr. Tompkins said.
South Carolina isn't experiencing the demographic and economic forces that have made Virginia and North Carolina, formerly reliably red states, into presidential battlegrounds, Mr. Tompkins said. And the demographic groups that dominate the state - such as evangelicals and African-Americans - tend to have strong allegiances to one party or the other, leaving few persuadable voters.
"I'm personally doubtful that the Democrats will compete successfully in a presidential contest in the near future," Mr. Tompkins said.
Or, from a South Carolina Democrat's perspective, the slightly more pessimistic view:
"I think it is very unlikely that we will see much change in South Carolina voting at the presidential level," Mr. Oldendick said, adding, "or any other level for that matter."

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a summary of the weekly party addresses. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
When President Obama ends this term, he will have made dozens fewer appointments to lower courts than the two previous presidents, in large part because of a deliberate political strategy, Charlie Savage reports. Mr. Obama has moved slowly to nominate appeals court judges and sought relatively moderate jurists who he hoped would not provoke culture wars that distracted attention from his ambitious legislative agenda.

        
Much has been written about Representative Paul D. Ryan's intellectual influences, but since coming to Washington, he has become a particular favorite of - and powerful influence on - the intellectuals, economists, writers and policy makers who are at the heart of the conservative establishment, Annie Lowrey writes.

        
The announcement of this year's moderators for the presidential debates exposed a gulf between a new media environment and the secretive Commission on Presidential Debates, Brian Stelter and Trip Gabriel report. Despite the selection of CNN's Candy Crowley as the first female moderator in 20 years, strategists are complaining that the four moderators are "pretty mainstream" and lack diversity.

        
One way Mr. Ryan is the lid to Mitt Romney's pot is the approachability and comfort level he inspires in everyday people, Trip Gabriel writes. He has completed his first week as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, easily passing the "deer in the headlights" test that undermined the rollout of earlier Republican vice-presidential picks.

        
Mr. Ryan and his wife, Janna, paid 20 percent of their adjusted gross income in federal taxes in 2010, David Kocieniewski reports.
Weekly Addresses

        
President Obama used this week's address to focus on the teachers who "work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies." As other countries race to "out-educate" America, Mr. Obama expressed concern that several thousand fewer educators will be going back to school this year. "Since 2009, we've lost more than 300,000 education jobs, in part, because of budget cuts at the state and local level," Mr. Obama said. "Think about what that means for our country. These cuts force our kids into crowded classrooms, cancel programs for preschoolers and kindergartners, and shorten the school week and school year. That's the opposite of what we should be doing as a country." He blamed Congress for not providing support to states that would prevent further layoffs and called out Republicans for voting in favor of an economic plan that "would make the situation even worse."

        
Representative Vicky Hartzler, Republican of Missouri, delivered her party's weekly address, citing an independent report from Ernst & Young that says a tax increase would "destroy" more than 700,000 jobs. She says that President Obama and Congressional Democrats' proposed tax increases would have a disproportionate impact on small businesses and weaken an already struggling economy. "Perhaps they haven't been listening to the manufacturers and small-business owners who are already canceling plans to hire and expand," Ms. Hartzler said. "Or the group of 88 economists who warn this tax hike must be stopped." Pointing to the House's passage of 30 jobs bills and its approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, she said that her party has been consistent in offering solutions to the nation's most pressing challenges.
Around the Web

        
Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was once a V.I.P. at the Republican National Convention, but will be attending the Democratic National Convention this year, WPRI reports.

        
Several lawmakers broke Congressional ethics rules by tweeting their opinion of Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan, The Hill reports.

        
Politico names this year's presidential and vice-presidential candidates "the most workout-obsessed Republican and Democratic tickets in U.S. history," saying they collectively look nothing like America.
 
A previous version of this post incorrectly described Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. He is the current governor, not a former one.

HEADLINE: Obama Attacks Republicans Over Teacher Layoffs

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: In his weekly address, Mr. Obama noted that education employment has fallen by 300,000 jobs since 2009. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama on Saturday bashed Congressional Republicans - and by association, the Romney campaign - for failing to prevent teacher layoffs made by cash-strapped state and local governments. 
In his weekly address, Mr. Obama noted that education employment has fallen by 300,000 jobs since 2009. He pushed for Congress to help stem the job losses and called the Republican approach to education financing "backwards" and "wrong."
"The economic plan that almost every Republican in Congress voted for would make the situation even worse," Mr. Obama said, referring to a budget put forward by Representative. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mitt Romney's running mate. 
"It would actually cut funding for education - which means fewer kids in Head Start, fewer teachers in our classrooms and fewer college students with access to financial aid - all to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires." 
Mr. Ryan this year put forward a budget with significant cuts to nondefense discretionary spending, a category that includes federal money for education. The Republican-controlled House passed the budget proposal, but it failed to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate. 
If Mr. Ryan's cuts were evenly distributed among budget programs, in the White House's analysis, it would eliminate funding for 38,000 jobs for teachers and aides, and a further 27,000 jobs for educators working with children with disabilities and special needs. 
In his American Jobs Act, Mr. Obama included a $30 billion proposal to prevent an estimated 280,000 teachers and other education workers from getting laid off. The legislation failed to make it through Congress. He included $25 billion to prevent education layoffs in his 2013 budget proposal.
"The jobs bill that I sent to Congress last September included support for states to prevent further layoffs and to rehire teachers who'd lost their jobs," Mr. Obama said in his weekly address. "But here we are - a year later with tens of thousands more educators laid off - and Congress still hasn't done anything about it."
Mitt Romney's campaign has made school choice the centerpiece of its education proposal. The candidate proposes transforming federal education programs into a kind of voucher system, giving parents and students funds to attend the school of their choosing. 
In the Republican response to the weekly address, Representative Vicky Hartzler of Missouri bashed Mr. Obama as a poor steward for the recovery. 
"The House has passed more than 30 jobs bills that eliminate excessive red tape, empower small businesses, and approve the Keystone XL pipeline - a critical project the president and his party continue to block," Ms. Hartzler said.
Mr. Obama's address coincided with the release of a White House report quantifying education job losses and detailing the knock-on effects, like bigger classrooms and shorter school years.
The loss of state and local jobs has proved a persistent drag on the economy, even as private employers have added millions of workers to their payrolls since the recession officially ended in June of 2009.

HEADLINE: To Obama, Republican Budget Plans Are 'Snake Oil'

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama took on the budget proposals of Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan at a campaign stop in New Hampshire, accusing the Republican ticket of seeking to cut trillions of dollars in taxes for the wealthy while raising taxes for the middle class. 

 BODY:
WINDHAM, N.H. - President Obama took on the budget proposals of Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan on Saturday, accusing the Republican ticket of seeking to cut trillions of dollars in taxes for the wealthy while raising taxes for the middle class and making deep cuts to programs that would benefit working Americans.
Venturing deep into Mr. Romney's backyard, Mr. Obama spent Saturday campaigning in New Hampshire, where Mr. Romney has a vacation home, as the focused effort on the remaining swing states intensified. Mr. Obama won New Hampshire in 2008. But Mr. Romney's ties here put the state in play, and in what is increasingly expected to be a close election, the president may need every one of this state's four electoral votes to get to 270 and clinch re-election.
Jogging up to the stage in a hot and packed high school gymnasium, Mr. Obama zeroed in quickly on the twofer of Mr. Ryan's controversial budget proposals and Mr. Romney's income taxes. Two days after Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, said that he paid at least 13 percent of his income in taxes each year during the past decade, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Ryan would make that relatively low percentage even lower.
"He put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than one percent in taxes a year," Mr. Obama said, to outraged jeers from the crowd. "And here's the kicker, he expects you to pick up the tab!"
Taxes have become a centerpiece of Mr. Obama's offense, and he did not let up on it. "Governor Romney's tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families by more than $2,000," he said. "Ask Mr. Romney and his running mate, when they're in New Hampshire - they'll be coming here on Monday - ask him if that's fair."
He called the Romney-Ryan budget proposals "snake oil." Earlier in the week, in Iowa, he called them "fairy dust."
"They've been trying to sell this trickle-down snake oil before," Mr. Obama said.
Tailoring his message for the audience in New Hampshire, whose motto is "Live Free or Die," Mr. Obama spoke of American character and determination. Despite the country's economic troubles, he said, "the American character has not changed. We saw during this crisis how people got knocked down and got right back up."
Mr. Obama, who has greatly ramped up his campaign as he gets closer to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, which begins on Sept. 4, and then the last sprint to November, appeared fired up on Saturday in front of a friendly audience of about 2,300 people. In fact, he even said so: "I'm getting all fired up!" he yelled at the crowd.
He also tried to adopt a chatty tone, though, making a point of mentioning that his daughters Malia and Sasha went to camp in New Hampshire this summer.
"Thank you for returning Malia and Sasha safe and sound," he said, grinning.

HEADLINE: Can a Mom Get A Break?

BYLINE: By JANICE MIN. 
Janice Min is the editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter.

 BODY:
SOMEHOW, my local manicure ladies always feel inclined to turn my $35 finger-and-toe sessions into a barrage of myriad personal questions. In halting English, they will pepper me with, ''How old are you?'' ''Where you born?'' ''How much you make?'' ''What your husband do?''And then more recently, ''When your baby due?''
First, I'm irked. Then embarrassed. And then when I answer, ''Actually, I just had a baby,'' I am met with blank stares. As if there is no other possible explanation for why all the other moms sitting at the salon in their Lululemon are sporting Pilates-hewn six packs, and I look like I've hidden one of those Heineken mini-kegs under my T-shirt.
The reason being is that I pushed out a 6-pound-10-ounce baby girl nearly four months ago. And I'm 42 to boot. Can't I get a free pass? 
But this is Los Angeles, where kale is the official food, zero (as in size) is every woman's lucky number, and fat is something actors only wear in fake suits for ''funny'' roles.
So from this land of all-things-ersatz, from breasts to reality TV, has arisen another irresistible illusion: the Momshell (mother-as-bombshell). And she makes no allowances for my maternal paunch.
There, in the stacks of periodicals at the nail salon, these genetic aberrations smile at us from celebrity magazines, or from our computer screens, wearing bikinis on the beach in Cabo weeks after Caesarean sections, or going straight from recovery room to Victoria's Secret runway. Shortly before Mother's Day this year, People magazine anointed Beyoncé as ''World's Most Beautiful Woman'' with a cover line ''Back After Baby!''
You see, in today's celebrity narrative, just two kinds of desirable maternal female physiques exist: the adorable gestating one (with bellies called ''bumps'') and its follow-up, the body that boomerangs back from birth possibly even better than before. Me? I'm currently stranded on an island like the one on ''Lost,'' only this one is inhabited exclusively by still-pudgy moms struggling to find their way back.
I am partly to blame for my own physical netherworld. As the editor of Us Weekly, covering the Suris and Shilohs of Hollywood for six years, I delivered what the young female audience wanted: cute moms and babies. So much so that Tom Wolfe once remarked, ''The one thing that Us Weekly has done that's a great boost to the nation is, they've probably increased the birthrate.''
When the infant-industrial complex took hold during the economic boom of the aughts (around the time every mom in SoHo suddenly had a status symbol Bugaboo), the Olympian efforts that star moms from Gwyneth Paltrow to Gisele Bündchen employed to get thin again seemed just Hollywood spectacle; their sideshow, not ours. Weight loss was female entertainment.
But in the same way that gray hair went from natural to unacceptable in part because of Clairol's relentless marketing in the 1960s, ubiquitous imaging of ''sexy'' moms has rewired society's expectations. Tropical cultures have no native words for ''snow''; ours used to be devoid of words to describe a sexual or sexy mother. Now, we have terms like ''yummy mummy'' and ''cougar.''
On TV, June Cleaver and Roseanne have been replaced by Sofia Vergara's Gloria on ''Modern Family,'' Courteney Cox on ''Cougar Town'' and cocktail-swilling, Botox-frozen ''Real Housewives.'' At school drop-off, sweat pants have been banished, as Balenciaga bags and blowouts make every day seem like mommy dress-up. (Yes, I like to look nice, too, but there are only so many tricks I can pull off before 7:30 while packing lunchboxes.)
Lately, though, signs are showing that this 1 percent of lucky mothers with the time, money and good genes to be skinny in their skinny jeans have informed our judgment of the other 99 in a sort of trickle-down mean-girls effect. Shortly after People magazine put Beyoncé on its cover this year, TMZ ran photos of the actress Bryce Dallas Howard with her 4-month-old daughter, Beatrice, for no reason -- except, perhaps, to let commenters verbally stone her.
''Her next role is Mama Cass,'' said one. Said another, ''1 word=LAXATIVES!!! STAT!!!'' In total, the post about a respected actress, who had earlier poignantly written about her postpartum depression and 80-pound gain from her first pregnancy, racked up 297 comments (and counting).
Jessica Simpson, whose 70-pound gain during her recent pregnancy hasn't quite reversed course, also is in the eye of a schadenfreude storm. Last month, she said, ''After you have your baby, it's like, 'Oh, my God, what happened to my body?' ''
The Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rai, six months after giving birth, was featured in a much-viewed YouTube video entitled ''Shocking! Fat Aishwarya Rai!'' that juxtaposed before-and-after photos against the sounds of an elephant (some news media blamed ''Western values'' for the uncivilized pile-on).
Even the actress Hilary Duff discovered that her Twitter account was brimming with nasty remarks after she gave birth in the spring. ''I read comments on my Twitter page about how I'm waddling into Pilates and I go: 'Wow, that's a really mean thing to say. I just had a baby three weeks ago!,'' she said.
So what are we Pudge Island inhabitants to do? Of course, I am all for looking great, feeling good and getting skinny. There is no virtue in letting oneself go after giving birth. And let's face it: celebrities aren't always terrible examples; many eat well, exercise and dress far cuter than we do. They've learned how to pull it together, so much so that I wrote a new book filled with simple advice from their stylists, makeup artists and trainers.
We all can learn a little from people whose profession is to be attractive. If our livelihood depended on wearing a swimsuit in front of millions, we'd probably put down the doughnut too.
Still, our tendency toward these extremes makes us a self-loathing bunch. We play into the conflicts of Madonnas versus Whores, Working Moms versus Stay-at-Homes, Bettys versus Veronicas.
And now we have Fab Moms versus Flab Moms. Did you look like Heidi Klum before having children? No? That's O.K. But if you don't look like a supermodel after having children, maybe you just aren't trying hard enough.
The recent ''Are You Mom Enough?'' cover of Time magazine was either the apex or nadir of all our current mama drama. If it wasn't enough to get creeped out hearing grown men express envy of the breast-feeding 4-year-old boy latched onto his attractive mother, the question posed on the cover seemed to encompass not only the article's attachment parenting debate, but also the self-doubt that all mothers perpetually face.
While the men in our lives become wrinkly, lose hair, hide guts under stained shirts and comfortably watch TV while the children are crying, women fret when the milk isn't organic, check every toy for bisphenol A -- and now, try to look 30 and slim, erasing any trace that our bodies gave birth. It's like our helicopter parenting (with nowhere else to go) has turned inward.
I've found it illuminating, having given birth to my third child, to see how times have changed. Not as many people I run into as I would expect ask to see baby photos, or ask what kind of designer stroller or crib I bought (those questions are so pre-2008).
Instead, I've noticed an unconscious reflexive once-over from others' eyes, looking to see if I'm ''back'' to my old body or how my weight is faring. In the way men can't help but check out a woman's cleavage, women glance repeatedly at my midsection. From behind, I'm guessing there is a rear-end assessment as well. If we saw this behavior in chimps, Dr. Jane Goodall would likely say it was the animals' way of assessing pecking order.
Yes, we are a looks-obsessed culture. One of our greatest virtues as humans is our desire to constantly improve. But in the same way that women can have it all, the notion that instantly stick-thin figures after birth are normal is untrue. Sometimes, in my sleep-deprived nights, I ponder our ideal of this near-emaciated, sexy and well-dressed Frankenmom we've created and wonder how to undo her. Even just a little bit.
Not only for the pressure to let up on me, and you, but also perhaps so my little baby girl can one day love her own children, too, without hating her body at the same time.

HEADLINE: Refinancing a Vacation Home

BYLINE: By BETSY VERECKEY

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS who want to take advantage of historically low mortgage rates and refinance a vacation home should be prepared for stricter loan requirements, especially if they rent out the property.Lenders typically consider such loans riskier. ''In the event of a fiscal problem,'' said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Pompton Plains, N.J., ''a homeowner with a primary and secondary residence is far more likely to continue to make payments on the home they live in, rather than the one they visit occasionally.''
Mr. Gumbinger notes, too, that homeowners are less likely to maintain a second home as they do a primary residence, which might affect the home's value and could mean greater expense for the lender should the property end up in foreclosure. 
In addition to charging a higher rate, lenders may require a lower loan-to-value ratio, which is the percentage of a property's value that is mortgaged. For a primary residence, a borrower can have a ratio as high as 95 percent, but on a second home or an investment property, the maximum ratios are 90 percent or 85 percent, according to Matt Hackett, an underwriting and operations manager with Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender based in New York City.
Lenders may also require a higher minimum credit score -- for instance, 700 to 720, said Mark Logue, the president of Thoroughbred Mortgage in Rye Brook, N.Y.
And they will want to see ample liquidity. Expect to have on hand, for instance, two months' worth of funds to cover mortgage principal and interest, the property taxes and insurance. If you're planning to rent out the property, it changes category and becomes an investment property -- and for that, you'll need to show six months' worth of funds in your bank statements, Mr. Hackett said. Lenders will want to ensure that there is a cushion should there be problems with future rent payments.
During the past year, foreclosure rates on investment properties were around one and a half times higher than on second homes not being used as investment property, according to CoreLogic, a real estate analytics firm.
Mr. Logue says rates for second-home refinancing are typically about a quarter of a percentage point higher than those for primary residences, which is ''not significant, but there is a difference to cover the risk.''
But if you rent out your second home for over two weeks out of the year and report that income on your tax returns, most lenders will treat that home as an investment property, said Daniel Gualtieri, a vice president in the Hamptons division of GFI Mortgage Bankers.
''There goes your chance to get a low Fannie or Freddie rate,'' he said, ''because you're showing the house not as a second home anymore. You're showing it as a rental property.''
Investment properties will often carry higher rates, or more points, based on their loan-to-value ratio, Mr. Hackett said. For instance, for loan-to-value ratios up to 75 percent, a borrower can: pay points totaling 1.75 percent of the loan amount; pay a slightly higher rate instead of points; or combine the two (a 25 percent higher rate and 75 percent payment in points).
Those planning on renting out a property after refinancing should disclose that information to the lender beforehand. Otherwise, said Jude Coard, a tax partner at accounting firm Berdon L.L.P., ''if they see you rented out the property, you may be in default of the mortgage.''
But Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, added: ''In today's marketplace, every bank has different guidelines as it relates to the second home. It really depends on the type of bank that you go to.''
Some lenders, for instance, don't consider a home an investment property if it's rented out for only a season each year.

HEADLINE: Do Argentines Need Therapy? Pull Up a Couch

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Emily Schmall contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- The cafe, just north of a leafy district affectionately nicknamed Villa Freud, was almost empty. Roberto Álvarez sipped his espresso, furrowed his brow and began ticking off the names of psychologists he had seen over the past decade. He stopped counting only when he noticed that he was running short of fingers.''Let me tell you something about us Argentines,'' said Mr. Álvarez, a 51-year-old construction worker, after a tangent on Jacques Lacan, the famous French psychoanalyst who sometimes conducted sessions with patients in taxicabs. ''When it comes to choosing a psychologist, we are like women searching for the perfect perfume. We try a bit of this and a bit of that before eventually arriving at the right fit.''
Indeed, Argentines often manage a smile upon hearing that psychoanalysis has been on the wane in the United States and other countries, rivaled by treatments that offer shorter-term and often cheaper results than years invested in sessions of soul-searching. Even as Argentines grapple with high inflation and an economic slowdown, many seem to know precisely what they want (at least in one area of their lives): psychoanalysis, and plenty of it. 
The number of practicing psychologists in Argentina has been surging, to 196 per 100,000 people last year, according to a study by Modesto Alonso, a psychologist and researcher, from 145 per 100,000 people in 2008. That compares with about 27 psychologists per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the American Psychological Association.
Those numbers make Argentina -- a country still brooding over its economic decline from a century ago -- a world leader, at least when it comes to people's broad willingness to bare their souls.
''There is no taboo here about saying that you see a professional two or three times a week,'' said Tiziana Fenochietto, 29, a psychiatrist doing her residency at the Torcuato de Alvear Hospital for Psychiatric Emergencies, a public institution. ''On the contrary,'' said Ms. Fenochietto, who has been in therapy herself for the past eight years, ''it is chic.''
One need not wander far in this city to get a grip on the resilient obsession with neuroses of various stripes. The name Villa Freud is a nod not only to the Austrian founding father of psychoanalysis, but also to the number of psychologists who ply their trade in the buildings along the elegant streets around Plaza Güemes, in northern Buenos Aires.
A short cab ride away, in the theater district along Avenida Corrientes, lines form each night where the local adaptations of two hit plays have opened side by side: ''Freud's Last Session,'' currently an imagined debate between Sigmund Freud and C. S. Lewis, and ''Toc Toc,'' about obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Slip into many bookstores here, and tomes abound written by Argentines about the psychological ills that plague people, and their cures. Malele Penchansky's ''Universal History of Hysteria'' and Alejandro Dagfal's ''Between Paris and Buenos Aires: The Invention of the Psychologist'' are among the offerings. A new prizewinning Argentine comic book, ''Repairer of Dreams,'' even blends psychoanalysis into the tale of a dystopian city called Polenia.
Psychoanalysis is not just for Argentina's moneyed classes, with some psychoanalysts in the state medical system offering patients free sessions. And while some private health plans do not pay for psychoanalysis, insurance programs for some unionized workers cover dozens of therapy sessions a year.
''We say no to charity and yes to equal opportunity,'' said Adriana Abeles, president and founder of the Fields of Psychoanalysis Foundation, which carries out research, trains students of psychoanalysis and provides therapy. When patients cannot afford to pay, they can volunteer in exchange for their sessions, doing jobs like repairing furniture, cooking or painting walls.
The country's growing supply of psychologists also means that consumers have considerable bargaining power. While some of the top analysts here charge the equivalent of hundreds of dollars per session, many work on a sliding scale in accordance with their patients' incomes, offering sessions for as little as $15 an hour.
Despite the continued boom in psychoanalysis, Argentina is not impervious to global treatment trends. Techniques like cognitive behavior therapy, which claim to offer shorter-term results, have gained ground here, and some health insurance plans frown upon the costs involved in drawn-out psychoanalytic counseling. Drug treatments have also made inroads, and some therapists in Argentina have expanded online offerings, turning to technologies like Skype.
But Andrés Raskovsky, president of the Argentine Psychoanalytic Association, recently asserted that psychoanalysis had little risk of extinction in Argentina since seeing a psychologist twice a week is still viewed as being affordable for much of the population.
Theories abound as to why hang-ups, and the professional class that treats them, seem to flourish here.
Martín, the main character in ''Sidewalls,'' a critically acclaimed 2011 romantic comedy about life in the shoe box apartments of Buenos Aires, offers this theory: ''Apathy, depression, suicide, neuroses, panic attacks, obesity, fear of heights, muscular tension, insecurity, hypochondria, sedentary behavior -- all are the fault of architects and construction entrepreneurs.'' (Martín, of course, in a scene worthy of a Woody Allen film, professes to suffer from all of them ''except for suicide,'' and rarely leaves his high-rise building except to attend therapy.)
Others look to Argentina's past for explanations, and not just the sadness bred by the faded glory of a nation that was once wealthier than many European ones.
The country, some say, was long vulnerable to melancholia, or at least an acceptance of sharing those troubles with a patient listener. With its history of immigration, largely from Europe, Argentina has a tradition of drawing inspiration from European intellectual trends, including the rise of Freudian psychology a century ago. Spanish immigrants who sought opportunities away from the fascist rule of Francisco Franco were pivotal in establishing psychoanalysis in the 1940s as a respected profession in Argentina. Nowadays, some of the top psychoanalysts here are Jewish, most of them descendants of European Jews.
Others have sought to tie the appeal of psychoanalysis to the nation's music, like the tango, which can plumb decidedly dark themes. (There is even something here called ''psychotango,'' which explores the use of psychoanalytic thinking and dance as a tool for ''self-transformation.'')
But Mariano Ben Plotkin, author of ''Freud in the Pampas,'' a book about the emergence of psychoanalysis in Argentina, said the reasons were much more complex. ''Sure, we have the tango, but the Portuguese have the fado,'' said Mr. Plotkin, referring to the mournful music of Portugal, a country with fewer psychologists per capita.
Instead, Mr. Plotkin, whose own parents sent him to a psychoanalyst several times a week when he was a child, attributes the rise of psychoanalysis in Argentina partly to its reception by a large, relatively well-educated middle class in the 1960s.
Despite the rise of rival treatments, Mr. Plotkin said he remained sanguine about what he called the ''hegemonic'' position of psychoanalysis in Argentina's psychological community. After all, ordinary Argentines readily employ psychological terms that in other countries would be the preserve of psychology majors, and can hold forth on the difference of Freudian and Jungian methods.
Respect for psychoanalysis extends to other realms as well. It is embedded in various state institutions; parents of children at public schools, upon being asked to attend meetings regarding their child's behavior, for instance, are sometimes surprised to learn that one of first discussions is with a psychoanalyst employed by the school system.
And in a sign of its wide acceptance, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her cabinet chief took time out in April to meet with leaders of the World Psychoanalysis Association, which was convening then in Buenos Aires.
Opening a newspaper or cultural supplement here often feels like leafing through decades-old editions of The New Yorker, when cartoons were drenched in psychoanalytic jargon.
Diego Sehinkman, a psychologist who writes a weekly column for the newspaper La Nación in which he describes imaginary therapy sessions with politicians across the spectrum, said: ''We are fascinated in Argentina with peering into the suffering of people in power. Especially those who have made us suffer a bit.''

HEADLINE: Milton Bassin, 88; Expanded York College

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Milton Bassin, who as president of York College in Jamaica, Queens, oversaw the construction of a vast campus on a once-blighted site -- steering the project through New York's fiscal crisis and, in the process, helping to revitalize Jamaica and educate thousands of disadvantaged students -- died on Monday in the Bronx. He was 88 and lived in Somers, N.Y.His son, Robert, confirmed the death.
York, the youngest of the City University of New York's 12 four-year colleges, was housed in temporary classrooms at Queensborough Community College in Bayside when Mr. Bassin was named president in 1971. Three years later, it was relocated to an abandoned Montgomery Ward department store on Jamaica Avenue. 
By then plans had been drafted for a permanent campus on 49.8 acres bordering the Long Island Rail Road tracks between 158th and 165th Streets. The land, which had been taken over by the city, was a bleak expanse of weeds, parking lots, gas stations and a towering Brooklyn Union gas tank.
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller initially vetoed the plan as part of his attempt to stem a statewide fiscal crisis. But in 1973, with Mr. Bassin playing a leading role in bringing together politicians, business owners and residents in support of the college's mission to educate low-income and minority students, Mr. Rockefeller reversed himself.
Approximately $200 million in construction was completed on York's campus during Mr. Bassin's 20 years as president. Of the six buildings now occupying gently sloping green spaces, three were built by the time he retired in 1991: the Academic Core, which includes classrooms, the library and administrative offices; a science building; and another classroom building. They constitute more than 80 percent of the 931,607 square feet of space in the six buildings.
''Thanks to Milt, thousands of students have received a high-quality education at a senior college in the heart of southeast Queens,'' Dolores Swirin, the college's vice president for development, said in a statement.
There were 371 students enrolled at York when it opened in 1967; there are now more than 8,000. ''The overwhelming majority are minority, coming from more than 120 countries,'' Ms. Swirin said. ''Almost all are the first in their families to go to college.''
Mr. Bassin's impact was felt well beyond the campus, Carlisle Towery, president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, said in an interview. The college, he said, is ''the heart of, the centerpiece for, Jamaica's revitalization.''
In the 1960s and '70s, as middle-class residents moved to the suburbs and downtown Jamaica faced stiff competition from regional malls, the neighborhood deteriorated. Today about 1,000 privately owned duplex homes, financed by urban renewal programs, surround the campus.
''Pride of ownership means a lot,'' Mr. Towery said, ''and all that was stimulated by the certainty of York having its campus there.'' In addition, he said, the shopping district is ''viable and stabilized, very crowded.''
A tuition-free college education was one of Mr. Bassin's tenets. He was one of 4 CUNY college presidents, out of 19, who opposed the system's 1976 decision to charge tuition.
''Without free higher education, I would not have been able to go to college,'' said Mr. Bassin, who graduated from City College in 1944 with a degree in mechanical engineering.
Milton Gerald Bassin was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 26, 1923, one of three children of Max and Miriam Bassin, who had emigrated from Russia. His father was a Yiddish poet who supported the family by selling insurance.
After graduating from City College, Mr. Bassin served in the Navy for two years. He then joined the faculty at New York City Community College in Brooklyn (now New York City Technical College), eventually rising to chairman of the mathematics department, dean of the college and, in 1966, president. He earned a master's degree in engineering from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1954.
Besides his son, Mr. Bassin is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Bernice Blasenheim; his daughter, Lori; his brother, Eugene; and two grandchildren.
Connecting York College to the community was vital for Mr. Bassin. ''We have made sure,'' he said, ''that the whole concept from accessible, attractive courtyards to low-profile, appealing buildings serves as notice to the people who live in Jamaica that we are with them and part of them.''

HEADLINE: In Brazil, a Noisy, Tense Prosperity

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
BARKING dogs and a crying baby. Maids and housekeepers calling to each other through the air shaft of an apartment building. The echo of samba music on the radio and soccer matches on television. The faint murmur of the sea in the background, and in the foreground, the incessant clatter of construction: the pounding of hammers, the churning of cement mixers, the screeching of circular saws.That is the soundtrack of daily life in Brazil's big cities these days, the inevitable accompaniment of an economic boom. But that cacophony also served as inspiration for the director Kleber Mendonça Filho, who decided to give his first feature film, a winner of prizes at festivals in Europe and the United States, the enigmatic title ''Neighboring Sounds.''
''We're at a very curious moment right now in Brazil,'' Mr. Mendonça said in an interview in New York this spring, where his film was shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series. ''There's a lot of money, which means building things. And to build things in most cases means demolishing other things, which in turn stimulates my generation of directors and artists to say something about all of that.'' 
''Neighboring Sounds,'' which opens Friday, is set in the northern coastal city of Recife, Brazil's fifth-largest metropolis, in a middle-class enclave whose newly prospering residents are buying flat-screen televisions and Audis or arranging private English and Chinese lessons for their children. But they worry about crime, and when a private security firm comes knocking, they eagerly sign on.
A single family with extensive landholdings in both the city and the nearby countryside dominates the neighborhood, though, and the patriarch, an old-fashioned autocrat named Francisco, doesn't want to cede any control. What results is a collision of the past and the future in an uneasily fluid present.
Francisco is played by the novelist and actor Waldemar Solha, whose luxuriant white beard and commanding bearing gave him the perfect look for the role. Mr. Solha, 71, was in Recife for the premiere of an opera whose libretto he had written when the film's casting director, Daniel Aragão, approached him, addressing him as ''Hey, Francisco,'' which immediately made him curious to read the script.
''I know guys like Francisco from having lived long stretches out in the backlands,'' Mr. Solha said. ''In the 1960s, I worked in a bank out there, in an area full of hired gunmen, and they'd come into the bank like they owned the place. I thought my career as an actor was over, but when I saw this script, I went crazy for it.''
Francisco's foil is Clodoaldo, the seemingly deferential head of the security team that sets up on a street corner, changing the dynamics of life in the neighborhood. Like Mr. Solha, Irandhir Santos, who plays Clodoaldo, is a native of northeast Brazil accustomed to what he called ''the perverse logic'' of the region's history of social oppression.
''Certain aspects of that logic have simply been transferred from the sugar mills to these tall apartment buildings,'' Mr. Santos said. ''Instead of wire fences to ensure the separation of classes, you've got security cameras and guards, and that transposition is what motivated me to help Kleber tell this story.''
Mr. Mendonça said that the class tensions that underpin the central conflicts in ''Neighboring Sounds'' came directly from his own job experience. At one firm, he recalled, the owner acted just like a typical ''colonel,'' the term used to describe the bosses who have dominated life in northeastern Brazil since colonial times.
''There we were, in a modern company, with computers and everything, but the mentality that made the place function, the generalized lack of respect, was like that of a plantation owner talking to his cane cutters,'' he said. ''This was the son of a traditional family, a person who can be considered sophisticated but at the same time is brutal and rustic. So the film comes precisely from this union of the modern and the archaic.''
Though ''Neighboring Sounds'' has a lush, vibrant look, in keeping with its tropical setting, and a sophisticated, subtle sound design, it is in some ways literally a home movie. Not only did Mr. Mendonça shoot most of the scenes on the block where he lives, but one home in the movie is his own apartment.
In addition, cast members were lodged in a hotel just a few blocks away, immersing them round-the-clock in the situation the film portrays. ''The whole neighborhood is a construction site,'' said Gustavo Jahn, who plays Francisco's somewhat passive grandson João, a real estate agent. ''Even in my hotel room I'd hear noise all around me and sense the presence of many layers of sound.''
For most of his adult life, Mr. Mendonça, 43, has been a film critic for the main daily newspaper in his home city, and has also organized film festivals. Over the last decade he has also made several award-winning shorts, like ''Recife Frio'' and ''Eletrodomestica,'' that address some issues also raised in ''Neighboring Sounds.''
Mr. Mendonça said that some of the credit for his questioning view of social niceties should go to the film's producer, Emilie Lesclaux, who also happens to be his wife. Ms. Lesclaux, 31, went to Brazil a decade ago to work in the cultural section of the French consulate in Recife, fell in love with Mr. Mendonça and the country at the same time, yet even now finds herself puzzled by some local customs.
''Being married to a Frenchwoman, it's not that this isn't something I didn't see before,'' he said, ''but being with her in ordinary life is really interesting, because she has non-Brazilian reactions to some aspects of Brazilian life, and that make me snap my fingers and say 'This is interesting, it's something strong' '' and worth examining.
One example, a theme that runs throughout the movie, is the unusually casual and seemingly affectionate relationship between servants, most of whom are black, and their employers, almost all of whom are white. João even plants a tender kiss on the neck of his housekeeper, who regularly brings her children to his apartment, and engages her in the kind of banter a mother and son might have.
''When Kleber and I first came together and I met his housekeeper, who had cared for him when he was a child, I was wondering who exactly is this woman and what is their relationship?'' Ms. Lesclaux recalled. ''I felt jealousy, like I was an interloper. It was a very Brazilian situation.''
Over the last 18 years, Brazil has enjoyed a spurt of growth that has allowed it to zoom past Britain, Italy, Russia and Canada to become the world's sixth largest economy, a process that has propelled tens of millions of Brazilians into the middle class. ''Neighboring Sounds'' may be the first major Brazilian film that directly takes as its main subject that transformation and its consequences.
From the time of the politically conscious Cinema Novo movement of the early 1960s through ''City of God'' a decade ago, the Brazilian films that have had the best reception abroad are those that have focused on social problems like poverty, violence and racism. The director Glauber Rocha even advocated what he called an ''aesthetic of hunger'' as a response to Hollywood values.
Mr. Mendonça said he greatly admired Cinema Novo films. But he said the time had arrived for a different approach, one that addresses the concerns of a country that has become predominantly middle class.
''Brazilian film has to break the mold,'' he said, adding that ''99 percent of Brazilian filmmakers are middle class or upper middle class or bourgeois, as I am, yet most of the time they're making films about people they don't know that much about and subjects they haven't mastered. We need more films that don't take place in a favela or the backlands and aren't about some guy who is really poor and living beneath a bridge. Maybe then we can talk about a new Brazilian aesthetic.''

HEADLINE: Rent or Buy?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
BLANCHING at their rent bills, more New Yorkers are being forced to confront that age-old question, should I rent, or does buying make more sense?In many cases, the hard numbers point toward the latter. The average Manhattan apartment rented for a record $3,459 in July, according to Citi Habitats, which called the price the highest since it began tracking rents in 2002. And with the vacancy rate hovering around 1 percent, landlords aren't willing to cut deals. 
By contrast apartments for sale have held relatively steady in price from the start of the year and are down from the market peak in 2008. Combine that with low interest rates, and the cost of buying an apartment is about the same, if not cheaper on a monthly basis in many neighborhoods, than the cost of renting. But making the leap to homeownership is complicated by tough lending standards, the often hefty down payments and other obstacles that would-be buyers must clear in order to break into the New York market. And even if you clear all the hurdles, there are often trade-offs.
Take Casey Galegher and Van Krishnamoorthy, who recently spent $699,000 on a two-bedroom condo in Harlem, after a year living in a one-bedroom rental on the Upper West Side with their 5-year-old son, Finn. ''It may take 10 years for the restaurants to feel like the Upper West Side,'' said Dr. Krishnamoorthy, a radiologist. But meanwhile they are getting more space and amenities for their money, paying about $4,900 a month for their brand-new 1,400-square-foot condo. On the Upper West Side, ''we couldn't get an elevator building in our price range,'' said Dr. Krishnamoorthy, noting that a two-bedroom in a doorman building across the street from their former rental was listed at $7,000 a month.
Joan Riegel, a 69-year-old educator, started looking to buy earlier this year, when the rent on her 1,000-square-foot Upper West Side rental climbed past $5,000 a month -- an increase of 25 percent. This month she moved into a $675,000 co-op in the Gramercy Park area, trimming her monthly housing cost nearly in half, to about $2,600 a month including maintenance. While her new apartment is smaller, she said, ''I'm going to have so much more money.''
In general, whether renting is better than buying largely depends on individual circumstances, including what you can afford, what's on the market and how long you plan to stay in your home. (The Times has an online calculator to help you pinpoint exactly how long you need to stay for your investment to begin paying off.) Here is a look at how four potential buyers came to resolve their own rent-versus-buy conundrums, including the calculations they made, the hurdles they overcame and the lessons they learned along the way.

HEADLINE: Finding Dividends In Unusual Places

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
DIVIDEND seekers are in a bit of a quandary. As frightened investors have raced into defensive equities lately, traditional income-producing areas of the stock market have become fairly frothy.Utility shares, for instance, are now trading at a premium to the broad market, which is a rarity. And the price-to-earnings ratio for the average telecommunications stock is 59 percent higher than the P/E for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Yet dividend investors aren't without alternatives. As more and more types of companies return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends, there are plenty of sources of income in today's stock market -- and relatively cheap ones at that. 
The only catch is that investors must be willing to bet on economically sensitive stocks to capture those payouts. ''That's where we've been focusing our attention these days -- on nontraditional, overlooked areas that are more exposed to global economic growth,'' said David F. Hone, portfolio manager of the William Blair Large Cap Value fund.
A prime example is technology. In the late 1990s, fast-growing tech companies rarely paid dividends, preferring to reinvest their profits toward future growth. Yet in recent years, tech shares have quietly become the second-biggest contributor to S.& P. 500 dividends in dollar terms, just behind the consumer-staples sector.
Tech now accounts for 13.8 percent of all S.& P. 500 payouts, up from less than 6 percent in 2007, before the financial crisis began, according to Standard & Poor's. In fact, all it would take for tech to become the market's dividend leader would be for Google to start paying a modest yield, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P. Dow Jones Indexes.
Yet because tech dividend yields, expressed as a percentage of stock prices, are not especially high, this sector is still overlooked when it comes to equity income strategies. The average tech yield stands at 1.6 percent, versus 2.3 percent for the broad market.
Even tech stocks with better-than-average yields may be getting short shrift. Mr. Hone noted that Microsoft, for example, had a healthy yield of 2.6 percent. That dividend has grown at a market-beating annual rate of 15 percent over the past five years, yet Microsoft shares trade at a P/E of just 10.1,based on projected earnings.
Kent L. Johnson, co-manager of the Sit Dividend Growth fund, agreed that dividend investors should not overlook tech. Among his fund's top holdings are I.B.M., Microsoft and Intel. Mr. Johnson noted that Intel, with a dividend yield of 3.2 percent and a projected P/E ratio of just 10.2, ''yields twice what 10-year Treasuries do, but it trades at a valuation that's just two-thirds that of utility stocks.
''Those are the types of opportunities we're looking for,'' he said.
To be sure, Sit Dividend Growth approaches dividend investing in a slightly unconventional way. Instead of focusing on stocks with the highest yields, ''what we're trying to do is to find growth stocks -- companies with strong top-line sales growth, strong cash flow and healthy balance sheets -- that happen to pay decent yields,'' said Roger J. Sit, another co-manager of the fund.
That has driven the fund both to tech and to other classic growth areas of the market. These include industrial stocks, like those of the farm equipment maker Deere & Company, and health care stocks like Cardinal Health, a pharmaceutical distributor. Both have dividend yields of more than 2.2 percent and trade at valuations of around 10 times projected earnings.
In general, tech, industrial and health care stocks share a couple of attractive traits: earnings of all three grew faster than the broad market in the second quarter. And the average P/E ratio for all three is lower than that of the S.& P. 500.
''You have to fish where the fish are, and for dividend investors that means going to places where there's enough income for dividends to be paid out today as well as tomorrow,'' said Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at the Westwood Holdings Group, an asset management firm. But, Mr. Freeman said, you also have to fish in areas that are hospitable to value-minded investors. After all, investors aren't simply buying income; they are also buying the underlying stock.
If investors are gravitating toward frothy areas like utilities because they crave stability, he added, they should consider shares of industry-leading companies with strong balance sheets in places like tech, industrials and health care.
CHRIS CORDARO, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic Capital, added that dividend seekers should also be willing to look abroad for reasonably priced sources of income. He noted that the yield on the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets index was nearly 3 percent. ''Yet these economies are forecast to grow the fastest over the next 5 to 10 years,'' he said.
Mr. Cordaro added that dividends were just one element of total returns, and that ''investors should look at a number of different dimensions.'' These include earnings and fundamental factors, including valuations.
If they do that, he said, they'll realize that many of the best opportunities for dividends are found in the fastest-growing areas of the market.

HEADLINE: The World Is Flat, Again

BYLINE: By MARK VANHOENACKER. 
A writer and airline pilot based in New York.

 BODY:
I'LL never forget my first globe. It was a basketball-size sphere with textured mountains and shining cerulean seas, but its crowning inner glory was a light bulb. Suspended in the darkness of my bedroom for most of the nights of my childhood, it served first as a night light unto my world. But night after night and year after year, it showed me the makings of things like nights and years and a permanently marvelous truth: We live on a sphere, turning in the light of a star.I plotted many things on that globe, including my career as a pilot. I have two globes today (a light-up model and a mind-wringing Japanese jigsaw sphere). But while stylized images of globes still appear occasionally on Web sites, newscasts and logos, actual globes are increasingly rare. When did you last see a globe in an office, or a living room? American schools, too, have seen a decline. Officials for major school systems -- including Chicago and Seattle -- report that most classrooms no longer have them. The last globe you saw was probably in a child's bedroom -- a high-minded toy. 
Not that they haven't had a good run. The first globes were ''celestial'' models of the heavens -- what Atlas shoulders (it's the sky, after all, that seems round). The first ''terrestrial'' globe was made around 150 B.C. (by Crates of Mallus, in case you're ever in a barroom brawl over what the Stoic grammarians ever did for us). The oldest Earth globe that survives today is from 1492. It was spectacularly ill timed, though a colorful cast of saints, mermen and Sciapods make up for the absent Americas.
Just across the Columbian divide is the Hunt-Lenox globe, circa 1510, which features portions of the Americas, and the weighty term ''New World.'' The globe also bears cartography's only known deployment of ''here be dragons'' (in Southeast Asia). Elizabethans, in particular, loved globes -- ''the whole earth, a present for a prince,'' was Queen Elizabeth's awe-struck response to a gift of a globe -- and then there is the name of a certain theater. In ''The Comedy of Errors,'' Dromio rudely maps the portly kitchen wench: England on the chin, France on the forehead, and just you guess about the Netherlands.
Such glorious history makes the decline of globes only more perplexing. Perhaps no four-billion-year-old design can escape the occasional hiccup in brand maintenance. But there are more likely culprits. As reference tools, home globes can't compete with detailed, up-to-date online resources (though note the Wikipedia logo, an incomplete globe). The decline of globes in schools, according to Robert Chisholm, program director for history and social studies in Boston's public schools, is also because of the squeeze of standardized math and English testing on subjects like geography.
It is the absence of globes in most professional environments, though, that reveals the most about us. Don Draper of ''Mad Men'' has an office globe. But none of the dozen or so executives I contacted could remember when they last saw one. The more global their work, the more they found the idea of a globe unappealing. Globalization is the alleged triumph of travel, trade and connectivity over the planet's bricks-and-mortar (or rocks-and-water) limitations. It's a measure of globalization's success -- and hubris, perhaps -- that its original icon appears literal and unsophisticated.
What's lost when we lose sight of globes? An accurate sense of home, to start. The view of a Roman street on Google Maps is wonderful -- but only after a globe has shown you Italy. And no online or paper map has yet succeeded in stretching a round planet onto a flat surface. Choose your complicated failure: Mercator? Sinusoidal equal area? Equidistant conic? Only a globe is both simple and right -- simple because it's right.
Globes show why maps are imperfect -- but also what maps even are. Susan Heffron, an education specialist with the Association of American Geographers, argues that online tools should never entirely displace school globes, particularly given the increasingly recognized importance of tactile, hands-on learning. Even for complex phenomena, like seasons and the length of days, a globe and flashlight work better than computer animations.
Indeed, whatever the irony of globalization's making globes unworldly, it's arguably made them more necessary. Dr. Heffron emphasizes that many environmental and geopolitical issues (thawing Arctic Sea routes, for instance) are more easily grasped on a globe. Mr. Chisholm, the Boston teacher, describes various lessons -- students tracing the life cycle of a sneaker across the globalized modern economy, say -- as hugely more effective when actual spheres turn under small fingers.
Every kid deserves a globe to ponder (and touch). What about adults -- hunting, gathering and car-pooling in a world that most days looks flat? The best reason for adults to rediscover globes is that, for all but the most silicon-hearted among us, nothing so easily and beautifully conjures our small place in a big scheme. After all, we live not in but on a world, one so achingly beautiful that we can hardly imagine we are free to gaze or sit down upon it anytime we like. Your family and your living room deserve a convenient, all-in-one incarnation of the transcendence of the Earthrise image, the grammar of Carl Sagan's ''Cosmos'' and ''The Tree of Life,'' the forgotten romance of our common home and of all travel.
A home globe doesn't have to look old-fashioned. There are clean, modern designs now. Find one you like, and put it where you're likely to stand up and touch it, to feel under your fingers what's under your feet. Spin it slowly around and think of Marilynne Robinson's reminder in ''Gilead,'' that the sun's ''light is constant'' -- that there's only ever been one day. Or, as my 7-year-old goddaughter sees it, ''I like that there's just one ocean.'' A globe shows us that there's only one of a lot of things -- and that we're all in it, and on it, together.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Envisions Park as Way to Revitalize Downtown Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Grand Park, one of the largest new parcels of open space in this sprawling city, is the focus of all sorts of grand visions. Designed for a major concert, a farmers' market or a participatory dance recital, it opened late last month with much fanfare, meant to attract office workers, suburbanites from across the region, tourists and the urban dwellers who call downtown home.Sandwiched between City Hall and Disney Hall, the park is the latest attempt to revitalize a neighborhood where the sidewalks once rolled up by nightfall but that now sees a new restaurant or bar opening seemingly every week.
Depending on whom you ask, it elicits comparisons to New York's Central Park or San Francisco's Union Square -- and a couple of the most enthusiastic supporters even liken it to the Champs-Élysées. 
''Everyone has some characterization of it to compare it to the city they know, but we're not trying to mimic anyone,'' said Gloria Molina, the Los Angeles County supervisor who led the effort to build the park. ''We're just very proud that we now have pedestrian walkways and green space in the heart of this neighborhood, and we're busy trying to make it our own.''
Even as the heat neared the triple digits downtown last week, there were signs of life that might never have been seen in this stretch of land.
There was 3-year-old Carri-Anne Park, splashing in the water jets near a fountain that a few months ago was almost hidden from public view. The girl's bright pink bikini top matched the picnic table and chairs scattered through the area. (The nearly fluorescent pink lawn furniture, one of the park's most distinctive features, is the sort of thing you might find only in Los Angeles.)
''You can't compare it to anything that we have anywhere else,'' said Lina Park, who brought her daughter with a group of friends from her church in Koreatown. ''It's clean, safe and big -- that's the kind of place people are going to want to come to.''
For years, officials have been trying to persuade more families to move to downtown, arguing that parents can live and work in the same neighborhood or simply have the more urban experience that they might be accustomed to on the East Coast.
So parents are encouraged to bring their children in swimsuits. By virtue of the mostly sunny weather here, the park will also feature programs year-round -- ''we're not just talking summer concerts,'' said Thor Steingraber, the vice president of programming at the Music Center, which will operate the county-owned park for the next year.
''We're going to make jury duty fun again,'' Mr. Steingraber said, referring to the park's location near the county courthouse.
''But we're also catering to people coming from all over the county on the weekend and families who live here coming during the week after work,'' he added. ''The village square experience has really been replaced by the virtual square experience, and we want to bring that village square back.''
For now, it is too early to tell whether the park will fill that role. On a recent afternoon, a Starbucks in the middle of the park seemed to be a bigger draw than the rows of palm trees and picnic tables that surround it. Ms. Molina, the county supervisor, said officials considered removing the coffee shop but were met with protests from workers in nearby buildings.
The idea for the park came up nearly eight years ago, when a real estate developer made a bid to create a large building filled with retail outlets and penthouse lofts. The county, which owned the property, agreed to the permits only if it received $50 million up front to create a new park.
There were multiple delays, and the real estate development has been stymied by a weak economy. If the developer does not begin construction by February, the land will revert to the county.
For some, that would not be a bad thing.
Activists have argued for years that the redevelopment of downtown has come at the expense of the most needy, particularly the homeless population in the eastern section of downtown known as Skid Row. This summer, Occupy Los Angeles protesters have shown up regularly at downtown events to argue that the gentrifying neighborhood is pushing out those who are desperate for affordable housing.
''We've seen some victories over the years with increased access to green space and hiring local employees, but unfortunately we've had many more defeats,'' said Becky Dennison, the co-director of the Los Angeles Community Action Network, which has worked on the downtown issue for the last decade. ''Unfortunately, what we really have now is a demarcation line about what policing strategies are, where businesses go and who is welcome and who is not.''
Peggy Richie, 81, and Katherine Nelson, 84, have lived in the city their entire lives and have seen the downtown morph from a place people want to be to a place people avoid. And in recent years, they have seen it morph back again.
''It used to be that people were afraid to come down here, and that didn't do nobody any good,'' Ms. Richie said as she walked through the park on the way from buying opera tickets at the Music Center to a late lunch at Philippe, the downtown fixture famous for its French dip sandwiches. ''You have something like this, and it restores people's excitement a little bit.''
Ms. Nelson then recalled, a little wistfully, the times when the pair would stop at a thrift shop downtown looking for bargains. It was sold a few years ago. In its place, or just nearby, is a pet boutique.

HEADLINE: Native of Nowhere

BYLINE: By ATOSSA ARAXIA ABRAHAMIAN. 
A journalist at Reuters and an editor at The New Inquiry.

 BODY:
I ENTERED the green card lottery in the fall of 2010. It was a surprisingly simple form, composed mostly of questions on contact information, but a box that read ''Country Claimed'' gave me pause. Most applicants write in wherever they were born, but for me it was a bit more complicated; I could not, in good faith, claim any country as my own.I was born in Canada on July 19, 1986. My Iranian-born parents (of Armenian and Russian extraction) were living in Geneva at the time, but Switzerland grants citizenship only to the children of naturalized citizens. My parents, who both worked for the United Nations, didn't know if they would live there long enough to meet the residency requirements. I was destined to inherit an Iranian passport, and they knew all too well the lifetime of travel and work restrictions that would entail.
So they came up with a third-country solution. My mother would fly to Vancouver, British Columbia, wearing an oversize raincoat just weeks before her due date. She would give birth at a local hospital, stay with her brother, who lived there, until my paperwork was processed, and return to Geneva with a Canadian baby in tow. It worked so well that she repeated the process four years later with my brother. 
My mother was finally naturalized when I was 8, so I was able to become a Swiss citizen after all. But my papers were, once again, misleading. Growing up, I spoke four languages at home -- Armenian with my father, Russian with my mother and English and French with baby sitters -- and attended international schools in which no one cared where you were from unless it was during the World Cup. I lived in Switzerland, but for all intents and purposes, I grew up on international soil.
When I went to college in New York, I was invited to Armenian events on the basis of my last name and Iranian ones on account of my first name, and I didn't think too much about where I came from. I was busy making friends and falling in love with the city. I spent summers working here, and it was the first place I'd ever lived that felt like home to me. Having spent my entire (albeit short) adult life here, I couldn't imagine leaving. So when I graduated, I found myself in need of a work visa.
There are several types of visas under which foreigners can work here, from seasonal farm work programs to O visas for ''extraordinary aliens'' -- Nobel Prize winners, celebrities and occasionally writers. For someone like me, just starting out in a career, this one was a long shot. The most common visa among college graduates is the H1-B. But the application process takes months, and the employer is required to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees to pay for sponsorship. The foreigner's legal status in the country also depends on maintaining his or her employment.
When I graduated, right before the Great Recession, no one was sponsoring. I asked a lawyer if there was anything I could do to stay. He took my $100 consultation fee and asked if I had a boyfriend I could marry.
I left. But I had no idea where to go. I felt like a foreigner in Geneva, and most of my friends had left. I'd spent no time in Canada. I had nothing in Iran. I tried out Russia for size, but lasted barely six weeks (life advice: don't go to Russia if you're depressed). Eventually, I found a job at an international organization in Paris and spent the year Skyping with my New York friends, listening to WNYC reruns on my laptop and applying to graduate schools back in the United States.
Had I not had the good fortune and the funds to go back to school, I don't know where in the world I'd be. In 2010, I was able to return to New York for a master's program in journalism, and I spent that year working harder than I ever had before. I would have to make up for my nationality with labor and talent, a school counselor told me. When I interviewed for jobs, I felt like a leper. My international classmates joked that coming clean about a limited work permit at a job interview was like telling someone you had herpes on a first date.
In the meantime, I entered the green card -- also known as the ''diversity'' -- lottery. They call it a lottery for good reason; the odds of winning are minute. But I'd marked the deadline in my calendar the year before, and it seemed like a waste to let it pass. I didn't have the right-size photograph to attach to my application, so my boyfriend snapped a picture of me standing against a dusty white wall in our kitchen. It was 7 a.m., and head-on, I looked like a sleepy convict. I wrote down my phone number and address, and under ''Country Claimed,'' settled on Switzerland.
Last summer, when I found out I'd won, I couldn't believe it could be that simple. I called three lawyers to make sure it was real. They said it was.
It wasn't.
Two painful months later, I received a letter from the United States Embassy in Bern. It informed me that I was disqualified from the lottery because I'd claimed the wrong country of origin. Although I had Swiss citizenship, I was not a Swiss native, because I was born in Canada. Canadians typically aren't eligible for the lottery, but if I'd claimed Iran, where my parents were born, I wouldn't have had any trouble. I appealed and complained, but nothing could be done. My mother's trip in the summer of 1986 came back to bite me. The punch line, of course, was that I was too diverse for the diversity lottery. Even I can't tell you where I'm from.
I used to think of immigration as a problem for the migrant poor, not something that affected college-educated global citizens. I now know that getting a work permit is a complicated and often heartbreaking process, no matter who you are. Thanks to months of pitching articles to whoever would let me write them -- not to mention a good lawyer -- I finally obtained an O visa this year. I don't have to get married, to a man or a job, to have a career in the United States. But I was able to stay only because I had the time, resources and support to make it work. For most people, the odds are stacked against them from beginning to end.

HEADLINE: Youth Golf Thrives, but Not in High School

BYLINE: By ADAM SCHUPAK

 BODY:
Will Thomson bounded onto the practice tee lugging a double-strapped golf bag. His round of 78 was complete, but Thomson was still brimming with energy. At 11, he was the youngest and smallest junior in the field at the International Junior Golf Tour's Bridgestone Golf Tournament of Champions in late May in Orlando, Fla.He had traveled with his father, Tom, from Pittsford, N.Y., to test his game in the 14-and-under division. But viewed through the prism of junior golf, their trip was not far at all. In the field, there were more juniors from Japan than from Florida. There were golfers from Panama, France, Denmark, Italy and Mozambique.
To Thomson's left on the range, students from the Gary Gilchrist Golf Academy were dressed in matching bright blue Puma shirts. High-priced private coaches doled out swing tips and drills to their troops. To his right, the bags of his competition were emblazoned with names like Core Golf Academy, Greg Norman Champions Golf Academy and Junior Players Golf Academy. 
Soon Thomson would have his own flashy bag. He represented the United States last month in the Euro Junior Golf Cup, an international team competition, at St. Andrews, Scotland.
''He's going to get a Team USA bag before he gets one from his high school,'' Tom Thomson said.
His Team USA bag will also gain him more attention than a high school one. High school golf has become irrelevant on the recruiting trail for college coaches, who are flocking to junior tournaments to identify the best young talent.
Long before tryouts for the fall season begin in certain parts of the country, junior golfers with an eye on playing beyond high school have been testing their game at a full slate of national events this summer. An alphabet soup of tours has arisen to satisfy the Will Thomsons of the world, each tour committed to helping junior golfers ages 11 to 19 in their pursuit of earning a college golf scholarship and eventually playing on the PGA Tour.
According to the National Golf Foundation, the sport's vital signs -- rounds played, golf facilities developed and participation -- are all down. The arena of junior competitive golf has been one of the sport's few growth categories.
Stephen Hamblin, the executive director of the American Junior Golf Association, recalled cringing many years ago when a board member boldly predicted the association would be running multiple tournaments in a week.
''We were struggling to do one a week,'' said Hamblin, who has worked for the association for 29 years. He said the organization now runs 96 events, ''and I have a full-time staff of 60. It's beyond what I envisioned. But it's what the parents and players want. We survive because of our mission and purpose and the void we fill.''
The void Hamblin refers to exists at the high school level, where golf does not receive anywhere near the same treatment as football, basketball or baseball. Matches are often nine holes, and qualified instruction is rare. So is the likelihood of obtaining a college golf scholarship based on one's high school golf record.
About 120 college coaches attended the United States Junior Amateur Championship last month in New Hampshire. The Georgia Tech men's golf coach, Bruce Heppler, said that the first time he attended the event in 1990, as a University of Nevada-Las Vegas assistant, he and Mike Holder of Oklahoma State were the only coaches in attendance. Holder took his wife, and they invited Heppler for a collegial lunch.
''Now you don't even dare eat because you're afraid someone will gain an advantage,'' Heppler said.
For parents who obsess over the multitude of junior rankings, the proliferation of junior golf tours can be confusing, and scheduling can be overwhelming.
''It's an information wasteland,'' said Mark Berman of Jacksonville, Fla., whose 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, is ranked third in her age group on the Hurricane Junior Golf Tour and as an eighth grader finished third in the district championships for the Bolles School last fall.
The American Junior Golf Association is where the most promising players compete. Both finalists in the United States Amateur on Sunday came from it, as had more than 200 players on the PGA and L.P.G.A. Tours, including Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Paula Creamer. For the third straight year, A.J.G.A. membership has grown, reaching a record 5,800.
Invitationals like the Wyndham Cup, at Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill, attract the top talent, and regional events like last week's Webb Simpson Junior Championship have accommodated their growing ranks. The competition to play is fierce, and it is not cheap. Peter Orrell, the chief executive of Junior Golf Corporation, owner and operator of the Hank Haney International Junior Golf Academy and the International Junior Golf Tour, estimated that families spent a few thousand dollars to attend the Bridgestone Golf Tournament of Champions at Grand Cypress Resort. (The A.J.G.A. and other tours offer a financial-assistance program.)
''Add in flights, it could be a $5,000 weekend,'' Orrell said. ''But a college scholarship is big money. The way to have a shot is to invest time and money to it.''
Another sign of the pent-up demand is a cottage industry of golf academies that have sprouted, with the most high profile featuring the acclaimed instructors Gilchrist, Haney and David Leadbetter. Tuition at some academies can reach $70,000.
College coaches warn parents against spending the cost of a scholarship to get one. Men's coaches are given only four and a half scholarships annually, women's coaches six, which they allocate among a team of 10 to 12 players.
In a tough economy, a college scholarship is more valuable than ever. In response to an avalanche of inquiries, the A.J.G.A. recently created a Web site to help navigate the competitive junior golf landscape. The University of Washington men's golf coach, Matt Thurmond, also has a free recruiting blog and posts the answers to recruiting questions.
As much as the opportunities for junior golfers to showcase their abilities have increased, some coaches still stress old-fashioned values to determine whom they want to coach for the next four years.
''Nothing tells me more about the character of a recruit,'' Thurmond said, ''than how they treat and speak of their mother.''

COST TO RENT $3,100 a month, for a 700-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper West Side.COST TO BUY $4,900 a month, including common charge and taxes, for a nearly 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom two-bath with a den in Harlem. 
PRICE $699,000
DOWN PAYMENT $34,950
VERDICT Buy
BACKSTORY After living in a one-bedroom rental on the Upper West Side with their 5-year-old son, Finn, for a year, Casey Galegher, 31, and Van Krishnamoorthy, 34, were ready for a bigger place. But the two-bedroom rentals they found in their neighborhood cost more than they wanted to pay.
THE SEARCH With interest rates low and plans to stay in Manhattan for the long term, they began looking at apartments for sale and homed in on Harlem. ''With renting something in our existing neighborhood being comparable to actually buying a place above 110, it became an easy decision,'' said Ms. Galegher, a stay-at-home mom. ''Also we could get a lot more space for the money above 110.''
This summer they spent $699,000 on a two-bedroom in a new condominium, using a Federal Housing Administration loan that allowed them to put just 5 percent down. Taxes are $100 a month, thanks to a 25-year tax abatement with 20 years remaining. And the couple received 1 percent back at closing from RealDirect.com, the online brokerage they used through the process.
LESSON LEARNED Broaden your horizons. ''Before we looked in Harlem,'' Dr. Krishnamoorthy said, ''I always felt it was financially a bad decision to buy,'' mainly because such a large amount of money goes into the down payment, as opposed to being invested in stocks. ''We had to put in so much money relative to renting and there was no guarantee that the apartment would appreciate.'' But after researching the Harlem market, he said, he is convinced the investment will pay off. He and his wife are not only paying the same or less than if they had rented a similar property, he said, but can also rent the place out to Columbia graduate students in several years, if they decide to move downtown. ''For us it's a win-win.''

HEADLINE: Gay Male Comics Await the Spotlight

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
COULD James Adomian become the first man to break through as an openly gay stand-up star?The thought popped into my head as he performed last month in front of an almost entirely male audience at the Rockbar, on Christopher Street. In a hat, with a confident, wry smile and a thin mustache, Mr. Adomian, whose debut album ''Low Hangin Fruit'' (Earwolf) was released on Monday, is a casually handsome performer who doesn't come across as clearly gay or straight. He has a low-boiling energy onstage -- confident, jaunty but not aggressive -- and his set features solidly constructed, verbally playful jokes enlivened by an uncanny ability to channel a subway crowd or a larger-than-life character. 
Leaning into the microphone and looking ready to pounce, Mr. Adomian, 32, imagined what Disney World would be like in New York by transforming into a Type A shouter whose every second is defined by pointless urgency: ''I want to be in Tomorrowland yesterday!'' He did several sharp minutes about how popular villains always have characteristics that read gay, including a persuasive argument that the Transformers sound like catty, enraged drag queens (''Megaaaatron! Shut up, Starscream!''). His parody of crowd work killed: ''So,'' he shouted in a life-of-the-party voice. ''Who's in the closet?''
Revealingly, this joke did just as well two days earlier at a straight bar in the East Village. There were small changes, like specifying at Rockbar that an accent was from someone straight, but the sets were remarkably similar. This consistency is its own argument: Just as some stand-up comics have achieved mass appeal with highly specific ethnic or racial points of view, a polished set from a gay perspective could do the same. The response was equally loud in both rooms.
Homophobia has long been a part of mainstream comedy, but attitudes have changed radically since 1983, when Eddie Murphy opened the concert film ''Delirious'' with a long gay-panic riff that included a joke about worrying about getting AIDS from a woman who kissed a gay man. Mr. Murphy expressed regret for that bit many years later, and last year Tracy Morgan took just a week to apologize for what was widely seen as an antigay rant in a show in Nashville.
Comedy has probably never had more openly gay performers and frank talk about homosexuality than it does now. The veteran comic Todd Glass made news in January when he came out of the closet on Marc Maron's podcast. And while straight comics still make gay jokes rooted in stereotypes, there are also figures like Bo Burnham, a fast-rising straight 21-year-old who recently made a pilot for MTV. Years after turning a clip of himself singing ''My Whole Family Thinks I'm Gay'' into a viral Internet hit, he said that he likes to keep his sexuality vague.
Of course mainstream comic actors and writers, like Neil Patrick Harris and David Sedaris, have found success. Yet there has never been that one transformative gay male comic, let alone someone of the stature of Anderson Cooper or even Frank Ocean acknowledging his sexuality.
Early this year, the gay comic Ralph Hardesty wrote an article about searching for role models. ''I wish there were a classic comedy special like Richard Pryor's epic 'Live on the Sunset Strip' that spoke directly to gay men,'' he wrote. ''It doesn't sound like it would mean that much -- until you realize you don't have it.''
Last year was a watershed for women in comedy because performers like Kristen Wiig, Whitney Cummings and Lena Dunham reached large audiences. They have followed pioneers like Joan Rivers, Roseanne Barr and Sarah Silverman. And lesbian comedians like Ellen DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell and Wanda Sykes have all found success as headliners, though each came out after achieving some fame.
''With gays, we still don't have the first guy,'' said Dave Rubin, a gay comic who is the co-host of the Sirius radio show ''The Six Pack,'' which often features gay celebrities. ''Television likes their gay people as sidekicks on the Bravo network or as fashion experts. I'm just not sure how far we've come from one of my favorite Homer Simpson lines: 'Marge, I like my TV loud, my beer cold and my homosexuals flaming!' ''
That's not the case in live comedy today, where you often see stand-up that is less accurately described as gay comedy than it is as comedy from gay perspectives, among others. In his recent one-man show ''Numb,'' the popular young British stand-up Simon Amstell talked bluntly about his sex life in the charmingly neurotic vein of a young Woody Allen.
Gabe Liedman, a verbally clever comic who helps run the usually packed weekly stage show ''Big Terrific'' and whose debut comedy album is set for September, treats his sexuality as a given in a deliriously absurd, intricate joke about accepting imperfection. ''No one's perfect,'' he said last month, mid-riff. ''Channing Tatum's not perfect. Neither am I. Maybe we'll date.''
Brent Sullivan, a defiantly understated 28-year-old comic with a calm NPR voice, said his only rule onstage was that he never come out.
''Straight people don't have to do that,'' he said in an interview. ''Why should I? It should be inherent in what I'm saying that I'm a gay man. If you stop making it a thing, then it won't be.''
Many young stand-ups treat coming out offhandedly or divorce it from sentiment or trauma. Mr. Adomian uses it as a springboard for a series of jokes and mock swagger: ''I'm gay. Sorry, ladies,'' he says, pausing for a small leer. ''You're welcome, fellas.'' It's a stark contrast from more familiar stories full of humorous anxiety and fear of disapproval.
The middle-aged veteran comic Kevin Meaney came out in 2008, and the experience remains a part of his act. ''How do you tell your wife you're gay?'' he asked with exaggerated exasperation at a recent show at Ella Lounge in the East Village. ''Honey, I'm homo!''
Mr. Meaney also sang several songs, including one as Ethel Merman. Mario Cantone, who is probably the best-known openly gay stand-up working today (he played a recurring character in ''Sex and the City''), also sings in his act, something straight comics rarely do.
This style seems old-fashioned to many of his colleagues. Along with the writer and comedian Eliot Glazer, Mr. Sullivan stars in the elegantly made, very funny Web series ''It Gets Betterish,'' which portrays them as pathetically unglamorous gay men in a world that expects them to be more flamboyant. The scripts, including one about futilely trying to convince people they don't like Lady Gaga, tap into the general appeal of being an outsider, even in your own subculture.
Mr. Glazer is preparing to shop ''It Gets Betterish'' to television networks but understands the challenges.
''In our culture it's acceptable to talk about women and men, or even women and women, but it's still seen by some as icky to talk about two men,'' he said in an interview. ''But it's a generational thing. For many it's no big deal.''
The stage star Nathan Lane, who started his career in a comedy team, said: ''It's hard for stand-ups to be totally honest about your life and not alienate audiences. It's easier, I think, for a woman, especially if you have a daytime talk show.''
The stand-ups say their challenge is not just that straight audiences will not relate to gay sex but that gay comics also have trouble appealing to gay crowds.
At a show I attended last year, Mr. Cantone asked a Gotham Comedy Club audience who in it was gay; the response was but a smattering of applause. Female comics like Kathy Griffin and Margaret Cho, however, have loyal gay male audiences.
''When they are, like, 'You are my gays,' it's a marketing tool,'' Mr. Glazer said. ''It drives me insane.''
In a solo show at the Upright Citizens Brigade, Mr. Sullivan slyly skewered the antigay activist Fred Phelps, using understated, extreme reasonableness. Mr. Sullivan said later that he couldn't get any gay media to cover the performance, and that the vast majority of his alternative-comedy audience was straight. ''I don't think it's chic to be a gay nerd yet,'' he said.
When the first breakthrough gay male comic arrives, chances are he will have received a boost online. Gay performers like the former Groundling Drew Droege, whose video impressions of the actress Chloë Sevigny have gone viral, and Billy Eichner, whose Fuse channel game show has become a cult hit, have had success without help of gatekeepers at comedy clubs or network television.
Mr. Adomian has already become a star of sorts in the podcast world, in which he regularly does a dizzying number of cameo impressions on ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' and ''Sklarbro Country.'' His characters -- including Gary Busey, Tim Gunn and Paul Giamatti -- are so hilariously realized that it's surprising that he hasn't been picked up by ''Saturday Night Live.'' His best is probably a pitch-perfect Jesse Ventura, former wrestler and Minnesota governor, as a mindlessly argumentative, conspiratorial kook with the confidence of someone trained in a fake sport.
So far, Mr. Adomian's character work has somewhat overshadowed his stand-up. His debut album may change that. It uses his gift for mimicry in the service of observational jokes, capping a bit about the hypermasculinity of beer commercials with a gravelly baritone impression of the actor Sam Elliott. Capturing the outdated showbiz lingo of graying musicians, he says in a mock-Dean Martin style, ''He's all jacks and no aces.'' While the voices first get your attention, it's the economy, accuracy and flair of his writing that makes them stick.
To become a star, Mr. Adomian will probably need to ensure that his own voice emerges even more strongly. His most vivid material touches on gay themes. It's here where we see why diversity in comedy is not just about fairness, but quality too. A straight or closeted comic could not get the laughs that Mr. Adomian does out of the homoeroticism of pro wrestling or comparisons of gay bars, let alone a personal story of gay bashing.
Striking a delicate tonal balance, Mr. Adomian transformed being assaulted into a cuttingly funny yarn without diminishing its horror. Responding to a punch, he fights back by saying he will alert the press. This works, even though in an aside he concedes it's a ridiculous threat. He illustrates the point by imagining an old-school print editor dreaming of the story as tabloid gold. In rat-a-tat, hard-boiled cadence, he imagines the headline:
''Poof popped in the lip: Fisticuffs on the Yellow Brick Road.''

HEADLINE: For Russians, Corruption Is Just A Way of Life

BYLINE: By MISHA FRIEDMAN. 
Misha Friedman is a photographer whose subjects have included the humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda, violence in Nigeria and the war in Darfur.

 BODY:
CORRUPTION in Russia is so pervasive that the whole society accepts the unacceptable as normal, as the only way of survival, as the way things ''just are.''It is not simply about officials abusing power; it's also about ordinary people comfortably adapting these principles to their daily lives. 
Most Russians have grown so accustomed to a certain lawless way of life that they have come to view corruption as ''Russia's own special way.'' They are unsure how their country's economy, government or social sphere might function without it. This photo essay is an attempt to show that corruption is both a state of mind and a way of life.
Thousands of people in Russia's large cities took to the streets in recent months, unhappy with President Vladimir V. Putin's system of running the country. Under his leadership, they believe, Russia is steadily becoming a medieval country with corruption trumping all laws. These people have traveled the world, and they feel embarrassed when their peers in London, New York or Berlin ask about the Pussy Riot trial or the imprisonment of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Members of this new class of Russians often hide their nationality just to avoid being compared to their country's ruling elite or asked questions that they cannot answer.
I was born in Moldova, then part of the Soviet Union, but moved to New York in the early 1990s when my parents immigrated here. For more than a decade I have been going back to Russia, noticing how the country has become more and more corrupt and lawless. I have been working on this project for the past six months. I see corruption as more than something done to people; it is something they participate in. It involves both a resignation to and a justification of a state of iniquity, insecurity and mistrust.
This project was financed by the Institute of Modern Russia, a nonprofit group based in the United States that aims, among other things, to combat Russian corruption.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: A young man beats a woman on a Moscow street, above, while police officers and bystanders look on without intervening. Domestic violence kills as many as 14,000 Russian women each year.
Are these just two friends, left, having lunch? Corruption is such a part of daily life that it's hard to tell what might be going on in dark places.

HEADLINE: Punting Less Can Be Rewarding, but Coaches Aren't Risking Jobs on It

BYLINE: By ADAM HIMMELSBACH

 BODY:
The punt seems to contradict football's essence, as coaches voluntarily relinquish the ball even though they have at least one more chance to move it forward.Although some statistics show there are often better options on fourth down, teams continue to punt, punt and then punt some more. But what if they did not? What if the punt was punted?
Last week, San Diego State Coach Rocky Long said he might consider going for first downs when his team faced fourth downs past midfield this year. His intentions rekindled a debate about the value of the punt, a play some think is a product of coaches' conservatism and resistance to change.
''Coaches tend to be risk averse,'' said Dr. Ben Alamar, a professor of sports management at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif., who has studied N.F.L. statistics. ''People are typically uncomfortable moving away from the norms.'' 
David Romer, a professor of political economy at the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper in 2005 on the statistics of punting that has become the gospel for the antipunting faction. Romer, who analyzed data from N.F.L. games from 1998 to 2004, determined, among other things, that teams should not punt when facing fourth-and-4 yards or less, regardless of field position.
''Of course, there are times when punting is a good idea,'' Romer said in an e-mail message, ''just not nearly as many as football coaches seem to think.''
Brian Burke, the publisher of advancednflstats.com, said teams should go for a first down when they faced fourth-and-1, or when it was fourth down from the opponent's 35 to 40. Burke also said that he believed that teams should try to score a touchdown when facing fourth-and-goal from the 6 or closer, assuming a last-second field goal is not called for.
''If everyone agrees out of fear or ignorance to sort of play ultraconservative, nobody really has an advantage,'' Burke said. ''There's no development, no evolution. Coaches have strategies that are generations behind where the sport really is. It's going to take someone to stick their neck out.''
Coaches are hesitant to take the plunge because a string of failed fourth-down attempts could leave them vulnerable to criticism and affect their job security more than a conservative menu of punts ever could.
''From different eras, there was a mind-set that playing the field-possession game is a good thing, because it turned the ball to the other team 40 yards away and allows them to make a mistake,'' the former Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. ''Coaches, by nature, are a little bit defensive in their thinking.''
According to Dr. Curt Lox, a professor of kinesiology and sports psychology at Southern Illinois-Edwardsville, the candidates best in position to experiment with a punt-free strategy are those who are so established and successful that they are almost immune to criticism of their strategy, or those who are unknown underdogs with nothing to lose.
Kevin Kelley, the head coach at Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Ark., fit the second description when he was hired in 2003. That year, he came across a grainy VHS tape of a professor espousing the potential virtues of a punt-free lifestyle. Kelley was intrigued and has since become perhaps the most unorthodox coach in the nation.
His high school team does onside kicks after almost every score. It does not use a punt returner, because Kelley believes fumbles and penalties occur more often than strong returns. And it does not punt. Last season, the Bruins went 14-0 and won the Class 4A state title.
''It was easy to convince the players, because they grow up playing PlayStation and Madden and they don't punt in those games, so they don't want to punt in real games,'' Kelley said. ''The fans were a different story.''
When Kelley unveiled his aggressive offense, his tactics were questioned by Pulaski administrators and school board members. Once, when Pulaski defied its own logic and punted, it received a standing ovation from the home crowd.
''I remember turning around and saying, 'You're the only people in the history of football that stand and cheer for a punt,' '' Kelley said.
It would be ineffective, Kelley said, for college and professional coaches to decide in the middle of a game to attempt a risky fourth-down play simply because statistics supported the call. If they embraced the model, the structure of their play calling would be tailored toward it.
Kelley's offense thrives because the possibilities are endless. Third-and-7 is not necessarily a passing down, and third-and-inches is not necessarily a running down.
''And God help the defense on first-and-10,'' Kelley said, ''because we can literally do anything.''
In recent years, Kelley has consulted with college and N.F.L. teams. He said one offensive coordinator for a team in the Big 12 Conference was enthralled by the idea of never punting, but the head coach was spooked by the risks. Then the offensive coordinator became a head coach, and he got cold feet, too.
Kelley has shared his philosophy with two A.F.C. coaches whose hesitancy outweighed their curiosity.
''These coaches are making millions of dollars, and if they lose close games doing it the traditional way, they'll probably keep their jobs,'' Kelley said.
Pro and college punters, already a solitary lot, are understandably defensive when facing such an existential question. If there was no punting, there would be no punters.
''Obviously, we don't get to score points,'' said Bobby Cowan, a senior punter at Idaho whose average of 46.41 yards a kick was second in the nation last season. ''But when you pin a team on the 1-inch line and your team gets a safety, that's kind of your 2 points. Plus, you get the ball back, so you could basically score 9 points for your team.''
Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe understands the data that says most teams punt too often.
But, Kluwe said, unlike baseball and its sabermetric-friendly 162-game season, a 16-game football season is not a large enough sample for a definitive stance.
''Over the long run, your offense might convert enough of those fourth downs to be worth it,'' Kluwe said. ''The problem is if you run into a couple of bad plays in one game, you're going to lose.''
And in football, one extra loss could keep a team out of the playoffs. But for punters like Kluwe, perhaps there is a happy medium, a way to embrace this new way of thinking without turning punters into relics.
''I'm all for running fake punts,'' Kluwe said. ''That's our one time to shine.''

HEADLINE: Skilled Work, Without the Worker

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
DRACHTEN, the Netherlands -- At the Philips Electronics factory on the coast of China, hundreds of workers use their hands and specialized tools to assemble electric shavers. That is the old way.At a sister factory here in the Dutch countryside, 128 robot arms do the same work with yoga-like flexibility. Video cameras guide them through feats well beyond the capability of the most dexterous human.
One robot arm endlessly forms three perfect bends in two connector wires and slips them into holes almost too small for the eye to see. The arms work so fast that they must be enclosed in glass cages to prevent the people supervising them from being injured. And they do it all without a coffee break -- three shifts a day, 365 days a year.
All told, the factory here has several dozen workers per shift, about a tenth as many as the plant in the Chinese city of Zhuhai. 
This is the future. A new wave of robots, far more adept than those now commonly used by automakers and other heavy manufacturers, are replacing workers around the world in both manufacturing and distribution. Factories like the one here in the Netherlands are a striking counterpoint to those used by Apple and other consumer electronics giants, which employ hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers.
''With these machines, we can make any consumer device in the world,'' said Binne Visser, an electrical engineer who manages the Philips assembly line in Drachten.
Many industry executives and technology experts say Philips's approach is gaining ground on Apple's. Even as Foxconn, Apple's iPhone manufacturer, continues to build new plants and hire thousands of additional workers to make smartphones, it plans to install more than a million robots within a few years to supplement its work force in China.
Foxconn has not disclosed how many workers will be displaced or when. But its chairman, Terry Gou, has publicly endorsed a growing use of robots. Speaking of his more than one million employees worldwide, he said in January, according to the official Xinhua news agency: ''As human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.''
The falling costs and growing sophistication of robots have touched off a renewed debate among economists and technologists over how quickly jobs will be lost. This year, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made the case for a rapid transformation. ''The pace and scale of this encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound economic implications,'' they wrote in their book, ''Race Against the Machine.''
In their minds, the advent of low-cost automation foretells changes on the scale of the revolution in agricultural technology over the last century, when farming employment in the United States fell from 40 percent of the work force to about 2 percent today. The analogy is not only to the industrialization of agriculture but also to the electrification of manufacturing in the past century, Mr. McAfee argues.
''At what point does the chain saw replace Paul Bunyan?'' asked Mike Dennison, an executive at Flextronics, a manufacturer of consumer electronics products that is based in Silicon Valley and is increasingly automating assembly work. ''There's always a price point, and we're very close to that point.''
But Bran Ferren, a veteran roboticist and industrial product designer at Applied Minds in Glendale, Calif., argues that there are still steep obstacles that have made the dream of the universal assembly robot elusive. ''I had an early naïveté about universal robots that could just do anything,'' he said. ''You have to have people around anyway. And people are pretty good at figuring out, how do I wiggle the radiator in or slip the hose on? And these things are still hard for robots to do.''
Beyond the technical challenges lies resistance from unionized workers and communities worried about jobs. The ascension of robots may mean fewer jobs are created in this country, even though rising labor and transportation costs in Asia and fears of intellectual property theft are now bringing some work back to the West.
Take the cavernous solar-panel factory run by Flextronics in Milpitas, south of San Francisco. A large banner proudly proclaims ''Bringing Jobs & Manufacturing Back to California!'' (Right now China makes a large share of the solar panels used in this country and is automating its own industry.)
Yet in the state-of-the-art plant, where the assembly line runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are robots everywhere and few human workers. All of the heavy lifting and almost all of the precise work is done by robots that string together solar cells and seal them under glass. The human workers do things like trimming excess material, threading wires and screwing a handful of fasteners into a simple frame for each panel.
Such advances in manufacturing are also beginning to transform other sectors that employ millions of workers around the world. One is distribution, where robots that zoom at the speed of the world's fastest sprinters can store, retrieve and pack goods for shipment far more efficiently than people. Robots could soon replace workers at companies like C & S Wholesale Grocers, the nation's largest grocery distributor, which has already deployed robot technology.
Rapid improvement in vision and touch technologies is putting a wide array of manual jobs within the abilities of robots. For example, Boeing's wide-body commercial jets are now riveted automatically by giant machines that move rapidly and precisely over the skin of the planes. Even with these machines, the company said it struggles to find enough workers to make its new 787 aircraft. Rather, the machines offer significant increases in precision and are safer for workers.
And at Earthbound Farms in California, four newly installed robot arms with customized suction cups swiftly place clamshell containers of organic lettuce into shipping boxes. The robots move far faster than the people they replaced. Each robot replaces two to five workers at Earthbound, according to John Dulchinos, an engineer who is the chief executive at Adept Technology, a robot maker based in Pleasanton, Calif., that developed Earthbound's system.
Robot manufacturers in the United States say that in many applications, robots are already more cost-effective than humans.
At an automation trade show last year in Chicago, Ron Potter, the director of robotics technology at an Atlanta consulting firm called Factory Automation Systems, offered attendees a spreadsheet to calculate how quickly robots would pay for themselves.
In one example, a robotic manufacturing system initially cost $250,000 and replaced two machine operators, each earning $50,000 a year. Over the 15-year life of the system, the machines yielded $3.5 million in labor and productivity savings.
The Obama administration says this technological shift presents a historic opportunity for the nation to stay competitive. ''The only way we are going to maintain manufacturing in the U.S. is if we have higher productivity,'' said Tom Kalil, deputy director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Government officials and industry executives argue that even if factories are automated, they still are a valuable source of jobs. If the United States does not compete for advanced manufacturing in industries like consumer electronics, it could lose product engineering and design as well. Moreover, robotics executives argue that even though blue-collar jobs will be lost, more efficient manufacturing will create skilled jobs in designing, operating and servicing the assembly lines, as well as significant numbers of other kinds of jobs in the communities where factories are.
And robot makers point out that their industry itself creates jobs. A report commissioned by the International Federation of Robotics last year found that 150,000 people are already employed by robotics manufacturers worldwide in engineering and assembly jobs.
But American and European dominance in the next generation of manufacturing is far from certain.
''What I see is that the Chinese are going to apply robots too,'' said Frans van Houten, Philips's chief executive. ''The window of opportunity to bring manufacturing back is before that happens.''
A Faster Assembly Line
Royal Philips Electronics began making the first electric shavers in 1939 and set up the factory here in Drachten in 1950. But Mr. Visser, the engineer who manages the assembly, takes pride in the sophistication of the latest shavers. They sell for as much as $350 and, he says, are more complex to make than smartphones.
The assembly line here is made up of dozens of glass cages housing robots made by Adept Technology that snake around the factory floor for more than 100 yards. Video cameras atop the cages guide the robot arms almost unerringly to pick up the parts they assemble. The arms bend wires with millimetric accuracy, set toothpick-thin spindles in tiny holes, grab miniature plastic gears and set them in housings, and snap pieces of plastic into place.
The next generation of robots for manufacturing will be more flexible and easier to train.
Witness the factory of Tesla Motors, which recently began manufacturing the Tesla S, a luxury sedan, in Fremont, Calif., on the edge of Silicon Valley.
More than half of the building is shuttered, called ''the dark side.'' It still houses a dingy, unused Toyota Corolla assembly line on which an army of workers once turned out half a million cars annually.
The Tesla assembly line is a stark contrast, brilliantly lighted. Its fast-moving robots, bright Tesla red, each has a single arm with multiple joints. Most of them are imposing, 8 to 10 feet tall, giving them a slightly menacing ''Terminator'' quality.
But the arms seem eerily human when they reach over to a stand and change their ''hand'' to perform a different task. While the many robots in auto factories typically perform only one function, in the new Tesla factory a robot might do up to four: welding, riveting, bonding and installing a component.
As many as eight robots perform a ballet around each vehicle as it stops at each station along the line for just five minutes. Ultimately as many as 83 cars a day -- roughly 20,000 are planned for the first year -- will be produced at the factory. When the company adds a sport utility vehicle next year, it will be built on the same assembly line, once the robots are reprogrammed.
Tesla's factory is tiny but represents a significant bet on flexible robots, one that could be a model for the industry. And others are already thinking bigger.
Hyundai and Beijing Motors recently completed a mammoth factory outside Beijing that can produce a million vehicles a year using more robots and fewer people than the big factories of their competitors and with the same flexibility as Tesla's, said Paul Chau, an American venture capitalist at WI Harper who toured the plant in June.
The New Warehouse
Traditional and futuristic systems working side by side in a distribution center north of New York City show how robotics is transforming the way products are distributed, threatening jobs. From this warehouse in Newburgh, C & S, the nation's largest grocery wholesaler, supplies a major supermarket chain.
The old system sprawls across almost half a million square feet. The shelves are loaded and unloaded around the clock by hundreds of people driving pallet jacks and forklifts. At peak times in the evening, the warehouse is a cacophony of beeping and darting electric vehicles as workers with headsets are directed to cases of food by a computer that speaks to them in four languages.
The new system is much smaller, squeezed into only 30,000 square feet at the far end of the warehouse and controlled by just a handful of technicians. They watch over a four-story cage with different levels holding 168 ''rover'' robots the size of go-carts. Each can move at 25 miles an hour, nearly as fast as an Olympic sprinter.
Each rover is connected wirelessly to a central computer and on command will race along an aisle until it reaches its destination -- a case of food to retrieve or the spot to drop one off for storage. The robot gathers a box by extending two-foot-long metal fingers from its side and sliding them underneath. It lifts the box and pulls it to its belly. Then it accelerates to the front of the steel cage, where it turns into a wide lane where it must contend with traffic -- eight robots are active on each level of the structure, which is 20 aisles wide and 21 levels high.
From the aisle, the robots wait their turn to pull into a special open lane where they deposit each load into an elevator that sends a stream of food cases down to a conveyor belt that leads to a large robot arm.
About 10 feet tall, the arm has the grace and dexterity of a skilled supermarket bagger, twisting and turning each case so the final stack forms an eight-foot cube. The software is sophisticated enough to determine which robot should pick up which case first, so when the order arrives at the supermarket, workers can take the cases out in the precise order in which they are to go on the shelves.
When the arm is finished, the cube of goods is conveyed to a machine that wraps it in clear plastic to hold it in place. Then a forklift operator summoned by the computer moves the cube to a truck for shipment.
Built by Symbotic, a start-up company based in the Boston area, this robotic warehouse is inspired by computer designers who created software algorithms to efficiently organize data to be stored on a computer's hard drive.
Jim Baum, Symbotic's chief executive, compares the new system to a huge parallel computer. The design is efficient because there is no single choke point; the cases of food moving through the robotic warehouse are like the digital bits being processed by the computer.
Humans' Changing Role
In the decade since he began working as a warehouseman in Tolleson, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, Josh Graves has seen how automation systems can make work easier but also create new stress and insecurity. The giant facility where he works distributes dry goods for Kroger supermarkets.
Mr. Graves, 29, went to work in the warehouse, where his father worked for three decades, right out of high school. The demanding job required lifting heavy boxes and the hours were long. ''They would bring in 15 guys, and only one would last,'' he said.
Today Mr. Graves drives a small forklift-like machine that stores and retrieves cases of all sizes. Because such workers are doing less physical labor, there are fewer injuries, said Rome Aloise, a Teamsters vice president in Northern California. Because a computer sets the pace, the stress is now more psychological.
Mr. Graves wears headsets and is instructed by a computerized voice on where to go in the warehouse to gather or store products. A centralized computer the workers call The Brain dictates their speed. Managers know exactly what the workers do, to the precise minute.
Several years ago, Mr. Graves's warehouse installed a German system that automatically stores and retrieves cases of food. That led to the elimination of 106 jobs, roughly 20 percent of the work force. The new system was initially maintained by union workers with high seniority. Then that job went to the German company, which hired nonunion workers.
Now Kroger plans to build a highly automated warehouse in Tolleson. Sixty union workers went before the City Council last year to oppose the plan, on which the city has not yet ruled.
''We don't have a problem with the machines coming,'' Mr. Graves told city officials. ''But tell Kroger we don't want to lose these jobs in our city.''
Some jobs are still beyond the reach of automation: construction jobs that require workers to move in unpredictable settings and perform different tasks that are not repetitive; assembly work that requires tactile feedback like placing fiberglass panels inside airplanes, boats or cars; and assembly jobs where only a limited quantity of products are made or where there are many versions of each product, requiring expensive reprogramming of robots.
But that list is growing shorter.
Upgrading Distribution
Inside a spartan garage in an industrial neighborhood in Palo Alto, Calif., a robot armed with electronic ''eyes'' and a small scoop and suction cups repeatedly picks up boxes and drops them onto a conveyor belt.
It is doing what low-wage workers do every day around the world.
Older robots cannot do such work because computer vision systems were costly and limited to carefully controlled environments where the lighting was just right. But thanks to an inexpensive stereo camera and software that lets the system see shapes with the same ease as humans, this robot can quickly discern the irregular dimensions of randomly placed objects.
The robot uses a technology pioneered in Microsoft's Kinect motion sensing system for its Xbox video game system.
Such robots will put automation within range of companies like Federal Express and United Parcel Service that now employ tens of thousands of workers doing such tasks.
The start-up behind the robot, Industrial Perception Inc., is the first spinoff of Willow Garage, an ambitious robotics research firm based in Menlo Park, Calif. The first customer is likely to be a company that now employs thousands of workers to load and unload its trucks. The workers can move one box every six seconds on average. But each box can weigh more than 130 pounds, so the workers tire easily and sometimes hurt their backs.
Industrial Perception will win its contract if its machine can reliably move one box every four seconds. The engineers are confident that the robot will soon do much better than that, picking up and setting down one box per second.
''We're on the cusp of completely changing manufacturing and distribution,'' said Gary Bradski, a machine-vision scientist who is a founder of Industrial Perception. ''I think it's not as singular an event, but it will ultimately have as big an impact as the Internet.''

HEADLINE: An Ode to Youth, Forever Fleeting

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
IN late May, a week after she graduated from Yale University, 22-year-old Marina Keegan headed to her family's summer cottage on Cape Cod to begin revisions of ''Independents,'' a musical whose book she had written the summer before. The plan was for her to be joined there by the show's director, lyricist and composer, but she never made it; the car in which she was riding crashed, killing her.Last weekend, ''Independents'' opened at the New York International Fringe Festival with Ms. Keegan's parents, other family members and many of her friends from Yale in attendance. No one spoke of the tragedy from the stage, but then again, there was no need to, because Ms. Keegan's collaborators, all of them contemporaries with no prior experience of losing someone their own age, have been seesawing between grief and resolve since her death. 
''We all agreed, Marina's parents included, that going ahead was a way of honoring Marina and getting her words and ideas across to more people,'' said Charlie Polinger, the director of ''Independents'' and a Yale classmate of Ms. Keegan's. ''But as the inventor of this world, she would have wanted this to be a show in its own right, not a memorial service, and that's what all of us are trying to do.''
''Independents'' is set in the current day aboard an 18th-century tall ship where a motley crew of people in their 20s have taken refuge from the pressures of beginning their adult lives. They survive economically by smuggling marijuana between Canada and the United States, but when the captain of their vessel disappears, they turn to historical re-enactments of events from the Revolutionary War to make ends meet.
In an essay, ''The Opposite of Loneliness,'' which was published just before her death and received national attention, Ms. Keegan touched on some of those same themes, in particular the pleasure of ''tiny groups that make us feel loved and safe and part of something even on our loneliest nights.'' She added: ''It's not quite love and it's not quite community; it's just this feeling that there are people, an abundance of people, who are in this together. Who are on your team.''
That puts ''Independents'' squarely in the tradition of shows that attempt to express the yearnings of an emerging generation. Obvious reference points, mentioned by Ms. Keegan's collaborators, include musicals like ''Hair'' and ''Rent'' or, more recently, ''Spring Awakening,'' a 19th-century German play that was turned into a Tony-winning Broadway musical in 2006.
An earlier play of Ms. Keegan's, ''Utility Monster,'' a meditation on charity and ethics, was given a staged reading by the Firework Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in February. The Fringe, which features 188 works and runs through Aug. 26, selected ''Independents'' for inclusion in April. The musical, which is scheduled to play on Monday, Thursday and Saturday, ''was fun and moving and very current, all of which spoke to us, plus it has a lovely score and wonderful characters,'' said Elena Holy, the festival's artistic director.
She added, ''You can have a debate about whether they are slackers or burnouts aboard that ship, but this is being done by a group of 20-somethings, and it speaks to their generation.''
Bringing any original theatrical work to the stage involves revisions, as scenes or songs are expanded, contracted or even eliminated and characters' roles modified. In the case of ''Independents'' that creates a paradox: even as Ms. Keegan's collaborators strive to honor her intentions, the changes they make in her unexpected absence result in a certain dilution of her original contribution.
''It became clear to me that her parents were going to have to face the loss of their daughter in a new and painful way, a very bizarre dramaturgical way,'' said Deborah Margolin, who was Ms. Keegan's playwriting professor at Yale and a mentor. ''Because she is not alive to complete the work, her words are not the only words in the work, and it is natural to be wondering if she would approve of this line or sentiment or idea.''
Ms. Keegan's parents said they understood that need, adding that they took solace in the maritime setting of the musical and its evocation of the period of the American Revolution, which came directly out of Ms. Keegan's own upbringing and interests. Her father, Kevin, has taught high-school and middle-school American history, and the family's longstanding ties to Cape Cod gave her access to a rich stock of nautical lore and legends.
''It's not just a coincidence that this play is set on a Revolutionary War tall ship,'' Mr. Keegan said. ''Marina was brought up around ships and sailing, has even been a sailing instructor.'' He added, ''She researched that history very carefully for this play.''
Ms. Keegan's taste is also reflected in the folk-pop score, with her collaborators citing her fondness for artists like Sufjan Stevens, Mumford & Sons, Fleet Foxes and Laura Marling. ''Form and function are connected'' in a mix of modern concerns and traditional sounds, explained Mark Sonnenblick, the lyricist.
It is always tempting to embellish the promise of those who die young, but even while she was alive, Ms. Keegan drew praise as a precocious talent. ''She would be the first person to be horrified by what she considered facile sentimentality, but I have to say that Marina combined excellence and suppleness of language with passionate commitment to social justice and the investigation of humanity, and therefore had enormous potential as a writer,'' Ms. Margolin said.
Yet there is no guarantee that she was going to pursue a career as a playwright. She also showed promise as an essayist, won praise for her poetry and showed talent as a fiction writer: she was to have spent this summer working at The New Yorker, and NPR broadcast one of her stories on ''Selected Shorts'' last year.
''I knew my daughter was talented,'' Mr. Keegan said. ''Now the world knows because of a tragedy.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Cool

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL. 
A reporter who covers the environment for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE blackouts that left hundreds of millions of Indians sweltering in the dark last month underscored the status of air-conditioning as one of the world's most vexing environmental quandaries.Fact 1: Nearly all of the world's booming cities are in the tropics and will be home to an estimated one billion new consumers by 2025. As temperatures rise, they -- and we -- will use more air-conditioning.
Fact 2: Air-conditioners draw copious electricity, and deliver a double whammy in terms of climate change, since both the electricity they use and the coolants they contain result in planet-warming emissions.
Fact 3: Scientific studies increasingly show that health and productivity rise significantly if indoor temperature is cooled in hot weather. So cooling is not just about comfort. 
Sum up these facts and it's hard to escape: Today's humans probably need air-conditioning if they want to thrive and prosper. Yet if all those new city dwellers use air-conditioning the way Americans do, life could be one stuttering series of massive blackouts, accompanied by disastrous planet-warming emissions.
We can't live with air-conditioning, but we can't live without it.
''It is true that air-conditioning made the economy happen for Singapore and is doing so for other emerging economies,'' said Pawel Wargocki, an expert on indoor air quality at the International Center for Indoor Environment and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark. ''On the other hand, it poses a huge threat to global climate and energy use. The current pace is very dangerous.''
Projections of air-conditioning use are daunting. In 2007, only 11 percent of households in Brazil and 2 percent in India had air-conditioning, compared with 87 percent in the United States, which has a more temperate climate, said Michael Sivak, a research professor in energy at the University of Michigan. ''There is huge latent demand,'' Mr. Sivak said. ''Current energy demand does not yet reflect what will happen when these countries have more money and more people can afford air-conditioning.'' He has estimated that, based on its climate and the size of the population, the cooling needs of Mumbai alone could be about a quarter of those of the entire United States, which he calls ''one scary statistic.''
It is easy to decry the problem but far harder to know what to do, especially in a warming world where people in the United States are using our existing air-conditioners more often. The number of cooling degree days -- a measure of how often cooling is needed -- was 17 percent above normal in the United States in 2010, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, leading to ''an increase in electricity demand.'' This July was the hottest ever in the United States.
Likewise, the blackouts in India were almost certainly related to the rising use of air-conditioning and cooling, experts say, even if the immediate culprit was a grid that did not properly balance supply and demand.
The late arrival of this year's monsoons, which normally put an end to India's hottest season, may have devastated the incomes of farmers who needed the rain. But it ''put smiles on the faces of those who sell white goods -- like air-conditioners and refrigerators -- because it meant lots more sales,'' said Rajendra Shende, chairman of the Terre Policy Center in Pune, India.
''Cooling is the craze in India -- everyone loves cool temperatures and getting to cool temperatures as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Shende said. He said that cooling has become such a cultural priority that rather than advertise a car's acceleration, salesmen in India now emphasize how fast its air-conditioner can cool.
Scientists are scrambling to invent more efficient air-conditioners and better coolant gases to minimize electricity use and emissions. But so far the improvements have been dwarfed by humanity's rising demands.
And recent efforts to curb the use of air-conditioning, by fiat or persuasion, have produced sobering lessons.
Since 2005, Japan had been promoting energy conservation through its annual summer ''cool biz'' campaign: air-conditioning thermostats in government offices were set to between 75 and 77 degrees and workers were told they could forsake business suits for looser, cooler clothes. So far so good.
But in the past year, the country became an unwitting laboratory to study even more extreme air-conditioning abstinence, and the results have not been encouraging. After the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami knocked out a big chunk of the country's nuclear power, the Japanese government mandated vastly reduced energy consumption. To that end, lights have been dimmed and air-conditioners turned down or off, so that offices comply with the government-prescribed indoor summer temperature of 82.4 degrees (28 Celsius); some offices have tried as high as 86.
Unfortunately, studies by Shin-ichi Tanabe, a professor of architecture at Waseda University in Tokyo who has long been interested in ''thermal comfort,'' found that while workers tolerated dimmer light just fine, every degree rise in temperature above 25 Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) resulted in a 2 percent drop in productivity. Over the course of the day that meant they accomplished 30 minutes less work, he said.
Other studies have found that with office temperatures between 82 and 86 degrees, symptoms like headache, drowsiness and difficulty concentrating increase, which may explain the drop in performance.
Worse still, perhaps, Mr. Tanabe calculated that the suffering was all for naught: When offices were kept above about 82 degrees, so many people were using inefficient fans at their desks that the total electricity consumption could be higher than if the building had been better cooled. ''That's just stupid,'' he said.
Some studies from hot and humid Singapore also show that cooler is better when it comes to office work, said Mr. Wargocki, who is currently a visiting researcher at the National University there. Though people in Singapore tend to identify a range from about 68 to 75 degrees as ''neutral'' temperature -- neither hot nor cold -- studies found that work improved if the thermostat was lowered to about 72. ''It's a huge problem if we have to cool buildings in tropical environments to that level, in terms of energy use and climate,'' Mr. Wargocki said.
And that is where the bulk of new demand will occur. A new report by the McKinsey Global Initiative predicts that one billion city dwellers ''will enter the global consuming class by 2025.'' And, for most of them, an air-conditioner will most likely be a first purchase since almost all of the cities with the highest potential cooling needs, according to Mr. Sivak's research, are in developing countries that are in hot climates. These include Chennai, India; Bangkok; Manila; Jakarta, Indonesia; Karachi, Pakistan; Lagos, Nigeria and Rio de Janeiro. Sales of air-conditioning units are already growing by double digits annually in many emerging economies.
So researchers say the best hope is that we all adjust our air-conditioning expectations and behavior.
Building managers could increase airflow in hot buildings, for example, which improves comfort. Workers could wear lighter, looser clothing to work in summer -- instead of carrying sweaters to protect themselves from over-chilled air. Architects could design office blocks using materials that did not conduct so much heat and where humans could open the windows to take advantage of natural ventilation and breezes.
Stan Cox, author of ''Losing Our Cool,'' suggests that one solution might be a return to room air-conditioning, so we only use energy to cool spaces that people are actually using. He believes that people are accustomed to working in frigid offices but could acclimatize to warmer conditions.
Mr. Wargocki says that an office temperature in the mid to high 70s should be fine. The comfortable temperature for sleeping (naked) is around 84, Mr. Tanabe says, if a fan is on.
Those suggestions are a good deal warmer than the norms in the United States, which underlines a cultural differences in cooling preferences.
''The temperature many Americans find most comfortable indoors in summer -- 70 degrees -- feels uncomfortable to most Europeans, who find it too cold,'' said Mr. Sivak, who suggested that Europe's greater environmental awareness might make people more inclined to put on an extra sweater in winter or tolerate a bit more heat in summer.
Unfortunately many tropical places -- including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong -- seem to have followed the United States' lead in cooling preferences, Mr. Tanabe said, holding cooler to be better.
But certainly if I deserve to have an air-conditioner here in New York, my counterpart in Mumbai deserves to have one, too. So individuals need to be coaxed to make new choices.
''We need to educate people there are other ways to be comfortable than just turning up the A.C., you have to use it wisely,'' said Mr. Wargocki, speaking from his condo in Singapore with the windows open late one evening to create natural drafts for cooling.
He began telling me about how the European Union was effectively forcing companies to use less cooling, by mandating that new buildings meet stricter energy-use standards. Since air-conditioning gobbles up far more electricity than heating in many office buildings, one way for architects to achieve compliance is to avoid an over-reliance on air-conditioning -- for example, building with materials that do not absorb heat or pumping in cool air from deep underground.
I was listening from my living room in New York on a steamy Sunday morning. Given the topic of our conversation, I had the air-conditioner off, and the temperature was 85 or so. I couldn't concentrate.

HEADLINE: In School District Financing, Some Parts of the Puzzle Are Difficult to Compare

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Canyon Independent School District did not set out to be one of the thriftiest in the state.The district, just outside Amarillo, spends about $6,500 in state and local money for each of its 8,700 students. That figure is one of the state's lowest, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of 2010-11 financial data from districts with an enrollment of 5,000 students or more.
Likewise, Sheldon Independent School District, in the Houston area, was not aiming for any records as a big spender when it shelled out about $9,000 for each of its 6,500 students -- though that figure makes it the district with the state's highest per-student operating costs. The statewide per-student spending average is $7,200 for districts of at least 5,000 students.
Combining the districts' spending levels with the academic performance of their students -- most of the Canyon students beat the state averages for standardized test scores and college readiness, while the opposite was true for Sheldon -- it would seem logical to label Canyon a success and Sheldon a failure. 
But there are other figures to consider. About 30 percent of Canyon's students are from low-income households, compared with about 80 percent in Sheldon. Almost 30 percent of Sheldon's students have limited proficiency in English, compared with fewer than 1 percent of Canyon's. And because of how Texas finances its public schools, in the same year Canyon received less per student from the state than Sheldon -- a difference of more than $1,000 in state money alone.
The way the state distributes money to school districts, and how much, will be center stage when a trial begins this fall involving more than half of the state's districts serving the majority of its students, along with Texas charter schools and a group of parents and business leaders asking for a more efficient system.
Because of the complexity of school finance, it's tempting to turn to per-student spending to understand how well -- or how poorly -- a district is spending its money. But the circumstances of the two districts illustrate the potential perils of that approach.
''A straight-up comparison of the dollars spent per student in District A and dollars spent per student in District B can be grossly misleading,'' said Lori L. Taylor, a government professor and education researcher at Texas A&M University who has helped the state analyze school district efficiency. Such a comparison, she said, could give people the idea that their district is ''wasting their money when it is actually enormously frugal but facing enormous challenges.'' (Texas A&M University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
When the state changed the way it financed schools in 2006, it meant that most Texas districts did not receive money based on what it cost to educate a student. Instead, the state began financing districts largely on what they raised through property taxes that year.
Intended to help districts make the transition after the Legislature reduced property taxes, the ''target revenue'' system has become permanent, though schools are also financed based on a formula that takes into account factors like regional cost-of-living expenses and a district's number of bilingual, low-income and special-education students.
But because of the same political pressures that have already landed school finance in the courts six times since the 1970s -- even before target revenue came around -- the formula is based on estimates that in many cases have not been updated in almost three decades.
Because of the pending litigation, a spokeswoman with the Texas Education Agency declined to comment on the school financing system.
Under the current system, a district like Sheldon is naturally poised to have a high cost per student. It has high property wealth because of the industry there, which includes a LyondellBasell chemical plant, so it receives more money from the state than most districts. But at the same time, it is also educating students mostly from economically disadvantaged households, which the state also takes into account when financing schools.
On the other hand, Canyon is among the bottom half of districts financed by the target revenue system. Although its students perform better than average on state tests, the district still cannot offer the smaller classes and academic intervention programs for struggling students it would like to raise its accountability ratings, said Randy McDowell, the district's assistant superintendent of business and operations.
''Our goal isn't to be the lowest-spending district in the state,'' he said. ''We are conservative, but we are really not cheap.''
Last year, the state comptroller's office released a study analyzing districts' spending compared with their academic performance, attempting to control for factors like demographics, size and regional costs. Although some education finance experts have questioned whether it adequately did that, the study does rank Canyon as more efficient than Sheldon -- but neither of them are the outliers they would be based on their per-student spending.
Cypress-Fairbanks, a district in the Houston suburbs that the study regarded as one of the state's most efficient, achieved that distinction not by design but because of a confluence of circumstances, said Stuart Snow, the district's associate superintendent of business and financial services.
The district -- the third-largest in the state, with nearly 104,000 students -- is like Canyon, among those that receive the least in target revenue financing. That happened because of various factors, Mr. Snow said, including a rapid influx of students that he said outpaced property tax values when target revenue levels were set in 2006.
Since then, the district has shaved almost $107 million from its budget to make ends meet, largely through increasing class sizes because it could not hire the staff to keep up with the annual increase in students. It also saved about $20 million in its 2011-12 budget by reducing the district's share of employees' health benefit premiums by about 25 percent.
''It's been hard, and it's been a big sacrifice,'' Mr. Snow said. ''It's hard to measure the impact of that on student learning. Our student performance hasn't suffered yet, but when you get larger classrooms, at some point in time you expect to see student performance decline.''
Meanwhile, said the Sheldon district's superintendent, Vickey M. Giles, high target revenue has allowed it to keep programs that others have had to cut after lawmakers reduced financing to public education by about $5.4 billion during the last legislative session.
''I won't apologize for the fact that I have a higher target revenue because of the population I serve,'' Dr. Giles said. While they care about their children's education, she said, parents in the district do not have the money to ''provide lots of books in their home, or give them experiences that many children from higher income homes have available to them from birth.'' That means many of Sheldon's students come to school without the same advantages that help students from other backgrounds succeed academically.
The district has joined the lawsuit challenging the state's financing system, though Dr. Giles said that the case would probably result in the district's receiving less money.
''We are all going to educate our students to the best of our ability, but is it fair that one district has $4,000 per student from the state while I have $6,700?'' she said. ''No, it's not fair.''

HEADLINE: A Literary Hero, Keeping the Last Bookshop Alive

BYLINE: By PAUL KNIGHT.

 BODY:
ARCHER CITY -- On a recent Friday afternoon, the courthouse square in this tiny North Texas ranching community was packed with sleek Mercedes-Benzes and Lexuses that occupied spots usually left empty or taken by pickups. The drivers of these cars loaded boxes of books into trunks and back seats, and trucks hauling rig equipment slowed and stopped for people rushing across the street.Several hundred visitors had descended on Archer City for a huge book auction hosted by the writer Larry McMurtry, who planned to sell 300,000 of the 450,000 books he had brought here since returning to his hometown in the late 1980s. It was an unusual scene for a place that Mr. McMurtry once described as so empty that one can feel ''like the only human creature in town.''
''Nothing has ever happened like this in Archer City. I've never seen this many people parked here,'' said Mr. McMurtry, 76, the town's most famous resident and arguably the state's most famous living author. ''I wondered whether it was wise to bring a lot of citified Northerners into the heart of the heat. The books, I think, will make it worth it.'' 
His books, a handpicked collection sold out of four stores he named Booked Up, have defined Archer City for decades. In the early years, Mr. McMurtry dreamed of creating a book town, not unlike Hay-on-Wye, a Welsh village on the English border that started with one store and eventually attracted dozens of booksellers and shops.
He took out ads in bibliophile magazines that read: ''Miraculous birth! Visit the newly born book town of Archer City, Texas, and help the endless migration of good books continue.'' A shuttered hotel was renovated and reopened, and the town's original hospital was turned into a bed-and-breakfast, to accommodate the carloads of book buyers and the McMurtry fans who made the long drive to Archer City.
For those outsiders, the attraction was almost mythic. Brandon Kennedy, who works in the modern and contemporary art department at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, has traveled to Mr. McMurtry's bookstores repeatedly during the last 13 years.
''Driving from a metro area, you witness the city and suburbs going away, and then your mental state starts to echo the landscape and you get a clear head to approach what's around you,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''That's what was so great about having these bookstores in town.''
But an influx of booksellers never occurred. Only one other bookshop opened here, and now it is gone. The hotel and the bed-and-breakfast are on the market.
The Last Book Sale, as Mr. McMurtry billed the auction, a nod to his 1966 novel, ''The Last Picture Show,'' appeared to signify the end of his book town experiment. He described the three-day event as the ''sensible'' thing to do for a bookseller near the end of his life with no heirs interested in running bookstores.
''It's bittersweet,'' said Faye Kesey, the writer Ken Kesey's widow, who married Mr. McMurtry last year. ''It's like anything at the end of life -- kind of like leaving your family behind.''
The sale also leaves Archer City, population 1,834, at a crossroad. ''We're like a lot of small towns struggling, and the only way to hold water is to get outside people coming in,'' said Rick Jones, a city councilman. For years, even as Mr. McMurtry's dream for a book town fizzled, his stores kept book buyers coming to Archer City, bringing a valuable infusion of tourist dollars.
''Every little bit helps,'' said Cliff Byrd, 71, who has lived here his whole life. ''The oil business is gone, most of the wells have dried up. The ranching business is gone. A few ranchers are handing down land through families, but they don't contribute a lot to the economy. They used to buy vehicles, but there's no longer a dealership here. I see no new business.''
Matt McLemore, Mr. McMurtry's nephew, who was raised in Archer City and now sells ranch land out of an office on the courthouse square, added, ''The bookstores brought culture that we wouldn't have had here.''
For Mr. Kennedy, the auction signifies a palpable loss. ''I found myself not wanting to think about the stores that'll be gone, because you won't have a chance to revisit them,'' he said. ''It's like limbs being cut off from the body.''
The redemption for Mr. McMurtry, and perhaps for the town, is his decision to keep Booked Up No. 1 open indefinitely. During the auction, Mr. McMurtry, who made roughly $200,000 from the sale, mostly stayed away from the bidding area. He spent his time at the store that will remain, sitting in a chair and talking to the book buyers who came to see him.
By winter, after the books are shipped to their new owners, the other three stores will sit vacant. But Mr. McMurtry says the town will survive in a different form.
''It's got some pretty good antique stores now,'' he said. ''I think it will become an antique town.''

 BODY:
THE GENERALCharles de Gaulle and the France He Saved
By Jonathan FenbyIllustrated. 707 pp. Skyhorse Publishing/A Herman Graf Book. $32.95.
Dare I call a 707-page biography a page turner? For once, the fake enthusiasm of blurb prose rings true. I did ''finish the book in one sitting,'' as another chestnut has it, though the sitting was a very long flight of 16 hours. And why? Because Jonathan Fenby, a former editor of The Observer of London and a prolific author, knows how to turn breadth and depth into enthrallment. Academic historians tend to shy away from the grand sweep, while journalists like to stick to the chatty and topical. Fenby has blended the best of both crafts -- the historian's gravitas, the journalist's feel for drama -- into a magnificent book that will rank alongside a classic like Jean Lacouture's multivolume biography of Charles de Gaulle. 
Fenby actually gives us two books, masterfully intertwined, for the price of one. ''The General'' isn't just the story of a 20th-century giant who captivated the public's imagination even while he was still alive. It also traces the course of a great nation that refused to come to terms with the loss of the strategic pre-eminence it had once enjoyed. This is history with an almost literary flavor. Think of Booth Tarkington's ''Magnificent Ambersons,'' which charts the waning fortunes of an aristocratic family in 19th-century America, and more particularly think of the movie that was made of it. Fenby hasn't written a novel, but one can imagine how Orson Welles might have turned ''The General'' into a movie classic. Hollywood, take note.
Le Grand Charles looms so large because his nation kept shrinking. Humiliated by Prussia-Germany in 1871, France was barely saved by America's intervention in World War I. Succumbing to the fatigue of the 1920s and 1930s, France was done in for good by Nazi power in 1940. The shame of collaboration followed, but rebirth after D-Day was not to be. Instead, the end of the war signaled the death of an empire, from Indochina to Algeria, and the relentless decay of the Fourth Republic while the world became English with an American accent. Enter Charles de Gaulle, a man from the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow, as his admirer André Malraux put it. A comrade from de Gaulle's early army days recalled: ''He stood out not so much because of his size but because of his ego, which glowed from afar.''
At 6-foot-3, naturally he could see farther than his contemporaries. As France hunkered down behind the Maginot Line after World War I, de Gaulle preached the armored offense Hitler's panzer armies would use with devastating efficiency. When Nazi Germany rearmed, de Gaulle railed against appeasement as an ''irreparable disaster.'' He told his family: ''We have capitulated without fighting.'' It was all in vain.
This is the stuff from which tragedy is made. When Hitler subdued France in a matter of weeks, de Gaulle escaped to London. ''It was for me,'' he wrote while Vichy France half resisted, half embraced Hitler, ''to take the country's fate upon myself.'' He and who else? De Gaulle's war years in London read like ''Don Quixote Doing Achilles at the Court of St. James's.''
Hitler was the enemy across the Channel, Churchill the enemy next door. He (and Franklin Roosevelt) barely suffered the general's antics. ''The P.M. is sick to death of him,'' a minion wrote. Even the Free French headquarters, another Churchill aide noted, were ''getting nearly as tired as we are of their chief's ungovernable temper and lack of balanced judgment.'' Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, politely asked him: ''Do you know that, of all the European allies, you have caused us the most difficulties?'' De Gaulle smiled: ''I don't doubt that. France is a great power.''
France was not. De Gaulle perfectly embodied an economy-class power that insisted on flying first class. With Germany's defeat in sight, the general triumphantly returned to Paris (Roosevelt and Churchill let his troops march at the head of the parade), but soon both the man and the country were found wanting. De Gaulle, who probably never heard of the deadly sin of pride, would either rule or retire. After only a few days as head of the government he huffed ''I've had enough,'' and not long after he abruptly resigned. For him, none of the demeaning wheeling and dealing with those little men in the legislature. So it was off to Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, where he would hole up for the next 12 years.
While de Gaulle sulked, his country sank, going through about two dozen governments with an average life span of six months. France lost Indochina, Suez and l'Algérie française and was obliged to watch as the heirs of Prussia-Germany regained economic primacy and rose to become America's ''continental sword.'' By 1958, on the cusp of civil war over Algeria, the Fourth Republic was ready to collapse, and it did -- right into the hands of Le Grand Charles. ''Great circumstances bring forth great men,'' he declared. ''Only during crises do nations throw up giants.''
De Gaulle reigned over the Fifth Republic for the next 11 years -- a latter-day Sun King forced to suffer the ornery ways of democratic politics. The ''man from the day before yesterday'' remained stuck in the 19th century, his consuming passion being the chessboard of realpolitik. Alternately, he would court and confront ''les Anglo-Saxons,'' the West Germans, the Soviets and the Chinese. It was power politics without war, and its name was ''leverage'' -- either by collaring new allies (like West Germany) or betraying old ones (like Israel). As his various grands desseins faltered, de Gaulle fell back on a classic from his days in London: maximizing his nuisance value. Bribe me, or else! His ''readiness to go to the brink,'' Fenby writes, ''created an exaggerated impression of power,'' a power France did not have, never mind the atom bomb acquired in 1960. So the United States finally called his bluff. Dean Rusk, John Kennedy's secretary of state, said: ''We learned to proceed without him.''
And so did his people. Les événements of May 1968, the mightiest student revolt in the West, brought up to 10 million students and workers into the streets. In the midst of the revolution, de Gaulle's prime minister, Georges Pompidou, declared: ''The General doesn't exist anymore; de Gaulle is dead.'' Not quite.
The last few chapters read like a thriller with footnotes. De Gaulle escaped back to Colombey, then to French Army headquarters in Germany to plead for the support of the military. Meanwhile, the faithful rallied in Paris, and the general returned, winning a huge majority in the parliamentary elections of June 1968. But he was the nation's savior no more, as he had been in 1940 and 1958. When he called a referendum on his reforms -- actually, on himself -- he lost, and resigned on the same day. In November 1970, just short of his 80th birthday, he died in Colombey.
Fenby has written a story that is learned, incisive and gripping -- an intellectual pleasure as well as a French window, so to speak, on Europe's demise and rebirth. The dramatis personae are Churchill, America's presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson, Konrad Adenauer and, of course, de Gaulle, the outré hero, who could have sprung from the imagination of Homer or Cervantes. There is no more fitting epitaph than Fenby's last sentence: ''The world would not see his like again.''

DAYS OF DESTRUCTION, DAYS OF REVOLTBy Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco
Illustrated. 302 pp. Nation Books. $28.
This book is a collaboration between Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco, showing us daily life in four centers of 21st-century American poverty. Hedges' contribution -- a combination of reportage and commentary -- is in a long tradition of literary journalism. Sacco's is the sort of graphic art popularized by Art Spiegelman in ''Maus.'' Both writers have decades of experience as correspondents in war zones, but in ''Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt'' they turn their attention to the bombed-out and collapsed areas of their own country.
Sacco's sections are uniformly brilliant. The tone is controlled, the writing smart, the narration neutral; we are allowed to draw our own conclusions. Hedges sees this book as a call to revolution, and as with most works in which the author's philosophical and political beliefs are aired in an unfiltered manner, a lot of what you appreciate about Hedges' writing will depend on how closely you identify with his politics. 
From my point of view -- and perhaps I could be accused of not being political enough -- this is unfortunate. This is an important book. But it is at its best when simply presenting the facts.
Anyone who grew up near a postindustrial area -- who has seen a middle-class town become a pocket of destitution -- will not find any one chapter in this book too shocking. What is shocking is the degree to which this depth of poverty is found everywhere, from rural Indian reservations to near-slave conditions in Florida tomato fields. These are not pleasant stories. They are the very sort of thing we all prefer to forget so that we can focus on our daily lives, and this makes it all the more important that they are recorded.
The first chapter opens with a sketch of life on the Pine Ridge Lakota reservation in South Dakota. As it follows the lives of various people on the reservation, weaving between history and personal narration, we see the rise of the American Indian Movement (AIM), its eventual collapse and how people today have learned to live with the consequences.
Hedges' rage here is palpable, as is his sympathy with his subjects, and occasionally the tone gets a little strident. But as the book continues, the polemics fade. The second chapter brings us into Camden, N.J., telling the story of its decline and abandonment by the powers that be; the third chapter does the same for West Virginia, focusing on coal mining's economic, social and environmental effects. The fourth chapter, which covers human slavery in the Florida tomato fields, is the most shocking.
The book's final chapter takes place in New York City, at the center of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Hedges believes this was a turning point in American history, and there is an insider feel, something almost Woodstockian in the tone. Hedges' take is that the seeds of a revolution were sown in Zuccotti Park, but those who saw the events from the outside might be more reminded of the protests against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
By the end of this book, I found myself preferring Sacco. Maybe even more so than in his other work, he allows characters and situations to speak for themselves. If you are a close reader, his point of view is clear, but it is controlled in such a way that you are allowed to disagree with him.
Hedges is a serious writer and thinker, and as in his seminal work, ''War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning,'' he is brilliant at depicting human life at the extremes of existence -- from war to grinding poverty -- and explaining the effects on the human psyche. But if in that book he was more like a teacher, in this one he is high priest. We're given little room to form our own opinions. ''There are no excuses left,'' he says in the final chapter. ''Either you join the revolt or you stand on the wrong side of history.''
How you react to being ordered to join the revolt will determine a lot of what you think about this book. If you're a believer, it will all be fuel for the fire, but the people who would learn the most from these stories will very likely have trouble getting past the first pages. I couldn't help wondering about conservative friends of mine, their children and other folks who might have read this book if the tone had been less strident. But maybe that is the problem with all calls to revolution: You hear them only if you want to.

HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?Money and the Good Life
By Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky243 pp. Other Press. $24.95.
Robert Skidelsky is a historian best known for his definitive three-volume biography of John Maynard Keynes; his son Edward Skidelsky is a philosopher. They have collaborated on a book arguing that people in wealthy countries like Britain and the United States work too hard and by doing so miss out on the ''good life'' -- an ethical concept of a life as ''worthy of desire, not just one that is widely desired.'' 
The inspiration for ''How Much Is Enough?'' is -- unsurprisingly, given the father's preoccupation -- an essay by Keynes. It is called ''Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren'' and was published in 1930. Since it is by Keynes, it is ingenious and brilliantly written. It is also dated and unconvincing. It predicted that barring another world war or some comparable tragedy, a century hence per capita income would be four to eight times as much because of continued capital investment. So far, so good; despite another world war, G.D.P. per capita in the United States has increased almost sixfold since 1930 (and about the same in Britain), and we still have 18 years to go before the century is up. Keynes thought the increase in per capita production would lead to a sharp fall in the hours of work; by 2030 a person would have to work only 15 hours a week to maintain his standard of living. The ''economic problem'' would have been solved, and the challenge would be to fill up people's leisure time with rewarding leisure activities. This part of Keynes's paper is wide of the mark. People in wealthy countries like the United States and Britain are working fewer hours per week on average than in 1929, before the Great Depression reduced the amount of available work: roughly 40 rather than 50. But Keynes thought that by 2010 the average would be 20.
His essay is very English, because the traditional aspiration of the English upper class was not to work at all. Keynes, middle- rather than upper-class, worked hard all his life, but he was highly cultivated, a member of the Bloomsbury set, a balletomane, an admirer of the ''good life'' in a distinctively English sense unrelated to material comfort.
In recent years, England has become much more like the United States, but I well remember as recently as the 1980s how shabby England was, how terrible the plumbing, how shoddy the housing materials, how treacherously uneven the floors and sidewalks, how inadequate the heating and poor the food -- and how tolerant the English were of discomfort. I recall breakfast at Hertford College, Oxford, in an imposing hall with a large broken window -- apparently broken for some time -- and the dons huddled sheeplike in overcoats; and in a freezing, squalid bar in the basement of the college a don in an overcoat expressing relief at being home after a year teaching in Virginia, which he had found terrifying because of America's high crime rate, though he had not been touched by it. I remember being a guest of Brasenose College -- Oxford's wealthiest -- and being envied because I had been invited to stay in the master's guest quarters, only to find that stepping into the guest quarters was like stepping into a Surrealist painting, because the floor sloped in one direction and the two narrow beds in two other directions. I recall the English (now American) economist Ronald Coase telling me that until he visited the United States he did not know it was possible to be warm.
The Skidelskys are correct that because goods and services can be produced with much less labor than in 1930, we could live now as we did then while working many fewer hours. We want to live better than that. And what would we do with our newfound leisure? Most people would quickly get bored without the resources for varied and exciting leisure activities like foreign travel, movies and television, casinos, restaurants, watching sporting events, engaging in challenging athletic activities, playing video games, eating out, dieting, having cosmetic surgery, and improving health and longevity. But with everyone working just 20 hours a week (on the way down to 15 in 2030), few of these opportunities would materialize, because people who worked so little would be unable to afford them. Nor could leisure-activity services be staffed adequately. The implications would be social as well as individual. Productivity would fall because workers would acquire skills at a slower rate. Nations would be defenseless, with soldiers who were on duty only 20 hours a week and had few weapons because the employees of munitions makers were also working only 20 hours a week. And imagine the maintenance of internal order in a society in which police officers, firefighters and paramedics worked only 20 hours a week.
The Skidelskys have an exalted conception of leisure. They say that the true sense of the word is ''activity without extrinsic end'': ''The sculptor engrossed in cutting marble, the teacher intent on imparting a difficult idea, the musician struggling with a score, a scientist exploring the mysteries of space and time -- such people have no other aim than to do what they are doing well.'' That isn't true. Most of these people are ambitious achievers who seek recognition. And it is ridiculous to think that if people worked just 15 or 20 hours a week, they would use their leisure to cut marble or struggle with a musical score. If they lacked consumer products and services to fill up their time they would brawl, steal, overeat, drink and sleep late. English aristocrats in their heyday didn't work, but neither did they cut marble or explore the mysteries of space and time. Hunting, gambling and seduction were their preferred leisure activities.
Americans value leisure, but it is expensive leisure, and so they have to work hard in order to pay for it. As a result they have less leisure time than if their preferred form of leisure were lying in a hammock, but on balance they obtain more pleasure.
The authors offer suggestions for how to change the balance between work and leisure. First, everyone should receive either a wage from the government (with no obligation to work to earn it) generous enough to enable him to work only part time, or a capital endowment at birth; the risk of people squandering their endowment in ''riotous living can be reduced by limiting their spending to approved objects (such as education)''; in addition, the schools would educate people for leisure. Second, they recommend imposing a progressive consumption tax, to make consumer products more costly in the hope of discouraging people from working hard to be able to afford them (it could of course make them work even harder). Third, firms should be forbidden to deduct advertising expenditures from taxable income, since advertising encourages consumption.
But here is the oddest thing about the book: There is virtually no discussion of how people, their incomes halved, might be expected to employ the vastly greater leisure that the authors want them to have. Besides the sentence I quoted about the musician, sculptor, teacher and scientist -- and the description is of their work, not of their leisure activities -- there is a suggestion that a good leisure activity is letting one's mind wander ''freely and aimlessly,'' and a list of three recreations -- ''playing football in the park, making and decorating one's own furniture, strumming the guitar with friends'' -- offered to refute any contention that the authors' conception of leisure is ''narrowly highbrow.''
If you ask someone to work half as long for half the pay, you should have better answers to his question: What shall I do with my new leisure?

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Legacy of the Baby Boom Generation

 BODY:
Readers debate whether the bashing of boomers as selfish and spoiled is justified.The Letter
To the Editor:
Has hating baby boomers become our last acceptable prejudice?
In a recent column, Bill Keller labeled boomers ''an entitled bunch'' and called for cuts in their retirement benefits, as if that were their penance. It's time to put this tired narrative to rest.
In the early 1980s, before most boomers started raising families, they were called too selfish to have children. Then, when boomers turned out to be pretty good and selfless parents, they were accused of getting too involved in their kids' lives.
Boomers have been accused of creating cultural chaos through moral relativism. Then, when boomers came of age and declared bigotry of any kind immoral, they were accused of being too politically correct. 
Today only boomers get tarred as acquisitive and self-absorbed, yet for years their parents were derided for ''keeping up with the Joneses'' and their grandparents for ''conspicuous consumption.''
When the World War II generation was about to retire, no one blamed them for the Vietnam War, their discrimination against blacks, women and gays, or their pollution of our waterways and air.
Certainly the World War II generation deserves enormous credit for defending us from the greatest threat to freedom ever known to humankind. But that's the point: Generations are complex. They do outstanding but also not so good things, and they should not be reduced to cartoon characters.
Baby boomers have ushered in the most tolerant and inclusive era in our history. What women can do today would have been considered science fiction in the Fifties. Gays and lesbians who once were routinely arrested or committed to psychiatric institutions can now marry and raise a family in many parts of the country. We now have an African-American president.
What deserves scorn are not boomers but a national discussion that traffics in bumper stickers and drive-by stereotypes.
LEONARD STEINHORN Washington, Aug. 13, 2012
The writer is the author of ''The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby Boom Legacy'' and a professor of communication at American University.
Readers React
Finally! An all-out vindication of the boomers. Technically I'm a year ahead, but emotionally and psychologically I'm all boomer. Thus, I've have been annoyed at the slings and arrows that have flown in our direction. Child-raising? Health? Education? The budget? Any war, any wrong, it's our fault.
Why are we such easy targets? Because, I think, we took such joy in what we did. We had the audacity to live in a meaningful time and have fun doing it. We had the best soundtrack to our lives and great movies like ''The Godfather'' and ''Chinatown.'' Faced with the wrenching spectacle of Vietnam, civil rights and feminist issues, we demonstrated or became active in politics.
Since the Reagan years, meaning in a national sense has been about making money and getting what's yours. The Gen Xers know on some level how hollow this is, how constricting the ideology of selfishness is. They also see photos of us romping, singing, flashing the peace sign, always exuberant, sometimes stoned, always laughing.
That's what is missing from our lives in these depressing times when the fight has been crafted so that someone else is always to blame.
JANE SHOSTEN Rochester, Aug. 15, 2012
At the risk of sounding entitled myself, I find it frustrating that this conversation is mainly focused on the baby boomers, and does not really consider the other generations involved in this situation, like us, the children of the baby boomers.
This conversation is not really about whether the boomer generation turned out all right. Many in my generation idolize the social change the boomers brought about. Rather, the issue is the huge financial burden on our nation, and how it will be shared between the boomer generation and my own.
Many of the political and economic decisions that have gotten our nation into our current situation were made in the past 30 or so years, when boomers were the major voting bloc. America should have prepared for today: saving for the time when that large bloc of people switched from being taxpayers to entitlement recipients.
Instead, America chose to cut taxes and not cut government spending, including starting several wars but not paying for them. To be fair, our parents used their extra money to provide my generation with a more comfortable childhood, and for that we are grateful. But we are reaping the financial consequences of their decisions.
What's the solution?
I'm not exactly sure. It doesn't feel fair to suddenly tell retirees that the benefits they had planned on will be cut. But it also doesn't feel very fair to ask my generation to pay more taxes and receive fewer benefits because the boomer generation didn't take the responsibility to pay enough taxes to finance the government it wanted.
ADRIAN BRUSH Austin, Tex., Aug. 15, 2012
The critic Edmund Wilson once remarked of Hemingway's ''A Farewell to Arms'' that the force of disillusionment derives from the strength of the original hope and belief. That appears to be precisely what has happened to the baby boomers.
The generation that was told it was our best and brightest now finds itself crossing the retirement age of 65 crippled by the largest loss in household wealth in our nation's history. Projections now show that most boomers will be almost entirely dependent on their Social Security income after they stop working -- if they can afford to do so. To call them to the docket of selfishness at this time seems uncharitable at best.
LANDON Y. JONES Princeton, N.J., Aug. 16, 2012
The writer is the author of ''Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation,'' which coined the phrase ''baby boomers.''
I often wonder who are these people who love to criticize us baby boomers. As far as I can determine, once you strip away their silly slogans and stereotypes, they are simply still mad that they missed Woodstock. Many also resent the sexual freedom we enjoyed as a result of birth control. Others resent the opportunities we had to attend college and travel the world. Seems their criticisms always say more about what they feel they missed than about what we actually had.
I for one am very proud of the accomplishments of my generation, be it greater racial tolerance, gay liberation, protecting the environment, empowering women or opposing unjust wars. These, however, did not come easily. We worked long and hard to challenge official secrets and repressive power structures, and to create more just institutions and inclusive communities. These efforts also required real sacrifice and courage -- maybe not the beaches of Normandy but the battles of Selma, Stonewall and Kent State, to name but a few.
One lasting boomer legacy will always be our music. I believe that historians will look back and say this generation possessed extraordinary musical talent and inspiration. As I routinely tell my Gen Y children, ''This is the first time in history that the parents are cooler than the kids!''
NANCY LOVING Pittsburgh, Aug. 15, 2012
Mr. Steinhorn is quite correct in asserting that generations are complex. To lay responsibility for the problems (or, for that matter, the positive aspects) of the present is not only unfair but also lazy. Still, the social significance of the baby boomers cannot be denied. Even if the boomers had not championed rights and equality for women, racial minorities and gays, they would have still had an outsized impact on our country, not for any conscious reason, but because of their sheer numbers.
The proverbial ''pig in the python'' at every stage of their life cycle, the baby boomers have demanded immense amounts of effort and resources from the rest of society. The number of elementary schools constructed in the '50s and '60s and the expansion of colleges and universities in the '70s was no accident. And the coming strain on social services for the elderly will not be either.
Most baby boomers are probably no more selfish than other people, but given the ''tyranny of demography,'' that might not matter for either the perceptions or the reality of the generation as a whole.
JAMES THAJUDEEN Brooklyn, Aug. 15, 2012
Mr. Steinhorn pats the boomers on the back for gay rights and an African-American president. However, both of those outcomes were the result of Generation X and later generations entering the electorate and wrenching loose the boomers' own grip on the status quo.
Mr. Steinhorn completely ignores some of the boomers' worst collective feats in recent years: cuts in funding for public education, the dismantling of the social safety net for all but boomer-aged citizens and the economic polarization of haves and have-nots.
While the boomers were given by their parents a free, quality public education and an assured retirement, their children and grandchildren are left with far less -- all because boomers don't want to pay the taxes that all previous generations paid.
The sense of civic duty has been completely lost on them.
DAVID RAMBERG Cambridge, Mass., Aug. 15, 2012
Thank you, Mr. Steinhorn, for standing up for the boomers. We seem to be the scapegoat of choice lately. We've been referred to as the ''grasshopper generation,'' consuming everything in our path with no regard for anyone else.
The economic power of boomer working men and women has been financing Social Security and Medicare during our earning years, and now that it's our turn to retire, we're told we don't deserve what we've provided for others. I have no doubt that boomers will redefine retirement, just as we changed the landscape for working families with day care centers, maternity leave and other family-centric solutions that today's working families depend on.
It would be nice to accomplish other necessary changes without the unfounded yammering and criticism from those who now take these changes for granted. Grasshoppers? Hardly.
S. WHEELER Sturgis, Mich., Aug. 15, 2012
As a 32-year-old liberal gay man, I certainly applaud the victories of the boomer generation as pertains to equal rights for all citizens. Ditto, the increased awareness of environmental responsibility we all share.
But I cannot help but point out the failures of the boomer generation that affect mine -- eagerly and blindly supporting economic policies like ''trickle down'' and the deregulation of the financial industry, which have severely damaged my opportunities as I begin to build my adult life.
Or the support of vacuous political candidates because of their telegenic qualities, earthiness or beer-sharing abilities -- despite their impulsive lust for war, derision of intellectualism and disregard for scientific fact.
But boomers can take heart that criticisms will inevitably be focused on my generation as well.
DOMINIC QUINTANA Astoria, Queens, Aug. 16, 2012
As a member of the so-called Greatest Generation, I admit sadly that, aside from those who made tremendous sacrifices and should never be forgotten, we weren't all noble in the postwar period and shouldn't coast on sacrifices of the brave in war and peace. The same can be said of all succeeding generations. For the future, we can only hope that the noble outnumber most of us and that we all, at least, have moments of which we can be proud.
JEAN V. CULLEN New York, Aug. 15, 2012
Thank you for publishing Mr. Steinhorn's response to Bill Keller's criticism of boomers for having the nerve to age and retire. I'd venture a guess that our generation -- yes, I'm a boomer -- has paid more into the Social Security system than the superbly marketed Greatest Generation.
All of the usual criticisms of the boomers raise an obvious question: If the members of the Greatest Generation were so great, how did they mess up so badly in raising their children?
It's time for a truce.
RICHARD STRANZL Graton, Calif., Aug. 15, 2012
The Writer Responds
When the one president who strongly self-identified as a boomer, Bill Clinton, left us with a surplus, no one praised boomers for selflessness, and indeed the anti-boomer sentiment never abated. So it is disingenuous to pin the bad policies of recent years on boomers.
The question is why so many so reflexively bash boomers.
Ms. Shosten and Ms. Loving suggest that those younger harbor jealousy toward a boomer generation that united against war and inequality and whose soundtrack joyously challenged the status quo. Ms. Wheeler observes that boomer accomplishments are taken for granted.
At bottom is the fact that boomers have profoundly changed America. Boomers said no to an America where women were confined at home, blacks were warned about getting ''uppity,'' and those who marched to a different drummer, prayed to a different deity or challenged hierarchy and environmental degradation were told to conform or stay silent.
Those most virulent against boomers have been conservatives who continue to resist a boomer America that encodes diversity as a moral value. If they can trivialize boomers as arrogant and selfish, they can trivialize boomer accomplishments, feminism for example, as arrogant and selfish as well.
Even The New York Times has indulged in its own drive-by stereotypes, labeling boomers ''the solipsistic generation'' in one news article and headlining another ''Boomers Hit New Self-Absorption Milestone: Age 65,'' showing how rooted the meme of spoiled, entitled boomers has become.
Those complicit with this boomer stereotype -- even those well intended -- contribute to a cynicism that undermines the progress we still have to make.

HEADLINE: Swept Off Her Feet

BYLINE: By DAPHNE MERKIN

 BODY:
When is a shoe not just a shoe? Why, when it's a love object, a fetish or an alternate dream of self, of course. Shoes, like handbags, have grown in cultural stature over the last few decades, sending out coded and not so coded messages about the women who wear them: I am sexy, chic, kooky; I can walk without falling down in four-inch heels; I can afford to spend gobs of money on elusive brands and esoteric leathers. Manhattan department stores have, in the last few years, enlarged their shoe departments, in recognition of their allure and "recession-proof" sales potential, in many cases taking away space from what was once the main event - the clothes themselves.A reigning case in point is the second-floor Shoe Salon at Bergdorf Goodman, which in September 2011, in advance of the store's 111th anniversary celebration this fall, opened a renovated and expanded department. "Women will cut back on vacations and entertaining," says Linda Fargo, the Bergdorf senior vice president who oversaw the expansion. 
"We won't cut back on shoes." The sumptuous space mixes vintage furniture and commissioned pieces, and exotic materials like shagreen, faux parchment and macassar ebony, with leopard-print carpeting and a domed gold-leaf ceiling. It has five connecting rooms, with sections for couture designers like Chanel, Lanvin and Manolo Blahnik (about half of the Blahnik collection is exclusive to Bergdorf); "modernist" brands like Dries Van Noten and Chloé; and edgier ones like Azzedine Alaïa and Jimmy Choo. "The choices within the brands skew toward the feminine," Fargo notes decisively. "We won't embrace ugly chic."
On a Friday afternoon in early May I made my way to the Shoe Salon, which I have frequented on and off over the years, albeit less so since the heels and prices have escalated. The place was humming with females on the hunt. In one corner a slim young Asian woman was trying on a pair of statement-making Giuseppe Zanotti sandals in fuchsia suede, taking a few tottering steps forward like someone who had just learned to walk. A salesman assured her there were only a few pairs left, although it was hard to imagine who else might have sprung for this particular model, equipped as they were with six-and-a-half-inch heels. (I measured them, just to check, with a wooden ruler provided by a passing saleswoman.) I ventured to ask whether the sandals were wearable and the young woman answered: "Not so much, it's a little like walking on stilts." She was still stumbling around when I left two hours later, which helped convey the impression that high heels rule the seas. I had been assured, however, that a heavy analysis of heel heights goes on behind the scenes. "It's about the perfect midheel," says Eloise Taussig, who oversees shoe buying at Bergdorf, "one that's both fashion forward and elongates the leg, and in which the customer can walk comfortably."
I decided to settle myself in the couture section to watch the action. Janet Bortz from northern New Jersey, who was staying at a hotel for her wedding anniversary, had wandered in with her husband. She explained that she usually shops at Saks or Barneys but that she likes looking at the Bergdorf selection: "It's got personality. I thought it would be a lot more Ferragamo-ish." Across the way, a saleswoman advised a Japanese customer, with her daughter translating, not to wear her round-toe Louboutin pumps more than two hours for the first few times or her toes would swell up.
Nearby a saleswoman named Lori Zodikoff, an energetic former equities trader, talked aloud to herself. "Let's see if we can neaten this up," she said about a display of Manolos. One of a mostly male sales force of 35, Zodikoff, like many of the staff, goes beyond the call of duty for her regular customers, taking their shoes to be fixed or personally dropping them off to save on the messenger fee. She has clients from across the country who e-mail or text her with images of shoes that have caught their fancy. (Bergdorf gives iPhones to all its sales representatives.) She said that one woman's boyfriend advised her to buy two of each shoe, one pair for each of her houses: "What are you schlepping it back and forth for?"
I overheard a young woman with a blond ponytail say to her two friends, "Just appreciate this for a second," holding up a pair of Tom Ford black satin sandals with four-inch crystal-encrusted heels. I went over to admire the shoes for myself and discreetly looked at the price tag: $1,180. Then again, one might argue that those prone to sticker shock would do well to take their business elsewhere. "Inflation," declared Tony Amato, one of the top-grossing salesmen in the department, "isn't in the Bergdorf Goodman dictionary." A courtly and impeccably dressed Naples-born connoisseur of women and their footwear, Amato fondly reflected that his customers "don't spend time in the kitchen - they spend time in Bergdorf." Some collect shoes, buying them not to wear but to put on display. He also has local customers who come in twice a week - "like going to the grocery store" - and that there has never been a day that he hasn't sold a shoe. (The most he has sold in one day is 60 pairs.)
I returned to the salon for a second visit in early July to find its famous summer sale in full swing. The sale had been going on since 9 a.m. on May 30; the store normally opens at 10 but sends out a midnight e-mail alerting customers to the earlier opening, for which a line forms around the block. Some of the 40 racks of sale shoes in sizes 5 to 12 had been whittled down to make room for prefall arrivals, but there was still enough on offer - including a yellow and red patent-leather Prada sandal with a back like a winged chariot that originally went for $1,300 - to entice the bargain-savvy.
In the couture area, where the shoes are full-priced, Shira Westreich was shopping for mother-of-the-bride shoes for herself as well as bridal shoes for her two daughters and a daughter-in-law. It had been a six-month search for the bride's shoes, and although Westreich objected to the prices - "they're forcing you to buy $1,000 shoes, you don't have a choice, we're doing it and we're insane" - she also explained that Bergdorf has the widest selection. "I'm goal-oriented. I know I'll find it here." She ended up choosing an ivory satin-and-lace Valentino pump with what she described as a "moderate platform" (with a four-inch heel) for the daughter who's getting married. To my eye, the shoe looked hazardous, especially for such a high-stakes occasion, but I could see that it was a thing of beauty to behold, an aspirational prop worthy of the theater of fashion. Which is the point, after all, isn't it?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tougher Crash Test Brings Lower Scores

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
NEW models typically receive the top rating -- Good -- in front offset crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. So the institute raised eyebrows throughout the auto industry last week when it released results of a new type of frontal test in which only two of the 11 tested cars received the highest score.All 11 cars, which fall into the ''entry luxury'' market class, had received the top rating in previous frontal crash tests, which spread the impact of a 40 mile per hour crash over 40 percent of the car's front end, on the driver's side. The institute, which is financed by the insurance industry, will continue to use that 40 percent test, which it is now calling the ''moderate overlap'' frontal test.
The new ''small overlap'' frontal test is designed to replicate what happens when a car's front corner collides with another vehicle or with a stationary object like a tree or utility pole. The new test spreads the 40 m.p.h. impact over a smaller area, about 25 percent of a car's front end, also on the driver's side. 
That front-corner hit missed the main crush zone structures in most of the cars. These structures help to manage crash energy and reduce the impact on the passenger compartment.
The two sedans that received Good ratings in the new test were the Acura TL and Volvo S60. One model, the Infiniti G, was rated Acceptable.
Four cars received Marginal ratings: the Acura TSX, BMW 3 Series, Lincoln MKZ and Volkswagen CC. And four received the lowest rating of Poor: the Audi A4, Lexus ES 350, Lexus IS 250/
350 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
In what the institute called a first, the door of the VW CC was sheared off its hinges, raising the possibility that an occupant could be partly or completely ejected.
The institute's new small-offset test is unlike any that it, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has conducted before, although the federal safety administration has been considering such a test.
''We don't do this just to make it harder,'' said Adrian Lund, president of the insurance institute. ''We do it because people are still dying in crashes.''
He said the new test was an effort to answer this question: Why are some 10,000 people still dying each year in frontal crashes, despite the installation of air bags, widespread use of safety belts and high scores for most new cars in previous front-crash tests?
A 2009 institute study of newer vehicles that performed well in front crash tests found that small-overlap-type crashes accounted for 20 to 25 percent of fatalities, with similar findings for serious injuries.
Mr. Lund said that the main crush-zone structures are generally found in the middle 50 percent of the car -- an area struck in the previous frontal crash tests. But those structures do not typically extend to the car's outer edges, which means that in a small-offset crash a wheel can be forced back into the footwell, resulting in serious, debilitating leg and foot injuries.
The Volvo S60 had only a few inches of intrusion, the institute reported, because its reinforced upper rails and a steel cross member below the instrument panel helped to keep the car's ''safety cage'' intact. Since the late 1980s, Volvo has been performing its own small-overlap tests while developing new vehicles.
The Lexus IS suffered 10 times more intrusion, trapping the dummy's left foot and wedging the right foot beneath the brake pedal. In the Mercedes C-Class, the dummy's right foot was wedged beneath the brake pedal as the left front wheel was forced back.
The small-offset impact also causes the dummy to head toward the front windshield pillar, even as that pillar is pushed toward the dummy. In some cases, the restraint systems might not keep the dummy from hitting the pillar because the steering wheel, which contains the air bag, veers so far to the right that the dummy misses the bag.
Automakers' responses to the findings ranged from a low-key promise by Toyota to a more forceful pushback by Mercedes-Benz.
A Toyota statement about the performance of its Lexus models read, in part, ''With this new test, the institute has raised the bar again, and we will respond to this challenge as we design new vehicles.''
Mercedes responded by questioning the value of the test, saying, ''As a leader in automotive safety, we have full confidence in the protection that the C-Class affords its occupants -- and less confidence in any test that doesn't reflect that.''
The insurance institute chose models from luxury brands because they are generally the first to come to market with advanced safety features. The institute will next test 15 midsize, moderately priced cars like the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Volkswagen Passat.
It will take time for automakers to figure out how to design vehicles to do well on the new test without adding a lot of mass to vehicles, which manufacturers are trying to slim down to meet tough new fuel economy rules. But David Champion, senior director of Consumer Reports' automotive test center, said he thought that in five to 10 years all manufacturers would be able to get ratings of either Acceptable or Good, without adding a lot of cost to their models.
''This will become just another box they have to check -- must do well in I.I.H.S. small-overlap test -- which is going to be good for the consumer,'' he said.

N.H.T.S.A.'s full frontal test rates vehicles on how well they protect an average-size male driver and a small-stature female passenger using a system in which five stars is the best. The institute's tests now include offset impacts over either 40 percent of the front end (moderate overlap) or 25 percent (small overlap) and include an average-size male dummy in the driver's seat.

HEADLINE: Start-Ups Develop Bike-Sharing Options

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN. 
Twitter to @joshuabrustein.

 BODY:
With the announcement on Friday that New York's ambitious bike-sharing program, Citi Bike, will be delayed, New Yorkers will have to wait until spring 2013 to ride one of the bright blue bikes.But City Hall has no monopoly on the concept of sharing bicycles, and two start-ups are working on alternatives to Citi Bike and its planned 10,000 bikes, specially designed bike racks and smartphone app to let riders navigate the system.
The shoestring start-up Spinlister is a Web site (and in the coming months, a mobile app) that operates on the same principle as other sharing-economy companies like Airbnb or Taskrabbit. It has been connecting people with underused bicycles to cyclists without wheels for several months already. If what you are looking for is a bicycle for the day, it can be much cheaper than the available alternatives, while giving you that warm, fuzzy feeling of being in on something. 
Spinlister is a small-time operation, with the company's founder, Will Dennis, 23, at its center. About 80 bikes are currently listed in New York City (it also operates in San Francisco), and Mr. Dennis says the site has facilitated hundreds of rentals in recent months. At least 20 of those are of Mr. Dennis's own six-gear bicycle, the Blue Lady Killer. (Other Spinlister users offer bikes with names like the Red Devil, Midnight Rider and Maggie.)
Mr. Dennis argues that Spinlister can coexist with the city's program because it serves a different market. The pricing for Citi Bike is set up for people intending to ride for no more than an hour or two; after that, the fees pile up quickly. Spinlister's rates, by contrast, are based on daylong rentals. Plan on spending about $20 to rent a bike for a day, although some people ask much more for high-end road bikes.
Unlike Citi Bike, Spinlister does not reward spontaneity. Getting a bike depends on arranging a meeting with its owner, and most of these people are presumably not just sitting around waiting for your e-mail. I tried twice to rent a bike on less than a day's notice and failed both times.
But the big question is how the service, as it grows, will deal with theft and fraud. Spinlister deems the renter responsible for damaged or stolen bikes, but it is unclear how it can enforce this policy. To reassure people who list bikes, the service guarantees to cover losses of up to $5,000. Mr. Dennis says it has not had to pay out yet, quite likely because Spinlister remains so small. It is hard to see this good luck lasting forever.
Social Bicycles is working on a bike-sharing program that seems more in line with the city's idea. (Indeed, the three-man company bid for the contract to run the city's program but was beaten out by Alta Bicycle Share.)
The twist with Social Bicycles is that instead of custom-built racks that people visit to pick up shared bikes, the bikes themselves come with built-in locks and GPS units. When people want bikes, they can look at a smartphone app to locate one, then unlock it by entering a PIN into a small computer on the back of the bicycle. When they're done, users simply lock up the bikes at their final destination and walk off.
In addition to being convenient, Social Bicycles argues, this method is relatively inexpensive: The cost per bicycle is about 25 percent of what it will be under the city's system.
Social Bicycles is still early in its development. The company is working with clients like the city of Buffalo and San Francisco International Airport, which is establishing a bike-sharing program for employees who need to get between terminals. Some of these programs are expected to be running in the coming months.
The company has aspirations to supplement New York City's bike-sharing program as it expands geographically. For the moment, the only place you are likely to see one of the bikes around here is outside the offices of BMW's start-up incubator in the West Village, where the company is based.

HEADLINE: Falling Victim To Hard Times And Dry Times On the Range

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
AZTEC, N.M. -- The land is parched, the fields are withering and thousands of the nation's horses are being left to fend for themselves on the dried range, abandoned by people who can no longer afford to feed them.They have been dropping dead in the Navajo reservation in the Southwest, where neighbors are battling neighbors and livestock for water, an inherently scant resource on tribal land. They have been found stumbling through state parks in Missouri, in backyards and along country roads in Illinois, and among ranch herds in Texas where they do not belong.
Some are taken to rescue farms or foster homes -- lifelines that are also buckling under the pressure of the nation's worst drought in half a century, which has pushed the price of grain and hay needed to feed the animals beyond the reach of many families already struggling in the tight economy.
And still the drought rages on. The most recent federal assessment is that parts of at least 33 states, mostly in the West and the Midwest, are experiencing drought conditions that are severe or worse. It is affecting 87 percent of the land dedicated to growing corn, 63 percent of the land for hay and 72 percent of the land used for cattle. 
With water tables falling, fields are crusting and cracking, creeks are running dry. Water holes first shrink, then vanish altogether. And dozens of wildfires are consuming forests and grassland across the West.
While precise figures are hard to come by, rough estimates from the Unwanted Horse Coalition, an alliance of equine organizations based in Washington, puts the number of unwanted horses -- those given up on by their owners for whatever reasons -- at 170,000 to 180,000 nationwide, said Ericka Caslin, the group's director.
Many more could be out there, though. The Navajos, for instance, have no tally on the number of feral horses on their land; a $2 million effort to count and round them up was vetoed by the tribe's president because of the cost.
Here, in this speck of a city in northern New Mexico, just outside Navajo territory, Debbie Coburn has been scrambling to enlist volunteers and raise money to feed, clean and care for three times as many abandoned horses as she had in her rescue farm, Four Corners Equine Rescue, through all of last year.
She gets up almost every day to find messages in her computer from people whose horses are in desperate need of help. One recent morning, a woman writing on behalf of her elderly parents who live just east of Albuquerque said, ''They have scraped by every week to purchase a bale of hay for their horse, but they just can't do it anymore.''
At $8 to $12 for a bale of roughly 60 pounds, enough to feed a riding horse for maybe three days, hay already costs five times what it did 10 years ago, Ms. Coburn said. This summer's anemic harvest has spurred competition for a limited supply among ranchers big and small, from nearby cities and also from out of state. And as a rule, the price of hay goes up in the cold months; it doubled last winter, when the drought's devastating effects first began to sprout.
''This winter, to be quite blunt, scares the hell out of me,'' Ms. Coburn said as she walked across the corrals where the horses are kept, some of them in improvised pens enclosed not by steel barriers, but by electric fence. (The horses have arrived faster than she has been able to make room for them.)
''At this point,'' she added, ''it's just too late for rain alone to solve our problems.''
Tony Pecho, the president of Illinois Horse Rescue of Will County, some 50 miles south of Chicago, has been trying to get horses adopted straight from the homes of the people who call to say they can no longer keep them. There is no money to bring them all to his farm, he said. And while calls for abandoned horses were rare in years past, this year they are the most frequent, he said, sometimes coming from places as far as four hours away.
Mr. Pecho has been asking for donations, of money as well as hay, on Facebook. On Saturday, Connie Hendrix, the president of the Missouri Forget-Me-Not Horse Rescue and Sanctuary in Linn Creek, hosted a fund-raising ice cream social and pie auction at a church, and she plans a golf tournament and silent auction next month, just to feed the horses she already has.
Last week, Ms. Hendrix picked up a mare running in the woods behind a subdivision in a city 120 miles south of her facility, thirsty, malnourished and with an injured eye. Last Monday, she said, she got a call from a sheriff's deputy asking if she could take in seven scrawny horses, three belonging to someone who is unemployed and the other four to an elderly man on disability. Neither, Ms. Hendrix said, could afford to keep the animals fed.
She is not sure if she can, either. ''I don't know if we're going to be able to find hay or afford hay to take in that many,'' she said.
There is little logic to the hay market. Ms. Hendrix's rescue gets its hay from Tennessee, while the rescue in Illinois brings it in from northern Wisconsin. Jennifer Williams, the executive director of the Bluebonnet Equine Humane Society, a network of foster homes for horses in Texas, said she gets it from wherever she can.
Ms. Coburn said she could still find New Mexico hay for her horses, but competition from out-of-state cattle ranchers is stiff. Big trucks that roll in empty leave packed to the brim, bound for places like Texas and Kentucky.
''My challenge now is to set as many bales aside as I can,'' she said, ''but that's hard when you're the little guy.''
At the Navajo reservation, where much of the once green grass is gone, leaving behind only sand, sheep herders have taken to bringing their animals to eat the scraps of hay that are left behind after bales are sold in open-air markets. Feral horses, free-roaming animals that once were domesticated, have been jumping over fences to eat the weeds that grow by the side of the road.
Forage ''has shriveled and died on the range,'' Kimberly Johnson, the acting supervisor of the tribe's grazing management program, said from the headquarters of the Navajo Nation's agriculture department in Window Rock, Ariz., near the New Mexico border. Ms. Johnson said that only 30 percent of the tribe's livestock owners care for their animals on a daily basis, based on an informal survey this year.
So the horses have been searching for water wherever they can: in mills and troughs meant to supply the families that live around them, as well as the animals they own, and in lakes the drought has turned into puddles.
Stallions fight one another for food and water, their bites drawing flesh and blood. Atop a mesa near Many Farms, Ariz., in the heart of Navajo territory, horses were stomping the ground one recent afternoon, as if trying to draw water from a pond that is now just cracked dirt. Tribal rangers said carcasses dot the arid landscape.
Horses are sacred animals to the Navajos; they symbolize prosperity and the beauty of the Navajo way of life, Ms. Johnson said. She and her colleagues have found themselves in an awkward spot, caught between tribe members who want the feral horses away from their water and out of their land and others who would rather the horses be left alone.
Roundups are being carried out almost every day, all across the reservation. The horses are sold, at least some of them destined for slaughter in Mexico. One morning in Cornfields, Ariz., on the western edge of the reservation, a woman tried to keep the feral horses from being penned in her corral, cursing and screaming at the men who had rounded them up at her grandson's request.
Ms. Johnson watched it unfold from afar.
''What do we do?'' she asked. ''Do we leave them out to die of hunger and thirst?''

HEADLINE: Sneaky Ways to Keep Conflicting Promises

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune.The state's economy is booming, relatively speaking. Tax revenue is far higher than the comptroller had predicted. The Rainy Day Fund has so much money that it may hit a cap. Hardly anybody even knew that particular savings account had a limit. And why would they? Why would the state ever hoard $9 billion or $10 billion?
But the state's financial outlook isn't as rosy as it appears to be, particularly if state lawmakers want things to run the way they run now. 
It's the central problem of state government in Texas. Lawmakers here and in Washington have promised to deliver more programs and services than they are willing or able to finance. As a result, they're constantly choosing between cutting what Texans demand and increasing taxes and fees Texans don't want to pay.
The last round in that long-running tug of war was during the 2011 legislative session, and lawmakers escaped with a flourish of creative financing. They saw that they couldn't afford the 24 months of Medicaid required in their two-year budget. Instead of cutting the program or lowering what they pay to providers (who have long complained that those rates are far too low), they budgeted just enough to hold the program until early 2013. That's when lawmakers return to Austin for another legislative session and another budget. They figured the state economy might improve -- the equivalent of a leprechaun showing up or a winning lottery ticket blowing in through the window -- before they had to pay for the last few months of Medicaid. Maybe fewer people would use the program or they would spend less than expected.
Maybe they'd get lucky.
And so they did. The revenues have come in faster than Comptroller Susan Combs projected.
But their 2011 budget tricks and some clouds in the financial forecast take away some of their options in 2013. Gov. Rick Perry and other leaders decreed at the time that money in the state's Rainy Day Fund should not be used for routine expenses. They didn't want to create a problem two years down the road. They also decided it would be O.K. to use the reserve for supplemental appropriations -- the unanticipated spending that had to be covered in the last months of a budget.
Budget writers are smart people, and they saw an opening. They shorted that two-year Medicaid budget by a few months, leaving services intact and uncut and assuming they could come back and find the money for the final few months in early 2013. If income turned out to be short, they could use the one-time money in the Rainy Day Fund -- money they were unable to use on the front end -- to cover the gap.
Sure, it's convoluted and sneaky. But they don't have to answer to voters in November about cuts in Medicaid services. Or about increasing taxes and fees. They can use savings and revenue increases to cover that tab and other, similar bills. And all without breaking any promises to voters, either about taxes or about promised services.
That's the good news they will hear in January. The bad news? Their budget woes are just what they were two years ago. The state's savings account has to be used for the current budget and not for the next one. And the state is still growing, which means existing costs of government are going up.
It's a familiar litany: 70,000 to 80,000 more children in public schools every year, rising costs and client loads in health and human services, a highway financing system that no longer completely covers maintenance on existing roads in a state that also needs new roads, a statewide water plan with a financing drought, a higher education system stuck between stingy state budgets and a deep and growing resentment of tuition increases. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A list of promises on one side of the ledger -- government programs and services that voters want -- and a list of promises on the other against higher taxes or fees that voters don't want to pay.
The comptroller recently told lawmakers that a flagging national and international economy could cut into the state's tax income -- an early warning against too much optimism. They'll get real numbers, the ones used for budgeting, in January.
Then they can decide which set of promises to break.

HEADLINE: A Chance to Make Mortgage Shopping Easier

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
MORTGAGE rates are very low, but some people who could qualify for cheap refinancing are procrastinating. That may be because shopping for a mortgage can make root canal surgery seem fun.Choosing a home and mortgage is probably the largest financial decision that most Americans ever make. Yet perhaps because the loan process is so onerous and opaque, many take the first quote they are offered. In fact, research shows that people typically spend more time shopping for a car or vacation than for a mortgage, and I suspect that many families spend as much or more time picking out a microwave oven.
Shirking on mortgage shopping is a costly type of sloth. Other research, done for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, finds that most borrowers could save several thousand dollars by getting just one more quote.
Now is a propitious time for raising these issues because the new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is undertaking a Congressionally mandated revision of some disclosure forms that are required by law. (Disclosure: Along with John G. Lynch Jr., a professor at the University of Colorado, I met with bureau staff members last month to discuss this proposal from a behavioral science perspective.) 
The bureau's goals should be to make mortgage shopping easier and more efficient, and to make the industry more transparent and competitive, all while reducing the kinds of bad loans that helped create the financial crisis.
One form is of particular importance. It's the ''loan estimate,'' a paper copy of which must go to borrowers within three days of application for a loan.
The bureau's research team did extensive testing to decide what data should be included on this new form. It proposed a three-page version containing more than 100 pieces of information, including the interest rate, charges for various services and whether features like prepayment penalties or balloon payments were part of the deal.
The designers had to make formatting choices -- which numbers should go where on the form, in what size and font, and so forth. There are nearly endless possibilities -- and the choices are important because design influences consumer behavior.
A good example involves the annual percentage rate, which has been required to be reported since 1968. Because tests showed that this number often confused consumers, the bureau chose to put it on the third page of the form. Some critics say it should be displayed more prominently, but most economists agree that the A.P.R. can be a misleading measure of a loan's cost.
The A.P.R. is an estimate of total loan costs, including fees, expressed as an interest rate. Two factors complicate its usefulness. First, it is calculated by assuming that the loan will be held for the entire term, typically 30 years, amortizing the fees over those years. But most mortgages are repaid much sooner, either because the homeowner sells the home or refinances the loan. This is especially true for adjustable-rate mortgages with initially low teaser rates.
If borrowers refinance after three years, for example, but the A.P.R. is calculated over a 30-year period, the total costs of the loan are greatly understated, and can wrongly steer borrowers toward loans with higher upfront fees.
The second problem is that the A.P.R. for an adjustable-rate mortgage is simply a guess, because it is calculated by assuming that interest rates will never change. Because rates are currently at historic lows, it is likely that anyone who actually holds a 30-year adjustable mortgage for its full life will pay a higher rate at some point in the future.
The bottom line is that there is no single correct way to design this form or to calculate the A.P.R. But one small change would make all of these issues less important, while sharply improving consumers' ability to shop around.
All the bureau needs to do is to give borrowers the right to receive the disclosure in a machine-readable version -- meaning that the information would be stored in a way that allows easy processing by computers.
The move would be in keeping with the Obama administration's ''smart disclosure'' initiative ''to expand consumers' access to data that helps them make better informed decisions.'' And it wouldn't impose significant additional costs on lenders because the regulation already wisely requires lenders to keep records of the loan estimate forms in an ''electronic, machine-readable format'' to demonstrate compliance.
If banks are already storing this information electronically, it would be straightforward for them to transmit it to borrowers in a secure, confidential way. In fact, that should be cheaper for the lender, especially if the alternative is an overnight delivery service. With a machine-readable version, a mortgage shopper could then upload the information to any number of Web sites or applications that would serve as intelligent ''choice engines.'' Some might be nonprofit organizations that could alert borrowers to usually high fees or potentially dangerous features. Others could be commercial sites, similar to the various travel Web sites that many of us use to book airline tickets and hotels. But unlike some of those sites, these would reveal all fees, not shroud them. (Think baggage fees and required valet parking.)
Choice engines would also vastly improve upon existing Web sites for mortgage shopping that don't provide consumers with all the details they need to evaluate loans. (It's a bit like trying to choose a flight online if the only information you receive about the destination is ''somewhere in Florida.'') And the option of electronic transmission to consumers would solve the problems of a cumbersome, inefficient paper-only system, which would require them to either scan the forms they receive or manually enter myriad pieces of data.
MACHINE-READABLE disclosure also makes the form's physical design less crucial. That's because choice engines would analyze every number, no matter where on the form, and emphasize specific numbers for individual borrowers. For example, if you plan to refinance after three years, the A.P.R.'s of various loans could be calculated accordingly. If you tend to be absent-minded about making payments, late fees could be highlighted. These features would indeed make the disclosure process ''smart.''
If the bureau can't modify the rule in this way now, here's a challenge to lenders who want to compete by offering transparency and low rates: Why not unilaterally give all prospective borrowers complete information about your loans in a machine-readable format as soon as you provide the initial quote?
If enough lenders do this -- listen up, credit unions, community banks and online lenders -- the cottage industry of online mortgage advisers could get a jump-start, and mortgage shopping could finally enter the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Both Campaigns Seize Role of Medicare Defender

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and HELENE COOPER; Trip Gabriel reported from The Villages, Fla., and Helene Cooper from Windham, N.H.

 BODY:
THE VILLAGES, Fla. -- After several days in which he mentioned only generalities on the campaign trail, Representative Paul D. Ryan sought on Saturday to play offense on Medicare, attacking in detail President Obama's health care plan, seizing an issue that has the potential to be one of Mr. Ryan's biggest liabilities in joining the Republican presidential ticket.Mr. Ryan, who has proposed a controversial voucher program for Medicare, accused Mr. Obama of being the bigger threat because of savings wrung from the growth of spending in the program contained in the president's health care overhaul of 2010.
He said a board of ''15 unelected bureaucrats'' would decide what should be cut, and that ''one out of six of our hospitals and our nursing homes will go out of business.'' 
''The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program,'' Mr. Ryan said, to boos from a crowd of more than 1,000 seniors in this vast retirement community.
Left unsaid was that his own budget plan passed by the House in March includes the same $716 billion in savings, to be used to reduce the deficit.
Having Mr. Ryan take the Medicare fight to Florida, a crucial battleground state that Mr. Obama won in 2008, represented an effort by Mitt Romney's campaign to turn what many strategists predicted would be the ticket's Achilles' heel -- Mr. Ryan's detailed and aggressive budget cuts -- into an asset.
With his 78-year-old mother looking on, Mr. Ryan, 42, wove a story of generational obligation to personalize the long-term threat to Medicare's solvency. He described how he and his mother, Betty Ryan Douglas, were the primary caregivers for a grandmother with Alzheimer's disease who moved into their Wisconsin house when he was a teenager.
''You learn a lot about life,'' he said. ''Medicare was there for my family, for my grandma, when we needed it. And Medicare is there for my mom when she needs it now, and we have to keep that guarantee.''
To save Medicare for current and future retirees, he added, ''you have to reform it for my generation, so it doesn't go bankrupt when we want to retire.''
President Obama, campaigning in New Hampshire on Saturday, dismissed the Romney campaign's tactics on Medicare, saying that it was Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan who threatened the program.
''Now you think they'd avoid talking about Medicare, considering both of them have proposed to voucherize the Medicare system,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They want seniors to get a voucher to buy their own insurance, which would force seniors to pay an additional $6,400 for their health care.''
Mr. Obama defended Medicare and his health care overhaul, saying the ''only changes to your benefits'' were that Medicare now covers preventive services like cancer screenings at no cost. The $718 billion in cost savings -- or cuts -- over the next decade, he said, add about eight years to Medicare's solvency.
Mr. Obama also zeroed in on the twofer of Mr. Ryan's budget proposals and Mr. Romney's tax returns, days after Mr. Romney disclosed that he paid around 13 percent in taxes over the past 10 years.
''He put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than one percent in taxes a year,'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. Ryan, to jeers from the crowd. ''And here's the kicker: he expects you to pick up the tab!''
He called the Romney-Ryan budget proposals ''snake oil'' -- an apparent downgrade from the phrase he was using last week in Iowa to describe the Republican economic proposals, ''fairy dust.''
''They've been trying to sell this trickle-down snake oil before,'' Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Romney spent Saturday in Massachusetts, hopping between high-dollar fund-raisers on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, including at the homes of the billionaire industrialist Bill Koch and Jeffrey R. Jay, a private equity executive who specializes in health care companies.
Mr. Romney, who has said he would sign the House budget as president, seemed to back away this week from that commitment when he emphasized that he would restore the Medicare cuts incorporated in the budget plan.
And Mr. Romney made clear that his running mate supported his own position. ''Congressman Ryan has joined my campaign, and his campaign is my campaign now, and we're on exactly the same page,'' he said in an interview with CBS.
The $716 billion in cuts -- or savings -- come from reducing payments to providers over the next decade in an effort to control costs. They include lower payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and to providers of Medicare Advantage plans, which are private.
The Romney campaign argued that lower payments would lead to fewer services. ''In an imaginary world where government simply controls everything and everyone, this might sound like an effective way to control cost,'' Lanhee Chen, Mr. Romney's policy director, wrote in a memo distributed on Saturday. ''In the real world, the result will be fewer providers accepting Medicare payments, and worse care for today's seniors.''
Speaking before the crowd of seniors on Saturday, Mr. Ryan emphasized that his plan, incorporated into the House budget, would not begin until people who are younger than 55 today become eligible for Medicare.
''Our solution to preserve, protect and save Medicare does not affect your benefits,'' he said. ''Let me repeat that.''
Mr. Ryan introduced his mother as a snowbird who lived part of the year ''just down the road over near Lauderdale.''
''She planned her retirement around this promise'' of Medicare, he added. ''That's a promise we have to keep.''

HEADLINE: U.S Says Iraqis Are Helping Iran Skirt Sanctions

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN and DURAID ADNAN; James Risen reported from Washington, and Duraid Adnan from Baghdad.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama announced last month that he was barring a Baghdad bank from any dealings with the American banking system, it was a rare acknowledgment of a delicate problem facing the administration in a country that American troops just left: for months, Iraq has been helping Iran skirt economic sanctions imposed on Tehran because of its nuclear program.The little-known bank singled out by the United States, the Elaf Islamic Bank, is only part of a network of financial institutions and oil-smuggling operations that, according to current and former American and Iraqi government officials and experts on the Iraqi banking sector, has provided Iran with a crucial flow of dollars at a time when sanctions are squeezing its economy.
The Obama administration is not eager for a public showdown with the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki over Iran just eight months after the last American troops withdrew from Baghdad. 
Still, the administration has held private talks with Iraqi officials to complain about specific instances of financial and logistical ties between the countries, officials say, although they do not regard all trade between them as illegal or, as in the case of smuggling, as something completely new. In one recent instance, when American officials learned that the Iraqi government was aiding the Iranians by allowing them to use Iraqi airspace to ferry supplies to Syria, Mr. Obama called Mr. Maliki to complain. The Iranian planes flew another route.
In response to questions from The New York Times, David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, provided a written statement saying that Iran ''may seek to escape the force of our financial sanctions through Iraqi financial institutions.'' But he added that ''we will pursue, and are actively pursuing, efforts to prevent Iran from evading U.S. or international financial sanctions, in Iraq or anywhere else.''
Some current and former American and Iraqi officials, along with banking and oil experts, say that Iraqi government officials are turning a blind eye to the large financial flows, smuggling and other trade with Iran. In some cases, they say, government officials, including some close to Mr. Maliki, are directly profiting from the activities.
''Maliki's government is right in the middle of this,'' said one former senior American intelligence official who now does business in Iraq.
In announcing that he was ''cutting off'' Elaf Islamic Bank, Mr. Obama said it had ''facilitated transactions worth millions of dollars on behalf of Iranian banks that are subject to sanctions for their links to Iran's illicit proliferation activities.''
But the treatment the bank has received in Baghdad since it was named by Mr. Obama suggests that the Iraqi government is not only allowing companies and individuals to circumvent the sanctions but also not enforcing penalties for noncompliance.
Iraqi banking experts said last week that the bank was still allowed to participate in the Iraq Central Bank's daily auction at which commercial banks can sell Iraqi dinars and buy United States dollars. These auctions are a crucial pathway for Iranian access to the international financial system. Western officials say that Iran seeks to bolster its reserves of dollars to stabilize its exchange rates and pay for imports.
Iraqi and American officials with knowledge of Iraqi banking practices say Iranian customers are able to move large amounts of cash through the auction, and from there into banks in regional financial centers like Dubai, United Arab Emirates, or Amman, Jordan, and then into the international banking system.
Mudher Salih, the central bank governor, said in an interview that Elaf Islamic Bank was being allowed back into the auction because Elaf officials had denied any wrongdoing. ''Elaf Bank is attending the auctions, and they are telling us that they didn't violate the law, and saying that they didn't deal with any Iranian institutes,'' Mr. Salih said.
While Iraq has tried to impose more stringent reporting requirements that might pick up illegal transfers, officials with knowledge of the Iraqi banking industry say that banks, hawala houses, an unofficial global network of money-traders, and their Iranian customers are finding ways around them, often by forging documents that make it look as if the money transfers are to finance legitimate trade between Iraq and other countries.
Thanks to Iraq's growing oil revenue, the Iraqi central bank has about $60 billion in foreign exchange reserves, held in accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with which to meet the insatiable demand for dollars. But the new flight of dollars out of Iraq is prompting criticism of the central bank and of the Iraqi government.
The accusations of high-level Iraqi government involvement in sanctions-busting have roiled Iraqi politics and invariably reflect on Mr. Maliki, since many Iraqi officials now say that he has taken effective control of the Iraqi central bank, which is nominally independent.
''We want to question the central bank and the banks that are involved,'' Ali al-Sachri, a member of Parliament, said in an interview. Mr. Salih acknowledged the huge dollar transfers and said that they threatened the economic stability of Iraq by depleting the country's foreign reserves. He said that ''in order to prevent the economy from collapsing, we should put an end to this illegal flow of dollars outside Iraq.''
He said the large-scale money laundering was probably being helped by ''some corruption that requires the government to investigate,'' but he defended the actions of the central bank, saying that it does ''not have the capability to watch everything.''
Several American and Iraqi banking and government officials also say that Iranian organizations have gained effective control over at least four Iraqi commercial banks through Iraqi intermediaries. That gives Iran direct access to the international financial system, supposedly denied to Tehran by the economic sanctions. Even as the United States has moved to tighten the vise against Iran this summer, the Maliki government has openly sought to enhance its already deep economic and political ties with Iran. Trade between Iraq and Iran, which fought a costly war from 1980 to 1988, has been growing rapidly ever since the American-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, and it is now estimated to be as high as $11 billion a year. Among other openly acknowledged forms of trade, Iraq has contracts to buy large amounts of electrical power from Iran.
Just last week, an Iraqi delegation that includes the deputy prime minister and top officials from the ministries of finance and trade and the central bank met in Tehran with their Iranian counterparts for talks about further increasing economic ties.
An Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said in a telephone interview that Iraq ''is not intending to break any rules,'' but added that ''we also have good relations with Iran that we do not want to break.''
This year, Iraqi officials publicly expressed concerns that their large volume of trade with Iran might place them in violation of the sanctions on Iran, and they said they would seek a sanctions waiver. After those public statements, American officials privately told the Maliki government that Iraq would not be found to be in violation of the new Iran sanctions because of its publicly acknowledged cross-border trade, according to a former senior United States official.
Whatever help Iraq has given Iran, the sanctions have put considerable pressure on Tehran. Iran's oil exports have dropped by about 40 percent because of the latest round of sanctions, while Iraq's own oil production has been surging. American officials say that if aiding Iran was a priority of the Iraqi government, Baghdad would not be so eagerly ramping up oil production to fill the void left by Iran.
Still, clandestine trade, including large-scale smuggling of oil and oil products, has been increasing, and the Iraqi government has done little to stop a highly organized effort that frequently provides financial benefits to Iraqi political parties and powerful political leaders, according to American and Iraqi oil traders and experts.
Iraqi fuel oil, acquired by smuggling operations with close connections to political leaders at extremely low prices with the help of government subsidies, is being smuggled from Iraq through Kurdistan and into Iran. From Iran it is smuggled once again, with some going to Afghanistan, where the cheap fuel is resold at a large profit. American and Iraqi oil experts say they believe that at least some Iranian oil is finding its way to Iraqi ports for export.

HEADLINE: Michigan's G.O.P. Governor Defies Easy Labels

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- In this political age of ideological purity, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan is an enigma.Mr. Snyder, a Republican business executive who took office last year after a wave of G.O.P. statehouse victories, has told his Republican-dominated Legislature that a right-to-work measure is not on his agenda. The issue, he says, is too divisive.
And as some lawmakers made it clear that they intended to take their time considering their options on the national health care law, Mr. Snyder said Michigan needed to move swiftly to set up a health insurance exchange.
Then, last month, to the astonishment of Republicans who had sponsored some voting measures, Mr. Snyder vetoed several of them, including one that called for requiring photo identification to get an absentee ballot. 
Mr. Snyder, who never sought elective office before he ran for governor with the unlikely slogan ''One Tough Nerd,'' says he is unambiguously a Republican, and it is a description with which many Michigan Democrats strenuously (and unhappily) concur. Yet Mr. Snyder, a former accountant who has single-mindedly focused on Michigan's economic woes, also studiously steers clear of public party-line battles and avoids the sort of language that riles up some Republican crowds. And, in a state that Mitt Romney hopes to make a battleground, he has even sidestepped opportunities to criticize President Obama.
''I'm a proud Republican -- there's no issue with that at all, so why can't I be a proud Republican and just try to solve problems?'' Mr. Snyder, who turns 54 on Sunday, said in an interview.
''I feel a lot of this is just common sense,'' he went on. ''If you dropped all the rhetoric, all the fighting, in a lot of ways people could come up with solutions they could all agree on.''
Mr. Snyder likes to call his approach ''relentless positive action,'' a term that prompts eye rolls from some Michigan politicians for its earnest, self-help-book sound and for his frequent use of it. The nonideological tack has kept him outside the brightest spotlight, making him a quieter, plainer counterpart to firebrands like Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin or Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine, who arrived in the same Republican wave.
Unsettled is whether Mr. Snyder's method can work with a national partisan divide that seems to grow deeper by the instant.
Republicans and business leaders here widely praise Mr. Snyder, crediting him with balancing the state's once-troubled budget, dumping a state business tax and presiding over an employment rebound in a state that not long ago had the highest jobless rate in the nation.
''He's done an amazing job,'' said Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company. ''Rick doesn't get bogged down in partisan stuff.''
Mr. Snyder got favorable ratings from 47 percent of voters -- including about three-quarters of Republicans, almost a quarter of Democrats and about half of independents -- in a statewide survey by EPIC-MRA in July. Mr. Snyder's favorable number was similar to Mr. Obama's.
''This governor has taken ahold of a state that was at the bottom of the heap,'' said State Senator Darwin L. Booher, a Republican who praised Mr. Snyder's leadership despite having sponsored one of the voting bills Mr. Snyder rejected (and learning of the veto, he said, only an hour or two before it was issued). ''Sometimes it's gotten him in trouble that he doesn't look at things politically, but it's refreshing.''
Democratic leaders dismiss Mr. Snyder's style as just a new political pose. His talk of inclusiveness and civility, in the view of Mark Brewer, the Democratic state party chairman, has masked one of the most conservative agendas of any Michigan governor since the 1940s.
They say he has all but ignored Democrats, who hold minorities in the Legislature, and has been mostly in lock step with Republicans. He has vetoed only six bills, as well as lines from 14 others. Among provisions he has approved: cutting education spending, taxing public workers' pensions, requiring more public union employees to pay more for health care, barring university graduate research assistants from forming unions, and permitting labor contracts to be tossed out in the most financially troubled cities.
''This is no different than what you see in Wisconsin, except that Governor Walker kicked down the front door and Governor Snyder is sneaking things in the back,'' said Gretchen Whitmer, the Senate Democratic leader, who added that appearing to rise above partisan fighting might be far harder if Mr. Snyder's party had not won dominance in both legislative chambers and other statewide offices. ''When you've got absolute control, absolute power, you can afford to be the magnanimous nice guy,'' she said.
Outside of Lansing, the state capital, Mr. Snyder's stances have alienated some people and puzzled others. Randy Bishop, a Tea Party organizer, mocks Mr. Snyder's Republican affiliation by calling him ''RINO Rick,'' a derogatory acronym for Republican in Name Only.
Even on matters where he appeared to buck traditional Republican stances, Mr. Snyder has been hard to lump in with others. While he has pressed to move quickly on a health insurance exchange, he says he needs more time to analyze whether Michigan should expand Medicaid under the Obama administration's health care law. While he vetoed identification-related voting provisions, he said he did so not on some philosophical basis but because of his concern that some particulars of the bills might have confused voters. And while he has said he prefers that no right-to-work legislation arrives on his desk, he has not said he would veto it.
In 2010, Mr. Snyder shocked many by emerging from a broad field of far better-known Republicans, including Mike Cox, then the state attorney general, and Pete Hoekstra, then a congressman, in a primary race before easily winning in the general election. One of many businessmen-turned-candidates around the country that year, Mr. Snyder, a former chairman of the Gateway computer company and a venture capitalist with law and business degrees, spent about $6 million of his own money on the campaign. The governor, who almost never wears a tie, returned all but $1 of his salary in his first year in office.
In a state where Republican organizers are desperately trying to excite their voters in hopes of winning the presidential race in the state for the first time since 1988, Mr. Snyder is an unexpected, sometimes awkward ingredient. Just before the Republican primary in Michigan in February, Mr. Snyder was asked in an interview whether Mr. Obama ought to be given credit for the state's economic improvements. ''I don't worry about blame or credit,'' he said. ''It's more about solving the problem.''
Bobby Schostak, the Republican state party chairman, acknowledged that Mr. Snyder might ''take a different approach,'' but said he diligently joined in party events.
''His red meat is talking about cutting costs and expenses, about the state's business economy and fiscal issues,'' Mr. Schostak said. ''Is he going to go pound on Congress or pound on Obama? That's not his style.''
Mr. Snyder has his own tests ahead. Labor leaders have pushed for a ballot question in November to seal collective bargaining rights in the State Constitution, threatening divisions over the very issue that Mr. Snyder had hoped to avoid. Another group is challenging efforts for a new bridge to Canada, a controversial proposal that Mr. Snyder advanced on his own after legislators did not. And another group wants to undo a law granting broad powers to shore up financially troubled cities, a measure that underpins a consent deal the Snyder administration reached for state oversight of struggling Detroit.
For his part, Mr. Snyder seems unworried. He says Michigan residents -- customers, as he calls them -- seem fine with his way of going along.
''Other politicians, a lot of them don't know what to make of it,'' he said.
''That doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me,'' he said, ''because, again, my customers appreciate it.''

HEADLINE: The Courtship Before Romney Elevated Ryan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a 15-minute courtesy visit from a Republican with big presidential aspirations to a rising star in Congress with big ideas about how to address the nation's fiscal problems.Mitt Romney, who had just left office as governor of Massachusetts and was moving to the right on issues like abortion, was beginning to immerse himself in federal budget policy. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who on that day in early 2007 had just become the top Republican on the House Budget Committee, was promoting a small-government libertarianism that within a few years would become Republican Party orthodoxy.
Inside the Longworth House Office Building, 15 minutes turned into an hour as the two men traded theories about how to overhaul Medicare, Social Security and the tax code, a pair of policy mavens out-geeking each other over esoterica like border-adjustable taxes. ''We went deep into the weeds,'' Mr. Ryan recalled in an interview.
It was the start of a on-again, off-again five-year courtship that encapsulated their party's gradual adoption of a more conservative stance on fiscal issues, a shift punctuated a week ago by Mr. Romney's selection of Mr. Ryan as his running mate. 
His choice of Mr. Ryan had clear political overtones for Mr. Romney, who despite years of trying to win over the right was still viewed with some suspicion by many conservative leaders. But to the degree that it was a marriage of political convenience, it came about only after the two Republicans engaged in regular, substantive and previously undisclosed exchanges that by this spring had left a skeptical Mr. Ryan convinced that Mr. Romney had come to a similar policy viewpoint. The future No. 2, it turned out, was doing some vetting of his own.
Over the past 18 months, with Mr. Romney emerging as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, the frequency and intensity of their communication deepened. Mr. Romney turned to Mr. Ryan for detailed consultations on his economic platform. Mr. Ryan made sure his Medicare proposal in the House matched up with what Mr. Romney was offering on the campaign trail.
Mr. Romney recruited several of Mr. Ryan's top aides as campaign advisers, and the candidate's staff members asked the congressman to review language in Mr. Romney's planned speeches and opinion pieces, people close to both men said in interviews.
Mr. Ryan did not shy from offering pointed advice well before he was named running mate: for months, he had urged Mr. Romney to focus his campaign as much on a ''a positive vision'' as on the shortcomings of the Obama presidency, something Mr. Romney has since emphasized.
''A lot of substance was exchanged between them,'' said Tom Rath, a longtime political adviser to Mr. Romney. ''Ryan's name came up very frequently. Those guys who were traveling with Governor Romney would say, 'Oh, I know he talked to Ryan about this' or 'Ryan and he were e-mailing about that.' ''
Even so, Mr. Ryan remained unconvinced that Mr. Romney was the right messenger for his philosophy until well into the 2012 campaign.
He took his worries about Mr. Romney public, telling The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last summer: ''I understand the knock on him. I understand the concerns. They're legitimate.''
Friends said he had wondered aloud about the depth of Mr. Romney's commitment to bold conservative ideas, asking colleagues whether he was ''wishy-washy,'' as one of them recalled.
Mr. Ryan recalled that he had wanted specifics before he was willing to deliver his endorsement and the credibility it would carry in the right wing of the party. Mr. Romney delivered what Mr. Ryan was seeking in a series of phone calls and meetings, determined to win Mr. Ryan over. Their interactions became so commonplace that colleagues recalled spotting Mr. Ryan duck into a phone booth in the House to take a call from Mr. Romney.
''What I was very surprised by was how much he and Mitt were talking, even prior to Paul endorsing him,'' said Representative Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican who is close to Mr. Ryan. ''It was way beyond the perfunctory solicitations for support.''
In the course of those lengthy discussions, Mr. Ryan said, ''I got a very good idea of the kind of reformer he wants to be.''
Just days before the Republican presidential primary in Wisconsin in early April, Mr. Ryan said he would back Mr. Romney, canceling a long-planned family vacation to campaign with him. (Mr. Romney held off a final challenge in Wisconsin from Rick Santorum and from that point cruised to securing the Republican nomination.)
In the interview, Mr. Ryan said there was no agreement by Mr. Romney during their talks over the vice-presidential slot to adopt the Ryan budget in its entirety as their campaign platform. Mr. Romney, while noting that their Medicare approaches are largely the same and expressing general admiration for the budget that Mr. Ryan pushed through the House this year, has hedged about elements of the Ryan plan, including the scale of its proposed spending cuts.
''He is the policy leader,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''He is the top of the ticket, and I joined it knowing this and being extremely comfortable with it.''
Not long ago, their partnership might have seemed unlikely. Mr. Romney had been a blue-state governor who championed a state-run health program with an individual mandate and had been willing to increase fees on residents to solve a state budget deficit. Mr. Ryan was a Tea Party hero who gave the conservative movement a detailed policy alternative to employ against President Obama's spending and deficit increases and complex health care overhaul.
The story of how they came together offers insight into both how the Republican Party moved in Mr. Ryan's direction and how Mr. Romney came to embrace a vision of the size and role of government that, with the selection of his running mate, will define his campaign.
''The nominee is saying: 'I share this philosophy. It's not enough to get elected -- I want to fundamentally transform this government,' '' said Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican who became a symbol of small-government conservatism when he cut the collective-bargaining rights of unionized state workers last year.
After Mr. Romney's quick exit from the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, in which he was bedeviled by charges of ideological flimsiness, he went through a period of rigorous self-examination that coincided with a sea change in Republican politics. The party's base, inflamed by bank bailouts, the federal stimulus bill and the Obama health care program, moved rightward. The Tea Party-infused freshmen who entered the House after the 2010 elections paved the way for Mr. Ryan's ascendancy.
Mr. Ryan was a touchstone for Mr. Romney as he tried to ensure that his policies were in sync with the spiritual heart of the party, the House Republicans.
''The one thing we did not have the last time was a link to the emerging Tea Party or the hard right, somebody who could help Mitt work through things he wanted to say that would resonate,'' Mr. Rath said. ''I think Ryan has been able to do that.''
Between 2007 and 2010, most of their interactions were glancing: Mr. Romney called to congratulate Mr. Ryan on election night in 2010 and to wish him luck when he delivered the Republican response to the president's State of the Union address the next year.
But in Mr. Ryan, Mr. Romney saw shades of himself: a clean-cut numbers guy who favored the cold-eyed truths of actuarial tables over ideology for its own sake -- the kind of person, friends said, he would have recruited at Bain Capital when he was chief executive.
In Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan saw, over time, a presidential candidate as steeped in the messy minutia of policy as he was. ''A classic executive,'' Mr. Ryan said.
As the large and rowdy field of Republican presidential candidates sought Mr. Ryan's counsel last year, he said, Mr. Romney quickly emerged as the most invested and engaged in the issues most important to him.
''I met with Rick Perry and Newt -- all of them -- Huntsman,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''I would tell my colleagues, 'Romney is the one who understands this stuff.' ''
He became comfortable enough to send Mr. Romney memos over the past few months encouraging him to focus on bolder ideas and to offer greater specificity in his proposals.
Mr. Ryan made his own concessions to the relationship. This year, he adjusted the House Republican plan for reducing the cost of Medicare to guarantee that future participants could keep a traditional fee-for-service plan, just as Mr. Romney's plan does. ''We made our plan look more like his,'' Mr. Ryan said.
By the time Mr. Romney was ready to make a decision about a running mate two-and-a-half weeks ago, both men had seemed to have concluded that they would mesh well both politically and substantively.
''There was a comfort level with him organizationally,'' Mr. Rath said. ''They are both, in their essence, wonks.''

HEADLINE: The Birthplace of Obama the Politician

BYLINE: By PAUL TOUGH

 BODY:
From the back seat of Steve Gates's white Pontiac, Monique Robbins spotted Jasmine Coleman walking home from school alone. It was an icy December afternoon on Chicago's South Side, and Jasmine's only protection against the wind was a thin purple jacket. She looked cold. Gates pulled the car over to the curb, and Robbins hollered at Jasmine to get in.Jasmine was 16, and Robbins and Gates, who were both in their 30s, were her neighbors. All three of them lived in or around Roseland, a patch of distinctly subprime Chicago real estate that stretches from 89th Street to 115th Street, way down past the last stop on the El. Fifty years ago, Roseland was a prosperous part of Chicago, home to thousands of blue-collar workers, most of them white, employed by the South Side's many steel and manufacturing plants. But the plants closed long ago, the white residents all moved away and Roseland has become one of the worst-off parts of the city by just about every measure you can think of: unemployment rate, dropout rate, murder rate or just the barren, empty feel of the streets. 
Looking out for Jasmine and young people like her in Roseland and other blighted sections of Chicago was Gates's full-time job. He worked for an organization called Youth Advocate Programs (YAP), acting as a mentor to the students in public high schools who were deemed most ''at risk.'' I met Gates, who is a laid-back, burly guy with tight dreadlocks and penetrating pale gray eyes, in the fall of 2010, and for several months he let me watch him at work, becoming, in the process, my unofficial guide to Roseland.
Gates pulled the car up in front of Jasmine's house on Lafayette Avenue, and Jasmine ran in to fetch her brother, Damien, who was also enrolled in YAP. Their house looked small and battered. The metal gate guarding the front door was torn off its hinges, and there was a fist-size hole in the front window. Damien, a handsome 17-year-old, sauntered out to the car behind Jasmine, and the two of them piled in the back while Gates kept the car running for warmth.
''Man, it's critical in our house,'' Damien said with a little laugh.
''It's cold!'' Jasmine said. ''You go in there, you think you still outside.''
Damien and Jasmine's mother had been fighting a long, losing battle with the gas company. The previous summer, after she failed to pay the heating bill, the company shut off the gas line. Now there was no heat at all, winter had arrived in force and that hole in the living-room window let in a steady stream of frigid air all night long.
Gates still lives in the house he grew up in, just a few blocks away from Damien and Jasmine's home. Things in Roseland were pretty bad when he was growing up, Gates told me, but they are much worse today, and the web of poverty that he saw kids like Damien and Jasmine caught up in, a paralyzing mix of unforgiving economic conditions, destructive social influences and shortsighted personal decisions, seemed almost impossible for them to escape. Some days, it seemed to Gates that he was making progress with the kids in YAP, but often the job felt hopeless and depressing, an unbroken cycle of hospital visits, school-expulsion hearings, court dates and funerals. It was taking a toll on his mood and his health, he told me. He and his girlfriend of 15 years had just broken up. He was smoking way too many Newports. He couldn't sleep.
One reason Gates's job was so daunting was the simple fact of the multitude of problems the students were facing. One had just been sent to boot camp for stealing a car. Jasmine's ex-boyfriend was shot and killed one night while sitting in a car in a snowstorm. A girl in YAP told me she was so angry at her mother for not protecting her from the sexual predations of a relative that she used to come to school just to find somebody to fight. ''Just when you think it can't get worse, it gets worse,'' Gates said.
But the job was also daunting because it often seemed like such a lonely enterprise. When you're down in Roseland, it's easy to feel very far from the center of the nation's attention. The big question that Gates wrestled with every day -- how do you help young people growing up in poverty to succeed? -- was not too long ago a major focus of public debate in the United States. During the Johnson administration, the place to be for smart, ambitious young people in Washington was the Office of Economic Opportunity, the command center for the War on Poverty. In the 1990s, Washington once again saw a robust public discussion of poverty, much of it centered on the issue of welfare reform. But not today. It is not that poverty itself has disappeared. In 1966, at the height of the War on Poverty, the poverty rate was just under 15 percent of the population; in 2010, the most recent year for which data is available, it was 15.1 percent. And the child-poverty rate is 22 percent -- substantially higher today than it was then. And yet as a political issue, especially during this presidential campaign season, poverty has receded almost to silence.
If any American president might have been expected to focus his attention on Roseland and its problems, it would be Barack Obama. The neighborhood, as it happens, played a critical role in Obama's personal and political history. As a young community organizer, he worked in Roseland and at a nearby low-rise housing project called Altgeld Gardens for three years in the late 1980s; it was in these communities, Obama said in the speech announcing his presidential run, that he ''received the best education I ever had.'' And when he finally left Roseland, for Harvard Law School and a political career, he did so, he said, to gain the knowledge and the resources that would allow him to eventually return and tackle the neighborhood's problems anew.
When Obama ran for president the first time, urban poverty was a major policy focus for his campaign. Senator Obama gave speeches on the issue, his campaign Web site had a dedicated poverty section with a variety of policy proposals, and in his platform, he committed his administration to ''eradicating poverty,'' pledging that ''working together, we can cut poverty in half within 10 years.'' But the official poverty rate has continued to rise under Obama. In May, Bob Herbert, the former New York Times Op-Ed columnist, castigated the president in the online magazine The Grio for his failure to address publicly the ''catastrophe'' of children growing up in urban poverty. ''Barack Obama can barely bring himself to say the word 'poor,' '' Herbert wrote.
The idea that Obama hasn't done much for poor Americans is simply not true; by some measures, he has done more than any other recent president. But Herbert is right that Obama has stopped talking publicly about the subject. Obama hasn't made a single speech devoted to poverty as president, and if you visit barackobama.com these days, you would be hard-pressed to find any reference to the subject whatsoever. As a result, he is missing -- so far, at least -- an important opportunity to change and elevate the national conversation on poverty. What we know about poverty, and specifically about its effect on children, has shifted markedly in the last few decades. New ideas are emerging from the fields of economics, neuroscience and developmental psychology. Four years ago, Barack Obama was the one politician in Washington who seemed attuned to those ideas and most concerned about addressing them. And the intellectual journey that led him to these new ways of thinking about poverty started in Roseland.
Obama arrived in Roseland in the summer of 1985 as a 23-year-old Columbia University graduate on a quest for a sense of purpose and belonging. It was a confusing, conflicted time to be black in Chicago. The election two years earlier of Harold Washington, the city's first African-American mayor, energized black residents, but many of them were still living in poverty, and whole sections of black Chicago seemed to be turning into war zones. The dispatches that journalists like Alex Kotlowitz and Nicholas Lemann filed from the city's gigantic high-rise housing projects during Obama's time in the city are shocking even today: children crawling on the ground to avoid bullets, apartments firebombed, a prolonged gun battle between gangs in two neighboring high-rise buildings that drew not a single police car in response.
Life in Roseland in those days was not as bad as it was in the high-rise projects like Cabrini-Green and the Robert Taylor Homes, but the neighborhood was changing, and as Obama conducted fact-finding interviews with local residents, he heard again and again the anxiety and fear that those changes were producing. In his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' Obama wrote that the middle-aged, working-class African-Americans he met in Roseland expressed satisfaction at what they had achieved in life: ''On the strength of two incomes, they had paid off house notes and car notes, maybe college educations for the sons or daughters whose graduation pictures filled every mantelpiece.'' But when they talked about the neighborhood's future, Obama wrote, ''our conversations were marked by another, more ominous strain.'' They worried about the neighborhood's trajectory of decline, ''the decaying storefronts, the aging church rolls, kids from unknown families who swaggered down the streets -- loud congregations of teenage boys, teenage girls feeding potato chips to crying toddlers, the discarded wrappers tumbling down the block -- all of it whispered painful truths, told them the progress they'd found was ephemeral, rooted in thin soil; that it might not even last their lifetimes,'' Obama wrote.
As Obama's time on the South Side progressed, he grew preoccupied by the fate of Roseland's young people, especially the teenage boys, who seemed increasingly directionless and hopeless. It was not just money they were lacking, he realized, but something deeper. As a boy, Obama spent several years in Indonesia, with a close-up view of third-world poverty, and in his memoir, Obama compared the lives of the children he saw in Altgeld Gardens with the lives of the children he saw as a boy growing up in the slums of Jakarta. In many ways, Obama wrote, the Indonesian slum-dwellers had it better. ''For all that poverty, there remained in their lives a discernible order,'' he explained. ''The habits of a generation played out every day beneath the bargaining and the noise and the swirling dust. It was the absence of such coherence that made a place like Altgeld so desperate.''
In the spring of 1987, Obama wrote, he began to feel that ''something different was going on,'' on the South Side. It was a subtle shift -- ''a change of atmosphere, like the electricity of an approaching storm'' -- but to Obama, that spring brought to Roseland the ''sense, shared by adults and youth alike, that some, if not most, of our boys were slipping beyond rescue.''
Steve Gates turned 14 in 1987; he and his peers in Roseland were precisely the rootless and wayward young men that Obama was so concerned about. When I asked Gates about that year, he said he, too, remembered it as a dark time. ''That was when crack really hit,'' Gates said. ''And that changed things. Before crack came into our neighborhood, I never heard gunshots.'' Before long, Gates was carrying a gun himself. And as the violence increased, he said, families with any kind of prospects left Roseland for the suburbs south of the Chicago city limits. The families that stayed behind more often than not were the ones that were falling apart. The only reason Gates survived to adulthood, he told me, was that his mother worked extra shifts as a bus driver to put him in Catholic school and then send him off to college.
In the fall of 1987, Obama traveled to Cambridge, Mass., for a conference at Harvard Divinity School, and as David Maraniss recounts in his recent biography, one of the talks Obama attended was by the University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson, who had just published his landmark book ''The Truly Disadvantaged.'' There is probably no book that did more to explain the changes that were taking place in neighborhoods like Roseland. Wilson identified a major shift in American poverty at that time. Sociologists define a neighborhood as being in ''extreme poverty'' if 40 percent or more residents are poor, and Wilson showed that from 1970 to 1980 in the five largest American cities, the number of poor people living in extreme poverty almost tripled. That degree of concentrated poverty, Wilson wrote, was extraordinarily toxic, especially to children, and it led, in neighborhoods like Roseland, to ''an exponential increase in related forms of social dislocation.''
The organizing techniques in which Obama was trained increasingly seemed to him inadequate to the social ills that Roseland faced. So Obama proposed something new: a ''youth-counseling network'' to provide mentoring and tutoring to teenagers while working directly with their parents -- a program that sounds quite a bit like YAP, in fact. But by that time, Obama had decided to apply to Harvard Law School.
He left Roseland with profoundly mixed feelings. He felt at times as if he were abandoning the South Side. But as he later described it in ''Dreams From My Father,'' he was able to convince himself that going to Harvard would be a natural extension of his work on behalf of Roseland's poor. An essential tenet of community organizing is that change comes from political power; going to Harvard, Obama reasoned, was a way of getting more of it. ''I would learn power's currency,'' Obama wrote, and then bring that knowledge ''back to where it was needed, back to Roseland, back to Altgeld, bring it back like Promethean fire.''
And indeed, Obama's approach to poverty as a politician was activist and innovative. Early in his presidential campaign, in July 2007, he gave an entire speech about poverty at a community center in Anacostia, a high-poverty neighborhood in southeast Washington. While Obama expressed support in the speech for some of the traditional, broad-brush Democratic antipoverty policies -- raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, expanding access to health care, improving educational opportunity -- his focus was on the need for new solutions to concentrated urban poverty, which he described as ''the cause that led me to a life of public service almost 25 years ago.''
With a nod to the ideas of William Julius Wilson, Obama made the case that inner-city poverty is qualitatively different from other strains of poverty. ''What's most overwhelming about urban poverty is that it's so difficult to escape,'' he said. ''It's isolating, and it's everywhere.'' Addressing this kind of poverty was neither simple nor straightforward, Obama said. ''If poverty is a disease that infects an entire community in the form of unemployment and violence, failing schools and broken homes, then we can't just treat those symptoms in isolation. We have to heal that entire community.''
Obama laid out an ambitious agenda to do just that. At its center was a proposal to expand the work of Geoffrey Canada and his organization, the Harlem Children's Zone, which takes an intensive and comprehensive approach to child development in a 97-block high-poverty neighborhood in central Harlem, providing poor children with not just high-quality charter schools but also parenting programs, preschools, a medical clinic, a farmers' market, family counseling and help with college applications. (My 2008 book, ''Whatever It Takes,'' is a profile of Canada and a history of the Children's Zone.)
''When I'm president,'' Obama said, ''the first part of my plan to combat urban poverty will be to replicate the Harlem Children's Zone in 20 cities across the country.'' With a candor unusual for a presidential candidate, Obama acknowledged the high price of his program: ''Now, how much will this cost?'' he asked. ''I'll be honest -- it can't be done on the cheap. It will cost a few billion dollars a year. . . . But we will find the money to do this because we can't afford not to.''
Looking back at the Anacostia speech today, what is striking about Obama's proposal, beyond its size and scope, was that he didn't conceive of it as just one more federal spending program. It was, instead, something more potentially disruptive: a thorough overhaul of existing federal aid to inner cities, a blueprint for a more coordinated, more effective, more responsive way to direct the often haphazard flow of government money into urban neighborhoods devastated by the multiple effects of concentrated poverty. It represented a break from the past: a new way of doing things in neighborhoods like Roseland.
As president, Obama has followed a very different path from the one he described in Anacostia. The Promise Neighborhoods program exists, but it is a small item tucked away in the discretionary budget of the Department of Education. Rather than devoting ''a few billion dollars a year,'' his administration has spent a total of $40 million on the program in the last three years, with another $60 million in grants going out to community groups later this year. A few other initiatives have focused on concentrated urban poverty, but they are mostly small and scattered. Instead, the antipoverty path that Obama has pursued looks more like a traditional Great Society Democratic approach: his administration has spent billions of dollars on direct aid to poor people, mostly working-poor families.
The reason for this shift in priorities, according to people in the Obama administration, was the economic crisis they inherited. As David Axelrod, Obama's former senior adviser and current chief campaign strategist, described it to me, ''We were essentially an economic triage unit, trying to prevent the country from sliding into a second Great Depression.'' The president's economic team during the transition was staffed mostly with centrist economists -- Lawrence Summers, Tim Geithner, Jason Furman -- but one of their top priorities, early on, was to send aid to poor people. A central tenet of Keynesian stimulus spending is that in an economic crisis, you try to get as much money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who will spend it right away, and the less money people have, the more likely they are to spend every dollar they receive from the government. The previous summer, Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, who was serving, at the time, as an adviser to the McCain campaign, testified before Congress on the need for an aggressive stimulus program. In his testimony, he included a handy chart, based on his own algorithm, that listed the ''Bang for the Buck'' that various stimulus measures would provide. According to Zandi's calculations, aid that went to wealthier Americans would not be very effective as stimulus: for every dollar that Congress cut from corporate taxes, the G.D.P. would gain 30 cents; making the Bush tax cuts permanent would boost it by 29 cents for every dollar added to the deficit.
Stimulus measures that gave money to poor and distressed families, on the other hand, would be much more productive: extending unemployment-insurance benefits would boost G.D.P. by $1.64 for every dollar spent. And at the top of Zandi's list was a temporary boost in the food-stamp program, which he calculated would produce $1.73 in G.D.P. gains for every dollar spent.
Jared Bernstein, who was Joe Biden's main economic adviser during the financial crisis, told me that Zandi's chart was taken very seriously by the economic team. ''Everyone was carrying around this list of multipliers,'' Bernstein said. ''And food stamps was always at the top. That had the largest multiplier.'' (Almost four years later, Bernstein still had the food-stamp multiplier committed to memory.)
Jason Furman, who is now the deputy director of the National Economic Council, was the subject of an outpouring of liberal outrage when he became the economic-policy director for the Obama campaign in the summer of 2008. (His critics mainly objected to positive statements he made about Wal-Mart and other multinational corporations.) But it was Furman who, in the early days of the transition, called Robert Greenstein, the head of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, to ask for a wish list of possible stimulus-spending initiatives for the poor. Greenstein told me that he and his colleagues drew up a long memo detailing different antipoverty programs that the White House might want to finance, and he sent it to Furman. A few days later, Furman called Greenstein with a complaint: his list wasn't long enough. ''He said, 'You need to think bigger,' '' Greenstein said. '' 'Give us more options.' '' As the economy continued to decline that fall, the numbers continued to increase; the total amount in the stimulus package that was targeted specifically at low-income Americans in 2009 topped $80 billion.
And so in 2009 and 2010, the Obama administration put a tremendous amount of money, very quickly, into the hands of low-income Americans. As part of the Recovery Act, the administration extended the eligibility rules for existing programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance, and the combination of the collapsing economy and the more generous rules meant the programs grew quickly. The number of individuals receiving food stamps rose to 45.1 million in 2011 from 27.4 million in 2007. From 2008 to 2010, an additional 6.8 million people, mostly children, began receiving Medicaid. Temporary changes in the eligibility criteria for various tax credits, including the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit, produced tax refunds for millions of low-income workers, often totaling thousands of dollars a year.
And while it is true that the Census Bureau's official poverty figures have grown steadily worse under Obama, rising to 15.1 percent of Americans under the poverty line in 2010 from 13.2 percent in 2008, those dismal numbers come with a significant caveat. When government statisticians calculate the poverty rate, they include only cash income. And over the last two decades, and especially during the Obama administration, the way the federal government gives aid to poor people has shifted away from cash transfers toward noncash transfers -- food stamps, Medicaid subsidies, housing vouchers -- none of which are included in a family's income for the purposes of poverty statistics. If you do count food stamps and other noncash aid, the poverty rate has, according to some calculations, not gone up much at all during the Obama administration, during the worst economic crisis in 70 years. That is a remarkable accomplishment. When I asked William Julius Wilson last month for his thoughts on the current administration's antipoverty efforts, he said that Obama had ''done more for lower-income Americans than any president since Lyndon Baines Johnson.''
In Roseland, the stimulus may not have made things much better, but it stopped them from getting much worse. Food stamps helped some families get enough to eat, teenagers got summer jobs, some tenants received help with their rent. A stimulus grant to the Chicago public schools helped pay for the YAP program, which let Steve Gates start working with children like Jasmine and Damien. But it was, by definition, a temporary fix.
When administration officials talk about longer-term solutions to poverty these days, they often talk about education. And the cabinet member who expresses the most personal concern about the plight of disadvantaged children is Arne Duncan, the education secretary. Before arriving in Washington, Duncan was the chief executive of the Chicago Public Schools. There, he put a high priority on overhauling the city's failing high schools, many of which were on the South Side, and as education secretary, he expanded that effort by adding more than $3 billion to a federal program to turn around 1,300 of the lowest-performing schools in the country. ''What I fundamentally believe -- and what the president believes,'' Duncan told me, ''is that the only way to end poverty is through education.''
There is a growing body of evidence that for many low-income children, a great school can provide a route out of poverty. And Duncan is a firm believer in the idea that transforming the schools in neighborhoods like Roseland will in turn transform the lives of the children who live there. But the record of school reform in Roseland is not encouraging. Jasmine and Damien attended Christian Fenger High School, a three-story redbrick hulk on 112th Street that, under both Duncan and his predecessor, was the target of multiple reforms -- from its brief incarnation as a math-and-science academy, complete with a $525,000 NASA-sponsored science lab, to the introduction of a ''transformation'' program partly financed by a large grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. But despite all the efforts, Fenger's academic results never really budged during Duncan's tenure. About half of each freshman class dropped out before graduation, and each year, only 2 or 3 percent of Fenger's juniors scored 20 or higher on the A.C.T., which is the college-readiness target of the Chicago Public Schools.
School reforms over the last decade have produced some notable successes for poor children. But there is a growing concern in education-policy circles that those reforms -- like charter schools that require a significant level of parental involvement -- tend to have a much higher success rate with better-off low-income students, the ones who come from more stable and capable homes. Chicago's public-school population is almost entirely low-income -- just one in eight students does not qualify for a federal lunch subsidy -- but within that population, some students are much more disadvantaged than others. Researchers from the University of Chicago's Consortium on Chicago School Research were able, recently, to identify a subset of students who were particularly disadvantaged, living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and unemployment, with high levels of crime and an elevated incidence of child abuse. The researchers found that these students were clustered at 46 public schools, which the researchers, borrowing a phrase from William Julius Wilson, labeled ''truly disadvantaged'' schools. These 46 schools were the targets of frequent reform efforts. But they were much less likely to respond positively to those reforms than schools with a less disadvantaged (but still poor) student body.
The divisions that the consortium's researchers found among Chicago's schoolchildren have an echo in national poverty trends. The Census Bureau tracks a category that the government calls ''deep poverty''; families are said to be in deep poverty if they earn less than 50 percent of the poverty line -- which means around $11,000 a year for a family of four, not including food stamps or other noncash support. The number of families in deep poverty grew sharply during the recent recession and its aftermath, and in 2010, the share of Americans whose families made less than half of the poverty line hit a record: 6.7 percent of the population, or 1 in 15 Americans. The numbers are even higher for children, disturbingly so. In 2010, 1 in every 10 American children lived in deep poverty.
This increase in deep poverty certainly has something to do with changes in the economy. But it has more to do with a shift, over the last two decades, in government aid to the poor. A working paper published last year by a team of economists led by Yonatan Ben-Shalom of Mathematica Policy Research tells the story of a growing divide. In 1984, federal aid to poor families was progressive, in the literal sense of the term -- the poorest families got the most help. Single-parent families below 50 percent of the poverty line received, on average, $1,231 (in current dollars) per month from the federal government. Those in what could be considered shallow poverty, between 50 and 100 percent of the poverty line, received $448. But over the following 20 years, that situation was reversed. Government aid to families in deep poverty fell by 38 percent on average, while aid to families in shallow poverty increased by 86 percent. By 2004, the government was actually giving more, each month, to families in shallow poverty than to families in deep poverty.
This shift is mostly the result of a series of legislative changes in the 1990s meant to encourage work among the poor -- among them the expansion of the earned-income tax credit and a law permitting children of single mothers working low-wage jobs to be covered by Medicaid. At the same time, government support for nonworking poor families began to drop sharply. The welfare-reform law passed by Congress in 1996 continued to provide cash aid to some poor families but did so with stringent requirements that adults who received that aid -- mostly single mothers -- either be working or actively looking for work. Over the last two decades, cash aid shrank steadily, and in many states, it has now all but disappeared. In Wyoming, just 314 families currently receive cash welfare. Illinois's caseload fell by 86 percent from 1997 to 2011. In Georgia, in 1996, more than 90 percent of poor families received cash aid. Now 8 percent of them do.
In theory, at least, this tough new approach makes economic sense; if you want to make low-wage work more appealing for poor adults, you need to make nonwork less appealing. A little carrot, a little stick. Where the theory breaks down is in the fact that these adults are raising children, and many of the adults -- like Jasmine and Damien's mother -- are having great difficulty doing so. Cutting their income, as the government has done over the last decade or two, seems unlikely to make them more effective parents, and it inevitably hurts their children.
There are now seven million American children whose families earn below 50 percent of the poverty line. And in the last decade, we learned quite a lot about what it does to children to grow up surrounded by the kind of everyday chaos that often accompanies life in a family that is earning less than $11,000 a year. Neuroscientists and developmental psychologists can now explain how early stress and trauma disrupt the healthy growth of the prefrontal cortex; how the absence of strong and supportive relationships with stable adults inhibits a child's development of a crucial set of cognitive skills called executive functions.
In fact, though, you don't need a neuroscientist to explain the effects of a childhood spent in deep poverty. Your average kindergarten teacher in a high-poverty neighborhood can tell you: children who grow up in especially difficult circumstances are much more likely to have trouble controlling their impulses in school, getting along with classmates and following instructions. Intensive early interventions can make a big difference, but without that extra help, students from the poorest homes usually fall behind in school early on, and they rarely catch up. When you cluster lots of children with impulse-control issues together in a single classroom, it becomes harder for teachers to teach and for students to learn. And when these same children reach adolescence -- unless someone like Steve Gates has managed to intervene -- they are more likely to become a danger to themselves, to each other and to their community.
Jack Shonkoff, a pediatrician who directs the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, is leading a campaign to translate the science of adversity and brain development into new policies to better serve American children living in deep poverty. He says that current government policies actually provide a pretty good way to identify the children who are going to need additional intensive help to succeed in school. If your parents can't handle the work requirements to get federal cash aid, then you're more likely to need extra help to perform well in kindergarten. But these children are often among the least likely to get additional specialized services. In other words, the way we direct services to poor children would work better if we did more or less the opposite of what we're doing today.
One afternoon in April of last year, I visited Fenger High with a YAP counselor named Sean Lett, and we ran into Damien and his mother. It was report-card pickup day, and Lett was acting, quite literally, in loco parentis, checking in with the teachers of all of his clients, sitting down with one and going over his report card with him line by line. When he saw Damien, he asked to see his report card, and it was awful -- lots of Ds and Fs. Lett lit into Damien right there in the hallway. ''This isn't good enough, man,'' he said, leaning in. ''You got to start handling your business, for real. No one else can do the work for you.'' His voice rose. ''Quit playing. This life is real, boy. How old are you?''
''Eighteen,'' Damien said.
''Eighteen? You gonna blink and be 21. Seriously.'' He put his hand on Damien's shoulder. ''I know you can do this, Damien. You just got to put your mind to it.''
Lett, when I first met him, told me that he saw his role as not just a mentor, but something more. ''A lot of our children are without fathers,'' he said. ''If you don't have a father figure in your life, you don't have discipline and structure, and without structure, you don't have anything. You have chaos.''
Lett's analysis has support from many of the academics who study how poverty has changed over time. Looking back on the lives and prospects of the American poor during President Johnson's War on Poverty, you can see two broad changes. In material terms, the trends have been mostly positive. Americans who live below the poverty line are much less likely to be hungry or malnourished today than they were then. A majority of families below the poverty line now have material possessions that would have been unthinkable luxuries in the 1960s: air-conditioning, cable TV, a mobile phone.
But while the material gap has diminished, a different kind of gap has opened between poor and middle-class Americans: a social gap. In the 1960s, most Americans, rich, middle-class and poor, were raising children in two-parent homes; they lived in relatively stable, mixed-income communities; they went to church in roughly similar numbers; their children often attended the same public schools. Today, those social factors all diverge sharply by class, and the class for which things have changed most starkly is the poor. Damien may have a cellphone, but he has never met his father.
The two social scientists who are most prominently chronicling these social changes today are Charles Murray, the conservative scholar, who wrote about them in his recent book, ''Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,'' and Robert Putnam, the progressive Harvard political scientist best known for his book ''Bowling Alone.'' What Murray and Putnam have each reported is that college-educated and well-off Americans today tend to raise their children in stable, two-parent families. Among this cohort, divorce rates have fallen over the last few decades. Rates of unmarried births are rising slowly, but they are still quite low. According to Putnam's data, churchgoing rates have held steady since 1990, measures of social connectedness have gone up and the amount of time parents spend interacting with their children, especially their infants, has risen sharply.
But among Americans at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale, things are quite different. Churchgoing has dropped since 1990 for less-educated and low-income Americans, and divorce rates have risen. Two-parent families are on the decline: in 2010, 88 percent of the children in the top third of the income distribution were being raised by married parents, and just 41 percent of the children in the bottom third were. While it's certainly true that many single parents are raising happy and successful children, these trends as a whole are taking a significant toll on low-income children.
''From a child-development point of view,'' Shonkoff told me, ''we know that being a child in a family at the bottom end of the disadvantage scale means that you're going to be less likely to get the kind of parenting or other care-giving that will lead to good outcomes and more likely to face the kind of adversity that leads to bad outcomes.'' For children, these social factors make a big difference -- not just in their current well-being, but also in their future economic prospects. This is a relatively new idea in the study of poverty, but it is one that is gaining acceptance among scholars: a critical factor perpetuating poverty from one generation to the next is family dynamics and their effects on child development. This means that if we want to improve social mobility, we need to find a better way to help disadvantaged parents and their children.
While this theory of poverty is still being debated by social scientists, it is not particularly controversial in poor neighborhoods. Obama saw it himself in Roseland. In ''The Audacity of Hope,'' Obama wrote that poor African-Americans were well aware of the role that family breakdown played in the perpetuation of urban poverty. As he put it, ''black folks can often be heard bemoaning the eroding work ethic, inadequate parenting and declining sexual mores with a fervor that would make the Heritage Foundation proud.''
I experienced something similar during my time in Roseland. Steve Gates is by no means a conservative, but when he talked about the root cause of the problems his YAP clients were facing in school and in life, he always came back to their home environments. ''Take a close look at our kids' family structures, and you get a perfectly clear picture of why they are the way they are,'' Gates told me. ''There is a very direct correlation between family issues and what the kids present in school. The lapses in parenting, the dysfunction -- it all spills over to the kids, and then they take that to school and the streets and everywhere else.''
Unfortunately, these social changes pose an enormous challenge to policy makers. Americans know how to use their government to remediate a certain kind of poverty. If a family does not have enough food to eat or money to survive, we know how to issue food stamps or cut a check. But when children are growing up in a home without the kind of stability and support and order that they need to succeed in life, Americans don't always know -- and certainly don't always agree -- on what we want the government to do. We generally agree that we want the government to help increase opportunity and social mobility. But we don't like the idea of the government meddling in the home lives of private families. And so we're in a dilemma: the biggest factor holding back social mobility for poor children may be one we don't have a good strategy to solve -- and it may be one we don't feel comfortable even addressing at all.
Given that political bind, what could President Obama do differently for young people like Damien and Jasmine? What Roseland needs is not necessarily a big new infusion of federal dollars. What it needs more than anything else is an antipoverty strategy that is much more comprehensive and ambitious than what exists there today, an approach that focuses on improving outcomes for children from birth through adolescence. Food stamps and other assistance are crucial, but parents like Damien's mother need help that goes far beyond that. Schools need to be better, yes. But better teachers and higher expectations can't on their own alter the pervasive influence of an entire neighborhood. And so the president could do what he pledged to do in Anacostia in 2007: create more programs that take on, in a direct way, the family dislocations that are holding many poor children back, like home-visiting programs for parents, intensive early-childhood education targeted at the most disadvantaged families and mentoring programs for teenagers, like YAP.
The Obama administration has, in fact, financed programs in all those fields, but in relatively small and uncoordinated ways, and often only temporarily. The stimulus grant that helped pay for YAP in Chicago ran out after two years. YAP's administrators lobbied school officials and Mayor Rahm Emanuel to continue the program with city money, but a year ago, YAP's funds were cut by nearly half, and next month, the program will end entirely. Steve Gates will lose his job.
And while it's almost a cliché among liberals that what Obama needs to do is give a few more good speeches, it really would make a difference for a president to talk publicly about the challenges of poverty policy in the candid and thoughtful ways that Obama did as a senator and in his first presidential campaign. When I asked Valerie Jarrett, Obama's longtime friend and mentor who is now a senior adviser to the president, about his relative silence on urban poverty, she said that the way the president spoke about poverty as a candidate in Anacostia -- as a unique problem specific to one group of Americans -- simply wasn't the right way for him to speak about it as president. A better approach, Jarrett said, was for the president to propose and support a set of broad programs that raised all Americans economically, an approach that she described as inclusive. She added: ''I think our chances for successfully helping people move from poverty to the middle class is greater if everyone understands why it is in their best interest that these paths of opportunity are available for everyone. We try to talk about this in a way where everyone understands why it is in their self-interest.''
It's a challenge for any politician in troubled economic times: how do you persuade voters to devote tax dollars to help the truly disadvantaged when the middle class is feeling disadvantaged itself? The problem is that universal economic progress will not help those in deep poverty -- or at least not enough. Places like Roseland need specific, targeted, effective help if they are ever going to change.
When I visited Roseland in June, almost two years after I first met Steve Gates, what struck me most was how much hadn't changed in the neighborhood. The storefronts were still mostly boarded up. The graduation rates were as low as ever. I went with Gates to yet another funeral of yet another young man who had been shot and killed. But Gates was trying to be positive. On a Friday night, he invited me to a YAP graduation celebration held in the basement of a Baptist church. Damien received a plaque, and he gave a little speech to his peers and mentors. He has two babies now, he said, and it's hard, but he also has a high-school degree and a job at a shoe store. The front window of his house is broken again, but it's summer, so it's not such a big deal.
It may well be that the kind of small, personal and incremental changes that have to take place in families like Damien's in order for him and his children to have any real hope of success are simply beyond the power of any government or any president. But for a couple of years, Steve Gates was, in a roundabout way, a representative of the federal government in Roseland, and the work he did, to me at least, pointed the way to a different and more productive kind of engagement with young people like Damien.
Finding a new approach won't be easy, of course. Back in Anacostia in 2007, Obama acknowledged that ''changing the odds in our cities will require humility in what we can accomplish and patience with our progress.'' But real change would take more than that, he said: ''Most importantly, it will require the sustained commitment of the president of the United States.''

 BODY:
From the back seat of Steve Gates's white Pontiac, Monique Robbins spotted Jasmine Coleman walking home from school alone. It was an icy December afternoon on Chicago's South Side, and Jasmine's only protection against the wind was a thin purple jacket. She looked cold. Gates pulled the car over to the curb, and Robbins hollered at Jasmine to get in.Jasmine was 16, and Robbins and Gates, who were both in their 30s, were her neighbors. All three of them lived in or around Roseland, a patch of distinctly subprime Chicago real estate that stretches from 89th Street to 115th Street, way down past the last stop on the El. Fifty years ago, Roseland was a prosperous part of Chicago, home to thousands of blue-collar workers, most of them white, employed by the South Side's many steel and manufacturing plants. But the plants closed long ago, the white residents all moved away and Roseland has become one of the worst-off parts of the city by just about every measure you can think of: unemployment rate, dropout rate, murder rate or just the barren, empty feel of the streets. 
Looking out for Jasmine and young people like her in Roseland and other blighted sections of Chicago was Gates's full-time job. He worked for an organization called Youth Advocate Programs (YAP), acting as a mentor to the students in public high schools who were deemed most ''at risk.'' I met Gates, who is a laid-back, burly guy with tight dreadlocks and penetrating pale gray eyes, in the fall of 2010, and for several months he let me watch him at work, becoming, in the process, my unofficial guide to Roseland.
Gates pulled the car up in front of Jasmine's house on Lafayette Avenue, and Jasmine ran in to fetch her brother, Damien, who was also enrolled in YAP. Their house looked small and battered. The metal gate guarding the front door was torn off its hinges, and there was a fist-size hole in the front window. Damien, a handsome 17-year-old, sauntered out to the car behind Jasmine, and the two of them piled in the back while Gates kept the car running for warmth.
''Man, it's critical in our house,'' Damien said with a little laugh.
''It's cold!'' Jasmine said. ''You go in there, you think you still outside.''
Damien and Jasmine's mother had been fighting a long, losing battle with the gas company. The previous summer, after she failed to pay the heating bill, the company shut off the gas line. Now there was no heat at all, winter had arrived in force and that hole in the living-room window let in a steady stream of frigid air all night long.
Gates still lives in the house he grew up in, just a few blocks away from Damien and Jasmine's home. Things in Roseland were pretty bad when he was growing up, Gates told me, but they are much worse today, and the web of poverty that he saw kids like Damien and Jasmine caught up in, a paralyzing mix of unforgiving economic conditions, destructive social influences and shortsighted personal decisions, seemed almost impossible for them to escape. Some days, it seemed to Gates that he was making progress with the kids in YAP, but often the job felt hopeless and depressing, an unbroken cycle of hospital visits, school-expulsion hearings, court dates and funerals. It was taking a toll on his mood and his health, he told me. He and his girlfriend of 15 years had just broken up. He was smoking way too many Newports. He couldn't sleep.
One reason Gates's job was so daunting was the simple fact of the multitude of problems the students were facing. One had just been sent to boot camp for stealing a car. Jasmine's ex-boyfriend was shot and killed one night while sitting in a car in a snowstorm. A girl in YAP told me she was so angry at her mother for not protecting her from the sexual predations of a relative that she used to come to school just to find somebody to fight. ''Just when you think it can't get worse, it gets worse,'' Gates said.
But the job was also daunting because it often seemed like such a lonely enterprise. When you're down in Roseland, it's easy to feel very far from the center of the nation's attention. The big question that Gates wrestled with every day -- how do you help young people growing up in poverty to succeed? -- was not too long ago a major focus of public debate in the United States. During the Johnson administration, the place to be for smart, ambitious young people in Washington was the Office of Economic Opportunity, the command center for the War on Poverty. In the 1990s, Washington once again saw a robust public discussion of poverty, much of it centered on the issue of welfare reform. But not today. It is not that poverty itself has disappeared. In 1966, at the height of the War on Poverty, the poverty rate was just under 15 percent of the population; in 2010, the most recent year for which data is available, it was 15.1 percent. And the child-poverty rate is 22 percent -- substantially higher today than it was then. And yet as a political issue, especially during this presidential campaign season, poverty has receded almost to silence.
If any American president might have been expected to focus his attention on Roseland and its problems, it would be Barack Obama. The neighborhood, as it happens, played a critical role in Obama's personal and political history. As a young community organizer, he worked in Roseland and at a nearby low-rise housing project called Altgeld Gardens for three years in the late 1980s; it was in these communities, Obama said in the speech announcing his presidential run, that he ''received the best education I ever had.'' And when he finally left Roseland, for Harvard Law School and a political career, he did so, he said, to gain the knowledge and the resources that would allow him to eventually return and tackle the neighborhood's problems anew.
When Obama ran for president the first time, urban poverty was a major policy focus for his campaign. Senator Obama gave speeches on the issue, his campaign Web site had a dedicated poverty section with a variety of policy proposals, and in his platform, he committed his administration to ''eradicating poverty,'' pledging that ''working together, we can cut poverty in half within 10 years.'' But the official poverty rate has continued to rise under Obama. In May, Bob Herbert, the former New York Times Op-Ed columnist, castigated the president in the online magazine The Grio for his failure to address publicly the ''catastrophe'' of children growing up in urban poverty. ''Barack Obama can barely bring himself to say the word 'poor,' '' Herbert wrote.
The idea that Obama hasn't done much for poor Americans is simply not true; by some measures, he has done more than any other recent president. But Herbert is right that Obama has stopped talking publicly about the subject. Obama hasn't made a single speech devoted to poverty as president, and if you visit barackobama.com these days, you would be hard-pressed to find any reference to the subject whatsoever. As a result, he is missing -- so far, at least -- an important opportunity to change and elevate the national conversation on poverty. What we know about poverty, and specifically about its effect on children, has shifted markedly in the last few decades. New ideas are emerging from the fields of economics, neuroscience and developmental psychology. Four years ago, Barack Obama was the one politician in Washington who seemed attuned to those ideas and most concerned about addressing them. And the intellectual journey that led him to these new ways of thinking about poverty started in Roseland.
Obama arrived in Roseland in the summer of 1985 as a 23-year-old Columbia University graduate on a quest for a sense of purpose and belonging. It was a confusing, conflicted time to be black in Chicago. The election two years earlier of Harold Washington, the city's first African-American mayor, energized black residents, but many of them were still living in poverty, and whole sections of black Chicago seemed to be turning into war zones. The dispatches that journalists like Alex Kotlowitz and Nicholas Lemann filed from the city's gigantic high-rise housing projects during Obama's time in the city are shocking even today: children crawling on the ground to avoid bullets, apartments firebombed, a prolonged gun battle between gangs in two neighboring high-rise buildings that drew not a single police car in response.
Life in Roseland in those days was not as bad as it was in the high-rise projects like Cabrini-Green and the Robert Taylor Homes, but the neighborhood was changing, and as Obama conducted fact-finding interviews with local residents, he heard again and again the anxiety and fear that those changes were producing. In his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' Obama wrote that the middle-aged, working-class African-Americans he met in Roseland expressed satisfaction at what they had achieved in life: ''On the strength of two incomes, they had paid off house notes and car notes, maybe college educations for the sons or daughters whose graduation pictures filled every mantelpiece.'' But when they talked about the neighborhood's future, Obama wrote, ''our conversations were marked by another, more ominous strain.'' They worried about the neighborhood's trajectory of decline, ''the decaying storefronts, the aging church rolls, kids from unknown families who swaggered down the streets -- loud congregations of teenage boys, teenage girls feeding potato chips to crying toddlers, the discarded wrappers tumbling down the block -- all of it whispered painful truths, told them the progress they'd found was ephemeral, rooted in thin soil; that it might not even last their lifetimes,'' Obama wrote.
As Obama's time on the South Side progressed, he grew preoccupied by the fate of Roseland's young people, especially the teenage boys, who seemed increasingly directionless and hopeless. It was not just money they were lacking, he realized, but something deeper. As a boy, Obama spent several years in Indonesia, with a close-up view of third-world poverty, and in his memoir, Obama compared the lives of the children he saw in Altgeld Gardens with the lives of the children he saw as a boy growing up in the slums of Jakarta. In many ways, Obama wrote, the Indonesian slum-dwellers had it better. ''For all that poverty, there remained in their lives a discernible order,'' he explained. ''The habits of a generation played out every day beneath the bargaining and the noise and the swirling dust. It was the absence of such coherence that made a place like Altgeld so desperate.''
In the spring of 1987, Obama wrote, he began to feel that ''something different was going on,'' on the South Side. It was a subtle shift -- ''a change of atmosphere, like the electricity of an approaching storm'' -- but to Obama, that spring brought to Roseland the ''sense, shared by adults and youth alike, that some, if not most, of our boys were slipping beyond rescue.''
Steve Gates turned 14 in 1987; he and his peers in Roseland were precisely the rootless and wayward young men that Obama was so concerned about. When I asked Gates about that year, he said he, too, remembered it as a dark time. ''That was when crack really hit,'' Gates said. ''And that changed things. Before crack came into our neighborhood, I never heard gunshots.'' Before long, Gates was carrying a gun himself. And as the violence increased, he said, families with any kind of prospects left Roseland for the suburbs south of the Chicago city limits. The families that stayed behind more often than not were the ones that were falling apart. The only reason Gates survived to adulthood, he told me, was that his mother worked extra shifts as a bus driver to put him in Catholic school and then send him off to college.
In the fall of 1987, Obama traveled to Cambridge, Mass., for a conference at Harvard Divinity School, and as David Maraniss recounts in his recent biography, one of the talks Obama attended was by the University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson, who had just published his landmark book ''The Truly Disadvantaged.'' There is probably no book that did more to explain the changes that were taking place in neighborhoods like Roseland. Wilson identified a major shift in American poverty at that time. Sociologists define a neighborhood as being in ''extreme poverty'' if 40 percent or more residents are poor, and Wilson showed that from 1970 to 1980 in the five largest American cities, the number of poor people living in extreme poverty almost tripled. That degree of concentrated poverty, Wilson wrote, was extraordinarily toxic, especially to children, and it led, in neighborhoods like Roseland, to ''an exponential increase in related forms of social dislocation.''
The organizing techniques in which Obama was trained increasingly seemed to him inadequate to the social ills that Roseland faced. So Obama proposed something new: a ''youth-counseling network'' to provide mentoring and tutoring to teenagers while working directly with their parents -- a program that sounds quite a bit like YAP, in fact. But by that time, Obama had decided to apply to Harvard Law School.
He left Roseland with profoundly mixed feelings. He felt at times as if he were abandoning the South Side. But as he later described it in ''Dreams From My Father,'' he was able to convince himself that going to Harvard would be a natural extension of his work on behalf of Roseland's poor. An essential tenet of community organizing is that change comes from political power; going to Harvard, Obama reasoned, was a way of getting more of it. ''I would learn power's currency,'' Obama wrote, and then bring that knowledge ''back to where it was needed, back to Roseland, back to Altgeld, bring it back like Promethean fire.''
And indeed, Obama's approach to poverty as a politician was activist and innovative. Early in his presidential campaign, in July 2007, he gave an entire speech about poverty at a community center in Anacostia, a high-poverty neighborhood in southeast Washington. While Obama expressed support in the speech for some of the traditional, broad-brush Democratic antipoverty policies -- raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, expanding access to health care, improving educational opportunity -- his focus was on the need for new solutions to concentrated urban poverty, which he described as ''the cause that led me to a life of public service almost 25 years ago.''
With a nod to the ideas of William Julius Wilson, Obama made the case that inner-city poverty is qualitatively different from other strains of poverty. ''What's most overwhelming about urban poverty is that it's so difficult to escape,'' he said. ''It's isolating, and it's everywhere.'' Addressing this kind of poverty was neither simple nor straightforward, Obama said. ''If poverty is a disease that infects an entire community in the form of unemployment and violence, failing schools and broken homes, then we can't just treat those symptoms in isolation. We have to heal that entire community.''
Obama laid out an ambitious agenda to do just that. At its center was a proposal to expand the work of Geoffrey Canada and his organization, the Harlem Children's Zone, which takes an intensive and comprehensive approach to child development in a 97-block high-poverty neighborhood in central Harlem, providing poor children with not just high-quality charter schools but also parenting programs, preschools, a medical clinic, a farmers' market, family counseling and help with college applications. (My 2008 book, ''Whatever It Takes,'' is a profile of Canada and a history of the Children's Zone.)
''When I'm president,'' Obama said, ''the first part of my plan to combat urban poverty will be to replicate the Harlem Children's Zone in 20 cities across the country.'' With a candor unusual for a presidential candidate, Obama acknowledged the high price of his program: ''Now, how much will this cost?'' he asked. ''I'll be honest -- it can't be done on the cheap. It will cost a few billion dollars a year. . . . But we will find the money to do this because we can't afford not to.''
Looking back at the Anacostia speech today, what is striking about Obama's proposal, beyond its size and scope, was that he didn't conceive of it as just one more federal spending program. It was, instead, something more potentially disruptive: a thorough overhaul of existing federal aid to inner cities, a blueprint for a more coordinated, more effective, more responsive way to direct the often haphazard flow of government money into urban neighborhoods devastated by the multiple effects of concentrated poverty. It represented a break from the past: a new way of doing things in neighborhoods like Roseland.
As president, Obama has followed a very different path from the one he described in Anacostia. The Promise Neighborhoods program exists, but it is a small item tucked away in the discretionary budget of the Department of Education. Rather than devoting ''a few billion dollars a year,'' his administration has spent a total of $40 million on the program in the last three years, with another $60 million in grants going out to community groups later this year. A few other initiatives have focused on concentrated urban poverty, but they are mostly small and scattered. Instead, the antipoverty path that Obama has pursued looks more like a traditional Great Society Democratic approach: his administration has spent billions of dollars on direct aid to poor people, mostly working-poor families.
The reason for this shift in priorities, according to people in the Obama administration, was the economic crisis they inherited. As David Axelrod, Obama's former senior adviser and current chief campaign strategist, described it to me, ''We were essentially an economic triage unit, trying to prevent the country from sliding into a second Great Depression.'' The president's economic team during the transition was staffed mostly with centrist economists -- Lawrence Summers, Tim Geithner, Jason Furman -- but one of their top priorities, early on, was to send aid to poor people. A central tenet of Keynesian stimulus spending is that in an economic crisis, you try to get as much money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who will spend it right away, and the less money people have, the more likely they are to spend every dollar they receive from the government. The previous summer, Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, who was serving, at the time, as an adviser to the McCain campaign, testified before Congress on the need for an aggressive stimulus program. In his testimony, he included a handy chart, based on his own algorithm, that listed the ''Bang for the Buck'' that various stimulus measures would provide. According to Zandi's calculations, aid that went to wealthier Americans would not be very effective as stimulus: for every dollar that Congress cut from corporate taxes, the G.D.P. would gain 30 cents; making the Bush tax cuts permanent would boost it by 29 cents for every dollar added to the deficit.
Stimulus measures that gave money to poor and distressed families, on the other hand, would be much more productive: extending unemployment-insurance benefits would boost G.D.P. by $1.64 for every dollar spent. And at the top of Zandi's list was a temporary boost in the food-stamp program, which he calculated would produce $1.73 in G.D.P. gains for every dollar spent.
Jared Bernstein, who was Joe Biden's main economic adviser during the financial crisis, told me that Zandi's chart was taken very seriously by the economic team. ''Everyone was carrying around this list of multipliers,'' Bernstein said. ''And food stamps was always at the top. That had the largest multiplier.'' (Almost four years later, Bernstein still had the food-stamp multiplier committed to memory.)
Jason Furman, who is now the deputy director of the National Economic Council, was the subject of an outpouring of liberal outrage when he became the economic-policy director for the Obama campaign in the summer of 2008. (His critics mainly objected to positive statements he made about Wal-Mart and other multinational corporations.) But it was Furman who, in the early days of the transition, called Robert Greenstein, the head of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, to ask for a wish list of possible stimulus-spending initiatives for the poor. Greenstein told me that he and his colleagues drew up a long memo detailing different antipoverty programs that the White House might want to finance, and he sent it to Furman. A few days later, Furman called Greenstein with a complaint: his list wasn't long enough. ''He said, 'You need to think bigger,' '' Greenstein said. '' 'Give us more options.' '' As the economy continued to decline that fall, the numbers continued to increase; the total amount in the stimulus package that was targeted specifically at low-income Americans in 2009 topped $80 billion.
And so in 2009 and 2010, the Obama administration put a tremendous amount of money, very quickly, into the hands of low-income Americans. As part of the Recovery Act, the administration extended the eligibility rules for existing programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance, and the combination of the collapsing economy and the more generous rules meant the programs grew quickly. The number of individuals receiving food stamps rose to 45.1 million in 2011 from 27.4 million in 2007. From 2008 to 2010, an additional 6.8 million people, mostly children, began receiving Medicaid. Temporary changes in the eligibility criteria for various tax credits, including the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit, produced tax refunds for millions of low-income workers, often totaling thousands of dollars a year.
And while it is true that the Census Bureau's official poverty figures have grown steadily worse under Obama, rising to 15.1 percent of Americans under the poverty line in 2010 from 13.2 percent in 2008, those dismal numbers come with a significant caveat. When government statisticians calculate the poverty rate, they include only cash income. And over the last two decades, and especially during the Obama administration, the way the federal government gives aid to poor people has shifted away from cash transfers toward noncash transfers -- food stamps, Medicaid subsidies, housing vouchers -- none of which are included in a family's income for the purposes of poverty statistics. If you do count food stamps and other noncash aid, the poverty rate has, according to some calculations, not gone up much at all during the Obama administration, during the worst economic crisis in 70 years. That is a remarkable accomplishment. When I asked William Julius Wilson last month for his thoughts on the current administration's antipoverty efforts, he said that Obama had ''done more for lower-income Americans than any president since Lyndon Baines Johnson.''
In Roseland, the stimulus may not have made things much better, but it stopped them from getting much worse. Food stamps helped some families get enough to eat, teenagers got summer jobs, some tenants received help with their rent. A stimulus grant to the Chicago public schools helped pay for the YAP program, which let Steve Gates start working with children like Jasmine and Damien. But it was, by definition, a temporary fix.
When administration officials talk about longer-term solutions to poverty these days, they often talk about education. And the cabinet member who expresses the most personal concern about the plight of disadvantaged children is Arne Duncan, the education secretary. Before arriving in Washington, Duncan was the chief executive of the Chicago Public Schools. There, he put a high priority on overhauling the city's failing high schools, many of which were on the South Side, and as education secretary, he expanded that effort by adding more than $3 billion to a federal program to turn around 1,300 of the lowest-performing schools in the country. ''What I fundamentally believe -- and what the president believes,'' Duncan told me, ''is that the only way to end poverty is through education.''
There is a growing body of evidence that for many low-income children, a great school can provide a route out of poverty. And Duncan is a firm believer in the idea that transforming the schools in neighborhoods like Roseland will in turn transform the lives of the children who live there. But the record of school reform in Roseland is not encouraging. Jasmine and Damien attended Christian Fenger High School, a three-story redbrick hulk on 112th Street that, under both Duncan and his predecessor, was the target of multiple reforms -- from its brief incarnation as a math-and-science academy, complete with a $525,000 NASA-sponsored science lab, to the introduction of a ''transformation'' program partly financed by a large grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. But despite all the efforts, Fenger's academic results never really budged during Duncan's tenure. About half of each freshman class dropped out before graduation, and each year, only 2 or 3 percent of Fenger's juniors scored 20 or higher on the A.C.T., which is the college-readiness target of the Chicago Public Schools.
School reforms over the last decade have produced some notable successes for poor children. But there is a growing concern in education-policy circles that those reforms -- like charter schools that require a significant level of parental involvement -- tend to have a much higher success rate with better-off low-income students, the ones who come from more stable and capable homes. Chicago's public-school population is almost entirely low-income -- just one in eight students does not qualify for a federal lunch subsidy -- but within that population, some students are much more disadvantaged than others. Researchers from the University of Chicago's Consortium on Chicago School Research were able, recently, to identify a subset of students who were particularly disadvantaged, living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and unemployment, with high levels of crime and an elevated incidence of child abuse. The researchers found that these students were clustered at 46 public schools, which the researchers, borrowing a phrase from William Julius Wilson, labeled ''truly disadvantaged'' schools. These 46 schools were the targets of frequent reform efforts. But they were much less likely to respond positively to those reforms than schools with a less disadvantaged (but still poor) student body.
The divisions that the consortium's researchers found among Chicago's schoolchildren have an echo in national poverty trends. The Census Bureau tracks a category that the government calls ''deep poverty''; families are said to be in deep poverty if they earn less than 50 percent of the poverty line -- which means around $11,000 a year for a family of four, not including food stamps or other noncash support. The number of families in deep poverty grew sharply during the recent recession and its aftermath, and in 2010, the share of Americans whose families made less than half of the poverty line hit a record: 6.7 percent of the population, or 1 in 15 Americans. The numbers are even higher for children, disturbingly so. In 2010, 1 in every 10 American children lived in deep poverty.
This increase in deep poverty certainly has something to do with changes in the economy. But it has more to do with a shift, over the last two decades, in government aid to the poor. A working paper published last year by a team of economists led by Yonatan Ben-Shalom of Mathematica Policy Research tells the story of a growing divide. In 1984, federal aid to poor families was progressive, in the literal sense of the term -- the poorest families got the most help. Single-parent families below 50 percent of the poverty line received, on average, $1,231 (in current dollars) per month from the federal government. Those in what could be considered shallow poverty, between 50 and 100 percent of the poverty line, received $448. But over the following 20 years, that situation was reversed. Government aid to families in deep poverty fell by 38 percent on average, while aid to families in shallow poverty increased by 86 percent. By 2004, the government was actually giving more, each month, to families in shallow poverty than to families in deep poverty.
This shift is mostly the result of a series of legislative changes in the 1990s meant to encourage work among the poor -- among them the expansion of the earned-income tax credit and a law permitting children of single mothers working low-wage jobs to be covered by Medicaid. At the same time, government support for nonworking poor families began to drop sharply. The welfare-reform law passed by Congress in 1996 continued to provide cash aid to some poor families but did so with stringent requirements that adults who received that aid -- mostly single mothers -- either be working or actively looking for work. Over the last two decades, cash aid shrank steadily, and in many states, it has now all but disappeared. In Wyoming, just 314 families currently receive cash welfare. Illinois's caseload fell by 86 percent from 1997 to 2011. In Georgia, in 1996, more than 90 percent of poor families received cash aid. Now 8 percent of them do.
In theory, at least, this tough new approach makes economic sense; if you want to make low-wage work more appealing for poor adults, you need to make nonwork less appealing. A little carrot, a little stick. Where the theory breaks down is in the fact that these adults are raising children, and many of the adults -- like Jasmine and Damien's mother -- are having great difficulty doing so. Cutting their income, as the government has done over the last decade or two, seems unlikely to make them more effective parents, and it inevitably hurts their children.
There are now seven million American children whose families earn below 50 percent of the poverty line. And in the last decade, we learned quite a lot about what it does to children to grow up surrounded by the kind of everyday chaos that often accompanies life in a family that is earning less than $11,000 a year. Neuroscientists and developmental psychologists can now explain how early stress and trauma disrupt the healthy growth of the prefrontal cortex; how the absence of strong and supportive relationships with stable adults inhibits a child's development of a crucial set of cognitive skills called executive functions.
In fact, though, you don't need a neuroscientist to explain the effects of a childhood spent in deep poverty. Your average kindergarten teacher in a high-poverty neighborhood can tell you: children who grow up in especially difficult circumstances are much more likely to have trouble controlling their impulses in school, getting along with classmates and following instructions. Intensive early interventions can make a big difference, but without that extra help, students from the poorest homes usually fall behind in school early on, and they rarely catch up. When you cluster lots of children with impulse-control issues together in a single classroom, it becomes harder for teachers to teach and for students to learn. And when these same children reach adolescence -- unless someone like Steve Gates has managed to intervene -- they are more likely to become a danger to themselves, to each other and to their community.
Jack Shonkoff, a pediatrician who directs the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, is leading a campaign to translate the science of adversity and brain development into new policies to better serve American children living in deep poverty. He says that current government policies actually provide a pretty good way to identify the children who are going to need additional intensive help to succeed in school. If your parents can't handle the work requirements to get federal cash aid, then you're more likely to need extra help to perform well in kindergarten. But these children are often among the least likely to get additional specialized services. In other words, the way we direct services to poor children would work better if we did more or less the opposite of what we're doing today.
One afternoon in April of last year, I visited Fenger High with a YAP counselor named Sean Lett, and we ran into Damien and his mother. It was report-card pickup day, and Lett was acting, quite literally, in loco parentis, checking in with the teachers of all of his clients, sitting down with one and going over his report card with him line by line. When he saw Damien, he asked to see his report card, and it was awful -- lots of Ds and Fs. Lett lit into Damien right there in the hallway. ''This isn't good enough, man,'' he said, leaning in. ''You got to start handling your business, for real. No one else can do the work for you.'' His voice rose. ''Quit playing. This life is real, boy. How old are you?''
''Eighteen,'' Damien said.
''Eighteen? You gonna blink and be 21. Seriously.'' He put his hand on Damien's shoulder. ''I know you can do this, Damien. You just got to put your mind to it.''
Lett, when I first met him, told me that he saw his role as not just a mentor, but something more. ''A lot of our children are without fathers,'' he said. ''If you don't have a father figure in your life, you don't have discipline and structure, and without structure, you don't have anything. You have chaos.''
Lett's analysis has support from many of the academics who study how poverty has changed over time. Looking back on the lives and prospects of the American poor during President Johnson's War on Poverty, you can see two broad changes. In material terms, the trends have been mostly positive. Americans who live below the poverty line are much less likely to be hungry or malnourished today than they were then. A majority of families below the poverty line now have material possessions that would have been unthinkable luxuries in the 1960s: air-conditioning, cable TV, a mobile phone.
But while the material gap has diminished, a different kind of gap has opened between poor and middle-class Americans: a social gap. In the 1960s, most Americans, rich, middle-class and poor, were raising children in two-parent homes; they lived in relatively stable, mixed-income communities; they went to church in roughly similar numbers; their children often attended the same public schools. Today, those social factors all diverge sharply by class, and the class for which things have changed most starkly is the poor. Damien may have a cellphone, but he has never met his father.
The two social scientists who are most prominently chronicling these social changes today are Charles Murray, the conservative scholar, who wrote about them in his recent book, ''Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,'' and Robert Putnam, the progressive Harvard political scientist best known for his book ''Bowling Alone.'' What Murray and Putnam have each reported is that college-educated and well-off Americans today tend to raise their children in stable, two-parent families. Among this cohort, divorce rates have fallen over the last few decades. Rates of unmarried births are rising slowly, but they are still quite low. According to Putnam's data, churchgoing rates have held steady since 1990, measures of social connectedness have gone up and the amount of time parents spend interacting with their children, especially their infants, has risen sharply.
But among Americans at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale, things are quite different. Churchgoing has dropped since 1990 for less-educated and low-income Americans, and divorce rates have risen. Two-parent families are on the decline: in 2010, 88 percent of the children in the top third of the income distribution were being raised by married parents, and just 41 percent of the children in the bottom third were. While it's certainly true that many single parents are raising happy and successful children, these trends as a whole are taking a significant toll on low-income children.
''From a child-development point of view,'' Shonkoff told me, ''we know that being a child in a family at the bottom end of the disadvantage scale means that you're going to be less likely to get the kind of parenting or other care-giving that will lead to good outcomes and more likely to face the kind of adversity that leads to bad outcomes.'' For children, these social factors make a big difference -- not just in their current well-being, but also in their future economic prospects. This is a relatively new idea in the study of poverty, but it is one that is gaining acceptance among scholars: a critical factor perpetuating poverty from one generation to the next is family dynamics and their effects on child development. This means that if we want to improve social mobility, we need to find a better way to help disadvantaged parents and their children.
While this theory of poverty is still being debated by social scientists, it is not particularly controversial in poor neighborhoods. Obama saw it himself in Roseland. In ''The Audacity of Hope,'' Obama wrote that poor African-Americans were well aware of the role that family breakdown played in the perpetuation of urban poverty. As he put it, ''black folks can often be heard bemoaning the eroding work ethic, inadequate parenting and declining sexual mores with a fervor that would make the Heritage Foundation proud.''
I experienced something similar during my time in Roseland. Steve Gates is by no means a conservative, but when he talked about the root cause of the problems his YAP clients were facing in school and in life, he always came back to their home environments. ''Take a close look at our kids' family structures, and you get a perfectly clear picture of why they are the way they are,'' Gates told me. ''There is a very direct correlation between family issues and what the kids present in school. The lapses in parenting, the dysfunction -- it all spills over to the kids, and then they take that to school and the streets and everywhere else.''
Unfortunately, these social changes pose an enormous challenge to policy makers. Americans know how to use their government to remediate a certain kind of poverty. If a family does not have enough food to eat or money to survive, we know how to issue food stamps or cut a check. But when children are growing up in a home without the kind of stability and support and order that they need to succeed in life, Americans don't always know -- and certainly don't always agree -- on what we want the government to do. We generally agree that we want the government to help increase opportunity and social mobility. But we don't like the idea of the government meddling in the home lives of private families. And so we're in a dilemma: the biggest factor holding back social mobility for poor children may be one we don't have a good strategy to solve -- and it may be one we don't feel comfortable even addressing at all.
Given that political bind, what could President Obama do differently for young people like Damien and Jasmine? What Roseland needs is not necessarily a big new infusion of federal dollars. What it needs more than anything else is an antipoverty strategy that is much more comprehensive and ambitious than what exists there today, an approach that focuses on improving outcomes for children from birth through adolescence. Food stamps and other assistance are crucial, but parents like Damien's mother need help that goes far beyond that. Schools need to be better, yes. But better teachers and higher expectations can't on their own alter the pervasive influence of an entire neighborhood. And so the president could do what he pledged to do in Anacostia in 2007: create more programs that take on, in a direct way, the family dislocations that are holding many poor children back, like home-visiting programs for parents, intensive early-childhood education targeted at the most disadvantaged families and mentoring programs for teenagers, like YAP.
The Obama administration has, in fact, financed programs in all those fields, but in relatively small and uncoordinated ways, and often only temporarily. The stimulus grant that helped pay for YAP in Chicago ran out after two years. YAP's administrators lobbied school officials and Mayor Rahm Emanuel to continue the program with city money, but a year ago, YAP's funds were cut by nearly half, and next month, the program will end entirely. Steve Gates will lose his job.
And while it's almost a cliché among liberals that what Obama needs to do is give a few more good speeches, it really would make a difference for a president to talk publicly about the challenges of poverty policy in the candid and thoughtful ways that Obama did as a senator and in his first presidential campaign. When I asked Valerie Jarrett, Obama's longtime friend and mentor who is now a senior adviser to the president, about his relative silence on urban poverty, she said that the way the president spoke about poverty as a candidate in Anacostia -- as a unique problem specific to one group of Americans -- simply wasn't the right way for him to speak about it as president. A better approach, Jarrett said, was for the president to propose and support a set of broad programs that raised all Americans economically, an approach that she described as inclusive. She added: ''I think our chances for successfully helping people move from poverty to the middle class is greater if everyone understands why it is in their best interest that these paths of opportunity are available for everyone. We try to talk about this in a way where everyone understands why it is in their self-interest.''
It's a challenge for any politician in troubled economic times: how do you persuade voters to devote tax dollars to help the truly disadvantaged when the middle class is feeling disadvantaged itself? The problem is that universal economic progress will not help those in deep poverty -- or at least not enough. Places like Roseland need specific, targeted, effective help if they are ever going to change.
When I visited Roseland in June, almost two years after I first met Steve Gates, what struck me most was how much hadn't changed in the neighborhood. The storefronts were still mostly boarded up. The graduation rates were as low as ever. I went with Gates to yet another funeral of yet another young man who had been shot and killed. But Gates was trying to be positive. On a Friday night, he invited me to a YAP graduation celebration held in the basement of a Baptist church. Damien received a plaque, and he gave a little speech to his peers and mentors. He has two babies now, he said, and it's hard, but he also has a high-school degree and a job at a shoe store. The front window of his house is broken again, but it's summer, so it's not such a big deal.
It may well be that the kind of small, personal and incremental changes that have to take place in families like Damien's in order for him and his children to have any real hope of success are simply beyond the power of any government or any president. But for a couple of years, Steve Gates was, in a roundabout way, a representative of the federal government in Roseland, and the work he did, to me at least, pointed the way to a different and more productive kind of engagement with young people like Damien.
Finding a new approach won't be easy, of course. Back in Anacostia in 2007, Obama acknowledged that ''changing the odds in our cities will require humility in what we can accomplish and patience with our progress.'' But real change would take more than that, he said: ''Most importantly, it will require the sustained commitment of the president of the United States.''

HEADLINE: Obama Opens Up to 'Moneyball' Writer for Vanity Fair

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: The White House has granted Michael Lewis, the best-selling author of "Moneyball" and "The Big Short," extensive access to President Obama for an article in the October issue of Vanity Fair. 

 BODY:
The White House has granted Michael Lewis, the best-selling author of "Moneyball" and "The Big Short," extensive access to President Obama for an article in the October issue of Vanity Fair.
The magazine confirmed that Mr. Lewis has conducted a series of interviews with the president for the piece. But a spokeswoman for the magazine and the White House both declined to comment on the focus of their discussions or what the article will detail.
Generally, Mr. Lewis is said to be writing about leadership, according to someone who knows both Mr. Lewis and the president.
It would seem to be something of a risk for the White House - which is highly guarded about allowing journalists access to the president for longer-form articles and books - to agree to let in an author who is known for an exacting and at times unsparing approach.

His writings on the financial industry, for example, have been particularly unsympathetic, even damning. A former bond trader, Mr. Lewis has criticized Mr. Obama's handling of the financial crisis, saying the administration missed an opportunity to regulate Wall Street more effectively. "It essentially just extended the Bush administration's approach to the problem," he said in 2009. "There's an argument to doing what they've done. I don't think they've made it very persuasively."
That the article will be published so close to the election - and possibly develop into a book like many of Mr. Lewis's other Vanity Fair projects - seems to make it all the more risky for the White House to invite the author in. He has been spotted on Air Force One and on trips that the president has taken this year to places like Colombia.
Mr. Lewis's article will be published as another high-profile project, by Bob Woodward, about Mr. Obama is about to hit bookstores. Mr. Woodward's book on the president's handling of the economic crisis, called "The Price of Politics," will be released on Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: In Picking Ryan, Romney Makes an All-In Move

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The past five Republican vice-presidential candidates have all been quite conservative. But the four who preceded Ryan also had other strengths - and they were usually chosen in the hope of balancing out some perceived deficiency at the top of the ticket. 

 BODY:
The past five Republican vice-presidential candidates have all been quite conservative. But the four who preceded Representative Paul D. Ryan also had other strengths - and they were usually chosen in the hope of balancing out some perceived deficiency at the top of the ticket.
Dick Cheney was supposed to give gravitas and foreign policy experience to George W. Bush. Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin were supposed to provide youthful energy to the campaigns of George H. W. Bush and John McCain. (Mitt Romney has rarely been questioned for being "too old," perhaps because he looks much younger than his 65 years.)
Bob Dole's choice of Representative Jack Kemp of New York might be more closely comparable to Mr. Romney's selection of Mr. Ryan, but it is not a perfect one. Mr. Kemp, who was one of Mr. Ryan's mentors, was conservative on fiscal policy, like Mr. Ryan. But he was moderate on social policy, which Mr. Ryan is not. With Bill Clinton, Mr. Dole's opponent that year, performing unusually well for a Democrat in rural areas, Mr. Kemp had the potential to advance Republicans' standing in the cities.
Mr. Ryan seems to have been chosen specifically because of his conservative policy views and the way he articulates them. Mr. Romney could have done more to push his edge with independent voters by picking Gov. Chris Christie, who has won over moderates in New Jersey. He could have chosen Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, seeking to make headway with Hispanic voters, a critical demographic group.
There were candidates with a longer list of accomplishments, like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. There were those with more blue-collar appeal, like former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.
And there were candidates who could have had more impact on the electoral math. Mr. Ryan has some value to the ticket here - he could put Democratic-leaning Wisconsin into play. But he does not have as much potential to shift the balance as someone from a true tossup state with more electoral votes - like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio or Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia.
Most of these other contenders also take conservative policy positions. (That is probably a prerequisite for any Republican running mate these days.) But for better or worse, they offer them with more window dressing. Mr. Ryan presents his ideas more nakedly, and his brand is associated first and foremost with his conservatism.
Political theory dictates that this is a dubious choice for Mr. Romney, since Mr. Ryan's views, especially on Medicare, are not likely to poll well with the average voter.
It's too early to say how the pick will play out, but the early reviews on Mr. Ryan are lukewarm. State and national polls conducted since the selection have shown, on average, a one-point gain for Mr. Romney in his race against President Obama.
It might be thought that a one-point gain is better than nothing. But vice-presidential announcements in past elections have also produced bounces in the polls, and they have usually been larger, averaging about five percentage points. Mr. Ryan is underperforming so far on that basis.
Likewise, polls conducted on the personal favorability of a new vice-presidential candidate are typically strong at first, with the public initially saying they like the candidate by two to one or three to one. Mr. Ryan's favorability numbers are only slightly better than break even.
The other problem for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan is that polling bounces are, by definition, impermanent and can sometimes represent a high-water mark for the new ticket. As the campaign evolves, and the initial surge of enthusiasm for a candidate fades, a running mate's unfavorable ratings typically increase faster than his favorable ones do. It is possible that Mr. Ryan could have net negative favorability ratings by Election Day, as Mr. Romney does now.
But Mr. Ryan was not a choice made to win a popularity contest.
My first take on the selection was that Mr. Romney had looked at the polls, concluded that he was losing, and deliberately made a high-risk choice that could shake up the campaign - somewhat as Mr. McCain did with Ms. Palin four years ago.
Reporting since then, however, has suggested that Mr. Romney made the pick despite reluctance from his pollsters and others on his political team. So it looks increasingly as though he made a different sort of gamble - more of a true all-in move.
His bet is that the era of triangulation is over: that Republicans can win elections without having to compromise. Or, perhaps, in an era when so few voters are truly undecided, he thinks a robust turnout from the Republican base could be enough to get him the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
Will it work? Political theory, as I mentioned, argues against it, but Republicans have been moving to the right for a couple of decades now, and it is not clear that they have paid much of a price for it.
Since Mr. Bush's selection of Mr. Quayle in 1988, Republicans have won three presidential elections and lost three. They have controlled the House in 14 of the 24 years since then, and the Senate in 10 of 24. In other words, each party has still been winning elections about half the time.
With Mr. Ryan on the ticket, this year's election could serve as something of a referendum on the theory. A split outcome - Mr. Obama winning another term but Republicans holding control of at least one chamber of Congress - is still a strong possibility, and would not provide a clear verdict.
Potentially, however, the addition of a highly visible and controversial member of the House to the Republican ticket will increase the correlation between the Congressional and presidential races, making it more likely that one party will make a clean sweep.
If it is Mr. Obama and the Democrats, Republicans' success in the midterm elections of 2010 will look like a blip. Democrats would then have won four of the last six presidential elections - and five of six in the popular vote. They would have passed the most significant change to the welfare state in decades, Mr. Obama's health care law, and paid a relatively small price for it (the loss of one branch of Congress for two years). And they will have done this despite deep voter dissatisfaction with the direction of the economy and the country as a whole.
If Republicans win everything, Mr. Obama's success in 2008 will look like the outlier - one that could come to be seen as unavoidable given the financial crisis that was unfolding at the time. And the cost of George W. Bush's controversial war in Iraq? The loss of the House for four years. But by 2014, Republicans would have controlled it for 16 of the last 20 years, and the new Congress would seek to roll back Mr. Obama's health care law and other accomplishments that liberals made in the interim.
If Republicans are running on Mr. Ryan's ideas - and winning with them - they will be able to advance a more credible claim that they have a mandate from the public, and that our politics really have shifted to the right.
My view is that the choice of Mr. Ryan will reduce Mr. Romney's chances of winning the election relative to some of the alternatives. But there is a heck of a payoff if it works.

HEADLINE: Square Offers A Flat Rate

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Not long after Square made waves by announcing a partnership with Starbucks, the company is offering a deal to companies at the smaller end of the spectrum.Last week, Square, which offers a mobile payment service, said it would give small businesses in the United States -- those that process up to $250,000 a year in transactions through Square -- the option of paying a flat fee of $275 a month, rather than 2.75 percent of each transaction. At that rate, the deal makes sense for businesses processing more than $10,000 a month. 
Keith Rabois, Square's chief operating officer, said that he hoped the simplified pricing structure would encourage more small companies and business owners to sign up to use Square.
''The main reason people don't participate is because they are bewildered by it,'' he said. ''Most people have no idea what 2.75 percent per swipe will amount to. They'd rather be making cupcakes for their customers instead of trying to parse all this stuff.''
If a business on the flat-rate plan hits the $250,000-a-year level on transactions through Square, the 2.75 percent swipe fee will go into effect. And that fee will also apply to all transactions over $400.
For Square, it is another step in the race toward a digital wallet and a cashless economy. The company is aiming to edge out competitors also hoping to become the primary way people pay for things on a smartphone, which includes Microsoft and Google and new entrants like GoPago. JENNA WORTHAM

HEADLINE: 7 Weeks Into Connecticut Nursing Home Strike, the Accusations Fly

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WESTPORT, Conn. -- For the past 15 years, Paulette Clergy has washed, fed, dressed and joked with the nursing home residents at the Westport Health Care Center. The workers and residents, she said, often seemed like one big family.Yet Ms. Clergy said that for the past seven weeks, she had felt a painful rupture in that family, after she and about 90 of the home's other unionized workers went on strike.
All told, about 600 workers at five Connecticut nursing homes walked out on July 3, angry that the homes' owner, HealthBridge Management, had imposed changes that the workers said were major steps backward. Asserting that workers' benefits were too generous, the company eliminated six paid sick days and a week of vacation for many workers, froze pensions and required many workers to pay at least $6,000 more a year for family health care coverage.
''We had good benefits, but now they want to change everything,'' said Ms. Clergy, 40, a mother of four who earns about $630 a week, or $33,000 a year. ''What they're asking us to pay for health coverage, it's too much money. That would leave me with nothing.'' 
The dispute, involving members of the Service Employees International Union, has had unusual political ripples. Connecticut's governor, Dannel P. Malloy, and its attorney general, George Jepsen, have marched on the picket line, with Governor Malloy saying, ''They're trying to break the union, and we don't want that to happen.''
A HealthBridge spokesman, Ed Remillard, said the company ordered the rollback in benefits after nearly 17 months of unsuccessful bargaining. ''Negotiations were deadlocked,'' he said, ''over the union's intransigence in seeking an 8.5 percent company-funded pension contribution and free health care, which shows how out of touch they are with current economic reality.''
HealthBridge has accused workers of committing sabotage at two homes just before the strike began, saying that unknown employees at its nursing home in Danbury threw linens on the floor and removed wristbands from several residents and IDs from wheelchairs and doors. Union officials have in turn called HealthBridge a serial lawbreaker because the National Labor Relations Board has filed six separate complaints accusing the company of labor law violations, with one labor board judge ruling that the company had acted illegally in firing 48 workers and rehiring them the same day at lower wages.
The allegations of sabotage led The Hartford Courant to editorialize that the governor and attorney general should not be taking sides in this ''toxic mess.'' Moreover, HealthBridge has accused Mr. Malloy of embracing the strikers because the powerful union that represents them was a big donor to his campaign.
Deborah Chernoff, a union spokeswoman, said the sabotage allegations seemed peculiar because the company did not make them until two weeks after the strike began -- and only after the governor marched on the picket line. She condemned any sabotage.
Norman A. Solomon, a professor at the Charles F. Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University, said that with unions on the defensive and unemployment high, HealthBridge, like many other companies, had taken the offensive.
''It's not far from a perfect storm,'' Professor Solomon said. ''You have struggling low-wage workers and an employer who's decided to play hardball in a state that's usually pretty receptive to unions. You end up with a dispute that's gotten uglier than we're used to in New England.''
One day last week, 25 strikers -- almost all of them immigrants from Haiti, Jamaica or countries in Africa -- picketed outside the three-story nursing home here under an intense sun, chanting ''Scabs, go home.''
The strikers asserted that the walkout at HealthBridge's homes in Danbury, Milford, Newington, Stamford and Westport had thrown the facilities into disarray, creating much worse service for the residents. But Mr. Remillard said the facilities ''continue to maintain the highest standards of safety, care and services'' thanks to the 730 replacement workers the company had hired.
Cluda Lewis, a certified nursing assistant, summed up the opinions of many on the picket line when she said, ''I understand that they might need to do some cutting, but they're asking way too much of us.'' She said the jump in health care premiums dwarfed the 2.2 percent raise HealthBridge had offered.
David Pickus, the local president of the strikers' union, said the local had reached contracts with 50 other Connecticut nursing homes without a strike over the past 17 months. He said that those settlements called for a 6 percent raise over four years and a slight increase in pensions, and that the union had sought the same deal from HealthBridge.
''From the beginning in this dispute,'' Mr. Pickus said, ''HealthBridge wanted to weaken the union and take away the standards the workers have fought to get over a long period of time.''
The union has taken the battle to the New York University School of Law, home of the Straus Institute for the Advanced Study of Law and Justice, which was largely endowed by Daniel E. Straus, a law-school alumnus and trustee who is one of HealthBridge's two main owners.
Union members and student supporters have staged protests outside the institute in Washington Square and criticized Mr. Straus and HealthBridge online.
Asserting that many of his company's actions have violated the law, a student group has petitioned the law school to oust Mr. Straus from its board.
The law school's dean, Richard L. Revesz, described Mr. Straus as a ''good and honorable person,'' adding that ''these matters are in the course of being litigated, and I have no doubt all parties will comply with the ultimate ruling.''
Earlier this year, the labor board accused HealthBridge of breaking the law by locking out 100 employees at its nursing home in Milford to discourage workers from belonging to a union.
Last Tuesday, the labor board issued its sixth, most far-reaching complaint against HealthBridge, charging that it had bargained in bad faith and illegally imposed the benefit cuts. The labor board said HealthBridge should reimburse all 600 strikers for lost wages since the walkout began, amounting to an estimated $2.6 million.
Mr. Remillard, speaking for Mr. Straus as well as the company, said HealthBridge's bargaining efforts and putting in place its ''last, best and final offer'' were all done in good faith. He said HealthBridge has done nothing unlawful, adding that the board's charges were merely allegations to be adjudicated before a judge.
Both parties could then appeal, all the way to the federal courts.
Jonathan Cutler, a sociology professor at Wesleyan University, said HealthBridge seemed intent on breaking the union. ''Things seem to be going well with its use of replacement workers -- there has been no interruption of care,'' he said. ''But the union has been doing well on the legal front with the labor board, and that is putting a lot of pressure on the company.''

HEADLINE: A Media Personality, Suffering a Blow to His Image, Ponders a Lesson

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
When Lynda and Stewart Resnick, the Beverly Hills entrepreneurs who founded POM Wonderful, wanted to host a dinner at their Aspen home in 2006 to talk about the Iraq war, they assembled a list of 22 A-list guests, including Queen Noor of Jordan, George Soros, the financier, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.Leading the list of journalists was one of their favorite guests: Fareed Zakaria, the Indian-born Harvard Ph.D and foreign-policy specialist who had turned himself into an unlikely media star.
''When he speaks, I listen,'' Ms. Resnick said last week. ''I am just so thrilled that he exists, that there is someone like that.''
Since that evening, the Resnicks have watched Mr. Zakaria climb the media ladder to even greater heights -- running Newsweek International, writing columns for Time magazine and The Washington Post, hosting ''GPS,'' his own program on CNN, and becoming one of the favorite dinner companions of the power elite. 
But Mr. Zakaria's career suffered an abrupt setback recently after bloggers discovered that his column of Aug. 20 for Time magazine had passages lifted almost entirely from an article by the historian Jill Lepore that appeared in The New Yorker in April.
Mr. Zakaria quickly apologized. But within minutes, Time had suspended him for a month and CNN, which had posted parts of the column on its Web site, removed the article and suspended him until further notice. Both began investigations of his work, as did The Post.
On Thursday afternoon, Time and CNN said they had completed their reviews, found no evidence of plagiarism and restored Mr. Zakaria to his demanding schedule. Just as quickly as his employers had questioned his credibility, they rallied around him.
''He's one of the premier global intellectuals,'' said Richard Stengel, managing editor of Time. ''He will recover.''
Not that long ago, getting a column in Time would have been the pinnacle of a journalist's career. But expectations and opportunities have grown in the last few years. Many writers now market themselves as separate brands, and their journalism works largely as a promotion for more lucrative endeavors like writing books and public speaking.
The problem, as Mr. Zakaria discovered, is that stain from any scandal can spread across platforms, threatening the image he had carefully built.
''This guy is his own brand,'' said Jim Kelly, a former top editor at Time. ''So when doing that, you have to be really careful at how you extend yourself. The American corporate landscape is littered with disastrous brand extensions.''
In an interview on Friday in his CNN office, Mr. Zakaria again apologized for what he had called ''a terrible mistake.''
''This week has been very important because it has made me realize what is at the core of what I want to do,'' Mr. Zakaria said. He said he wanted to ''help people to think about this fast-moving world and do this through my work on TV and writing.''
He added: ''Other things will have to go away. There's got to be some stripping down.''
Even a stripped-down schedule for Mr. Zakaria seems ambitious. Mr. Zakaria said he works on his column ideas each weekend, reports them on Monday, writes on Tuesday and Wednesday and films his Sunday television program on Thursday.
Then there are the three books he wrote and one book he edited, the speeches, the Twitter postings, all while trying to spend mornings with his family. On a recent Friday he was trying to cook pancakes and French toast for his three children who range in age from 4 to 13.
Mr. Zakaria said he never had an assistant write a column in 25 years and that he began using a research assistant for his column only in the last year.
The mistake, he said, occurred when he confused the notes he had taken about Ms. Lepore's article -- he said he often writes his research in longhand -- with notes taken from ''Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,'' by Adam Winkler (W.W. Norton, 2011), a copy of which was on his desk at his CNN office.
Charles R. Eisendrath, director of the Knight-Wallace Fellows in journalism at the University of Michigan, said the episode reflects the economic realities underlying the media business, where magazines have become more dependent on single personalities.
''What happens in the media is the cult of personality,'' he said. ''The brands who have been forced to cut their staff have been forced to take on the brands of journalists.''
He compared what happened to Mr. Zakaria to some of the challenges that Dan Rather went through before his fall. Mr. Rather stepped down as anchor of ''The CBS Evening News'' after the network began an investigation into his report on ''60 Minutes II'' on President George W. Bush's National Guard record. He was doing four jobs while his predecessor Walter Cronkite was able to focus on one, Mr. Eisendrath said. ''As long as it's cheaper to brand individual personalities than to build staff and bolster their brand, they will do it,'' he said.
Friends say Mr. Zakaria, 48, has always been a multitasker -- and an ambitious one. Boykin Curry, said that when they were Yale undergraduates and Mr. Zakaria ran the Yale Political Union, he set up trips to meet the vice president, Isaac Asimov and Andy Rooney. At the same time, Mr. Curry said, Mr. Zakaria always seemed so well read that ''I figured he just never had to sleep.''
Gideon Rose, another close college friend of Mr. Zakaria's and managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, said that Mr. Zakaria has always been efficient even with his private time. As he approached middle age, Mr. Zakaria grew more committed to an exercise routine of running and tennis and stuck to it. In 2011, he briefly separated from his wife, Paula Throckmorton, but said they were back together.
''I wish I had one-tenth of the energy and productivity he has,'' Mr. Rose said. ''I am much more normal than he is and therefore much less disciplined.''
After spending eight years as an editor at Foreign Policy magazine, Mr. Zakaria established his public reputation with a cover article for Newsweek in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks titled ''Why They Hate Us.''
He publicly favored the Iraq invasion, although he argued for a multinational force and was critical of how the war was conducted. Moving to Time, he wrote ''How to Restore the American Dream'' a cover article and a CNN special.
Barrett Sheridan, a book researcher for Mr. Zakaria from 2008 to 2010, described his former boss as a ''phenomenally fast and lucid writer'' and said that he never knew Mr. Zakaria to have a ghostwriter.
Nisid Hajari, who worked with Mr. Zakaria at Newsweek from 2001 through 2010, said that, unlike some other columnists, Mr. Zakaria did his own research and writing. ''I've edited other writers who seem to me to be overextended, and you can see it in their copy,'' Mr. Hajari said. ''Fareed was never like that.''
Current and former colleagues say that Mr. Zakaria has been very deliberate in the assignments he will take on. Mark Whitaker, managing editor of CNN Worldwide and former editor of Newsweek, said that Mr. Zakaria told him he had turned down suggestions that he start appearing daily on CNN.
Former colleagues at Newsweek International said he was involved in choosing covers and generating ideas but did little line editing and was more the public face of the magazine.
Now he says he plans to cut back work with groups like the Council on Foreign Relations, the Little Shakespeare Company and the Yale University governing board. He also says he plans to make fewer speeches.
''This has been a tough week, but it has also been clarifying,'' he said. ''You find out what matters to you in life, who your friends are.''
Ms. Resnick counts herself as one of his admirers. ''It's not his character to do these things,'' she said about the plagiarism. ''I think it's a tempest in a teapot.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Packaging Seeks to Reveal A Warm Romney

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS;

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- They hail from the Broadway stage, the control rooms of NBC and the design studios that created sleek sets for Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart.Their craft is slick packaging and eye candy that audiences consume by the millions.
Their latest project? Selling the Mitt Romney story in prime time. 
Working from makeshift offices at a hockey arena here, a team of Romney advisers, producers and designers has been staging and scripting a program for the Republican National Convention that they say they hope will accomplish something a year of campaigning has failed to do: paint a full and revealing portrait of who Mitt Romney is.
Instead of glossing over Mr. Romney's career as a private equity executive, they will highlight it in convention videos and speeches as the kind of experience that has prepared him to be the economic steward the country needs.
And rather than shy away from Mr. Romney's faith, as some campaign aides have argued he should, they have decided to embrace it. On the night Mr. Romney will address the convention, a member of the Mormon Church will deliver the invocation. On Sunday, this new approach was apparent as Mr. Romney invited reporters to join him at church services.
The campaign aides are determined to overcome perceptions that Mr. Romney is stiff, aloof and distant. So they have built one of the most intricate set pieces ever designed for a convention -- a $2.5 million Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired theatrical stage. From its dark-wood finish to the brightly glowing high-resolution screens in the rafters that look like skylights, every aspect of the stage has been designed to convey warmth, approachability and openness.
Conventions no longer command the kind of public attention they once did, and their very slickness can conspire against addressing the kinds of perception problems Mr. Romney faces. So one recent morning as Mr. Romney's image makers -- a team that includes many people who have never worked on a political convention before -- scurried around on the sawdust-covered floor of the Tampa Bay Times Forum, they said an essential part of conveying who their candidate is will depend on making the four days of programming feel nothing like a convention at all.
''Usually the convention is so straight and staid and symmetrical, even-Steven,'' said Eddie Knasiak, one of the convention co-designers whose credits include projects for Ms. Winfrey, Martha Stewart and MTV. ''We were conscious of trying to make it not seem grandiose. We wanted it to seem inclusive, warm. It's not like anything you've seen at a convention before.''
The convention hall will have two musical stages -- one for surprise acts and another for the house band, which will be led by G. E. Smith, the former musical director for ''Saturday Night Live'' and guitarist for Hall & Oates.
To serve as executive producer, the Republican Party brought in Phil Alongi, a former politics producer with NBC News. Mr. Alongi has helped the Romney campaign fine-tune its programming so it fits neatly into the tight, one-hour block that the broadcast networks have dedicated to airing the convention in prime time. He has advised them on how to avoid certain pet peeves of producers, like running long at the top or bottom of the hour, when the networks have to cut away for commercial breaks.
Mr. Alongi, with his knowledge of what cameramen and producers will be looking for, has also ensured that Republican Party branding is placed in camera lines of sight. ''When they're flipping through the channels at home, I want them to know this is the Republican National Convention,'' he said.
The most ambitious element of stagecraft, however, will be the podium -- which features 13 different video screens -- the largest about 29 feet by 12 feet, the smallest about 8 feet by 8 feet and movable. All the screens will be framed in dark wood.
''Even the frames are designed to give it a sense that you're not looking at a stage, you're looking into someone's living room,'' said Russ Schriefer, one of Mr. Romney's senior advisers who is running the convention planning for the campaign.
From the six-feet-high podium, staircases slope into the audience. The intended symbolism: Mr. Romney is open and approachable, not distant and far above.
Along with other props -- including a digital clock mounted to one of the arena's upper rings that will show the national debt ticking ever-higher -- the video screens will help augment whatever messages a speaker is trying to convey, be it images of woeful-looking Americans to convey that President Obama has mismanaged the economy or pictures of the Romney children that speak to the candidate's deep bonds with his family.
Mr. Romney, who as the planner for the Salt Lake City Olympics has experience coordinating large-scale events, has had a direct hand in shaping some major aspects of the convention, from the podium design to the theme, ''A Better Future,'' which he personally approved.
When his aides showed him an early proposal for the set, a more modern stage with features like steps that would light up, he told them to go back to the drawing board.
How to approach his religion, a topic that he usually avoids speaking about beyond the most general terms, is a question that has long divided his campaign staff. But in the end, they decided to confront it head on. In addition to the invocation, Mr. Romney's work as a bishop in the Mormon Church will be on display.
Despite concerns that his religion might alienate evangelicals and other conservatives, Mr. Romney and his advisers hope that his faith ultimately will be seen as a sign of strength of character, and his time as bishop as an example of his willingness to serve when called.
There is still the question of whether four nights of slickly produced biographical videos, elaborate staging and gushing speeches can change the dynamics of the presidential campaign or alter impressions of a man who has been a national figure for most of the last decade.
Still, Mr. Romney's advisers see it as a chance at a fresh start.
''This is an opportunity for us to tell the Mitt Romney story in a way that people might not have seen,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''This is our chance to lay out the arguments for why Barack Obama has failed and why Mitt Romney would do better, and to do that using a platform where 39 million people tune in to hear him speak, a lot of them for the first time.''

HEADLINE: It's Not About Assange

BYLINE: By ANITA ISAACS. 
Anita Isaacs is a professor of political science at Haverford College and the author of ''The Politics of Military Rule and Transition in Ecuador.''

 BODY:
ECUADOR'S decision to grant asylum to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks wanted in Sweden for questioning over claims of rape and sexual molestation, has put the country in a political standoff with Britain, where he is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy.But the confusion in London has, in fact, little if anything to do with Ecuadorean-British relations and everything to do with regional and local politics in the Western Hemisphere. And it has little to do with protecting Mr. Assange's right to a fair trial or freedom of the press -- which Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has trampled upon at home.
Instead, it is an attempt by Mr. Correa to settle old scores with the United States, display his political prowess in the run-up to Ecuadorean presidential elections next year and make a power play for a leadership role on the Latin American left. 
Despite its avowed leftist leanings, the Ecuadorean government maintained relatively cordial relations with the United States during the early years of the Correa administration, which many attributed to Mr. Correa, who took office in early 2007, having obtained a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was warmly received while on an official visit in June 2010, during which Mr. Correa reportedly described his American experience as the ''happiest four years of my life.''
That relationship soured in early April 2011, when the Ecuadorean government expelled the American ambassador, Heather M. Hodges, angered by comments she had made in confidential cables, obtained by WikiLeaks, in which she accused Mr. Correa of appointing a corrupt police chief in order to have someone in the post ''whom he could easily manipulate.''
The topic of the cable was particularly sensitive given the timing: Mr. Correa had just survived the greatest challenge to his presidency -- and an attempt on his life -- in the form of a police mutiny following the passage of legislation designed to standardize pay for public employees, which would have curtailed pay and benefits for the police force.
The United States retaliated by declaring the Ecuadorean ambassador in Washington persona non grata. In an interview conducted with Mr. Assange in June 2012, Mr. Correa also expressed his anger at the ''imperialist attitude'' of Ms. Hodges, who refused to either apologize or retract her comments.
While the two countries have new ambassadors in place, the wound remains raw. The opportunity to settle a grudge with the United States by refusing to deliver Julian Assange to authorities in either Sweden or the United States, where he could be charged with leaking classified documents, was simply too good to miss.
In asserting Ecuadorean sovereignty and defying the United States, President Correa is also vying for hemispheric leadership. The declining health of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez, who has been battling cancer for over a year now, has created a potential opening in Latin America for someone else to move in as the standard-bearer of leftist, populist and nationalist opposition to the United States.
Indeed, a growing number of countries in Central and South America and beyond, including Colombia and Uruguay, appear willing to risk antagonizing the United States by advocating alternative solutions to drug-related violence, including legalizing drugs. Until now Mr. Correa has been a marginal voice in these debates, and hovering in Mr. Chávez's shadow in general. Thus his decision to thumb his nose at Washington by granting asylum to Mr. Assange enables Ecuador to seize the political limelight.
It helps, too, that this is a low-risk venture for Mr. Correa at home, with the possibility of significant political returns. Elected president twice, initially in 2006 and again following the passage of constitutional reforms in 2009, he is already the longest-serving president since Ecuador's return to democracy in 1997. Given that he has a 57 percent approval rating and a deeply fragmented political opposition, Mr. Correa's chances for re-election in February 2013 are strong.
Mr. Correa's trademark populist and confrontational style, displayed in his refusal to stand down in the face of a mutiny, serves to shore up his standing in a country with a long tradition of authoritarian politics. Granting Mr. Assange asylum provides a politically timely reminder of Mr. Correa's leadership style at home -- and his potential for regional leadership beyond Ecuador's borders.

HEADLINE: Both Sides in Campaign Try to Mobilize Their Base

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The selection of Paul D. Ryan to be the Republican vice-presidential candidate has galvanized both parties' bases. The Wisconsin congressman is Velcro for his side and Teflon for Democrats.That enthusiasm is critical in an election that will be awash in cash from the well-heeled campaigns and the outside groups unleashed by court and political decisions. Voters in Columbus, Ohio, or Orlando, Florida, will be carpet-bombed with television commercials. The volume of ads will be overwhelming -- it will be like underlining every paragraph in a book -- and many are likely to tune out.
Another aspect of this U.S. presidential election is a closely divided electorate with a smaller than usual bloc of uncommitted or persuadable voters, maybe in the high single digits. 
That suggests both sides will place a premium on turnout. That's what has been known as the ground game, the old-fashioned shoe-leather effort to identify and enlist supporters. But this time, it is lubricated by technology: social media, databases, microtargeting and microlistening.
Michael Whouley, the storied Democratic ground-game guru, and Curt Anderson, who helped mastermind President George W. Bush's successful mobilization of voters in 2004, say getting voters to the polls will be even more critical this time.
President Barack Obama's forces have started with an advantage: an extensive infrastructure built on the foundations of their 2008 effort. They say they have been further aided by the selection of Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, whose policies are anathema to most core Democratic constituencies.
Republicans counter that Mr. Ryan will energize their base to turn out in November. In addition, outside groups, funded by wealthy backers like the brothers Charles and David Koch, who own the private petroleum and mining conglomerate Koch Industries, are also working to turn out conservatives.
Contrasting the demographic vote in linchpin states in 2008, when Mr. Obama was victorious, and those where Republicans triumphed in the 2010 congressional elections underscores the importance of turnout. The figures are from the national exit polls.
In the last presidential race, 18 percent of the turnout consisted of voters ages 18 to 29 who went for Mr. Obama by better than two to one. Senior citizens -- 65 and older -- were a slightly smaller bloc and backed the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain of Arizona. By contrast, in 2010, the senior vote dwarfed the youth vote in Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Colorado, among other states.
The Obama campaign's biggest challenge will probably be to come close to the 2008 result with the youth vote. The environment is tougher -- Mr. Obama captured the imagination of many young voters last time, and that will be hard to replicate with an economy that is now punishing that age group.
The campaign says its efforts this time are more extensive and sophisticated -- targeting 16 million potential first-time young voters.
''We're making far more use of social media,'' said Buffy Wicks, the Obama campaign's national director of Operation Vote. ''Last time, we sent out only a handful of tweets; now this is a major vehicle to communicate with voters, especially young voters.''
Another question is whether Democrats can muster the same intensity among the president's most loyal constituencies, African-Americans and Latinos.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama carried Florida by less than 240,000 votes of the 8.4 million cast; he got 96 percent of the votes of African-Americans, who represent 13 percent of the state's electorate, and won handily among Latinos, one of seven Florida voters.
In 2010, turnout among both blacks and Latinos was 2 percentage points lower than in 2008. If all else stays the same and minority turnout is like 2010, Mr. Obama loses Florida.
Most Democrats are optimistic that black voters will turn out to re-elect Mr. Obama. They are more worried about a drop-off among Hispanics.
The flipside for Republicans is the white evangelical vote, about a quarter of the electorate in 2008 and one-third two years later. In Virginia, white evangelicals accounted for 28 percent of the vote in 2008 and went four to one for Mr. McCain. In the gubernatorial race a year later, they were 34 percent of the electorate. That would have virtually wiped out the Democrats' victory margin of 235,000 votes in the state in 2008.
Republicans are focusing heavily on this core constituency. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, run by Ralph Reed with the backing of wealthy conservative donors, is budgeting $10 million to turn out religious conservatives.
Mr. Reed, a legendary political operative in the evangelical community, says they expect to reach 18 million religious social conservatives, about a quarter of them Roman Catholics. Via the Internet, e-mail and mobile phones, Faith and Freedom plans to make 121 million contacts with these overwhelmingly Republican voters.
With $1 billion in television advertising saturating major markets in battleground states, Mr. Reed thinks there will be a return of sorts ''to how elections used to be determined. You got lists of voters and turned out your vote.''
Richard Nixon said the way to win the presidency was to mobilize the base, or the true believers, in the primary. Then rush to the center, where most voters are, in the general election. This election may be more about which side better mobilizes those true believers.

HEADLINE: In Picking Ryan, Romney Makes an All-In Move

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The past five Republican vice-presidential candidates have all been quite conservative. But the four who preceded Representative Paul D. Ryan also had other strengths - and they were usually chosen in the hope of balancing out some perceived deficiency at the top of the ticket.Dick Cheney was supposed to give gravitas and foreign policy experience to George W. Bush. Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin were supposed to provide youthful energy to the campaigns of George H. W. Bush and John McCain. (Mitt Romney has rarely been questioned for being "too old," perhaps because he looks much younger than his 65 years.)
Bob Dole's choice of Representative Jack Kemp of New York might be more closely comparable to Mr. Romney's selection of Mr. Ryan, but it is not a perfect one. Mr. Kemp, who was one of Mr. Ryan's mentors, was conservative on fiscal policy, like Mr. Ryan. But he was moderate on social policy, which Mr. Ryan is not. With Bill Clinton, Mr. Dole's opponent that year, performing unusually well for a Democrat in rural areas, Mr. Kemp had the potential to advance Republicans' standing in the cities. 
Mr. Ryan seems to have been chosen specifically because of his conservative policy views and the way he articulates them. Mr. Romney could have done more to push his edge with independent voters by picking Gov. Chris Christie, who has won over moderates in New Jersey. He could have chosen Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, seeking to make headway with Hispanic voters, a critical demographic group.
There were candidates with a longer list of accomplishments, like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. There were those with more blue-collar appeal, like former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.
And there were candidates who could have had more impact on the electoral math. Mr. Ryan has some value to the ticket here - he could put Democratic-leaning Wisconsin into play. But he does not have as much potential to shift the balance as someone from a true tossup state with more electoral votes - like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio or Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia.
Most of these other contenders also take conservative policy positions. (That is probably a prerequisite for any Republican running mate these days.) But for better or worse, they offer them with more window dressing. Mr. Ryan presents his ideas more nakedly, and his brand is associated first and foremost with his conservatism.
Political theory dictates that this is a dubious choice for Mr. Romney, since Mr. Ryan's views, especially on Medicare, are not likely to poll well with the average voter.
It's too early to say how the pick will play out, but the early reviews on Mr. Ryan are lukewarm. State and national polls conducted since the selection have shown, on average, a one-point gain for Mr. Romney in his race against President Obama.
It might be thought that a one-point gain is better than nothing. But vice-presidential announcements in past elections have also produced bounces in the polls, and they have usually been larger, averaging about five percentage points. Mr. Ryan is underperforming so far on that basis.
Likewise, polls conducted on the personal favorability of a new vice-presidential candidate are typically strong at first, with the public initially saying they like the candidate by two to one or three to one. Mr. Ryan's favorability numbers are only slightly better than break even.
The other problem for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan is that polling bounces are, by definition, impermanent and can sometimes represent a high-water mark for the new ticket. As the campaign evolves, and the initial surge of enthusiasm for a candidate fades, a running mate's unfavorable ratings typically increase faster than his favorable ones do. It is possible that Mr. Ryan could have net negative favorability ratings by Election Day, as Mr. Romney does now.
But Mr. Ryan was not a choice made to win a popularity contest.
My first take on the selection was that Mr. Romney had looked at the polls, concluded that he was losing, and deliberately made a high-risk choice that could shake up the campaign - somewhat as Mr. McCain did with Ms. Palin four years ago.
Reporting since then, however, has suggested that Mr. Romney made the pick despite reluctance from his pollsters and others on his political team. So it looks increasingly as though he made a different sort of gamble - more of a true all-in move.
His bet is that the era of triangulation is over: that Republicans can win elections without having to compromise. Or, perhaps, in an era when so few voters are truly undecided, he thinks a robust turnout from the Republican base could be enough to get him the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
Will it work? Political theory, as I mentioned, argues against it, but Republicans have been moving to the right for a couple of decades now, and it is not clear that they have paid much of a price for it.
Since Mr. Bush's selection of Mr. Quayle in 1988, Republicans have won three presidential elections and lost three. They have controlled the House in 14 of the 24 years since then, and the Senate in 10 of 24. In other words, each party has still been winning elections about half the time.
With Mr. Ryan on the ticket, this year's election could serve as something of a referendum on the theory. A split outcome - Mr. Obama winning another term but Republicans holding control of at least one chamber of Congress - is still a strong possibility, and would not provide a clear verdict.
Potentially, however, the addition of a highly visible and controversial member of the House to the Republican ticket will increase the correlation between the Congressional and presidential races, making it more likely that one party will make a clean sweep.
If it is Mr. Obama and the Democrats, Republicans' success in the midterm elections of 2010 will look like a blip. Democrats would then have won four of the last six presidential elections - and five of six in the popular vote. They would have passed the most significant change to the welfare state in decades, Mr. Obama's health care law, and paid a relatively small price for it (the loss of one branch of Congress for two years). And they will have done this despite deep voter dissatisfaction with the direction of the economy and the country as a whole.
If Republicans win everything, Mr. Obama's success in 2008 will look like the outlier - one that could come to be seen as unavoidable given the financial crisis that was unfolding at the time. And the cost of George W. Bush's controversial war in Iraq? The loss of the House for four years. But by 2014, Republicans would have controlled it for 16 of the last 20 years, and the new Congress would seek to roll back Mr. Obama's health care law and other accomplishments that liberals made in the interim.
If Republicans are running on Mr. Ryan's ideas - and winning with them - they will be able to advance a more credible claim that they have a mandate from the public, and that our politics really have shifted to the right.
My view is that the choice of Mr. Ryan will reduce Mr. Romney's chances of winning the election relative to some of the alternatives. But there is a heck of a payoff if it works.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cautious Moves On Foreclosures Haunting Obama

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After inheriting the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, President Obama poured vast amounts of money into efforts to stabilize the financial system, rescue the auto industry and revive the economy.But he tried to finesse the cleanup of the housing crash, rejecting unpopular proposals for a broad bailout of homeowners facing foreclosure in favor of a limited aid program -- and a bet that a recovering economy would take care of the rest.
During his first two years in office, Mr. Obama and his advisers repeatedly affirmed this carefully calibrated strategy, leaving unspent hundreds of billions of dollars that Congress had allocated to buy mortgage loans, even as millions of people lost their homes and the economic recovery stalled somewhere between crisis and prosperity.
The nation's painfully slow pace of growth is now the primary threat to Mr. Obama's bid for a second term, and some economists and political allies say the cautious response to the housing crisis was the administration's most significant mistake. The bailouts of banks and automakers are now widely regarded as crucial steps in arresting the recession, while the depressed housing market remains a millstone. 
''They were not aggressive in taking the steps that could have been taken,'' said Representative Zoe Lofgren, chairwoman of the California Democratic caucus. ''And as a consequence they did not interrupt the catastrophic spiral downward in our economy.''
Mr. Obama insisted the government should help only ''responsible borrowers,'' and his administration offered aid to fewer than half of those facing foreclosure, excluding landlords, owners of big-ticket homes and those judged to have excessive debts.
He decided to rely on mortgage companies to modify unaffordable loans rather than have the government take control by purchasing the loans, the approach advocated by his chief political rivals in the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain.
The administration did not push for legislation to make mortgage companies help borrowers. The financial incentives it offered were often insufficient. And it responded slowly to warnings, including those in letters homeowners sent to Mr. Obama, that companies were not cooperating.
The result was a plan that failed to meet even its own modest goals, data shows. Mr. Obama said in Arizona a few weeks after taking office that the government would help ''as many as three to four million homeowners to modify the terms of their mortgages to avoid foreclosure.'' As of May, 4.3 million people had applied for aid, but only one million had received government-sponsored modifications, according to the most recent data. About a third of those turned away lost their homes, were facing foreclosure or filed for bankruptcy.
In June 2011, Mr. Obama conceded that his administration had not done enough. ''And so,'' he said, ''we're going back to the drawing board.''
The government has since enriched incentives for companies and found new ways to press them to take action. More people are getting help, and the housing market has finally begun to recover, leading some of the president's allies to wonder what might have been.
''If the program they have now had been used at the beginning, it would have had a tremendous impact,'' said John Taylor, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an umbrella group for housing advocates.
But it is impossible to know whether a more forceful response would have produced better results. Administration officials argue that the missed opportunity was relatively small because mortgage companies were unprepared to help homeowners even if the government had pushed harder -- and the government was unprepared to take the companies' place.
''We operated at the frontier of what was possible,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, whose department oversaw the housing plan, said in a statement. ''These programs helped millions stay in their homes and millions more refinance to take advantage of lower interest rates.''
Help Wanted
The president gets a purple file each day holding 10 letters selected from the thousands that arrive at the White House. Almost as soon as the administration started its housing plan, he began to see complaints.
''I get letters every day,'' Mr. Obama said at a June 2009 news conference, ''from people who say, 'You know, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the bank is still not letting me modify my mortgage, and I'm about to lose my home.' And then I've got to call my staff and team and find out why isn't it working for these folks, and can we adjust it, can we tweak it, can we make it more aggressive.''
Some of the letters came from people the administration was not trying to help. But in Arizona the president had also made promises that the government was not ready to keep.
Mr. Obama had emphasized that borrowers with financial problems could get mortgage modifications even before missing a payment. But the administration did not define eligibility for that kind of pre-emptive aid, and more than 4,000 people called the Treasury Department during the first year to complain they had been turned away on the grounds they had not missed a payment.
People who lost their jobs generally could not qualify for modifications, but more than 18 months would pass before the White House persuaded mortgage companies to let people skip a few payments while looking for work.
And there were unsettling stories about mortgage companies repeatedly losing paperwork, rejecting qualified applicants and, with surprising frequency, foreclosing on the very customers they had just agreed to help.
The president's advisers, including Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, then director of the National Economic Council, played down the significance of these anecdotes. They saw no evidence of widespread problems, and besides, the broader strategy was working: the recession ended in June 2009, and housing prices posted the first monthly increase in three years.
In late July, eager to claim credit, the president bounded onto a high school stage in Raleigh, N.C.
''We knew that ending our immediate economic crisis would require ending the housing crisis, where it began, or at least slowing down the pace of foreclosures,'' he said. ''We didn't stop every foreclosure. We couldn't help every single homeowner who had gotten overextended, but folks who could make their payments with a little bit of help, we were able to keep them in their homes.''
The celebration was premature. By the end of 2009 only 66,465 borrowers had received government-backed mortgage modifications, and the pace of foreclosures continued to rise: more than 900,000 homes in 2009 and more than a million in 2010, more homes than in any American city save New York.
Peter P. Swire, Mr. Obama's special assistant for economic policy in 2009 and 2010, said both the administration's successes in repairing financial markets and its shortcomings in helping homeowners could be traced to the president's reliance on Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers.
''They were the most experienced financial crisis team that you could have,'' said Mr. Swire, an Ohio State University law professor. ''But when you have economists like Larry Summers working on things -- well, Larry Summers is a macroeconomist. He's not a case worker.''
Mr. Summers declined to comment on the record, but other current and former officials echoed Mr. Geithner's view that the administration had done well under the circumstances. Some said they underestimated the complexity of helping millions of people. Some said they tried too hard at first to protect taxpayers from unnecessary losses. But they agreed that the most important problem was beyond their control: the mortgage industry was set up either to collect payments or to foreclose, and it was not ready to help people.
''They were bad at their jobs to start with, and they had just gone through this process where they fired lots of people,'' said Michael S. Barr, a former assistant Treasury secretary who served as Mr. Geithner's chief housing aide in 2009 and 2010. ''The only surprise was that they were even more screwed up than the high level of screwiness that we expected.''
Let Them Eat Carrots
Former Representative Jim Marshall, a centrist Georgia Democrat who lost his House seat in 2010, was a staunch advocate of the administration's economic policies. He supported the banking bailout. He opposed a similar bailout for homeowners.
The administration made just one mistake, he said in a recent interview: it failed to rewrite the bankruptcy code.
Congressional Democrats wanted to change the law to permit ''cramdown'' -- a term that meant letting bankruptcy courts cut mortgage debts -- to put pressure on mortgage companies to modify loans and to provide a backup plan for borrowers who could not get the help they needed.
''There was another way to deal with this, and that is what I supported: forcing the banks to deal with this,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''It would have been better for the economy and lots of different neighborhoods and people owning houses in those neighborhoods.''
Mr. Obama sponsored cramdown legislation as a senator, endorsed it as a presidential candidate and called on Congress to pass it in the Arizona speech.
But he also repeatedly pressed the pause button. When proponents sought to add a cramdown to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in September 2008, Mr. Obama, who had flown back to Washington from the campaign trail, persuaded them to postpone the ''partisan'' effort as an example to Republicans, who said the measure would violate existing contracts.
In February 2009, after Mr. Obama became president, the White House asked Democrats not to attach the measure to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, fearing it would cost votes. In March, a watered-down version finally passed the House, but the mortgage industry rallied opposition to block it in the Senate.
Some officials said the White House had tried and failed. But other officials and participants, including Mr. Marshall, said it simply was not a priority.
''There wasn't enough political capital, time or energy,'' said Mr. Barr, the former Treasury deputy.
Mortgage companies, mostly owned by large banks, had ample resources to improve their treatment of troubled borrowers. But in the absence of any significant threat of punitive government action, they made little progress.
''Here we are in 2011, looking at high levels of foreclosures on the horizon, looking at significant failures in process, and nothing much has changed,'' Sarah Bloom Raskin, a Federal Reserve governor, said at a housing finance conference in February 2011.
''It seems to me we have reached the point where this sign of failure is hindering our economy's ability to rebound.''
How Far a Trillion Goes
A stone-faced building just north of the Capitol testifies to the federal response to the last national housing crash in the 1930s. The block-long office building housed the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which bought and refinanced roughly 20 percent of outstanding mortgages, most within two years of its creation in 1933, to help a million families avoid foreclosure. It even turned a modest profit before closing in 1951.
Mr. McCain surprised Mr. Obama during their second debate in October 2008 when he proposed investing $300 billion in such a program, echoing prominent Democrats. Some economists argued that debt reduction would hasten recovery not just by preventing foreclosures, but by spurring consumer spending, the nation's primary economic activity.
Mr. Obama, leading in the polls, dismissed the idea as a ''risky'' giveaway to mortgage companies. ''Taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pick up the tab for the very folks who helped to create this crisis,'' he said at a rally two days later in Dayton, Ohio.
After the election, top economic advisers led by Mr. Summers told the president-elect that debt reduction was not the best policy. Mr. Obama hoped to secure about $1.1 trillion from Congress to arrest the recession -- a stimulus package of about $750 billion and the second half of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout fund Congress had created in September. In a blueprint delivered at a mid-December meeting in Chicago, the advisers recommended that nearly all of the money be used to stabilize the financial system and for a package of tax cuts and government spending programs. That, they said, would stimulate growth more than paying down mortgage debts and hoping homeowners spent their savings.
Mr. Geithner told Mr. Obama that if even if an additional $100 billion were available, he still would not spend it on housing.
As for foreclosures, the advisers said more modest forms of aid would work just as well in most cases. Indeed, some economists argued that debt reduction would counterproductively persuade other borrowers to stop making payments in pursuit of a better deal.
But the decision ultimately was political. Mr. Obama and his advisers were convinced that even in the depths of an unyielding crisis, most Americans did not want their neighbors rescued at public expense. Several cited the response to the Arizona speech -- including the televised diatribe by a CNBC personality, Rick Santelli, that helped give rise to the Tea Party -- as proof that they were wise not to do more.
''There's a lot of risk aversion in Washington,'' said James B. Lockhart III, who participated in some discussions as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, administrator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ''and I don't think anybody knew how bad it was going to get.''
End of the Beginning
Eighteen months later, the administration's hopes for a rapid economic recovery had faded. By summer 2010, it knew that the recession had been deeper than initially understood and that the effects of the financial crisis were lingering longer than expected. The housing market still showed no signs of life.
Frustrated allies -- including Congressional Democrats and liberal advocacy groups not normally focused on housing, like the National Council of La Raza -- were shouting for new action to prevent foreclosures.
Still the White House held firm to its strategy. ''The most important thing I can do right now to keep people in their homes is to make sure the economy is growing,'' the president said in Albuquerque in September 2010. ''That's probably the thing that's going to strengthen the housing market the most over the next couple of years.''
Two days later, an important deadline passed quietly. The $700 billion bailout fund Congress had created in 2008 expired. The administration could no longer use the money to finance new programs even if it wanted to. It had left more than $300 billion unspent.
In November, Democrats lost control of the House, further constraining the administration's ability to address the housing crisis.
And right about then, in the fall of 2010, Mr. Obama began to reconsider. The frustrated president told his advisers that what they were doing was not good enough. He told them to revisit old ideas and to find new ones.
Mr. Obama was particularly incensed by mounting evidence that mortgage companies were breaking the law in some foreclosure cases. There was also new research underscoring the costs of foreclosures and the benefits of measures like debt reduction.
But perhaps most important was the simple reality that housing, left to fester, had become Mr. Obama's biggest economic problem.
At a virtual town hall in April 2011, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook read a question that began, ''The housing crisis will not go away.''
The president, perched on a stool, listened gravely and nodded. ''Well, it's a good question,'' he said, ''and I'll be honest with you -- this is probably the biggest drag on the economy right now.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Packaging Seeks to Reveal A Warm Romney

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- They hail from the Broadway stage, the control rooms of NBC and the design studios that created sleek sets for Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart.Their craft is slick packaging and eye candy that audiences consume by the millions.
Their latest project? Selling the Mitt Romney story in prime time.
Working from makeshift offices at a hockey arena here, a team of Romney advisers, producers and designers have been staging and scripting a program for the Republican National Convention that they say they hope will accomplish something a year of campaigning has failed to do: paint a full and revealing portrait of who Mitt Romney is.
Instead of glossing over Mr. Romney's career as a private equity executive, they will highlight it in convention videos and speeches as the kind of experience that has prepared him to be the economic steward the country needs. 
And rather than shy away from Mr. Romney's faith, as some campaign aides have argued he should, they have decided to embrace it. On the night Mr. Romney will address the convention, a member of the Mormon Church will deliver the invocation. On Sunday, this new approach was apparent as Mr. Romney invited reporters to join him at church services.
The campaign aides are determined to overcome perceptions that Mr. Romney is stiff, aloof and distant. So they have built one of the most intricate set pieces ever designed for a convention -- a $2.5 million Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired theatrical stage. From its dark-wood finish to the brightly glowing high-resolution screens in the rafters that look like skylights, every aspect of the stage has been designed to convey warmth, approachability and openness.
Conventions no longer command the kind of public attention they once did, and their very slickness can conspire against addressing the kinds of perception problems Mr. Romney faces. So one recent morning as Mr. Romney's image makers -- a team that includes many people who have never worked on a political convention before -- scurried around on the sawdust-covered floor of the Tampa Bay Times Forum, they said an essential part of conveying who their candidate is will depend on making the four days of programming feel nothing like a convention at all.
''Usually the convention is so straight and staid and symmetrical, even-Steven,'' said Eddie Knasiak, one of the convention co-designers whose credits include projects for Ms. Winfrey, Martha Stewart and MTV. ''We were conscious of trying to make it not seem grandiose. We wanted it to seem inclusive, warm. It's not like anything you've seen at a convention before.''
The convention hall will have two musical stages -- one for surprise acts and another for the house band, which will be led by G. E. Smith, the former musical director for ''Saturday Night Live'' and guitarist for Hall & Oates.
To serve as executive producer, the Republican Party brought in Phil Alongi, a former politics producer with NBC News. Mr. Alongi has helped the Romney campaign fine-tune its programming so it fits neatly into the tight, one-hour block that the broadcast networks have dedicated to airing the convention in prime time. He has advised them on how to avoid certain pet peeves of producers, like running long at the top or bottom of the hour, when the networks have to cut away for commercial breaks.
Mr. Alongi, with his knowledge of what cameramen and producers will be looking for, has also ensured that Republican Party branding is placed in camera lines of sight. ''When they're flipping through the channels at home, I want them to know this is the Republican National Convention,'' he said.
The most ambitious element of stagecraft, however, will be the podium -- which features 13 different video screens -- the largest about 29 feet by 12 feet, the smallest about 8 feet by 8 feet and movable. All the screens will be framed in dark wood.
''Even the frames are designed to give it a sense that you're not looking at a stage, you're looking into someone's living room,'' said Russ Schriefer, one of Mr. Romney's senior advisers who is running the convention planning for the campaign.
From the six-feet-high podium, staircases slope into the audience. The intended symbolism: Mr. Romney is open and approachable, not distant and far above.
Along with other props -- including a digital clock mounted to one of the arena's upper rings that will show the national debt ticking ever-higher -- the video screens will help augment whatever messages a speaker is trying to convey, be it images of woeful-looking Americans to convey that President Obama has mismanaged the economy or pictures of the Romney children that speak to the candidate's deep bonds with his family.
Mr. Romney, who as the planner for the Salt Lake City Olympics has experience coordinating large-scale events, has had a direct hand in shaping some major aspects of the convention, from the podium design to the theme, ''A Better Future,'' which he personally approved.
When his aides showed him an early proposal for the set, a more modern stage with features like steps that would light up, he told them to go back to the drawing board.
Not everything in the convention hall will be to Mr. Romney's tastes, however. The concession stands will serve alcohol, which observant Mormons do not consume.
How to approach his religion, a topic that he usually avoids speaking about beyond the most general terms, is a question that has long divided his campaign staff. But in the end, they decided to confront it head on. In addition to the invocation, Mr. Romney's work as a bishop in the Mormon Church will be on display.
Despite concerns that his religion might alienate evangelicals and other conservatives, Mr. Romney and his advisers hope that his faith ultimately will be seen as a sign of strength of character, and his time as bishop as an example of his willingness to serve when called.
There is still the question of whether four nights of slickly produced biographical videos, elaborate staging and gushing speeches can change the dynamics of the presidential campaign or alter impressions of a man who has been a national figure for most of the last decade.
Still, Mr. Romney's advisers see it as a chance at a fresh start.
''This is an opportunity for us to tell the Mitt Romney story in a way that people might not have seen,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''This is our chance to lay out the arguments for why Barack Obama has failed and why Mitt Romney would do better, and to do that using a platform where 39 million people tune in to hear him speak, a lot of them for the first time.''

HEADLINE: What Happens in Patna, Stays in Patna?

BYLINE: AMITAVA KUMAR


HIGHLIGHT: Amitava Kumar, writer and professor, asks natives of Patna, the capital of Bihar State to share experiences about their city. 

 BODY:
When the travel writer Trevor Fishlock went to my hometown of Patna, a journalist greeted him by saying, "Welcome to hell." A few days later, that particular journalist, who had been zealous in his defense of the freedom of the press, was beaten unconscious.
I read the above story in a piece by Norman Lewis titled "Through the Badlands of Bihar." But it is not only Western visitors like Mr. Fishlock and Mr. Lewis who portray Patna thus. If you have been keeping track of recent Bollywood movies, the badlands of Bihar have become fertile ground for reaping cinematic violence.
I am writing a book about Patna where I want to present what the people who live there think about it. A part of me believes that Patna might be the victim of bad press. Did you know, for instance, that somewhere in the dark recesses of history, Patna produced the best opium?
I remember making this discovery when I stood on a treadmill in a steamy gym in Florida. Bending down, I looked at what had drawn my attention. The picture in the glossy magazine left open on the treadmill showed swarthy, dhoti-clad men at work in an immense hall, arranging in neat lines circular mounds of - what?
The text above the picture offered a clue: "Connoisseurs, he says, argue as to the source of the finest opium. Some say the best opium comes from Patna, India, along the southern bank of the Ganges."
Anything good is so rarely said about Patna that my seldom-exercised heart burst with joy. I stole the magazine from the gym. And on returning home, I cut out the picture and the text and stuck it in my notebook.
That was 12 years ago. I have unearthed my notebook now because I have been seized by a simple idea. I am currently in Patna to see my parents. I would like to post flyers on the city's busy roads that ask, "Does the best opium still come from Patna?"
The inspiration for acquiring knowledge about a city in this way came to me from a recently published book, "Jeff, One Lonely Guy." This book was fashioned out of the 60,000 calls and text-messages received after Jeff Ragsdale, a writer and unemployed comedian, reacted to a breakup by posting flyers in New York City that simply said: "If anyone wants to talk about anything, call me. (347) 469-3173. Jeff, one lonely guy."
The responses were varied and fascinating:
All this from the first handful of pages. The writer David Shields, who was one of Mr. Ragdale's teachers, helped edit these field notes from that occult zone Mr. Shields calls "Occupy Loneliness." In Patna, however, where I have a dense network of family and friends, more mundane mysteries need to be solved.
In 1967, there was a famine in Bihar. I knew of this only because my father, a career bureaucrat, served in places like Purnea, a district in Bihar. But then I discovered a newsreel where I watched the actor Marlon Brando listening to villagers near Patna. I learned that Mr. Brando had come to Bihar as the ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund. You can hear the voices speaking in Hindi in the background complaining of hunger and grain being denied to them by corrupt officials.
And then the Englishman providing the voiceover says, "All in all, it was a modest performance from Brando, and definitely a nonspeaking part."
So that could be another flyer: "Did you see Brando in Patna in 1967?"
One of my earliest memories is of standing on a railway platform at Patna Junction, saying goodbye to an uncle leaving for the United States. My aunt, who is waiting for her visa, is standing with me along with other family members. It is probably the year 1967.
Inside the railway carriage where my uncle is sitting, there is another man, with garlands around his neck. This man is Jayaprakash Narayan, the political leader who just a few years later would lead the country in the fight against Indira Gandhi after she had declared a state of emergency. I saw J.P., as he was known then, in my adolescent years. On a ferry on the Ganges, I once even had him autograph my school notebook.
This leads to the question: "Did you meet J.P. in Patna?"
A local rangbaaz, a ruffian, on the street where I lived would ask the man selling soft drinks at the corner to give us free drinks. This rangbaaz gave up his denim jacket and began wearing khadi. He was now J.P.'s follower. The state of emergency hadn't ended. The reformed man went to jail, where the Bihar politician Lalu Prasad Yadav and others were his cellmates.
After Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of power, the rangbaaz I had known became a junior statesman. By the time I was in college, he had become a corrupt minister.
"What happened to the idealistic young men and women of the '70s?" I would like to ask that question, or another one belonging to the same caste: "Where is the black money in Patna?"
At a garage sale in a small town in upstate New York, I bought an old copy of "India: The Rough Guide." If I remember right, the book cost me 25 cents. Thumbing through the section on Bihar, I made the discovery that Napoleon's four-poster bed is in a museum in Patna. "What is Napoleon's bed doing in Bihar?"
It is easy for visiting writers to dismiss Patna. Shiva Naipaul set an example in 1982 by describing it as "a town without the faintest traces of charm, a sprawling caravanserai of dusty roads and fenny lanes; a junk-heap of peeling, crumbling buildings, of squatter colonies earthed in tracts of mossy mud; a swarming hive of -chewing, meager-limbed men."
But I know the sewers and the stench that Mr. Naipaul portrayed with such zeal. In fact, my parents have been living with a specific municipal problem -- Patna is a city where rats carried away my mother's dentures. And so this question is urgent and unavoidable: "Are you knowledgeable about killing rats?"

HEADLINE: Writing Off Poor Children

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Investing public funds in early childhood education not only is a proven investment but also is the moral thing to do, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Blame those single moms. If only they had married and stayed married, their children would have turned out so much better. 
This argument elicits furious responses from those who insist that single mothers deserve more respect, with good reason. The role that men play in the single-parent situation also deserves more attention. 
But the blame game persists. In a recent New York Times article on poverty problems, a youth counselor says, "If you don't have a father figure in your life, you don't have discipline and structure, and without structure, you don't have anything. You have chaos." 
The article goes on to say that this analysis has support from many academics who study poverty. But the "chaos" conclusion does not follow from research showing that, on average and controlling for easily measured factors like income and education, children raised by two biological parents tend to fare better than others. 
The "chaos" argument does provide a rationale for minimizing public expenditures on poor children, on the grounds that they are damaged human capital, nonperforming assets, sunk costs that can never be recouped. 
Step back from any moral concerns and focus on an economic balance sheet. Would greater public investments in poor children pay off for taxpayers? 
Many economists have demonstrated a high rate of social return on public expenditures on poor children. James Heckman makes a famously strong case for early childhood education.

A new book edited by Greg J. Duncan and Richard Murnane, "Whither Opportunity? Rising Inequality, Schools and Children's Life Chances," offers clear evidence that programs that increase income for families living in or close to poverty, like the earned-income tax credit, have positive effects on educational performance, as do programs that reduce economic segregation. 
In other words, human capital isn't produced in schools alone. In a thoughtful review of this book, Richard D. Kahlenberg explains, "If we want to make a difference in schools, we cannot ignore what goes on outside them." 
Improving educational outcomes for children should improve productivity, promote economic growth and generate higher future tax revenues. That's where the human-capital story leads.
But the chaos analysis suggests that public investments won't help fatherless children. As Charles Murray puts it in his book "Coming Apart," "When families become dysfunctional, or cease to form altogether, growing numbers of children suffer in ways that have little to do with lack of money." 
The sentence itself reads true. And many of us (not just children) suffer in ways that have little to do with lack of money. But if all single-parent families are defined as dysfunctional or nonexistent, public assistance to them is hardly likely to pay off. If we don't want to "throw good money after bad," we should just cut our losses. 
In the United States today, most births to women under 30 take place outside of marriage. The suggestion that these children are a lost cause provides a powerful excuse for ignoring those growing up in poverty. 
But leading researchers on family structure, including the Princeton sociologist Sara McLanahan, explicitly assert that government should do more to close the gap between rich and poor children. 
Unfortunately, this issue seems to have dropped off a national political agenda dominated by proposals to cut taxes and public spending. 
Single mothers have proved particularly vulnerable to the high unemployment and underemployment rates resulting from the Great Recession. The number of them living in poverty increased steadily between 2000 and 2010.
Most of them could easily have escaped poverty by relinquishing their children to foster care.
But they chose not to write off their responsibility.

HEADLINE: In Tuscany, a Mad Celebrant of Olive Oil

BYLINE: MORT ROSENBLUM


HIGHLIGHT: Is it the essential oil? Well, the dove that advised Noah he could finally park the Ark carried with it an olive sprig. Olive oil lit the lamp that miraculously burned for eight days, which Jews celebrate at Hanukkah. And the first Olympic competitors wore only a coating of it. 

 BODY:
VICCHIO, Italy - When the Renaissance started around here on Giotto's palette, back around 1300, olives had been oiling the works of Mediterranean civilizations for millennia. They symbolized peace, and a pleasant lunch.
Today in the Mugello, this outrageously beautiful patch of Tuscany, olives still mean happy meals in a tranquil setting. So Paolo Pasquali decided this was the perfect spot to recivilize a troubled world with what he calls an oleotheque. 
Mr. Pasquali collects fine oils from all over the map. Samples go to top chefs in Europe, the United States and Asia, and they experiment with flavor profiles. Visitors from across the world also come to Villa Campestri, his olive-oil resort up the road from Florence, to learn about the noble fruit.
As Mr. Pasquali himself cheerfully points out, he's a little loony on the subject. Spurning the specialists' lexicon, he sets olive oil nuances to music so people can detect high and low notes, harmonious chords and off-key cacophony.
"It is time to speak of respect for olive oil," he says. "It needs its own space."
That makes some sense down in his 13th-century cellar, as he fills his tiny beakers and speaks in a mix of Renaissance-man wisdom and carnival patter. 
Pax oliviana dates to the Old Testament. The dove that (reportedly) advised Noah he could finally park the Ark carried with it a simple message: an olive sprig. What kept the lamp lit for eight days, a miracle that Jews celebrate at Hanukkah? Olive oil.
The first Olympic competitors, over in Greece, wore only a coating of olive oil. As explorers widened the map, colonizers planted olive trees wherever they would grow. The Spanish, carrying essentials with which to settle a New World, planted groves in Mexico and Peru. 
Today Californians make excellent oil from trees that date to the first missions. Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans adapt old varieties to their distinct terroirs.
But for cooks and connoisseurs, little matches the sharp green nectar of Tuscany's holy trinity of olive oil: frantoio, leccino and the sharp-edged but fruity moraiolo.
Mr. Pasquali, 62, embraced oil with a convert's zeal. He taught philosophy at the University of Florence and then made a killing as a publisher of niche newspapers. He turned tradition on its head, running ads for free but fixing a high cover price. He sold the business in 1989 and bought the tumbledown Villa Campestri.
He whacked away the jungle that engulfed his 300-plus acres, and somewhere along the way he fell in love with the forgotten olive trees. He applied his contrarian logic: spend what's necessary to make excellent oil and teach people its value.
An engineer friend designed a high-tech improvement on Leonardo da Vinci's oil press. With simple crushing, massaging and slow-speed spinning, it yields barely half what an industrial machine would produce. But it's the good half.
"What do I care about the cost?" Mr. Pasquali said, with an airy wave of the hand. "I want the best."
For the Mozart of Moraiolo, that's the key. Whatever else ails today's world, we've still got good olive oil.

HEADLINE: Are Alternative Weeklies Toast?

BYLINE: DAVID CARR


HIGHLIGHT: A BuzzFeed writer eulogizes a Village Voice that hasn't existed for many years. 

 BODY:
Over the weekend, Rosie Gray, a former staffer at The Village Voice now at BuzzFeed, wrote that the men in charge of Village Voice Media had more or less the run the place into the ground. She pointed to staff layoffs on Friday at the newspaper, one more episode in a long stretch of downsizing at a publication that is part of a chain of weeklies.
The main problem, she said is,
they're not Voice people. And it's hard to explain the importance of being a Voice person if you're not one. The Voice, as marginalized and irrelevant as it has become, really was the voice of the city and of a certain kind of New Yorker. It was insouciant and jubilant, with sharply reported city politics pieces sitting next to art house movie reviews and sex ads. The afterglow of that leaves an impression on those of us who worked there, even if you're like me and were born well after the Voice's heyday.
The last part is the telltale. The version of the Voice that was the "the voice of a city" has not existed for many years. The cup of coffee Ms. Gray had at The Voice as an intern and the author of the "Runnin' Scared" blog may have made a strong impression, but The Voice has no shot of reclaiming a central role in a city that has four dailies covering New York - The Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times and now The Wall Street Journal - in addition to the myriad blogs and print products of New York magazine, The New York Observer, Gawker and Capital New York. The list goes on, but you get the idea. In a large market like New York, The Voice, which used to make a noise nationally, has a hard time standing above the metropolitan clutter.
Ms. Gray points to the chain's legal problems with Backpage.com, which critics have contended is used to market children and teens for sex work, as a significant distraction and a drain on resources. And she suggested that the cowboy tendencies of Village Voice Media's two principals - Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey - did not endear them to the staff.
But whatever their idiosyncrasies, those men aren't killing The Voice; the informational ecosystem is. The problem with so-called alternative weeklies is that they were often formed in opposition to the daily newspapers in their respective markets, offering a spicier take on civic events and cultural coverage that reflected what was actually nascent in various places. With dailies limping in almost every American market and the listings and classifieds that were the bread and butter of weeklies now all over the Web, alternatives are just one more alternative among many.
Mr. Lacey, in an e-mail, pointed out that with the current political campaign focused on a faltering economy, it's not surprising that his company is struggling, along with many other media companies.
"Of course it is disappointing to let Rosie Gray, or any staff person, go," he wrote. (Ms. Gray actually left the paper, she was not laid off.). "But her take on The Voice could not be more cynical or wrong: 'We had a sinking feeling that they'd be willing to hurt The Voice instead of shuttering or selling other papers in the chain,' she writes." 
He added: "Nothing like that ever happened, but her suggestion that in a properly ordered world other journalists are more expendable, well, it is almost as revealing as her imagining that her departure is, somehow, part of ."
And it's not just The Voice that is struggling among weeklies. The Chicago Reader, once a huge, successful weekly, has been sold to The Chicago Sun-Times, a transaction that would have been unthinkable when it was in its prime. The Washington City Paper, where I once worked, was recently sold to yet another owner. City Pages in Minneapolis, a very well regarded weekly owned by Village Voice Media, isnow down to two full-time writers.
The idea that Mr. Larkin and Mr. Lacey had - using private equity money to roll up over a dozen weeklies into a chain to give the company scale in the advertising marketplace and savings on the cost side - has not panned out, in part because it was a big bet at the wrong moment. (Two of the company's private equity funders backed away from the company because of the controversy over Backpage.com)
Smaller weeklies in smaller communities, much like the pattern that has held for dailies, seem to be relatively healthier.
"Small and midsize markets have more traction these days" said John Saltas, owner of The Salt Lake City Weekly. "They aren't bound to strategies formed half a continent away. Nor are they as burdened with crippling debt. On that score, Village Voice Media is no different than MediaNews or any daily chain that bit off more debt than it needed when engulfing and devouring and consolidating. In the end, it made some short-term savings (repurposing movie reviews, for instance), but the long term loss was the loss of local credibility."
Mr. Saltas said that he admired Mr. Lacey and Mr. Larkin for their approach to journalism and that they had published significant work for years in many markets. But he noted that chains like theirs were bound to have trouble in the current market, when small and medium-size newspapers are having a better time of it.
"Our percent of market is far larger than that of most big city papers - our 60,000 circulation is a higher percentage of population than say, the Chicago Reader's circ in a city of seven million," he said. "We have impact on even the smallest story. It's hard to miss us and other small/medium market papers in our markets. Thus, we've held our market share better than some."
There was a time when big metropolitan weeklies embodied the zeitgeist and hosted some of the best, or at least most provocative, writing in the country. (Not to mention that they were onto the whole model of giving away content for free long before there was a consumer Web.) Many of the more compelling editorial voices were annealed by their time in the alternative weekly world. Some would argue that it is a better training ground for the basics in reporting than hyperactive digital realms where the emphasis is on productivity.
Washington City Paper was edited by Jack Shafer, one of the more respected media critics in the country, writing at Reuters. Erik Wemple, who does a similar job at the opinion page of The Washington Post, also edited the newspaper. Ta-Nehisi Coates, who blogs at The Atlantic, worked there, as did David Plotz, the editor of Slate, and Kate Boo, who writes for The New Yorker. Eben Shapiro at The Wall Street Journal worked for a now closed weekly I worked at in Minneapolis and we competed with Monika Bauerlein, co-editor of Mother Jones with Clara Jeffery, who worked at City Paper. Sam Sifton, the national editor of The New York Times, worked at The New York Press, Harold Meyerson spent time at The LA Weekly and Susan Orlean worked for Willamette Week.
The idea of the alternative weekly - that news would be covered absent the agenda of mainstream media and that truths would be told without paying heed to any kind of formal balance or objectivity - has all but been overwhelmed by the Web. Listings, spicy writing, coverage of the next big thing, all of that has been digitized and democratized and many alternatives have ended up looking, of all things, stodgy within this new-media context. It probably makes sense that Ms. Gray, a talented young journalist, issued her anticipatory - and perhaps premature - obit for The Voice writing for BuzzFeed.

HEADLINE: Among Many Aging Americans, Surprising Optimism

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: A survey finds that many older Americans are optimistic about their future -- perhaps unduly so. 

 BODY:
They were over age 70, and most thought that over the next five to 10 years, their "overall quality of life" -- finances, mental and physical health, recreation, family situation -- would stay the same (49 percent) or improve (23 percent).
They were over age 70, and a majority expected their health would remain the same or get better over the next five to 10 years. They intended -- 90 percent of them -- to live in their current homes for five to 10 years, and most were confident that they could without any substantial home modifications.
And if a "significant unexpected expense" should strike, like an accident or an illness, they were overwhelmingly confident they would have the ability to pay for it. Why not? They were also very confident that their income would be sufficient to cover their monthly expenses.
I read through the results of this national telephone survey of 2,250 Americans over age 60, called the "United States of Aging" and conducted by the polling company Penn Schoen Berland, wondering what was making the older group of respondents so insistently optimistic. Everything sounded hunky-dory.
I see much grimmer tidings elsewhere on a daily basis. What about that brief form the Boston College Center for Retirement Research showing that in 2010, the average household approaching retirement had just $120,000 in IRAs or 401(k)'s, which, if used to buy an annuity, would produce only $575 in monthly income? What of that new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing significant increases in the proportion of older Americans with multiple chronic diseases
Were the respondents in this survey being wonderfully upbeat? Or, less wonderfully, unrealistic? Though people did express some concerns when the questions got more specific, particularly those with lower incomes, on the whole these aging Americans envisioned buoyant futures.
When I called a couple of my favorite gerontologists to help me puzzle this out, they weren't really surprised; social scientists have known for years that older people, freed from the midlife stresses of work and child rearing, become happier. They call it the U-shaped curve: life satisfaction is greatest in people's youth and then again in old age.
"You're seeing resilience," said David J. Ekerdt, a University of Kansas gerontologist. "You're seeing the way we adjust our frames of reference to continue to assert, 'I'm the kind of person who'll be O.K.'"
Probably some of this resilience stems from the way the survey (with a +/- 3 percent margin of error) was conducted. Sponsored by the National Council on Aging and United Healthcare, it used a sample divided into groups aged 60 to 64, 65 to 69, and 70-plus - but it doesn't tell us how plus. Health problems and functional limitations grow more common as people pass 80, but we don't know how many 80-plus respondents were included.
The Cornell gerontologist Karl Pillemer, a veteran researcher, said the way some survey questions were worded, referring to a five- to 10-year horizon, could have caused confusion. If you're 72 and expect your health to remain the same for five years, you might well be right. If you're 82 and think it won't change over 10 years, you probably aren't.
It's also true that those over 70 are more likely than the boomers behind them to have retired with pensions, intact marriages and paid-off mortgages. Less financially battered by the recession, they may indeed be more secure financially, thus less worried.
Still, a psychological dimension is also involved. "There are developmental processes that occur as part of aging that make people more positive," said Dr. Pillemer, who has collected advice from more than 1,500 seniors as part of the Legacy Project. Many studies show that older people are better able to regulate their emotions, to focus on sources of pleasure, to maintain equanimity.
The impulse to express optimism also reflects an effort to sustain one's identity, Dr. Ekerdt said. "As we get older and the losses exceed the gains, we try to preserve some continuity, an idea of sameness about ourselves," he said. So you say you'll stay healthy, stay solvent, stay in your house. "It's the marvelous mechanism that keeps us sane."
It could get less marvelous when the idea outlives its basis in fact. Any number of readers can describe the tensions that arise when older relatives are falling on stairs, causing repeated fender-benders and otherwise faltering while they continue to insist that they're fine, that they can stay in their houses and their cars, that they don't need any help.
That's not a problem reflected in the "United States of Aging," but the survey will be conducted annually. Over time, we'll get to see how older people feel about their futures as they step further into them.

HEADLINE: Fiat 500 Turbo Mixes With the Classics at Concorso Italiano

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The supermini has been tuned to 135 horsepower, roughly splitting the difference between the base 500 and the performance-focused 500 Abarth. 

 BODY:
MONTEREY, Calif. -- On Aug. 17 at the Concorso Italiano, billed as one of the largest annual gatherings of Italian vehicles outside of Italy, the 2013 Fiat 500 Turbo was introduced.
The turbocharged version of the 500 supermini, scheduled to arrive in dealerships this fall, is expected to carry a base price of $20,200, inclusive of a $700 destination charge.
The main attraction, however, is the boost in engine output, to 135 horsepower. That roughly splits the difference between the rather modest 101 horsepower of the base 500's naturally aspirated 1.4-liter MultiAir 4-cylinder engine and the 160 horsepower produced by the top-of-the-line 500 Abarth.
"It's for the consumer who wants more zip than perhaps the output of the Pop base model, but who doesn't feel the need to go as high into the performance range of something like the Abarth," Tim Kuniskis, head of the Fiat brand in North America, said during the car's introduction here.
Mr. Kuniskis said the 500T, as it would be marketed, was merely the latest variation in a 500 lineup that would ultimately consist of 15 different vehicles.
The 500T offers points of visual differentiation with the base versions' Pop, Sport and Lounge variants, with a more prominent front fascia, added side skirts, black-accented 16-inch wheels and lights, and a rear spoiler. Inside, standard equipment for the 500T includes sport seats as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, all with accent stitching. The car is also outfitted with an upgraded audio system, developed in conjunction with the rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who licenses his name to the ubiquitous Beats by Dre headphones.
Apart from the the turbocharging of the engine, Fiat has made suspension enhancements, including lower control arms, stiffer spring rates, sport-tuned shock absorbers, tighter steering ratios and a freer-flowing exhaust. Such go-fast tricks impose a slight penalty in fuel economy; Fiat expects the 500T to achieve 34 miles per gallon in highway driving, compared with the base model's 38 m.p.g.
Mr. Kuniskis also presented an Abarth 500 with new, optional performance equipment that he said would increase that model's horsepower output to an even 200.

HEADLINE: What Mauritius Can Teach Us About the Global Arms Trade

BYLINE: KATHI LYNN AUSTIN


HIGHLIGHT: You'd like to set up an illegal weapons network in the post-9/11 era, but where to begin? Maybe try the idyllic island nation of Mauritius. 

 BODY:
Kathi Lynn Austin is a former United Nations weapons inspector. She is also the executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project, an advocacy group that she founded, "dedicated to investigating, documenting and bringing to justice major arms traffickers, war profiteers, and transnational criminal networks that fuel conflict around the globe." The views given here are Ms. Austin's alone, but we have asked Ms. Austin to contribute because as a trafficking expert she can help tease out the ways illegal arms traffic is sustained. - At War
So, you'd like to set up an illegal weapons network in the post-Sept.11 era. But where to begin? I recommend a trip to the idyllic island nation of Mauritius.
Granted, this tropical holiday destination isn't even close to places known for revolts and insurgency. But Andrei Kosolapov and Sergey Denisenko, two former associates of the convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout, are accused of trying to start an arms-trafficking enterprise based there. It turns out that Mauritius is a place where all the tried-and-true techniques of black-market gunrunning have been used. It has also been a venue for pioneering a few new maneuvers.
The success and longevity of a gunrunning ring usually rests on cleverly exploited loopholes in domestic and international law. Here is a primer on some of the methods and the legal gaps:
Never Identify Yourself as an Arms Broker
The technical term "arms brokers" refers to the intermediaries between supplier and shooter. Out of the approximately 52 countries that have any laws to regulate arms brokers, only a few, like the United States, have robust definitions to identify the full array of middlemen including dealers, transporters and financiers. Before these laws started showing up on the books in the late 1990s, traffickers cultivated their "Lord of War" image to attract clientele. Afterward, it was all about the disguise. Viktor Bout still insists that he was only in the transport business - the same assertion used by his former associates in Mauritius. 
Seek New Frontiers
If your unsavory reputation catches up with you, or you feel overexposed, move to a place where nobody knows your name. A classical technique made easy - since the absence of international registration and licensing for arms brokers means that unsuspecting countries like Mauritius are often unable to distinguish between legitimate and rogue operators on their turf.
Hide Under the Cover of Legitimacy
In the immediate period after the cold war, gunrunners cozied up to autocratic regimes with poor human rights records in countries where registrations and protection easily could be bought. Since Sept. 11, traffickers prefer to stay under the radar. Heralded as the best-governed African country five years in a row, Mauritius's clean reputation is seductive. Had there existed a global watch list on sanctions busters and operators on national blacklists, then Mauritius could have been forewarned.
Hide the Beneficiaries and Money
To remain in the shadows, traffickers traditionally require an economic superstructure conducive for shell games. With its offshore banking center, drop-box office addresses and seasoned holding company paper pushers, Mauritius may have unwittingly guaranteed the expertise required for traffickers to construct a complex screen to hide their illegal assets and sales. Financial centers usually fail to run compliance checks on all of a client company's shareholders and directors. And even when nefarious activities are detected, illicit entities are rarely reported to relevant law enforcement agencies.
Don't Forget, a Little Corruption Goes a Long Way
When it comes to influence-peddling and covering your back, nothing is better than having a minister, department head, police officer or other powerful benefactor in your pocket. Mauritius learned its lesson on this point. Since discovering the alleged illicit arms trade on its turf, the government has allowed the Independent Commission Against Corruption to conduct a money-laundering investigation inside its ranks. It also called on the Commissioner of Police, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Financial Services Commission to conduct official inquiries.
Choose Your Method of Transportation
Arms smugglers used to fly cheap Russian cargo planes to transport goods, most notably in African war zones. Since the decline of the former Soviet fleet, there has been a switch to "westernized" aircraft. Traffickers also have learned that smaller passenger aircraft are easier to obtain and arouse less suspicion. South African, European and American aviation brokers got a wake-up call when their links to the Mauritius case were exposed. But this is still an area ripe for fraud. Governments need to improve vetting procedures in the transportation sector and seal up regulatory cracks in civilian carrier controls.
Secure an Air Operation Certificate of Convenience
An age-old tactic: make sure your operation is transnational, because few governments expend resources on investigations that require law enforcement cooperation over multiple national borders. The key to the Mauritius case was an "air operation certificate" that traffickers could use to lease American and South African planes for potential operations in Iran, Sudan and Congo. The denial of a certificate is likely to be only a temporary setback given the abundance of shipping and aviation flags of convenience in other jurisdictions.
Deliver the Goods, No Matter the Particulars
Weapons and bullets are ubiquitous with no shortage of willing providers - or buyers. But you need to make sure that you don't get caught red-handed supplying a heavily monitored conflict zone. Traffickers must be ready for danger and skilled at covert operations, especially for logistics and transportation. This is the most vulnerable stage of an illicit arms supply chain. Since gunrunners are relied upon by governments for clandestine national security operations, they remain uniquely unregulated and almost never penalized for illicit actions abroad. Operating in zones of chaos and lawlessness, where, understandably, regulation - much less real governance - are almost absent, they are almost never charged with aiding and abetting atrocities or war crimes.
Enjoy Prime Real Estate and Have a Quick Exit Plan
Big-time traffickers seldom base themselves in the war zones they service. Picturesque Mauritius offers not only the sway of Indian Ocean breezes and a lavish lifestyle, but also easily obtainable residency permits and lucrative tax incentives with few questions asked. 
This guide is not for the arms middlemen. The people running guns already know all of these tricks of the trade. And the flow of illicit arms to war zones is obviously not the fault of a tiny place like Mauritius. It was just one small, and mostly unwitting, actor in a shadowy global enterprise.
But listing the loopholes shows many of the options traffickers have. It also reveals that current arms regulations need tightening.
So how do you address such a large issue? A big part of the problem comes from the lack of legislative oversight. There is no international regulatory framework for conventional weapons transfers, so stronger policy would be a good place to start.
But sketched-out policies are just that. And in July, world leaders failed to finalize a draft arms trade treaty. The importance of such a global pact was powerfully argued last month in an editorial in The New York Times and an opinion piece in The New York Times Magazine by a former child soldier, Ishmael Beah.
If the current treaty text were to pass, it would set the highest possible international standards when it comes to governing arms brokers. That sounds good, but the norms called for are only voluntary. They would allow governments to legislate brokers as they see fit - failing to patch up the loopholes and smooth out uneven domestic laws:
Each State Party shall take the appropriate measures, within its national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under its jurisdiction for conventional arms under the scope of this Treaty. Such controls may require brokers to register or obtain written authorization before engaging in brokering transactions.
Translation: No unified standard.
So, let's review. There are clear deficits to the current arms trade laws: No robust definition of arms brokers; no inclusion of transporters; no compulsory registration and licensing domestically or internationally that would flag illicit actors and strengthen enforcement cooperation; no legal reach across multiple national borders; no call for criminalization of breaches or penalties to act as deterrents.
For all of this lacking, what do you get? A long list of loopholes, exclusions and weakly enforced measures that allow traffickers to continue to fuel global conflict with each illegal weapon they sell. A mostly unfettered paradise for the arms middlemen, wouldn't you say?

HEADLINE: Examining the Ponzi Scheme Through the Mind of the Con Artist

BYLINE: DIANA B. HENRIQUES


HIGHLIGHT: In her new book, Tamar Frankel, a legal scholar, explores the psychology of the financial criminals and what makes them tick. 

 BODY:
Maybe "Ponzi scheme" should have its own spot in the Dewey Decimal System. Along with biographies of the schemers, a growing stack of scholarly references, legal tomes and articles aims to collect knowledge about this age-old crime.
But the latest entry in the category, "The Ponzi Scheme Puzzle: A History and Analysis of Con Artists and Victims" by Tamar Frankel, takes a different approach. While Professor Frankel is a legal scholar who has been on the faculty of the Boston University Law School since 1968, her book explores the psychology of the financial criminals and what makes them tick. She was inspired by a colleague who referred to them as "those mimics of trustworthiness: con artists."
She spent more than a decade researching the book, analyzing more than a hundred Ponzi schemes. Among them: theCaritas scandal in Romania, an early 1990s fraud whose victims saw the mastermind as a saint in Robin Hood guise; the currency fraudrun by J. David Dominelli, which collapsed in the mid-1980s and stung a host of San Diego's elite; and the Madoff scandal, history's largest Ponzi scheme, with paper losses of $64.8 billion and thousands of victims around the world.
Professor Frankel talked about the mind-set of the con artist, as well as the role that victims and society play. Her conclusions will not comfort Ponzi victims; she faults them for their gullibility and failing to "do their homework." She finds, too, that society has a profound ambivalence toward con artists despite the vicious nature of their crimes - which, she notes, on rare occasions have even included murder. 
Q. 
A. Yes. Especially, I understand better the impact of culture - a culture of risk-taking, the hope of making money, an insatiable appetite for more. These are all part of the culture in which Ponzi schemes arise and flourish.
Q. 
A. It's not so much a continuum as it is the proverbial slippery slope. It's very easy to slip down a slippery slope - and very hard to climb back up again. When people start doing one little wrong, it gets a little easier to do one more wrong.
Q. 
A. If you look at the history of successful human societies, two things are clear. One, you must have trust. Without it, society cannot succeed. At the same time, you must also be trustworthy.
Q. 
A. Gullibility is the tendency to believe without reasonable evidence. Every culture draws a line between trust and gullibility. And in the financial arena, the line between trust and gullibility may have to be more tightly drawn. For example, as I note in my book, many con artists make it seem that they are limiting access to their investments, making them available only to a select few. Now, rationally, why would a money manager do that? Look around you and you see hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity funds and advisers all salivating for more clients. Yet, there are those who believe that the more unique and hard to get an investment is, the more valuable it is. That's gullibility - because it is not rational to believe that.
Q. 
A. And Madoff was a well-known broker - in other words, it was his business. He was an expert trader. He said, "I have a secret way of doing something," and it may have seemed plausible that he did. You're quite right that he's different.
Q. 
A. I doubt it. People certainly are more concerned about risk than they were before the financial crisis. But con artists do not adjust their stories to the current culture and public feeling but rather focus on their potential targeted audiences. For example, a con artist who operated a charitable organization appealed to similar organizations with a story that an anonymous donor would match their investments. This story was convincing because the managers of charitable institutions have donors who seek to remain anonymous.
Q. 
A. That's a very difficult issue. "Blame" means an "assignment of responsibility for a fault or a wrong or an error." I think we would agree that a person who suffers from heart disease after years of overeating and smoking may bear some responsibility for his or her illness. I empathize with victims and I feel for them, even as I assign some responsibility to them.

HEADLINE: 'Do You Trust Politicians?'

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: In New Hampshire, voters - whether it's a hotel housekeeper or the speaker of the House - hold nothing back. 

 BODY:
West Lebanon, N.H.
Over the home stretch of this election, I'm going to visit a number of swing states to gauge the prospects of the two major party presidential candidates.
Here in New Hampshire - once a securely Republican state - the presidential contest pits Democrats struggling to revive their victorious 2008 coalition against Republicans attempting to reignite the conservative insurgency that swept the state in 2010.
In 2006 and 2008, New Hampshire Democrats were exceptionally enthusiastic about voting for Democrats, according to poll data analyzed by Andrew Smith, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire.
By the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats had sunk into relative apathy while Republicans couldn't wait to vote. More than three quarters of Republicans, 77 percent, said they were "excited" about the 2010 election, and just 10 percent said they were "depressed." Only 36 percent of Democrats were "excited" while 43 percent were "depressed."
The depression lingers. The biggest hurdle facing President Obama in New Hampshire (and elsewhere) is an enervated liberal electorate that must be galvanized.
Dawn, a forthright woman in her 40s, works as a hotel housekeeper in a small city in the middle of the state. She voted for Obama in 2008, but this year she is among the discouraged:
Obama is not on my real popular list. I think Obamacare is ridiculous. A lot of things that were based on good intentions get messed up. You cannot force people to get health care when - at least in New Hampshire - there's people who have to decide, "Do I heat my house or do I put food in my mouth?" 
There needs to be some kind of fine or penalty for insurance companies who have billions and billions of dollars. They need to be fined for making things so damn expensive in the first place. Obama is not off the hook with me. Do I think it's wise to spend tons of money on stimuluses and stimuluses? No. Do I think one party did a better job than the other? No. Because before Obama, we had 8 years of Republicans spending tons of money on other things.
My personal situation, I don't make any more money than I did when Obama was elected. I can't afford to get sick. I can't afford to go to the hospital if something happens. Obamacare? I couldn't afford the premiums. Everything I have is budgeted right down to the T. As an example, we have health insurance at the hotel, but the deductible is too high to get the benefit of having the insurance. So I don't get it, because it is an extra expense that I can't afford if I'm going to feed my children or pay my light bill. 
Obamacare would force me to spend money that I do not have, with no guarantee that I'm still not going to spend more money at the hospital or on prescriptions than I already do. Except I can get fined by the federal government. That gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling.
When was the last time that Joe Schmo who worked 30 years in a company that got laid off gets to run for president?
They are just so out of touch with reality. With what's going on. They claim to represent everybody, but you can't understand a person who makes $8, $9, $10 an hour if you've never been in their shoes.
What does Dawn think of the political class generally?
Do you trust politicians? There's very few that, once they get elected, that follow through on anything they used as a platform. Here's advice. You really want to talk about electing somebody? Talk to their housekeeper at home to find out what they're really like. Talk to the waitress or waiter in the town that they live in, the establishment they go to. See if they're sincere in anything that that they say on any platform that they get elected on, the housekeeper, the waiter, the dry cleaner, the guy at the meat counter will have more to say about the person that wants to get elected. Any politician at any level - they all put on a good face.
You can't keep outsourcing jobs because all you're left with is service jobs. Think about your checking account. If you keep writing checks and not depositing anything in it, very bad things happen. If you keep outsourcing jobs, that's what you're left with. I'll give you an example. I have a sister in Texas working in an oil refinery company. They did piping. She comes to work on a Monday, there's a chain wrapped around a gate. There's no more jobs. They never told anyone on Friday they weren't going to have a job come Monday.
Here in New Hampshire, paper mills that have been in business 100 years, their corporate owners found that if you do business in Mexico or China you don't have to pay wages, you don't have to deal with the labor laws or environmental laws. Like the Clean Air Act. I struggle. I work at this hotel. I have children. It is a struggle every day. It's very frustrating for people that are in my situation. Rent is expensive. Then you have a politician saying "I represent you."
We had a Republican primary up here a few months ago. They were going to decide who was going to be their Republican candidate for president. They never cleaned up after themselves. They left messes. If you are going to have a platform you are going to stand on, why don't you live by example?
I think in general there are certain things in life you will never hear extremely wealthy people, oil companies and politicians say: "Darn, we are in a financial crisis. Let me donate a couple of months of my salary and see if that will make a difference." But you will hear each of those groups of people point fingers and blame somebody. 
I guess my thought is that politicians want to be representing the average person. Before you run for the presidency, give up something. Live in a house that costs - try $1800 a month. But do it on $9 an hour at 28 to 30 hours a week. Buy food. And figure out how you are going to put gas in your car. Do it for six months. Then tell me you'll represent me.
Voter surveys here show New Hampshire is up for grabs. Obama won the state in 2008 with 53.4 percent to John McCain's 44.8 percent. Looking toward November, the University of New Hampshire's bimonthly Granite State Poll has Obama ahead, but his lead has been steadily declining. In February, he was 10 points ahead; in April, 9; in June, 4; and on August 12 he led by 3 points. Obama still has an edge, but the trend line is troubling to his campaign.
From 2000 to 2008, Democratic support grew steadily. The number of towns voting Democratic went from a clear minority in the Bush-Gore election to a decisive majority in Obama-McCain, as the following maps illustrate.
A remarkable study of population changes in the state by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire revealed that in 2008, one-third of voters had not cast ballots in New Hampshire in 2000. Of the new voters, just over 200,000 were migrants from out of state and more than 100,000 were New Hampshire residents who turned 18 between 2000 and 2008.
The authors of the study - Kenneth M. Johnson, Dante Scala and Andrew Smith - found that the new voters were decisively more Democratic than the older, established residents:
In 2010, however, the Democratic realignment was brought to an abrupt halt by one of the strongest Republican surges in the nation in what was a very Republican year. The 400-member New Hampshire State House went from 216-174 Democratic (with 10 vacancies) to 298-102 Republican. The state Senate went from 14-10 Democratic to 19-5 Republican. Both branches currently have veto-proof Republican majorities.
The Republican gains were orchestrated, in part, by a new political powerhouse in the state, William O'Brien, the current Speaker of New Hampshire's House of Representatives. O'Brien is himself a migrant from "Taxachusetts," a.k.a. Massachusetts. "We are an island of red in a sea of blue," O'Brien proudly told me, referring to the Democratic leanings of surrounding states.
O'Brien is a true believer. "As government grows," he said, "personal liberty shrinks." He has successfully pushed a decisively conservative agenda through the legislature, often over the veto of Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat. New Hampsire's budget cuts state spending by 18 percent, including a 45 percent reduction in state aid to higher education; reduces or eliminates a host of taxes and fees, including those on car registrations, businesses, cigarettes, gambling winnings and internet usage; and bars race and gender preferences.
The state Democratic Party, in an effort to motivate its supporters, is seeking to personally demonize O'Brien, to create an enemy worth defeating at the polls. Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan, architect of a budget that aims to radically reduce the size and scope of the federal welfare state, has reinforced this strategy.
Raymond Buckley, chairman of New Hampshire's Democratic Party, wrote in an email to local voters the day after Romney announced the selection of Paul Ryan that "Paul Ryan's radical agenda is right in line with the Tea Party agenda of Speaker Bill O'Brien. Together Romney-Ryan and O'Brien-Lamontagne would dismantle the programs that mean the most to middle-class families." Ovide Lamontagne is the leading Republican candidate for governor.
A number of voters I spoke to indicated that they plan to vote for Obama, but they spoke with little of the enthusiasm or optimism of 2008.
"I'll stick with Obama," Theresa Burke, who is retired but draws some income from her quilting, said. Her views of Romney suggested that the Obama campaign's negative ads have been effective: "I don't trust him, he's hidden too much money overseas."
Along similar lines, Nelson Pachezo, a housekeeping supervisor at a hospital in New London who said he was a Republican, told me, "I am not convinced by Romney, I care more about character than anything else. And there are some things about Gov. Romney, all those things that are coming afloat. President Obama is a Democrat and I'm not a Democrat." Romney, Pachezo said, "has got his money in the Bahamas. I know it's legal. There is an issue of character."
At the same time, New Hampshire has a long history of libertarian conservatism.
"I prefer someone who made all their money outside the public sector," said Jim Grafton of Meredith, who runs a warehouse and delivery business. "Obama has never ever run a lemonade stand. The only thing he ever distributed is drugs. Read his memoir."
Grafton sees Obama and the Democrats on a path to exercise "dictatorial control over the nation." If the American people don't support Republicans promoting a tough budget cutting agenda, "they will get what they deserve, things going down the tubes and you have to start all over again, or you have a dictatorship," Grafton told me. "Like most dictatorships, if you can sell it to the public that you are taking care of all of their needs, what do they need to worry about? It's all about control."
Ross Young, a 41-year-old Spanish teacher at Andover High School, said he "could never vote for Obama. It's a socialist thing, the redistribution of wealth. If you take a basic economic course, you know we are going down the wrong path. You can't go on spending more money to solve the problems."
New Hampshire has the second least religiously observant electorate of all 50 states, according to Gallup, a finding that should clearly benefit Democrats.
While 40 percent of the population nationwide defines itself as "very religious" (attending church weekly and describing religion as very important in their daily lives), only 23 percent of New Hampshire and Vermont residents meet these standards. Vermont beats New Hampshire for the least religious state: 58 percent of Vermonters say they are nonreligious. In New Hampshire, the number is 52 percent.
For over three decades, polls have shown that high levels of religiosity correlate with strong Republican leanings, while a lack of interest in religion is closely associated with support for Democrats.
New Hampshire stands out as the third "whitest" state in the nation, at 95.5 percent. In theory, that should work to the advantage of the Republican Party, which receives almost all of its support from whites. Nationwide, if only whites cast ballots, Romney would win 51-42, according to Pew Research. But the Republican advantage among whites does not apply to individual states: Vermont, the whitest state in the nation at 96.4 percent is also among the most Democratic. Maine, the second whitest, but also at 96.4 percent, is virtually certain to vote for Obama.
Income is another factor working to the advantage of Democrats in New Hampshire. Median household income, $63,277, is substantially higher than the national average, $51,914. In addition, New Hampshire residents are better educated than the country at large: 32.9 percent have college degrees compared to 27.9 percent nationally.
Obama's strongest margins in New Hampshire, according to the U.N.H. survey, are among those with college and graduate degrees - especially among college educated women, who back Obama 61-35. Among those with incomes of $100,000 or more, Obama beats Romney by a solid 53-44 margin.
O'Brien, the House Speaker, argues that the anti-tax, small government tradition runs deep in New Hampshire, which has no income or sales tax. With Paul Ryan on the ticket, O'Brien says, Romney can tap deeply into that tradition.
Obama campaigned in New Hampshire on Saturday, where he attacked his opponents' Medicare proposals, contending that "they want seniors to get a voucher to buy their own insurance, which would force seniors to pay an additional $6,400 for their health care." Romney and Ryan, in turn, are scheduled to make a joint appearance on Monday night, at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.
The time and energy devoted by both campaigns to a state with only 4 Electoral College votes - 0.7 percent of the 538 available - is, in some respects, mystifying, especially for a state with high media costs, since most television reaching Nw Hampshire is broadcast from Boston.
A very close election, however, can make those 4 votes crucial. In 2000, George W. Bush beat Al Gore in the Electoral College 271 to 266 (one elector abstained). If 3,606 New Hampshire voters - just 0.6 percent of the 569,081 total - had cast Democratic rather than Republican ballots that year, Gore would have won the Electoral College, 270-267.
With the contest here steadily tightening, it's voters like Dawn who will make the difference:
I believe you have to vote, if you don't vote you have no right to gripe. I'm independent. It shouldn't be on party lines. I hate to say it, but it'll probably be Obama again. Still, it's early enough that maybe anybody could impress me.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Reinventing the Toilet

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do you delegate too much? Do you ask dumb questions? (That's a good thing.) And have you tried to get a microloan? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: A Running Mate
Mitt Romney picks Paul Ryan. Here are Mr. Ryan's positions on small-business matters, and here is a discussion about whether Mr. Ryan is the right candidate for small businesses. Aaron Carroll digs into Mr. Ryan's Medicare proposals. Jillian Berman wonders whether Wall Street will like him. The president of the National Federation of Independent Business explains why small businesses are so big in politics. Bill Murphy Jr., offers five lessons in entrepreneurship to be learned from Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
The Economy: Breweries and Wineries
July retail sales jump, and some big box retail stores are growing. Breweries and wineries are also seeing significant growth. June conveyor shipments are up 35 percent over the previous year, and industrial production increases. Builder confidence continues to improve, but machine-tool orders slip and conditions in the New York region (pdf) have deteriorated. Small-business confidence declines, Google's Motorola Mobilityis cutting 4,000 jobs, and FedEx is offering buyouts to employees. Timothy Taylor laments the country's stagnant R.&D. effort. Consumer prices stay flat, producer prices climb more than expected, and Lam Thuy Vo explains what the prices on a very old menu can teach us about the economy. Meanwhile, the nation's economists are quietly evacuating their families (according to The Onion, anyway).
Technology: Reinventing the Toilet
A new report says New York small businesses face a technology gap; barely half feel they are using technology enough (pdf) to be competitive (and a third do not have a Web site). Among some cool new ideas: bacteria-eating viruses that may power cellphones, software to prevent texting behind the wheel, an implant that helps blind mice see and an advance that could turn wastewater treatment into an electricity producer. Bill Gates sponsors a reinvent-the-toilet challenge. Samsung expands its lead in the smartphone market but Research In Motion is not giving up. Pinterest introduces iPhone and Android apps. Google Plus introduces studio hangouts for musicians. American broadband growth slows. Brian Moylan suggests five apps the world desperately needs, including one that will let you do the following: "At a party, you run into a guy who greets you by name. You've met before, but you have no idea who he is. Snap a subtle photo of him. The software uses facial recognition software to troll Facebook and Google Image searches to ID him."
Your People: Do You Delegate Too Much?
Gad Levanon sums up the main trends in the labor market. Josh Tolan explains how to use video to recruit talent. Disney is sued by a Muslim employee over its dress code. Devan Perine reports that healthy employees contribute to healthy businesses. A Somali pirate becomes professional. Peter Nguyen discusses the delicate nature of delegating: "Not everything in your business should be delegated. ...

Aetna to Buy Coventry Health Care for $5.7 Billion | Aetna announced on Monday that it would buy Coventry Health Care for about $5.7 billion in cash and stock, in a move by the insurer to push further into government-backed programs like Medicaid.
Under the terms of the deal, Aetna will pay about $42.08 a share, with nearly two-thirds of that amount expected to be in cash. The figure is about 20 percent above Coventry's closing price on Friday.
Aetna, based in Hartford, said the deal would help it expand further into the government-backed health care programs Medicare and Medicaid.
"Integrating Coventry into Aetna will complement our strategy to expand our core insurance business, increase our presence in the fast-growing government sector and expand our relationships with providers in local geographies," Aetna's chief executive, Mark T. Bertolini, said in a statement.

Best Buy to Name Hospitality Executive as New Chief | Best Buy plans to name the chief executive of the hospitality company Carlson as its new leader, a person briefed on the matter said late on Sunday, as it said that an olive branch to its discontented founder was rejected.
Best Buy's naming of the Carlson chief, Hubert Joly, is likely to be the first of several disclosures the company plans to make to assure investors that the struggling electronics retailer can turn around its fortunes on its own.
Mr. Joly, a Frenchman who oversaw Radisson Hotels and Country Inns & Suites as Carlson's chief, is expected to join Best Buy in early September, once he obtains a visa, this person said.
Separately, the company said on Sunday that it had offered to grant its founder, Richard Schulze, access to confidential information to help him firm up what could be an $8.8 billion bid - only to be rejected. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Paul Tough on How Obama's Stance on Poverty Has Changed

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover article describes Roseland, the area of Chicago where Obama worked as a community organizer, and the challenge in turning political speech into action. 

 BODY:
How did this article come about?
I first went to Roseland to report on this organization called YAP, which stands for Youth Advocate Programs. I heard about YAP back in 2009, when I was just starting work on my book. I was interested in the idea behind YAP, that a school system could identify the kids who were most at risk and give them a dedicated mentor. It was a bit of a coincidence that I ended up in Roseland, and it was only after reporting there for a while that I realized that Roseland was where Obama worked as a young man.
When you got to Roseland, did people mention the fact that Obama had worked there?
No, people in Roseland didn't bring it up. It was amazing to me, actually, how little they talked about Obama's time there. Obama looms large in Chicago as a whole. In Hyde Park, where he lived for most of his Chicago years, there is a restaurant he used to go to where all the waiters wear "Obama Eats Here" T-shirts. But in Roseland, I didn't find that his history was something people talked about much at all.
Did people in Roseland feel abandoned by Obama?
No, I don't think they did. When I went back to Chicago this summer to do additional reporting for the story, I asked lots of people, including Steve Gates - the YAP mentor who was my main guide to Roseland - for their thoughts on Obama, and I didn't find anyone who felt negatively about what he'd done as president. There's a lot of fatalism in Roseland, and no one was surprised that the president wasn't talking a lot about their community. And so Obama remains very popular among voters there. Their instincts aren't to blame him for what is going on in Roseland. I think they feel that the forces he's dealing with are pretty huge. And in terms of day-to-day politics, I think they are much more focused on the city administration, because often it feels as if the mayor has more control over what happens in Roseland than the president does.

Were you surprised by anything in Roseland?
Yes, quite a bit. I'd done a fair amount of reporting in low-income neighborhoods in New York - in Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn. But the South Side of Chicago was startling to me. Its poverty feels much more intense than anything I saw in New York. The degree of segregation and isolation in Chicago was also startling, even compared to other American cities. There's nowhere in New York you can go where there are no white people for miles and miles. But that's true on the South Side. And a lot of the South Side is beyond the end of the subway line, and so the people who live there feel very cut off from the rest of the city.
Besides Damien and Jasmine, the teenagers you focused on in the article, did anyone else in Roseland make an impression on you?
In my book I write at some length about two or three other teenagers who were YAP students who got just a brief mention in the article. The boy who was in boot camp for stealing a car is named Mush. I spent a lot of time talking with him about how he was trying to straighten out and was having a difficult time. And there was another young woman, Keitha Jones, who used to go to school each day looking for a fight because she was so angry at her mother for not protecting her from sexual abuse by a relative. She had gotten into incredible amounts of trouble in high school and was on the verge of being kicked out. But with the help of her YAP advocate, she turned things around, graduated and is now starting her second year of a cosmetology program at a community college and has a job lined up after her degree. She was the most hopeful young person I met there, partly thanks to this wonderful advocate she worked with, a woman named Lanita Reed, who runs a salon of her own. Lanita really helped Keitha see herself in a different way. What she gave her was this unusual combination of therapy, friendship and family. Keitha was growing up in an incredibly chaotic environment. It was not just the sexual abuse; there was also apparently drug use in her family, and the cops were always breaking into their home and dragging off various relatives. For kids, it's very damaging to grow up in that kind of situation, but it also can mean that they are incredibly motivated to get out. And Lanita really leveraged that feeling in Keitha and helped show her that there was a specific and tangible path out of her situation that might be difficult but was not impossible.

Do you think the model of financing YAP-type programs is the path to combating poverty?
I don't think the answer is clear, and I don't think YAP is all of the answer. But I do think we need to have a national conversation about what we can do for poor kids who don't have the kind of family structure we wish they had. We aren't comfortable talking about that question right now, and I think that's true on both the left and the right. And the answer is complicated. Getting more money into the hands of parents might help, but alone, that doesn't seem to be enough. There's evidence that specific interventions help kids growing up in these environments. YAP is one of them, but there are others, like home-visiting programs where social workers visit the homes of young parents to give advice and support. But the reality is that if we are going to talk about equality of opportunity for kids in these neighborhoods, the first step is to talk about how to get kids without sufficient family structures the help that they need. That's what's both frustrating and hopeful to me about Obama's earlier speeches on the issue - I think he understood that. His Anacostia speech in 2007 was one of the smartest and most relevant speeches I've read on what poverty is about today. If he was saying those same things today, as president, that alone wouldn't be enough, but it would still make a huge difference.
Is it fair for liberals to complain, in the way that the Affordable Care Act has been criticized, that Obama has struggled to make an antipoverty message palatable?
I would make a distinction between the two. I credit the complaint about Obama that he hasn't told the health care story well enough. But on issues like food stamps, I don't think it's just bad messaging. It's no messaging. The White House doesn't want to talk about it. You're much more likely to hear about the increase in food-stamp recipients under Obama from Republicans than from Democrats. The main person who talked about food stamps on the campaign trail was Newt Gingrich, who held them up as a terrible program the administration was enlarging. Americans feel very conflicted about government aid. Remember that front-page story about how even Americans who receive federal aid don't like the idea of Americans' getting aid? There's something admirable about that American instinct, but it has created a strange situation for the Obama administration. They've given a lot of help to the poor, but they're reluctant to claim credit for it, because a lot of voters don't like the idea of the government helping the poor - and that's true even for some of the poor themselves. It's partly a problem, too, of inheriting such a terrible economy as president. Working on this story, I thought a lot about that Rahm Emanuel quote from the early days of the administration: "Never let a crisis go to waste." There were a lot of Democrats thinking that way right after the inauguration - that this was a great opportunity, and that the crisis would let them do a lot of the stuff they'd always wanted to do. But in fact, inheriting a crisis like that is no fun at all. You spend all your time staving off terrible disasters and spending money on programs that by definition don't have a lot of long-term impact. One thing I took away from this piece was that for a president, this kind of financial crisis really doesn't have a silver lining.

HEADLINE: In Briefing, Obama Touches on Medicare and Romney's Taxes

HIGHLIGHT: President Obama used an impromptu press conference to wade into domestic and campaign issues, defending his demand that his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, release more of his tax returns and returning fire in the debate over Medicare.

President Obama used an impromptu news conference on Monday to wade into domestic and campaign issues, defending his demand that his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, release more of his tax returns and returning fire in the debate over Medicare.
The president disputed suggestions that he was lowering the tone of the election with his drumbeat of demands that Mr. Romney release more of his income tax returns. 
"The American people have assumed that if you want to be president of the United States that your life's an open book when it comes to things like finances," Mr. Obama said. "I'm not asking him to disclose every detail of his medical records, although we normally do that as well."
"This isn't sort of overly personal, guys, this is standard stuff," the president said, with a thin smile. "I don't think we're mean by asking you to do what every other presidential candidate's done, right? It's what the American people expect." 
Mr. Obama opened with remarks on Medicare, apparently in an attempt to push back on the Romney campaign's assertions that the health care law he championed was responsible for cuts in the health care program for older Americans. 
"Today, H.H.S. announced that thanks to the health care law that we passed, nearly 5.4 million seniors with Medicare have saved over $4.1 billion on prescription drugs," Mr. Obama said before taking questions, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services. "That's an average savings of more than $700 per person. This year alone, 18 million seniors with Medicare have taken advantage of new preventive care benefits like a mammogram or other cancer screening at no extra cost. These are big deals for a lot of Americans, and it represents two important ways that the improvements we made as part of the Affordable Care Act has strengthened Medicare and helped seniors everywhere get better care at less cost."
Mr. Obama's surprise appearance before the White House press corps came after a long hiatus that prompted some grumbling that the president was bypassing them and saving his interviews for local newspapers and television stations.
"Jay tells me that you guys have been missing me," Mr. Obama said, after striding into the briefing room and interrupting his press secretary, Jay Carney, midsentence.
After his appearance, during which he took a handful of questions from network news correspondents and The Associated Press, Mr. Obama excused himself to grant interviews with local television stations in Virginia, Florida and California. The White House said that was part of a longstanding communications strategy aimed at tailoring his message to local audiences. During this election, the Obama campaign has also given presidential interviews to national outlets that specialize in softer news or sports, like "Entertainment Tonight," People magazine and ESPN.
White House officials said the strategy recognized how the media landscape has fractured in recent years. "In an increasingly diffuse media world, relying simply on traditional political media would be like fighting with one arm and two legs behind our back," said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director.

HEADLINE: A Channel on the Web Devoted to Shoes, for Those Who Can't Get Enough

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON;

 BODY:
FASHION brands spend a lot of money and time to place their products in movies, dramas and reality television. Nine West, the mass-market shoe store chain, has decided to cut out the middleman and produce its own media.On Tuesday, Nine West will introduce Channel 9 (channelnine.com), featuring programming that covers various aspects of footwear, like walking in stilettos, shoe repair tips and overflowing shoe closets.
Nine West, a division of the Jones Group, is starting the channel as the centerpiece of a new multimedia campaign, which includes print advertising, to reinvigorate its brand of trendy, affordable shoes. 
It is not that the brand is doing badly. Last year, Nine West over all had global sales of just under $1 billion, and the company expects to do well this year because, despite the economy, the image-conscious are still buying the latest pumps, stilettos, flats and wedges. Last year, women bought 548 million pairs of shoes that were not for sports use, according to Euromonitor International. That accounts for about 70 percent of the $23 billion annual women's shoe market in the United States.
''Nine West is still healthy and relevant. Our challenge is to find growth,'' said Richard Dickson, president and chief executive of the Jones Group's Branded Businesses.
The video channel ''will be a way for us to bring original content and entertainment to viewers'' and build an online community around Nine West, said Mr. Dickson, who also oversees other Jones Group brands, including Stuart Weitzman. ''We want to rewrite the rules of fashion marketing so it's not just about a shoe, it's about a conversation. We want Nine West to be a place you want to shop because you love shoes, not a place to shop when you need shoes.''
Channel 9 will introduce 10 hours of programming in the next few months. The video effort plus new brand and product marketing campaigns are the first steps in a complete Nine West brand overhaul, Mr. Dickson said. This will include changing the merchandise, packaging, store concepts and signs.
The first Channel 9 offerings, on the new site and on Nine West's YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr pages, include the fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone in a series called ''You've Been Prom'd.'' The six-episode series follows a group of high school seniors in Pennsylvania who applied to a Nine West contest and won gowns, shoes and makeup sessions for their prom night.
The programming is being produced by Hud:sun Media, a Hollywood production company that made ''Pregnant in Heels'' for Bravo and ''I'm Having Their Baby'' for Oxygen.
''We are aiming to offer great stories, amazing personalities and practical information for every woman who loves shoes and fashion,'' said Michael Rourke, the company's chief.
Also on Channel 9, Ms. Cutrone and other style advisers appear in a series called ''You've Been Schooled,'' to teach students about the fashion industry. One episode shows the makeup and wardrobe styling for a major fashion photo shoot, and another helps customers learn how to walk in their first pair of heels.
A program called ''Shoe Fix'' gives tips on how to choose the right shoes, and to keep them in good shape. That will be followed by ''Confessions,'' a series in which celebrities talk about their favorite pair of shoes. Viewers will be encouraged to submit their own ''shoe confessions'' by uploading videos via channelnine.com or the YouTube channel beginning Aug. 28.
Some will be able to tell their stories at ''confessional'' booths set up in some Nine West stores. Two stores in Manhattan, in SoHo and on Madison Avenue, will each have a booth set up on the first night of New York Fashion Week, Sept. 6-13. That same night, Nine West plans to send out three Fiats, outfitted with ''confessionals,'' roaming the city to encourage people to record their shoe confessions.
Nine West is promoting Channel 9 with advertising in taxi cabs and digital panels near New York City subway entrances, as well as partnerships with major fashion Web sites.
More programming will be introduced in September, including ''Shoe Hoarders,'' which shows some chock-full closets and profiles of, according to Nine West, ''some of the greatest and very unapologetic shoe addicts of all time.'' Other programs will have well-known footwear designers, pratfalls involving shoes, and fashion and Hollywood bloggers talking to celebrities about red carpet footwear.
Nine West, additionally, is starting separate brand and product campaigns. The brand campaign, called ''Nine and the Gang,'' will have five women, each wearing different shoe styles.
Nine West worked with the agency Lloyd & Company to devise the campaign that will appear this fall in fashion magazines including Vogue, Glamour and Lucky, as well as online, on billboards, at bus stops, in stores and on taxi televisions. It will expand later to global markets where Nine West has stores.
The product campaign, also in collaboration with the Lloyd agency, is called ''We Do Shoe,'' which will appear online, in-store, on Nine West merchandise bags and in newspaper advertising, but not in magazines. These ads show close-ups of glossy pumps.
Mr. Dickson said the company would have a larger ad budget this year, but did not give a figure. Nine West spent $10.2 million in advertising last year, up from $8.3 million in 2010, according to figures from Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. Nine West's outlay was nearly $3 million in the first three months of 2012, up from the $1.8 million spent in the same time period in 2011.

HEADLINE: Wise Choice, Judge Says, Now Forfeit $4.7 Million

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI;

 BODY:
Roberta Campbell balked at closing on an $18.75 million co-op apartment on the Upper East Side in 2009 after an inspection turned up what she felt were some grievous shortcomings: missing cooktop grates, shower enclosures and a microwave; unfinished floors; and a lack of heat, hot water, gas and air-conditioning.But after a four-day nonjury trial in United States District Court in Manhattan, Judge William H. Pauley III issued a decision Monday that Ms. Campbell must forfeit her $4,687,500 down payment and pay any accrued interest and ''reasonable legal fees.''
Ms. Campbell ''may have made a wise lifestyle decision to abandon her purchase at the Mark Hotel,'' Judge Pauley wrote, but the language of the ''one-sided'' sales contract made it clear that the developer was entitled to the money. 
Not to worry. Not long after refusing to close on the 14th-floor apartment at the Mark, at 77th Street and Madison Avenue, Ms. Campbell bought a $17.5 million, 3,840-square-foot apartment at 15 Central Park West, which is, in the words of the judge, ''one of the most desirable addresses in Manhattan.''
It is also a building whose apartments have continued to rise in value, despite the recession.
Amos Alter, a lawyer for Ms. Campbell, declined to comment on the case.
Jeffrey Louis Braun, a lawyer for the developer, a group led by Izak Senbahar, was more forthcoming. ''We're gratified by the judge's decision,'' Mr. Braun said.
The case is another bit of debris left behind by a once surging real estate market.
At the height of the real estate boom in January 2007, a group led by Mr. Senbahar closed the Mark for a gut renovation. It was a high-end hotel, but the owners wanted to add a fifth star to its rating by giving the 80-year-old building, which is a landmark, a makeover and by converting the upper floors into a co-op, with 42 luxury apartments and hotel service.
The renovations took longer than expected, and only two of the 42 apartments offered for sale actually changed hands. In the meantime, the recession hit and the developer became embroiled in lawsuits with the lender.
One buyer, Shalva Chigirinsky, a Russian billionaire, has sued the owners of the Mark to get out of his $15.75 million contract to buy a three-bedroom penthouse. Mr. Chigirinsky complained about the condition of his apartment. Last year, the owners of the Mark refinanced the project. In March, they put seven apartments back on the market for prices ranging up to $60 million.
In January 2008, Ms. Campbell and her then husband, William Campbell, the chairman of Intuit, the software giant firm, signed a contract to buy one. Just before the closing in 2009, Ms. Campbell inspected the apartment and then demanded the return of her down payment, citing a long list of problems. The developer argued that all of the issues raised by Ms. Campbell could be resolved in a day or two.
Moreover, a series of e-mails from Ms. Campbell that surfaced during the trial seemed to undercut her criticisms, the judge wrote. In one note, she agreed with her architect that the apartment was ''absolutely fabulous.'' Within days, however, Ms. Campbell was searching the Internet for a new apartment.
Judge Pauley observed that lawyers on both sides ''acted myopically'' for ''transactional lawyers in the business of closing deals'' for not trying harder to salvage this one -- which led to three years of litigation, 150,000 pages of document discovery, 16 depositions and a full trial.

HEADLINE: Clearing Skies for Private Jets

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY;

 BODY:
The private jet industry has been a bit more optimistic lately, in part because of business travelers like Mark Dowley who use it to patch holes in the domestic air travel system.Mr. Dowley, an executive for a private equity firm and a marketing consultant, said he still flew commercial planes on the long, nonstop routes that airlines offer in abundance. But he will sometimes take a business jet to a smaller destination -- the kind of place that could take an additional three hours or more to reach by commercial plane. So he may fly commercially from New York to San Francisco for a meeting in San Jose, and then fly by private jet to San Diego for more meetings.
He said he used private jets ''as a filler'' to circumvent time-consuming airline schedules that often require inconvenient connections, even on short hops. He buys hourly flight time on a light jet through NetJets, the leading player in the fractional ownership market, which also sells per-hour private jet flying through its Marquis jet-card program. He said he flew more than 300,000 miles a year for business, about 90 percent on commercial jets and 10 percent on private jets. 
''Commercial air is more cost-efficient, but private is a massive timesaver,'' Mr. Dowley said. ''I'm very judicious with the private flying time, though, to manage the cost.''
The industry has been struggling since the recession hit and criticism arose over corporate executives' use of private jets. But deteriorating commercial airline service has underscored one of the rationales long cited for flying privately: the efficient use of business time.
According to the annual forecast by Honeywell, deliveries of business jets this year will probably grow only slightly over last year's total of fewer than 650 planes, which in turn was down about 15 percent from 2010. The peak year was 2008, when 1,139 jets were delivered.
NetJets, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, remains the market leader. But the second-largest company in the fractional-share market, Flight Options, reported that its business had grown for three consecutive years.
Kenn Ricci, chairman of Flight Options, which operates a fleet of more than 100 private jets, said his company had a 53 percent increase in new fractional owners last year, when it took delivery of 14 new jets. Those were among the more than 140 it had on order.
''We have stabilized the business and made Flight Options into a much better company than it was -- a good alternative,'' Mr. Ricci said.
NetJets, which has more than 700 jets in its fleet, is also growing. In June, it announced orders and options to buy up to 425 new jets, which it called the largest airplane purchase in private aviation history.
NetJets said the deal, with a value of $9.6 billion at list prices, included up to 200 Bombardier Challenger 300s, 75 Challenger 605s and 150 Cessna Citation Latitudes, with deliveries starting in 2014. All are in the supermidsize and midsize cabin categories, which typically carry eight to nine passengers.
That transaction followed another big one last March, when NetJets announced orders and options for 120 Bombardier Global jets, with a total value of $6.7 billion at list prices. Aircraft in the Global series are large-cabin jets that typically carry about 13 passengers and cost $48 million to $58 million each. With flying ranges of up to 6,600 miles, these so-called heavy-metal jets are becoming increasingly popular as business aviation expands globally.
Slightly more than half of global business-jet deliveries are made in the United States, with the next biggest proportion, about 17 percent, in Europe, where the industry has been battered by the economic downturn. ''We take a global view, with our large operations in the U.S. and also in Europe, and expanding operations in China,'' said Jordan Hansell, chief executive of NetJets. ''We're looking at more than just the U.S. aviation market, which is holding its own.''
NetJets, Flight Options and a third big player, FlexJet, a unit of Bombardier, dominate the fractional-ownership market, which NetJets popularized starting in 1986. Rather than buying an entire airplane, fractional owners purchase a share, starting at one-sixteenth or one-eighth, of a certain model. Share ownership ensures a customer the availability of that model of plane on short notice for a specified number of hours a year.
A one-eighth share typically equals 100 flying hours a year. Besides buying a share of the plane prorated on its overall price, customers pay an hourly fee when flying and a monthly maintenance fee. The companies offer other options, including so-called jet cards sold in hourly blocks, usually in increments of 25 hours, but without the same rights as ownership.
Even at this less expensive end of the business, flying privately is not cheap. A 25-hour Flight Options card for a speedy, seven-passenger Hawker 400XP light jet, for example, costs $110,000, plus fuel and taxes. Jet cards are typically used by people who fly fewer than 50 hours a year.
''It's very hard to justify all the costs,'' Mr. Dowley acknowledged, ''but I'm in the service business and in the private equity business, where you have multiple clients and multiple issues.''
''The commercial schedule is just so grossly inefficient,'' he said, that augmenting it with private jets makes economic sense.
Over all, the cheapest per-seat method of private flying is charter aviation, in which travel is usually sold on a per-flight, on-demand basis. (XOJet, a leader in the on-demand charter business, said recently that its flight hours in the first half of 2012 were up 55 percent from the same period in 2011.)
The most expensive private-jet option, of course, is outright ownership of a plane. This end of the market remains the most severely affected since the recession, both by basic economics and by the populist criticism that developed against the high-flying rich.
Mr. Ricci estimated that while the fractional-share market was finally growing again, it had shrunk from about 450,000 hours a year just before the recession to about 350,000 hours now.
''If you're operating a business, it doesn't take long for your employees to realize you're still flying in the corporate jet,'' he said. ''That's maybe not the example you want to set. We still have customers that will do business flying commercially, and they'll have either a card or a small fractional share that they use for their personal travel, and they'll ask not to have that go through their office. They still try to keep that low profile.''

HEADLINE: No End to Housing Collapse in the 'Carpet Capital'

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON;

 BODY:
DALTON, Ga. -- It's lemonade time here in a town that calls itself the carpet capital of the world.How else can you look at it when you have recently shed more jobs than any other metropolitan area in America?
This stretch of carpet mills and floor covering outlets that hugs Interstate 75 between Atlanta and Chattanooga lost 4,600 jobs, or 6.9 percent, from June 2011 to June 2012, according to a new report from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Not that long ago, the mills that once produced nearly half the world's carpets could not find enough workers. The road along the Interstate was jammed with out-of-towners who drove hundreds of miles to find bargains amid the rolls of remnants and stacks of samples.
More than a million new homes a year were being sold by the mid-2000s, and they all needed fresh carpet.
By 2008, the housing boom was over. The town's unemployment rate, once about 4 percent, nearly doubled in a blink, and is now more than 12 percent.
The people of Dalton thought that was the worst of it. All the lemons had been delivered. But as many communities around the country found, what seemed like the bottom wasn't.
Last week, the cavernous floor-covering emporiums along Dalton's carpet row were empty. Carpet sellers who used to bring home $60,000 a year or more are making half that -- if they have a job at all.
Jerry Stanley, the carpet king of Dalton who built up an outlet empire from almost nothing in the 1980s, says business this July and August has been worse than last December, when carpet sales are always at their lowest because hardly anyone buys floor covering around Christmas.
He had 31 employees in 2008, the last good year. Now he is down to 12, and it is hard to figure out what to say in the motivational sales meetings. ''We're all kind of battle worn,'' he said. ''The guys have their dippers down.''
He blames a lot of things, not the least of which are the government's economic polices. But Home Depot and Lowe's are not helping, and neither is a new generation of customers who want it cheap, easy and, if possible, over the Internet.
Technology has hurt employment in other ways. The big mills that operate here have streamlined production. More efficient carpet factories meant many of the entry-level jobs tying yarn or stringing machines have been eliminated. More experienced workers were laid off.
Things in Dalton are so desperate that -- as bad as they know it sounds -- some people feel a little hopeful when they hear news about wildfires or floods or tornadoes.
''You've got to have carpet and wood to rebuild,'' said James Hall, 77, a one-time high school football star who along with his wife, Pat, 72, grew up in the area. ''It's terrible that tragedy helps us, but it does.''
Still, there are those who have turned their attention to making lemonade. Elyse Cochran, executive director of the Dalton-Whitfield County Joint Development Authority, is one.
Like a late-night gambler at a craps table, sure she can win it all back with one good roll, Ms. Cochran is as optimistic as they come. That 12.4 percent unemployment rate? It's a ready-made work force.
''That's our heritage, our history,'' Ms. Cochran said. ''We are a nonunion, hard-working manufacturing community.'' That should be attractive to other kinds of industries.
And the next generation of workers in this city of more than 33,000 are going to be well-positioned for what she calls ''the new global marketplace.'' The children of the immigrants -- some of whom were once bused in from Mexico to work in the mills -- are growing up. Hispanics make up the largest population of students at Dalton High School. Add in the German immersion program and you have a diverse, bilingual pool of potential workers, Ms. Cochran said.
Still, the days when someone with no education could walk into a plant and get a job as a yarn creeler are gone. The companies need engineers and people with other technical skills, so they are starting the training early.
The economic development agency and Shaw Industries, the world's largest carpet manufacturer, ran a carpet camp this summer for middle school students. Children toured carpet mills and even got to design a piece of carpet.
The hope is that they might grow up and enroll in a school like Georgia Northwestern Technical College, which just opened a campus here.
''Parents are sending their kids away saying, 'Don't go to work in the mills,' '' said Barbara Ward, the former high school teacher who started the camp. ''But it's not their parents' carpet mill of 30 years ago. It's very high-tech.''
But everyone knows the golden age is over.
''The carpet capital is not going to be Dalton and the 100 miles around Dalton ever again,'' Ms. Cochran said. On carpet row, salesmen talk a lot about the growing interest in laminate flooring. And then there is the new 184-acre industrial park. Granted, the only tenant is a small chemical adhesive company, but it is a start.
And surely Volkswagen, which has a new plant a half-hour up the road in Chattanooga, will need parts from smaller manufacturers that might want to call Dalton home.
Still, it is hard not to wonder what might become of Dalton, which started when the railroad arrived in 1847. Now, downtown holds not much more than three pawn shops, an espresso bar that plays Christian soft rock and the headquarters for the Carpet and Rug Institute, a trade group.
''All you need to do is get on the road to see what's happening here,'' said Mr. Hall, the former football star. ''Everybody's going in the opposite direction.''

HEADLINE: In Andalusia, on the Trail Of Inherited Memories

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL;. 
Doreen Carvajal, a reporter for The International Herald Tribune and The New York Times, is the author of ''The Forgetting River: A Modern Tale of Survival, Identity and the Inquisition.''

 BODY:
ARCOS DE LA FRONTERA, Spain -- I still wonder how I ended up living in a former medieval bordello on the brink of a sandstone cliff on the southern frontier of Spain.It was 2008, the start of the Andalusian region's economic meltdown, La Crisis, and anxiety spread like the Black Plague. But from the roof of my apartment in this ancient white pueblo, I plunged back in time.
The other world worried about bills, real estate values, tourism, lost jobs, the immediate future. In contrast, I retreated into my quest, hoping to take new stock of my identity by reclaiming ancestral memories, history and DNA clues that I believe had been faithfully passed down for generations of my family, the Carvajals.
They had left Spain centuries ago, during the Inquisition. That much I knew. We were raised as Catholics in Costa Rica and California, but late in life I finally started collecting the nagging clues of a very clandestine identity: that we were descendants of secret Sephardic Jews -- Christian converts known as conversos, or Anusim (Hebrew for the forced ones) or even Marranos, which in Spanish means swine. 
I didn't know if my family had a connection to the white pueblo. But by living in its labyrinth of narrow cobblestone streets, I hoped to understand the fears that shaped the secret lives of my own family.
History is a part of daily life in the old quarter, where Inquisition trials were staged and neighbors spied on neighbors, dutifully reporting heretics -- Christian converts who were secretly practicing Judaism. The former Jewish quarter, where white houses plunge down a steep, silvery lane, is still standing, though unmarked by any street sign. I wanted to understand why my family guarded secret identities for generations with such inexplicable fear and caution. When my aunt died a few years ago, she left instructions barring a priest from presiding over her funeral; my grandmother did the same.
There are scientific studies exploring whether the history of our ancestors is somehow a part of us, inherited in unexpected ways through a vast chemical network in our cells that controls genes, switching them on and off. At the heart of the field, known as epigenetics, is the notion that genes have memory and that the lives of our grandparents -- what they breathed, saw and ate -- can directly affect us decades later.
Recent studies in Sweden explore the effects of famine and abundant harvests on the health of descendants four generations later. That is not exactly what I am looking for: I'm intrigued by the notion that generations pass on particular survival skills and an unconscious sense of identity that stands the test of centuries.
The French psychologist Anne Ancelin Schützenberger, now in her 90s, has spent decades studying what she calls the ancestor syndrome -- that we are links in a chain of generations, unconsciously affected by their suffering or unfinished business until we acknowledge the past.
In the 1990s Dina Wardi, a psychotherapist in Jerusalem, worked with the children of Holocaust survivors and developed the theory that survivor parents often designated certain children as ''memorial candles'' who took on the mission of serving as a link to preserve the past and connect the future. The children of survivors who actively struggled against the Nazis, she found, had a compulsive ambition to achieve.
A similar strategy existed among the forced converts, the Anusim: Usually older women were entrusted with passing on information about their secret identity to particular younger family members. In our family, the historian was my great-aunt Luz, whose name means light in Spanish. I lived for a summer in her house in San José, Costa Rica, but she never confided in me, and regrettably I was not curious enough about our past to ask questions.
But recently, my cousin Rosie told me that she had made it her mission to question Aunt Luz at a family gathering. Given our family penchant for secrecy, she taped the conversation with a hidden recorder.
''Luz told me that our family came from Spain,'' Rosie said. ''She asked me, 'Has your mother ever told you that we are Sefarditas?' Of course, when I brought it up with my mother, she refused to talk.''
My fantasy, of course, was that I could somehow tap these ancestral memories. I have recently made the acquaintance of another Carvajal in Spain, an actor who remembers that even though he was raised Catholic he always insisted to his mother that he was Jewish. He said he started making the claim when he was about 6 years old.
In the video game Assassin's Creed, fiction provides a solution to this kind of riddle: Gamers plunge into the main character's genetic memory archives to share vivid recollections of Jerusalem and Italy during the Renaissance.
Reality is even stranger. Dr. Darold A. Treffert, a psychiatrist in Wisconsin, maintains a registry of about 300 ''savants'' who through a head injury or dementia acquire skills they never learned. Conceivably, he says, those skills, like music, mathematics, art and calendar calculating, were buried deep in their brains. He calls it genetic memory, or ''factory-installed software,'' a huge reservoir of dormant knowledge that can emerge when a damaged brain rewires itself to recover from injuries.
''How is this possible?'' Dr. Treffert asked in an interview. ''The only way that knowledge can be there is through genetic transmission.
''In the animal kingdom, we accept without question migration patterns that birds are born with, which they never learned. The monarch butterfly makes a trip from Canada to Mexico to a 23-acre spot, and they take three generations to get there.''
I think about the flight of butterflies when I consider what has brought me back to southern Spain, where my own ancestors surely left for Costa Rica on a boat from the Bay of Cádiz, most likely with some of the early Spanish explorers, who carried converso Jews fleeing the Inquisition.
In the red leather folder where I keep my reporter's notebook and business cards, I always keep a photograph of the old Inquisition jail in Arcos de la Frontera. It's from that heady time when I first visited the pueblo and felt a powerful urge to stay and explore. The photo shows a splintering wood door, a cobblestone lane and a whitewashed box of a building with a glowing light and street sign with the word ''leal,'' for loyal. I have marked it with a phrase from T. S. Eliot: ''And the end of all our exploring, will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.''
Long after I made my sojourn to Arcos de la Frontera, which is partly bounded by the Guadalete -- named for the mythical Greek river of forgetting -- I found out that Aunt Luz sometimes dreamed about Andalusia. It is too late to pose the question -- she died in 1998 -- but it haunts me that she told another cousin in Costa Rica that she often dreamed of a river that plunges into the bay where Columbus set sail for the Americas.
It could only be the home of our butterflies: the green river of forgetting, the Guadalete.

HEADLINE: As European Banks Retreat, Asia Fills the Gap

BYLINE: By ALAN WHEATLEY | REUTERS;

 BODY:
LONDON -- As European banks retrench in an effort to recover from the global financial meltdown, they are finding ready buyers in Asia for assets as varied as loans and entire insurance and brokerage operations.There are other tell-tale signs of a shift in power: The two biggest initial public offerings this year, after Facebook's, were made not in the United States or Europe, but in Malaysia.
Yet perhaps what is more striking is that, with one or two exceptions, Asian financial firms are not doing more in Europe itself to capitalize on the euro zone's festering debt and banking crisis. 
Take China. Its economy has more than doubled in size in five years. It has some of the biggest banks in the world. And its appetite for snapping up natural resources is undiminished: Witness the $15.1 billion agreement last month by the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corp., known as Cnooc, to buy Nexen of Canada, the biggest foreign acquisition to date by a Chinese company.
When it comes to the financial sector, however, the glass is half-empty, not half-full, said AndrÃ© Loesekrug-Pietri, chairman of A Capital, a China-Europe investment fund.
''There's a front-cover story every other month about China buying up the world, but China is still a very small player in international M.&A.,'' he said, referring to mergers and acquisitions.
David Marsh, co-founder of a forum in London that connects central banks and sovereign wealth funds with banks and asset managers, said Western institutions no longer had a monopoly on innovation and dynamism in financial services.
But China is playing a long game, biding its time and waiting for bargains. With plenty of bankers and traders being laid off, Chinese firms have the chance to build up their teams and expertise gradually, rather than by making giant acquisitions.
''They'll be much more clever than simply buying moribund banks at high prices; they'll be buying people,'' Mr. Marsh said.
''What we're seeing now is just the precursor of a much bigger shift that will take place over the next 10 years,'' he continued, ''but it won't happen in one fell swoop.''
Nonetheless, China has not been asleep on the acquisitions front.
Two Chinese private equity funds are on the shortlist of bidders for the asset management arm of the French-Belgian financial group Dexia, a deal that could be worth â[#x201a]¬500 million, or $616 million, or more.
And Citic Securities has agreed to buy CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, a highly regarded brokerage firm in Hong Kong, from its French parent, CrÃ©dit Agricole, in a two-stage transaction worth $1.25 billion.
The deal is symbolic. Whereas Citic is the biggest brokerage firm in China, CrÃ©dit Agricole is battling mounting losses in Greece, the epicenter of the euro zone crisis, where it owns one of the country's largest banks, Emporiki.
''Distressed banks selling good assets always happens in a crisis like this,'' said Ken Courtis, founding partner of Themes Investment Management and a former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia.
''Banks which don't want to raise capital by issuing new equity end up selling their offshore assets, and typically they sell the crown jewels,'' he said.
A clutch of other European financial institutions is also beating the retreat in Asia.
Royal Bank of Scotland has sold some of its Asia-Pacific investment banking operations to CIMB Group Holdings of Malaysia, while the Dutch bank ING is selling its $7 billion Asia insurance business. Both banks had to be bailed out by their governments during the crisis.
Integrating CLSA, known as a brokerage house with an independent streak, would be one of the biggest challenges for Citic, Mr. Courtis said. Chinese financial institutions in general have a narrow bench of executives with the right linguistic and overseas management expertise -- one reason they are initially beefing up their offshore presence in more-or-less familiar Hong Kong, he said.
''They don't have a lot of people who have experience managing big international pools of capital,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''So they will do this step by step. We'll continue to see them move ahead slowly.''
Underscoring that cautious approach, Bank of China said last month that it was ending a four-year foray into Swiss private banking and transferring less than 1 billion Swiss francs, or $1.03 billion, in assets to Julius Baer under a pact to refer clients to each other.
One reason China is treading carefully is that its sovereign wealth fund incurred big paper losses when it bought stakes in the fund manager Blackstone and the investment bank Morgan Stanley before the financial crisis broke.
Ping An Insurance, one of China's largest insurers, lost about $3 billion on its 2007 investment in Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial giant that foundered during the credit crunch.
Chastened, the authorities in Beijing blocked several other financial deals as too risky, including a proposal by Bank of China to buy 20 percent of a French private bank, La Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re Edmond de Rothschild.
''Today we don't have so much support from the government to do financial services M.&A.,'' said Mr. Loesekrug-Pietri of A Capital.
According to figures compiled by Rhodium Group, a consulting firm in New York, China invested $526 million in financial services and insurance in the European Union from 2000 to 2011, just 2.5 percent of China's total direct investment in the Union over that period.
But that sum includes only two mergers and acquisitions, valued at $31 million. The rest of the investment was in the form of ''greenfield'' projects, like setting up new offices.
London's ambitions to become a hub for trading in the renminbi, together with Chinese companies' growing presence in Europe, should ensure plenty of opportunities for further internal expansion, whether takeovers eventually flourish or not.
''We increasingly see Chinese service providers following their domestic clients abroad to provide support with overseas operations,'' Rhodium said in a recent report. ''Chinese banks, now present in all major European markets, are an example.''

1912 Man Walks Under Water
PARIS -- M. Maurice Fernez carried out some successful experiments yesterday [Aug. 20] in walking under water along the bed of the Seine without the aid of a diver's dress between the Pont Sully and the Pont Marie, near the Hotel de Ville. The apparatus he used consists of a simple appliance covering the mouth and the nostrils so as to exclude the water, while the air supply is assured by an indiarubber tube into which air is forced by means of a bicycle pump from a boat on the surface of the water. Clad in an ordinary bathing costume, M. Maurice Fernez remained immersed for ten minutes. It was clearly demonstrated that by means of the device he has invented it is possible to remain a long time below the surface of the water. 
1937 Hottest August 20 in 55 Years
NEW YORK -- New Yorkers dripped through the hottest August 20 in 55 years as the mercury hit 93 degrees in the shade at 4 o'clock this afternoon [Aug. 20]. In Boston, the weather bureau marked up a fifty-six year record when the thermometer registered 92 degrees, and from all over the south and eastern southwest came reports of near-record heat. Six deaths in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, and New York were accredited to the heat -- now in its third day -- and the second major period of stifling temperatures in recent weeks.
1962 Malta Asks for Independence
LONDON -- Malta, the hero island of World War II, tonight [Aug. 20] charged the British were starving it out of work and money and demanded complete independence from colonial rule. Dr. Borg Olivier, Malta's Premier, announced the demand after eight-week negotiations on British aid had broken down. He said an independent Malta would remain inside the Commonwealth. Malta was awarded the George Cross during World War II for its valor in resisting German and Italian attacks. Since then its role as a naval base has declined as British naval power has diminished. The result has been unemployment on the island and a series of demands for aid which British governments have regarded as excessive. Mr. Olivier's independence demand, which he said has the full backing of his Cabinet, was posted to Duncan Sandys, Secretary of State for the Commonwealth and Colonies. Malta now has internal self-government.

HEADLINE: Going After Illegal Logging Biologically

BYLINE: By DAVID FOGARTY | REUTERS;

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- Call it CSI: Singapore.Unlike the crime scene investigators from the popular television series, however, these detectives are hired to look for evidence of rogue wood from stores increasingly worried about being duped by a global trade in illegal timber now worth billions.
They take wood samples into their lab and put them through DNA tests that can pinpoint the species and origin of a piece of timber. They also track timber and timber products from forest to store to ensure that clients' shipments are legal.
''This is like 'CSI' meets save the planet,'' said Jonathan Geach, executive director of Double Helix Tracking Technologies, a Singapore company that has developed and commercialized DNA testing for wood, the only company in the world to have done so.
Every two seconds, an area of forest the size of a U.S. football field is clear-cut by illegal loggers, the World Bank said in a recent study. Annually, such illegally cleared land is equivalent to the area of Ireland. 
The money earned from a trade that Interpol estimates to be worth as much as $30 billion annually is untaxed and often run by organized gangs to pay for crime and conflict. The logging increases global warming with heightened carbon emissions and creates landslides through loss of vegetation on slopes. It causes loss of livelihoods in forest communities and dents global timber prices.
Until now, the battle against the trade in illegal timber has been waged with regulations and preventive measures but has not met with much success. Now it is increasingly focused on using the criminal justice system and law enforcement techniques.
New laws threatening prison time and fines are inducing companies around the world to take a harder look at where they get their timber.
Gibson Guitar, which makes some of the world's most prized guitars, agreed Aug. 6 to pay a $300,000 penalty after it admitted to possibly having made illegal purchases of ebony from Madagascar.
Mislabeling wood, lying about its origin and substituting one type of wood for another have become common practices in the timber trade.
Industry officials say rapid advances and plunging costs for DNA testing of timber now make the tests commercially viable for companies trying to meet new regulations in the United States and Europe.
Retailers like Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer and the Australian timber wholesaler Simmonds Lumber are either already using the technology or looking to add it to their existing timber sourcing practices.
''We see this as the way forward,'' said Jamie Lawrence, sustainable forest and timber adviser for Kingfisher, Europe's largest home-improvement retailer. Kingfisher has been using the services of Double Helix on an ad hoc basis to unmask cases of possible timber fraud in its supply chains, he said.
With the miniaturization of genetic testing equipment, desktop-size prototypes are already being tried out. Laboratories around the globe could be carrying out cheap DNA timber tests for companies, customs agents and the police within two years.
A laboratory run by Andrew Lowe, the chief scientific officer at Double Helix and one of the world's top plant geneticists, is the front line in the global fight against illegal logging.
It was at his laboratory at the University of Adelaide in South Australia that the method of extracting DNA taken from a log, a table or even flooring was refined -- the breakthrough needed to commercialize testing for timber importers, home-improvement stores and law enforcement agencies.
Trees, like people, have unique DNA, Mr. Lowe said.
''The DNA is in every cell in a wood product, and you can't falsify that DNA,'' he said.
By early 2011, Mr. Lowe was able to extract degraded DNA from decades-old wood and get accurate results. That led to an increase in business; Double Helix has 14 clients directly using its services, with most testing done in Adelaide.
When Double Helix opened in 2008, the DNA story was a hard sell. But as new U.S. laws started to bite over the past two years, and with tougher laws set for Europe in 2013, the number of clients is growing, said Kevin Hill, Double Helix's founder.
The aim is to license Mr. Lowe's DNA extraction technique within two years to accredited laboratories globally, as the $150 billion timber industry comes under increasing pressure to stamp out illegal wood.
Although DNA testing is extremely accurate because of the unique DNA signature each species has, it has a major limitation to overcome: an incomplete global map of tree genetics.
Constructing such a map is crucial, because DNA for each species changes subtly from one area to another, acting like a postal code that can be used to determine a sample's origin.
Going into a forest to take DNA samples across a species's entire range is costly and time-consuming. Building a database for teak, for instance, would cost about $1 million.
At present, databases exist for 20 tree species, mostly valuable tropical timbers, and are growing annually.
By contrast, Kingfisher's B&Q home-improvement stores carry 16,000 timber-related products. For consumers, it is a bewildering choice of goods. For the illegal timber gangs, it is an opportunity for wood laundering.
Kingfisher has progressively put in place tougher checks of its timber sources to ensure all wood comes from sustainable, managed forests. It uses chain of custody certification systems to follow the timber from forest to retail outlet, but those are not foolproof and illegal timber occasionally slips in.
''We're getting better at figuring out what's in our products and where it's coming from. So it's more difficult for rogue traders to pull the wool over our eyes,'' said Mr. Lawrence of Kingfisher, which has nearly 1,000 stores in eight countries.
The weakest link in timber supplies is between the forest and the sawmill, where stolen timber can be added to legitimate wood. In sawmill yards, too, logs from illegally cleared forests can be mixed with legal timber. DNA testing can overcome this, say Double Helix and its oldest customer, Simmonds Lumber, one of Australia's largest timber importers.
Paul Elsmore, Simmonds's former chief executive and now a consultant to the Australian company, said each container load of Indonesian merbau wood was worth about $45,000.
The cost of DNA testing and verification services was $250 for a container, equal to about 0.5 percent of the wood's value.
Double Helix says the ultimate goal is to make DNA testing so cheap that all companies will do it.
''One of the real values of this genetic marking is its ability to gather better-quality evidence and therefore aid prosecutions,'' said Davyth Stewart, a criminal intelligence officer at Interpol.
Mr. Lawrence said better wood forensics just makes sense. ''Any retailer worth their salt should not just be thinking about risk, brand protection or even legality,'' he said. ''They should be thinking this is a damn good idea.''

HEADLINE: Leading Party In South Korea Picks Woman

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN;

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- A former dictator's daughter who cited Queen Elizabeth I of Britain as her role model became the first serious female contender for South Korea's presidency on Monday when she was chosen as the governing party's candidate for the election in December.Park Geun-hye, a daughter of President Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, is the first woman and the first child of a former president to become the presidential candidate of a major political party in South Korea.
Ms. Park, 60, won the nomination of the Saenuri Party by a huge margin, gathering 84 percent of the votes during a party convention. The remaining ballots were split among four other rivals. 
''I will open an era of grand national unity,'' she said in a speech after winning the race, identifying a divide between regions, generations and the rich and poor as a main challenge for the next president.
In 2007, Ms. Park lost the presidential nomination of her party, then in opposition, to the current president, Lee Myung-bak, whose election returned conservatives to power after two consecutive liberal presidents: Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. Mr. Lee is barred by law from seeking re-election.
Seeking to retain power, the conservatives confront the best and worst of their legacy in Ms. Park's candidacy. Her father is the godfather of conservatives, and his twin bequests of economic growth and political repression still divide South Koreans.
Under Park Chung-hee, the country soared from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War and industrialized itself while maintaining a staunchly anti-Communist stance against North Korea and cherishing its military alliance with Washington. For older South Koreans, especially those in her father's home province, Gyeongsang in the southeast, his name is enough for them to vote for Ms. Park.
But under Mr. Park, the government also persecuted dissidents, often framing and torturing them as Communist subversives. Many of the victims are now opposition leaders.
His economic policy helped a handful of family-controlled and politically connected business enterprises grow into the so-called chaebol conglomerates, like Samsung and Hyundai, which spearheaded the country's export-driven economy but were accused of squeezing smaller businesses at a time of a widening gap between rich and poor.
Mr. Park also banned rock music, miniskirts for women and long hair for men.
Liberals, who seek to retake power, trace their roots to a pro-democracy movement against Mr. Park and subsequent dictators. They champion reconciliation with North Korea.
The main opposition Democratic United Party is scheduled to select its presidential nominee next month.
Ms. Park's aides said she needed to connect with younger voters, those who fret over rising youth unemployment and widening income disparity and who do not remember her father's leadership. On Monday, she pledged to broaden welfare and fight corruption, which has marred the image of Mr. Lee's government and her own party. She has also indicated that she would mend relations with North Korea, which have chilled under Mr. Lee. During a television debate this month, Ms. Park depicted Elizabeth I, who reigned as British queen from 1558 till 1603, as her role model.
''She saved her country from the verge of bankruptcy and turned it into a nation where the sun never set,'' Ms. Park said. ''Because she knew misfortune, she knew how to care for others.''
Like the Virgin Queen, as Elizabeth I is sometimes called, Ms. Park has never married and is often credited with saying that she was married to the nation.
Ms. Park abandoned her studies in Paris and served as acting first lady at 22 after her mother was killed in 1974 in an assassination attempt aimed at her father. After Park Chung-hee was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979, she disappeared from public view. Then, in 1998, with South Korea in economic crisis and people hankering for her father's charismatic leadership, she entered Parliament, saying she would ''save'' the country.
Ms. Park cultivated her image as a principled and steely leader, saying that she learned those values from her father. She traveled to North Korea in 2002 to meet its leader, Kim Jong-il. During her three stints as the leader of the conservatives' party, she demonstrated a skill in rallying support.
But critics called her Princess Geun-hye or notebook princess for her privileged upbringing and her reported reliance on prepared scripts. Her father's legacy has also dogged her, with the opposition demanding that she clarify her stance over her father's 1961 military coup. In 2007, she called it a ''revolution to save the nation.'' In July, she said the coup was ''my father's best and inevitable choice.''
Another obstacle to her candidacy, however, is her father's career as an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army during Japan's colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Anti-Japanese sentiments rooted in the occupation run deep in Korea. Chung Sye-kyun, a member of the Democratic Unity Party who is running for his party's presidential nomination, said last week, ''The daughter of the Japanese Army lieutenant should never become our president.''
Political analysts and surveys say that Ms. Park's biggest rival in the December poll will likely be Ahn Cheol-soo, a university dean and vocal critic of the existing political parties, all mired in corruption scandals. Mr. Ahn appeals to young voters and urban professionals who care as much about welfare as about economic growth, the guiding principle of conservative policy makers since Mr. Park's time.

HEADLINE: Shares Waver as Worry Rises on European Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS;

 BODY:
Stocks slipped Monday in one of the quietest trading sessions of the year. Worries about European debt crept up again, and Apple became the most valuable company of all time.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.56 points, or 0.03 percent, to 13,271.64. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell slightly, 0.03 point, to 1,418.13. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.38 point, or 0.01 percent, to 3,076.21.
With many traders and investors on vacation, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was light, just 2.7 billion shares traded. The average this year has been about one billion more. 
In a monthly report, the German central bank reiterated doubts about having the European Central Bank buy bonds to help struggling European economies. It emphasized that such purchases could carry ''substantial risks.''
In recent weeks, stocks rallied after the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, said the bank might buy the bonds of some European countries to lower their borrowing costs. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also seemed to soften her stance on the idea.
''We're getting mixed messages at best coming from Europe,'' Jim Russell, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said Monday. ''Investors are on the sidelines, and they're still a little scared.''
Apple, the most valuable company in the world, became the most valuable company in history. It hit a market value of $623 billion, surpassing Microsoft's record from 1999. Apple is worth almost twice as much as the next most valuable company, Exxon Mobil. Shares of rose $17.04, or 2.6 percent, to $665.15.
Stocks had inched up for six weeks. On Friday, the Dow and the S.& P. closed just below four-year highs.
The latest drop made Monday the 11th consecutive trading day of moves of less than 1 percent for the S.& P., according to FactSet, a financial data provider. In the same period last year, amid fears that the United States would default on its debt and that a second recession was possible, the S.& P. moved up or down by 1 percent or more roughly every other day.
Other stocks moving sharply Monday included Lowe's, the world's No. 2 home improvement store, behind Home Depot. It missed earnings expectations and lowered its outlook for the year. The stock fell nearly 6 percent.
The health insurer Aetna announced it would buy Coventry Health Care for $5.7 billion as the insurance industry realigns itself to better navigate the health care overhaul. Aetna rose $2.14, or nearly 6 percent, to $40.18. Coventry climbed $7.10, or 20 percent, to $42.04.
The deal follows the $4.46 billion buyout last month of another insurer, Amerigroup, by WellPoint, and an acquisition last year when Cigna bought HealthSpring in a deal worth nearly $4 billion as it sought a share of Medicare revenue.
Best Buy, the electronics retailer, slid 10 percent after rejecting an offer from its founder and largest shareholder to take it private. The company named Hubert Joly, the former chief of Carlson, a global hospitality company, and a turnaround specialist, as chief executive, on Monday.
Facebook gained 96 cents, or 5 percent, to $20.01. It slid last week after some insiders were able to sell stock for the first time since its initial public offering in May at a price of $38.
In the S.& P. 500-stock index, six of the 10 main industry groups fell, led by a 0.8 percent drop in telecommunications stocks.
In Europe, stocks fell. Greek stocks fell 2 percent. Spain's main index was off 1 percent.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1/32, to 98 10/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.81 percent.

HEADLINE: A Planet 'Just Right' for Life? Perhaps, if It Exists

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE;

 BODY:
What ever happened to the Goldilocks planet?It was big news back in September 2010 when a group led by Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution for Science said they had discovered a small planet circling a small red star in the constellation Libra, at a distance smack in the middle of the so-called Goldilocks zone -- that ''just right'' region where water on the surface is possible.
If confirmed, Gliese 581g, as it is known, would be the first known exoplanet -- that is, a planet outside our own solar system -- that could support life. But within weeks, a group of exoplanet astronomers based at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland under the leadership of Michel Mayor said they could not find the planet in their own extensive data on the star. After other papers appeared questioning the statistical significance of the new planet, most astronomers consigned it to the bin of failed dreams.
In July, however, Dr. Vogt and Dr. Butler struck back. 
In a paper in the journal Astronomische Nachrichten (Astronomical Notes) they argued that the planet does indeed show up in the Swiss observations, if they are analyzed properly.
''We see the planet in their data,'' Dr. Butler said recently.
The new paper has raised eyebrows, but has so far changed few minds.
In an e-mail recently, Dr. Vogt said, ''The silence is telling.''
Typical was the response from Artie P. Hatzes, a former student of Dr. Vogt's who is now at the Thuringian State Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany, who said it pained him to see his old mentor sticking to a conclusion ''that is obviously wrong.''
Dr. Hatzes called Gliese 581g ''a marginal detection'' that was not supported by additional data, something that happens often. ''I think that no amount of fancy analysis can replace having high-quality data and more of it,'' he said.
The impasse has led some astronomers to suggest that an outsider look at the data, but everyone is too busy with his or her own research. In the two years since Gliese 581g (pronounced GLEE-za) was announced, NASA's Kepler satellite has identified more than 2,300 candidate planets in a small portion of the Milky Way in the Cygnus constellation, which scientists are sifting in hopes of soon discovering what some call Earth 2.0.
If nothing else, the dispute illustrates just how hard it is to find out what is going on only a short distance away in the universe. The star Gliese 581 is about 20 light-years away, next door in cosmic terms. The evidence for its planets comes from slight periodic variations in the star's velocity, caused by gravitational tugs of planets swirling around it. The heavier the planet and the closer it is to its star, the bigger the tug, so it can take years to build up and parse the data for an entire system -- the so-called wobble method.
It was on this basis, using sensitive spectrography that goes by the acronym Harps on a telescope in Chile, that the Geneva team concluded by 2007 that there were four planets circling the star, two of them on either side of the ''habitable zone.''
Three years later, Dr. Vogt and his colleagues added two more planets based on their own observations with the Keck telescope in Hawaii, including the one in the middle of the habitable zone, circling the star every 37 days.
The European astronomers were quick to say the new planet was not in their own data. But much to the annoyance of Dr. Vogt and his colleagues, that data was not made public for a year, in a paper posted to the Internet by Thierry Forveille of the Grenoble Observatory in France, the lead author.
Dr. Forveille and his colleagues concluded that their data were best fit by a model in which Gliese 581 had four planets, one of which had an elongated elliptical orbit of 69 days. Such a planet could masquerade as one with half that orbital period, they said, perhaps explaining Dr. Vogt's planet.
Dr. Vogt and his colleagues contend that such an arrangement would be unstable, leading to colliding planets within 200,000 years. Redoing the analysis and assuming that the orbits were all circular, they found leftover data points that could be explained by a fifth planet with an orbit of about 32 days, snugly in the habitable zone, and a mass slightly more than twice that of Earth, essentially confirming their original Goldilocks claim.
Getting this new study published was a tricky problem. Because the Forveille data had not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, Dr. Vogt was not able to publish his analysis of that data in The Astrophysical Journal, the journal of choice for American astronomers.
So they sent it to Astronomische Nachrichten, one of the oldest astronomy journals in the world, but rarely the venue today for groundbreaking news. ''So we will now publish their own data for them for all the world to see and analyze, and then judge for themselves whether the Swiss's rebuttal claims have any credibility,'' Dr. Vogt wrote.
In an e-mail, Dr. Forveille shrugged off the new report, writing that his own team's computer simulations showed that the planetary system with elliptical orbits was stable at least over 900,000 years.
More to the point, he and other astronomers said, was that Dr. Vogt's planet had a 4 percent chance of being a false alarm. That is far above the 1 percent chance normally considered a benchmark for planet detection, and much bigger than the margin Dr. Vogt and his colleagues had cited in their first paper.
''Increasing false alarm probabilities with more data is of course never a good sign,'' Dr. Forveille said. Greg Laughlin of the University of California, Santa Cruz, an expert on planetary dynamics, said the chances of a false alarm rise to 12 percent when uncertainties about the star Gliese 581 itself -- stellar noise -- are added in.
But, he added, Dr. Vogt still had ''a decent shot''of being right. It comes down to whether four planets with eccentric orbits or five planets with circular ones are a more economical fit to the data. Assuming that the planets' orbits all lie in the same plane, Dr. Laughlin explained, tips the balance toward the extra planet. But, of course, more data is needed. He said, ''I thus believe that it is likely that if the peak holds up as more data comes in, the planetary explanation is likely to be correct.''
Eric Ford, an astronomer at the University of Florida who is involved with Kepler, noted that Carl Sagan had maintained that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
''In my judgment,'' Dr. Ford said, ''we do not have extraordinary evidence for the claimed planet Gliese 581g, at least not yet.''
Dr. Hatzes agreed, but added, ''I am sure this will not be the last we have heard of GL 581g.''

HEADLINE: Examining the Ponzi Scheme Through the Mind of the Con Artist

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES;

 BODY:
Maybe "Ponzi scheme" should have its own spot in the Dewey Decimal System. Along with biographies of the schemers, a growing stack of scholarly references, legal tomes and articles aims to collect knowledge about this age-old crime.But the latest entry in the category, "The Ponzi Scheme Puzzle: A History and Analysis of Con Artists and Victims" by Tamar Frankel, takes a different approach. While Professor Frankel is a legal scholar who has been on the faculty of the Boston University Law School since 1968, her book explores the psychology of the financial criminals and what makes them tick. She was inspired by a colleague who referred to them as "those mimics of trustworthiness: con artists."
She spent more than a decade researching the book, analyzing more than a hundred Ponzi schemes. Among them: the Caritas scandal in Romania, an early 1990s fraud whose victims saw the mastermind as a saint in Robin Hood guise; the currency fraud run by J. David Dominelli, which collapsed in the mid-1980s and stung a host of San Diego's elite; and the Madoff scandal, history's largest Ponzi scheme, with paper losses of $64.8 billion and thousands of victims around the world. 
Professor Frankel talked about the mind-set of the con artist, as well as the role that victims and society play. Her conclusions will not comfort Ponzi victims; she faults them for their gullibility and failing to "do their homework." She finds, too, that society has a profound ambivalence toward con artists despite the vicious nature of their crimes - which, she notes, on rare occasions have even included murder.
Q. Do you now feel that you better understand Ponzi schemes and the "mimics" of honesty who run them?
A. Yes. Especially, I understand better the impact of culture - a culture of risk-taking, the hope of making money, an insatiable appetite for more. These are all part of the culture in which Ponzi schemes arise and flourish.
Q. And yet, as you know, those traits are also part of the culture in which capitalism thrives and economies flourish. If no one trusted anyone, modern commerce - indeed, modern life - would be impossible. So where should we draw the line between trust and suspicion?
A. It's not so much a continuum as it is the proverbial slippery slope. It's very easy to slip down a slippery slope - and very hard to climb back up again. When people start doing one little wrong, it gets a little easier to do one more wrong.
Q. Will people buy that? That one step off the straight and narrow leads to corruption?
A. If you look at the history of successful human societies, two things are clear. One, you must have trust. Without it, society cannot succeed. At the same time, you must also be trustworthy.
Q. But it's not so simple, is it? Some victims of Mr. Madoff feel they justifiably placed their trust in a respected market veteran who knew far more about markets than they did. If I'm asked to vet a Madoff story, I know what to look for. But if my car mechanic tells me I need a new frambulator, I don't know enough about cars to assess his honesty; I'll have to trust him. So where is the line between justified trust and unreasonable gullibility? And won't it be different for different people?
A. Gullibility is the tendency to believe without reasonable evidence. Every culture draws a line between trust and gullibility. And in the financial arena, the line between trust and gullibility may have to be more tightly drawn. For example, as I note in my book, many con artists make it seem that they are limiting access to their investments, making them available only to a select few. Now, rationally, why would a money manager do that? Look around you and you see hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity funds and advisers all salivating for more clients. Yet, there are those who believe that the more unique and hard to get an investment is, the more valuable it is. That's gullibility - because it is not rational to believe that.
Q. Of course, Madoff had a seemingly plausible explanation for that: He managed money only as a sideline and he didn't want word to get around because he'd have to turn people away and that would cause hard feelings.
A. And Madoff was a well-known broker - in other words, it was his business. He was an expert trader. He said, "I have a secret way of doing something," and it may have seemed plausible that he did. You're quite right that he's different.
Q. Nor did Madoff promise sky-high returns - he just offered steady consistency. A fraud analyst named Pat Huddleston says of successful Ponzi schemers: "If it sounds too good to be true, you're dealing with an amateur." Don't you think future Ponzi schemers will take a page from Madoff's playbook and keep their returns relatively modest to avoid raising red flags?
A. I doubt it. People certainly are more concerned about risk than they were before the financial crisis. But con artists do not adjust their stories to the current culture and public feeling but rather focus on their potential targeted audiences. For example, a con artist who operated a charitable organization appealed to similar organizations with a story that an anonymous donor would match their investments. This story was convincing because the managers of charitable institutions have donors who seek to remain anonymous.
Q. Some critics may argue that your analysis of people who fall prey to Ponzi schemes skirts pretty close to "blaming the victim." Do you think Ponzi victims are responsible for their own fate?
A. That's a very difficult issue. "Blame" means an "assignment of responsibility for a fault or a wrong or an error." I think we would agree that a person who suffers from heart disease after years of overeating and smoking may bear some responsibility for his or her illness. I empathize with victims and I feel for them, even as I assign some responsibility to them.
Diana B. Henriques is author of "The Wizard of Lies: Bernie Madoff and the Death of Trust."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Now Job Candidates Treat Travel Policy As a Negotiating Point

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY;. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DID you know that one of the things that some job seekers are now negotiating is to what extent they will be exempt from strict corporate travel policies about what can and cannot be expensed on the road? I had no idea, but as soon as I heard, it made sense.''It's sort of funny that your travel policy would be one of the things that you might negotiate now as you're looking for a new job -- assuming you have a good track record of success, especially on the sales side,'' said Suzanne Neufang, the general manager of GetThere, a corporate travel reservations and expense management company.
''We're hearing this is starting to happen, that people are negotiating to at least be in the V.I.P. travel policy, rather than the Joe Shmoe travel policy,'' said Ms. Neufang, who is also the president of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, a trade group for travel managers. 
Companies, she said, ''are very conscious that if you've got this onerous travel policy, you can lose talent.'' Even with a high unemployment rate, she added, ''there is a high need for the right talent, so you don't want that right talent to walk out the door just because they found a better travel policy somewhere else.''
I have long argued that hard-working business travelers should object to corporate policies that add more burdens to life on the road -- like the policy that won't reimburse for a room service dinner, even if it was ordered by some weary marketing representative who just arrived in Seattle after flying all day without anything more than three ounces of peanuts.
It's no secret that corporate travel policies can be a little, shall we say, squishy, depending on who in the organization is doing the traveling. High-ranking executives and employees who are seen as directly adding to the bottom line usually can get around even the most strictly enforced travel policies.
A report by GetThere says that while business-travel spending has increased this year over last, travel managers across the board are tightening policies on reimbursements for airline fees. Only 78 percent of travel policies, for example, allowed for the reimbursement of a first checked bag in 2011, compared with 95 percent in 2010, according to the GetThere Corporate Travel Benchmark Report. Only 21 percent of policies reimbursed for preferred coach seats, which airlines are now selling aggressively, down from 24 percent a year earlier.
Companies are continuing to tighten reimbursement policies even as they struggle to negotiate better overall corporate deals with airlines, Ms. Neufang said. At the same time, travel managers complain that airlines do not provide sufficient information on their wide range of fees.
In recent years, the revenue from all the various fees added to base fares has become crucially important to the livelihood of airlines. Last year, airlines worldwide collected $22.5 billion from fees, a 66 percent jump in two years, according to research by the IdeaWorksCompany, a consulting firm, and the travel technology company Amadeus.
As managers try to sort out all these fees and cogently plan their budgets, travelers are often caught in the middle. Many choices requiring fees are made during the reservations process, but many more -- like last-minute seat selection, standby charges and in-flight Wi-Fi -- are offered ad hoc during the trip. Travelers themselves can be bewildered by what's allowed and what isn't.
''It's hit or miss,'' Ms. Neufang said. ''Corporations can be very good about communicating what is or isn't within policy, and some are a little loose about it and leave it to the travelers' or their managers' judgment.'' But when policy is not clear on a fee, ''a traveler has to make a choice as to whether to pay it or not,'' even at the risk of not being reimbursed, she said.
And as we're all watching airline fees, hotels are busily adding more of their own extra charges. Hotels in the United States will collect an estimated $1.95 billion in revenue this year from fees and surcharges, according to Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.
That's up from $1.85 billion last year -- but only $555 million a decade ago in 2002, according to Mr. Hanson. Common charges, he said in a report last week, include ''resort or amenity fees, early departure fees, early reservations-cancellation fees, Internet fees, telephone call surcharges, business center fees (that is, charges for receiving faxes and sending/receiving overnight packages), room service delivery surcharges, minibar restocking fees, charges for in-room safes and automatic gratuities and surcharges.''
To that list, I'd add a few. Like the ''groundskeeping'' surcharge I once had to pay at a resort and conference hotel in Phoenix that had way too many expansive lawns and gardens for a place in the desert, not to mention an emerald green golf course. Or a charge for ''bell captain service,'' even if you've been avoiding bellhops and taking your own wheeled bags to your room.
To repeat a refrain from a recent column, don't get me started.

HEADLINE: How Well You Sleep May Hinge on Race

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA;

 BODY:
Moleendo Stewart can't say for sure what's caused his lifelong sleeping problems. But he has his suspicions.There's the childhood spent in loud, restless neighborhoods in Miami. ''You hear people shooting guns all night, dealing drugs,'' said Mr. Stewart, 41, who lives in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. He also cites his weight, 260 pounds, down from a peak of 310.
Sleep experts would point to another factor working against Mr. Stewart: He is a black man.
The idea that race or ethnicity might help determine how well people sleep is relatively new among sleep researchers. But in the few short years that epidemiologists, demographers and psychologists have been studying the link, they have repeatedly come to the same conclusion: In the United States, at least, sleep is not colorblind. 
Non-Hispanic whites get more and better-quality sleep than people of other races, studies repeatedly show. Blacks are the most likely to get shorter, more restless sleep.
What researchers don't yet know is why.
''We're not at a point where we can say for certain is it nature versus nurture, is it race or is it socioeconomics,'' said Dr. Michael A. Grandner, a research associate with the Center for Sleep and Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. But when it comes to sleep, ''there is a unique factor of race we're still trying to understand.''
Whatever the cause, doctors say that unlocking the secret to racial sleep disparities could yield insights into why people in some minority groups experience higher rates of high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes. Helping poor or immigrant populations to get more solid sleep, they say, could also help break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.
''When people aren't sleeping as well during the night, they aren't as productive during the day, and they're not as healthy,'' said Dr. Mercedes R. Carnethon, associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ''It's a self-perpetuating cycle.''
The latest evidence that race and ethnicity can affect sleep came in June at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, held in Boston. In one of two studies on the topic presented there, white participants from the Chicago area were found to get an average of 7.4 hours of sleep per night; Hispanics and Asians averaged 6.9 hours and blacks 6.8 hours. Sleep quality -- defined as ease in falling asleep and length of uninterrupted sleep -- was also higher for whites than for blacks.
While those findings are consistent with earlier studies, this one, led by Dr. Carnethon, adjusted for risk factors like cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea and obesity. Even so, blacks and members of other minorities, who are statistically more prone to experience such problems, still got less and more disruptive sleep than whites.
One obvious remaining culprit, says Dr. Carnethon, is socioeconomics.
Because Chicago is still a fairly segregated city, ''the blacks and Hispanics in our study were generally living in neighborhoods that are closer to freeways, so you have freeway noise, there's more business noise at night, and there's potentially more crime, which is stressful to people,'' Dr. Carnethon said. People in lower-income neighborhoods are also more likely to have multiple jobs or to work odd hours, which can interfere with sleep.
The idea that differences in work and living conditions can explain the racial sleep disparities is a popular one among sleep experts. But studies that have accounted for those factors suggest a more complex reality.
One such study from 2005 -- also taking place in Chicago -- measured sleep among 669 participants while adjusting for education, income and employment status. In the end, black men on average still slept 82 minutes less per night than white women, who were found to sleep the best of anyone in the study.
Of course, isolating the real-life effects of social inequality can be tricky. ''There are more subtle differences'' among people than income and education, said Dr. Kristen Knutson, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and an author of the study. ''We had no way to control for stress, and there are social stresses an African-American man might feel that a white man with the same income and education level wouldn't.''
Mr. Stewart, the Brooklyn resident, said he did see discrimination as playing a role in his sleep problems.
''As a black person in America, even if you succeed in terms of education, you still have to deal with the inherent inequality of society,'' said Mr. Stewart, an administrator for a program that exposes students in racial minorities to careers in science and math. ''I don't blame it on the majority -- that's just simplistic. But in general it's not a fair thing, and you stress because of that.''
Sleep experts refer to this as the ''autonomy'' problem, and studies have shown it has an effect on sleep. ''People who feel they have control over their lives were able to feel secure at night, go to sleep, sleep well, and wake up well in the morning and do it all over again,'' said Dr. Lauren Hale, associate professor of preventive medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island, referring to a study she conducted in 2009. ''That's part of the cycle not just for blacks and minorities, but other disadvantaged populations.''
At least one study suggests that socioeconomic factors affecting sleep are highly specific to race and gender. For example, being divorced or widowed was particularly detrimental to the sleep of Hispanic men, while never being married was more likely to take a toll on the sleep of Asian men. Asian women lacking in education were more likely to report sleep problems than similarly educated white women. And men of all races who were in relationships slept better than single men, regardless of relationship quality; for women, the quality of the relationship was more likely to affect sleep.
''There's an effect of socioeconomics,'' said Dr. Grandner, a lead author of the study, ''but it's not really the economic. It's more about the socio.''
It may also be the culture. Black and Hispanic children in America are far less likely to have regularly enforced bedtimes than white children, according to a 2010 study conducted by Dr. Hale for the National Institutes of Health. White children were also more likely to have ''language-based'' bedtime routines -- those that involve reading or storytelling -- both of which are associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral advantages.
These routines establish patterns that can last a lifetime, Dr. Hale said. ''If routines are absent, especially these language-based routines, then children may be missing out on opportunities to develop and sleep optimally,'' she said.
And some researchers aren't ready to discount biology. In a forthcoming study, Dr. Grandner found that short sleepers are more likely to have elevated levels of C-reactive protein, but how much depended on race. C-reactive protein is produced by the body when inflammation is present and has previously been implicated in sleep problems.
The consequences of chronic sleep deprivation for all races include a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, stroke and high blood pressure. Other insidious threats -- like depression, mood swings and decreased learning capacity -- have all been linked to lack of sleep, both as consequences and causes. In order to break the cycle, researchers say, patients need to make sleep a priority.
''There's this idea in this country that sleep might not be the most important thing, that we have to get things done and sleep can be de-prioritized,'' said Dr. Grandner, comparing America with European countries that carve out midday periods for sleep. ''We need to be thinking about sleep the same way we think about diet and exercise.''

For the second year in a row, Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's biggest retailer, will offer a layaway program for holiday purchases.Echoing Wal-Mart executives' comments last week that American consumers are still worried about their finances, the company also said it would add an extra month to the program so shoppers have more time -- and paychecks -- to pay for their items on layaway. 
''Our customer was saying if they had two more paycheck cycles, that really would be helpful for them,'' said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.
The company had stopped layaway from 2006 to 2010, when the economy was much stronger and shoppers did not seem to need to delay paying for holiday gifts. With layaway, a store sets aside a product and allows a customer to pay over time for it. It lets people on tight budgets afford more expensive items than a single paycheck might allow, since they can make a dent in the payments whenever their paychecks arrive.
Last year, Wal-Mart brought the program back.
''Our customer continues to be concerned with unemployment and underemployment,'' Mr. Mac Naughton said. ''They're concerned about the expenses they're paying every day -- gas prices have recently gone up.''
Executives cited layaway as one of the reasons its holiday sales last year were relatively strong, and an executive at Target, a major competitor, said the layaway offering at Wal-Mart was hurting Target.
The company said millions of people used its layaway program last year. Mr. Mac Naughton declined to specify how many people did not pay off their layaway purchases, but said a ''distinct majority'' of customers were able to finish paying off their purchases.
Like last year, shoppers can use layaway on electronics, jewelry and toys. This year, small appliances and large sporting items, like trampolines, are included in the program.
This year's terms are also a little more lenient, giving shoppers 90 days to pay instead of 60 and not charging a cancellation fee. While it is more expensive to begin a layaway purchase this year -- $15 instead of $5 -- that $15 is refunded in a gift card once the item is fully paid for.
Mr. Mac Naughton said that for now, the company was not planning on extending its layaway program year-round. ''At this time, we're focused just on the Christmas selling season,'' he said.
Sears and Toys ''R'' Us have also brought back layaway in recent years. Sears Holding's Kmart division has had layaway programs for decades.

HEADLINE: Host to Masters Drops a Barrier With Its First 2 Female Members

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Augusta National Golf Club, the private club that hosts the Masters and has come under attack over the past decade for its all-male membership, added two female members Monday: Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, and Darla Moore, a South Carolina businesswoman.For years, the 80-year-old club's restrictive membership policies, which excluded blacks until 1990, cast it as a remnant of the antediluvian South. Whenever its exclusion of women was held up for public scrutiny, in 2002 and again this year, the club held steadfast to its practices with little concern about repercussions from golf's top players; its network broadcast partner, CBS; the tournament's sponsors; or the PGA Tour, which prevents courses with discriminatory membership policies from hosting its tournaments.
Augusta National conducts business on its own terms, long responding to questions about its policies by saying that it is a private club and that membership issues are a private matter. It remained consistent Monday, releasing a terse statement, which offered no further explanation, at a somewhat surprising time.
''This is a joyous occasion,'' said Billy Payne, the Augusta National chairman, in the club's statement. 
For the Hall of Fame golfer Nancy Lopez, it was a momentous occasion.
''It's a big steppingstone for women in golf and for women in general because of what Augusta stands for,'' Ms. Lopez said.
For Martha Burk, who began a campaign in 2002 urging Augusta National to admit women, it was an overdue occasion.
''It's about 10 years too late for the boys to come into the 20th century, never mind the 21st century,'' Burk said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''But it's a milestone for women in business.''
Augusta National's membership policies became a major talking point again this spring because I.B.M., one of three principal sponsors of the Masters, had elevated Virginia Rometty to chief executive. The four previous chief executives of the company had been given club membership.
The lack of an invitation for Ms. Rometty sparked a national discussion during the week of the tournament, with even President Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, voicing the opinion that the club should open its doors to women. The debate had been fermenting since 2002, when William Johnson, the club chairman at the time, responded to Burk by saying that Augusta National might one day have a female member, ''but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet.''
The timing of the announcement seems to be another example of the club's moving at its own pace. This year's Masters, won by Bubba Watson in a playoff, ended April 8, and the club's season does not open until October.
''People have been waiting for this,'' said the Hall of Fame golfer Amy Alcott, who has played at Augusta National as a guest. ''Nobody functions well with an ultimatum. I said it would happen when people least expect it.''
Even the issuing of a news release to announce the invitations to Ms. Rice and Ms. Moore was something of a surprise.
''I'm not sure they've changed their mind -- that they had one position a few months ago and a different one today,'' said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports. ''Augusta, historically, has operated on its own timetable and most likely felt that the appropriate time to announce it would not be on anybody's time schedule but their own. The fact that the media might be asking in April was one thing, but my guess is that the admission was separate from the tournament so that it would not appear that they were being pressured by the media to make an announcement.''
Women had been allowed to play at the club as guests of its 300-plus members. One does not apply to belong to Augusta National, whose members have included presidents (Dwight Eisenhower), leading businessmen and golf greats like Arnold Palmer. The club's secretive selection process calls to mind the College of Cardinals meeting in conclave to choose a pope. Prospective members are identified by a small committee, and the vetting process can take several years, with those under scrutiny probably unaware they are being sized up for membership.
''We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for membership at Augusta National,'' Mr. Payne, who took over as the chairman in 2006, said in a statement. ''Consideration with regard to any candidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and Darla was no different.''
Mr. Payne, who is also known as the head of the organizing committee for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was on vacation Monday and unavailable for further comment. In his address before this year's Masters, he acknowledged that the sport's stagnant growth was a major concern and that ''a very smart and motivated team of members'' had been appointed to determine what more the club could do to spur the sport's growth. But with the Rometty issue in the headlines, he faced questions from reporters about making his club more accessible to women as a potential spark for growth. He did not suggest a change in club policy was in the works.
An avid golfer, Ms. Rice, 57, was the national security adviser under former President George W. Bush and became secretary of state in his second term. In a statement released by the club, Ms. Rice, who has played at Augusta National several times and recently was appointed to the United States Golf Association's nominating committee, made a point of mentioning the club's commitment to growing the game.
''I have long admired the important role Augusta National has played in the traditions and history of golf,'' said Ms. Rice, who was the first black woman to be a provost at Stanford, where she is a professor of political economy in its Graduate School of Business. ''I also have an immense respect for the Masters tournament and its commitment to grow the game of golf, particularly with youth, here in the United States and throughout the world.''
Ms. Moore, 58, is vice president of Rainwater, a private investment company founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. She rose to success in banking, becoming the highest-paid woman in the industry and the first woman to be profiled on the cover of Fortune magazine. The University of South Carolina business school is named after her.
Mr. Johnson, the former Augusta National chairman, described Ms. Moore as a ''good friend'' in a statement released to The State of Columbia, S.C. He added that bringing Ms. Rice and Ms. Moore into the club was ''wonderful news'' and ''I could not be more pleased.''
Ms. Lopez's name had been mentioned along with Ms. Rice's whenever the issue of female membership came up. She said she still hoped to some day be offered membership at Augusta National.
''I was hoping four women would be admitted,'' Ms. Lopez said, ''so we could have a foursome.''

HEADLINE: Good Grade for the Mayor; Regret Over His 3rd Term

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New Yorkers are having second thoughts about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's third term.As for a fourth term? No thanks.
With less than 18 months to go in Mr. Bloomberg's unexpectedly long mayoral tenure, nearly three-quarters of New Yorkers said he should not have been allowed to run for a third term, according to the latest poll by The New York Times.
Mr. Bloomberg, having persuaded the City Council to approve a change in term limits that paved the way for his re-election in 2009, has presided over city government for more than a decade, and he still gets solid grades. Forty-eight percent of the poll's respondents approved of his job performance, and 39 percent disapproved, about the same as a year ago. 
But asked if they would support Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, in a hypothetical bid for a fourth four-year stint in City Hall, 65 percent of New Yorkers said they would not vote for the mayor again. One-quarter of voters would vote for him to stay on, and 8 percent said ''it depends.'' (The mayor, who is 70, has said he has no plans to run again.)
The eagerness for a new mayor comes even as New Yorkers are starting to feel more positive about the city's economy. And the proportion of residents who would prefer to keep living in the city, rather than move away, is the highest since Mr. Bloomberg took office, the poll found.
In a year's time, the proportion of New Yorkers who describe the local economy as good has risen sharply, to 45 percent from the 29 percent measured in a Times/CBS News survey in August 2011. New Yorkers said in follow-up interviews that they could see many improvements from a year ago and fewer signs of decline.
Baylen Thomas, 40, an actor, said sellers in his Brooklyn apartment building had received four offers, and at least one apartment had been sold, after five years of ''almost no sales.''
Pearline Childs, 77, a retired bookkeeper, said she saw crowded stores and eager shoppers around her low- and middle-income Manhattan neighborhood.
''People look like they're spending more and living better than they did last year,'' she said.
And Steven Tober, 69, a retired teacher who lives in Forest Hills, Queens, said he had been struck by the packed restaurants he was seeing in Manhattan.
''If people are eating out, they must have money,'' he said.
Still, unemployment remains at the top of residents' concerns, and many New Yorkers are still troubled by the economy. That was particularly true of black and Hispanic residents, about 60 percent of whom said in the poll that the economy was poor. Just over half of white respondents said the economy was good.
More than a third of New Yorkers polled said the quality of life had improved under Mr. Bloomberg, about the same proportion as three years ago. One in five residents said the quality of life had worsened, and 39 percent thought it had stayed the same.
Mr. Bloomberg's strongest support comes from men, older residents, whites, and residents of Manhattan and Queens. Women, middle-aged voters and residents of the other boroughs are more closely divided on his performance.
But there is consensus that Anthony D. Weiner, the former Democratic representative and mayoral hopeful who resigned after sending sexually explicit online communications to several women, should not return to public life. Asked about Mr. Weiner's seeking another political office, 54 percent said it was a bad idea, a third deemed it a good idea and 13 percent were not sure.

HEADLINE: House Member Is Rebuked After Nude Swim in Israel

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- They came to town promising something new and different, a fresh reprieve from the antics and proclivities of a ''Washington'' they disdained.But during a trip to Israel last summer, several House Republican freshmen engaged in a late-night swim in the Sea of Galilee, complete with one skinny-dipping congressman whose choice threatened to tarnish the reputation of the House newcomers as superserious number-crunchers who sleep on their office couches and go to bed before midnight.
On a trip billed as a foreign policy fact-finding mission last year, a large group of Republican members of Congress, and some of their staff and family members, decided to take a swim in the sea after a long day. 
Several members -- including Representative Steve Southerland II of Florida, who jumped into the water holding hands with his 21-year-old daughter -- said they were moved to dip for religious reasons. (The sea is believed by Christians to be the location where Jesus walked on water.)
While most of the members remained clothed, or largely so, Representative Kevin Yoder of Kansas decided to disrobe entirely, as reported first by Politico on Sunday. This sent most of the members fleeing for the shore, said a participant, and prompted a harsh rebuke the next day from Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, who was on the trip but did not swim in the sea.
More than 80 members of the House went on the trip, which was arranged by Mr. Cantor, as guests of the American Israel Education Foundation, a charity affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group. It was believed to be the largest number of members of Congress to make the trip during a single recess, according to the organizers at the time. Mr. Cantor's comments were made to the entire traveling group, said one person there, saying that members should not detract from the trip's mission.
While swimming in that sea is inoffensive to Israelis -- indeed, there is an annual race in that body of water -- Mr. Yoder's nudity, as well as possible over-imbibing by some members that evening at the restaurant near the beach where they swam, angered Mr. Cantor, who believed it distracted from their foreign policy mission.
''Twelve months ago,'' said Douglas Heye, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor, ''the congressman dealt with this immediately and effectively to ensure such activities would not take place in the future.''
House Speaker John A. Boehner, who has struggled for two years to keep some House freshmen in line, appeared to concur. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said, ''The majority leader handled the situation swiftly and appropriately.''
A law enforcement official said the skinny-dipping had come to light during an inquiry being conducted by the Washington field office of the F.B.I. into the possible misrepresentation of expenses, including meals and drinks in Israel, by some people on the trip.
On Monday, Democrats quickly leapt on the episode. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a statement saying it ''looks more like a scene out of 'Animal House' than a delegation of members of Congress representing America in Israel.''
A spokesman for Mr. Yoder -- who was criticized in his 2010 campaign for refusing a Breathalyzer test when pulled over while driving -- did not return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment. But he did release a statement to Politico on Sunday that read:
''A year ago, my wife, Brooke, and I joined colleagues for dinner at the Sea of Galilee in Israel. After dinner I followed some members of Congress in a spontaneous and very brief dive into the sea and regrettably I jumped into the water without a swimsuit.'' He apologized for any embarrassment he had caused to his district.
Some lawmakers who went swimming, like Representative Michael G. Grimm of New York, said they did so because the lake, known locally as Lake Kinneret, has religious significance.
Ditto for Representative Ben Quayle of Arizona. ''Congressman Quayle did swim in the Sea of Galilee for religious reasons,'' said Zach Howell, his spokesman. ''However, he did not swim as part of a large group, and did not witness nudity or other inappropriate actions, nor did he take part in such actions.''
Tim Kolpien, a spokesman for Representative Tom Reed of New York, said the congressman and his wife ''were there and swam together with a large group -- appropriately clothed; we don't have any comment. There was no impropriety, and he is unaware of any investigation.''
But that did not stop Nate Shinagawa, his Democratic opponent, from leaping on the news of the swim, saying it was ''disappointing to see our district in the national spotlight for a scandal at a time when the focus must be on job creation and economic growth.''

HEADLINE: In World of Finance, She Has Already Driven the Green

BYLINE: By MARY PILON;

 BODY:
After years of working her way to the highest levels of Wall Street, Darla Moore was still thinking about a dilapidated building known as the bean market in her hometown, Lake City, S.C.It was a favorite building of her father, Eugene T. Moore, an educator, athlete and coach. Darla Moore, 58, one of the wealthiest women in finance, poured time, money and energy into revitalizing the space, which opened last fall as a community gathering place and museum in the depressed town of former tobacco industry glory.
''She transforms things,'' said Jim Fields, the executive director of the Palmetto Institute, a nonprofit group Moore founded a decade ago that focuses on improving the economy and education system in her home state. ''It was a huge challenge. That's why she liked it so much.'' 
He added, ''She doesn't sleep much.''
Moore took on yet another transformative role Monday when it was announced that she and the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had become Augusta National Golf Club's first female members.
Augusta's membership policies were in the spotlight last spring after I.B.M., one of the principal sponsors of the Masters, promoted Virginia Rometty to be its chief executive. Previous chief executives were invited to become members of Augusta National, but Rometty was not.
Although Moore is less known than Rice is, she is no stranger to working her way past barriers and asserting herself in male-dominated worlds.
Moore and her husband, Richard Rainwater, declined interview requests through spokesmen Monday. Rainwater Inc., the firm they spearhead, referred questions to Augusta National.
''I am honored to have accepted an invitation to join Augusta National Golf Club,'' Moore said in a statement. ''Augusta National has always captured my imagination, and is one of the most magically beautiful places in the world, as everyone gets to see during the Masters each April.
''I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life. Above all, Augusta National and the Masters tournament have always stood for excellence, and that is what is so important to me. I am extremely grateful for this privilege.''
While Moore and her husband have maintained homes across the country, she lives much of the time on the farm in Lake City that has been in her family for generations, spending time on economic development in the area and tending to an extensive botanical garden, friends said.
Rainwater, whom Moore met in the early 1990s, introduced her to golf. (He was also a limited partner in the Texas Rangers with George W. Bush.) But the couple have faced greater challenges out of the office and off the green. Rainwater was told in 2009 that he had a rare brain disease. He and Moore have juggled their family lives and careers with his health care.
Moore had deep roots in sports through her father, who died in 2008. He played football and baseball at Clemson and played center on the 1948 team that defeated Missouri in the Gator Bowl. After graduating a year later, according to Clemson, Moore received offers to pursue baseball and football professionally.
Moore played in the Philadelphia Phillies' farm system before and after serving in the Army, then returned to Lake City and became a teacher and principal. In 2002, Darla Moore and Rainwater gave $10 million to Clemson's school of education, which was renamed for her father.
Moore attended the University of South Carolina and has given gifts totaling $70 million, according to a university spokeswoman. In March 1998, the university became among the few to name its business school for a woman.
Moore earned her M.B.A. in international business at George Washington in 1981. She then went to a training program at Chemical Bank (now part of JPMorgan Chase) in the early 1980s, on the cusp of Wall Street's leveraged buyout heyday.
''There wasn't a snowball's chance in hell that a female from the rural Deep South would be invited or embraced by that L.B.O. environment,'' Moore said in an interview with the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1999. ''Historically, no major players in the L.B.O. business were women.''
Moore transitioned into bankruptcy work, she has said, because there were more opportunities then in focusing on distressed assets. The change paid off when the economy seized.
''America blew up, largely as a result of greed, a total lack of perspective,'' she said in the Wharton interview, ''and the overleveraging of the corporate environment. I had watched all this going on and thought, Keep financing this, boys, because you are just creating business for me.''
Finance ''came very naturally to her,'' said Karen Fowler, a friend who works with Moore on philanthropic endeavors in Lake City. ''I assume a lot of that was because of her upbringing,'' she said, citing Moore's father.
''The extraordinary thing about her is that everything she does, there's no part of it where she's trying to get notoriety,'' Fowler said. ''She's a leader and has a vision and a passion, but it's never about her.''
In 1994, Moore joined Rainwater Inc., working alongside her husband. Throughout the decade, she had a career as one of Wall Street's most powerful and wealthy female executives, known for taking troubled companies and making them profitable.
Moore solidified her drive and gained national notice in the mid-1990s, when, through a controlling stock position in Rainwater, she had T. Boone Pickens removed from Mesa, his oil and gas company. The shake-up helped Moore earn a spot on the cover of Fortune magazine -- the first woman featured there.
''Congratulations to Darla and Condoleezza,'' Pickens said Monday. ''I hope they both accomplish what I did on 11, and that's get an eagle.''

HEADLINE: Collision Course

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN;

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- I may have missed it but I've not seen a war that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan don't want to fight. Romney vows never to negotiate with the Taliban and declares, ''We go anywhere they are and we kill them.'' He beats the war drums on Iran. He has a bizarre itch to open a new era of confrontation with Russia.When he sniffs the possibility of war Romney drops his frequent imitation of the Beatles' Nowhere Man (''Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to''). He becomes a Real Man fired up.
After more than a decade of inconclusive U.S. wars, this is not reassuring. 
In a similar vein, Ryan, whose experience outside Washington is limited, believes that in Afghanistan, ''Now is the time to lock in the success that is within reach.'' Said ''success'' is as hard to identify as the tax loopholes Ryan insists he wants to close.
The big question, of course, is how all this squares with the concerns over the U.S. debt that Romney has placed at the center of the campaign by picking Ryan. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost over $1.3 trillion. Several estimates, including one last year from Brown University, suggest the final bill will be $3.7 trillion or higher.
New or rebooted wars are scarcely the fiscal medicine the United States needs.
Ryan seemed to grasp this last year when he declared in a speech in Washington: ''If there's one thing I could say with complete confidence about American foreign policy, it is this: Our fiscal policy and our foreign policy are on a collision course; and if we fail to put our budget on a sustainable path, then we are choosing decline as a world power.''
The Wisconsin congressman was right about that.
He continued: ''In the coming years, our debt is projected to grow to more than three times the size of our entire economy. This trajectory is catastrophic. By the end of the decade, we will be spending 20 percent of our tax revenue simply paying interest on the debt.''
Yet Romney and Ryan are up for any costly fight. One reason, of course, is that they face a president who, with a bold decision, eliminated America's mortal enemy, Osama bin Laden, and whose cool review of ''kill lists'' selecting the next targets of drone attacks hardly suggests a lack of decider's testosterone. Upping the military ante against this incumbent is not easy. But, as Ryan's introduction before the U.S.S. Wisconsin suggests, it is something Romney feels he must do in pursuit of his new American Century.
Here we come to the heart of the matter: the desperate Republican quest to portray Obama as a quasi-European intent on the very European business of managed decline rather than renewed American glory.
No fiscal detail -- a trillion here, a trillion there -- can stand in the way of what Romney has called his ''one overwhelming conviction and passion'' -- that the 21st century be as American as the 20th. Battlefield triumph seems to be part of the Romney-Ryan recipe for this.
Romney has zeroed in on a phrase in a campaign white paper written last fall by the historian Eliot Cohen, who argued that the Obama administration views U.S. decline as a ''condition that can and should be managed for the global good rather than reversed.''
Aha! Romney declares: ''I do not view America as just one more point on the strategic map, one more power to be balanced. I believe our country is the greatest force for good the world has ever known.''
Ryan, likewise, has said that some -- read the Obama administration -- have decided ''that the choice we face is over how, not whether, to manage our nation's decline.'' But these ''calls to surrender'' must be rejected; the United States is ''a nation whose best days still lie ahead of us, if we make the necessary choices today.''
I believe in the enduring centrality of American power; I don't believe the nation's immense capacity for renewal is exhausted. But more war is not the ''necessary'' choice for the United States today if fiscal and foreign policy are to be taken off their ''collision course.'' The 2014 timetable for ending the combat mission in Afghanistan is right; war with Iran is avoidable; the lesson of Iraq and Afghanistan, wars without victories, must be learned. And even all the right choices for the United States will not alter the rise of India and China or make the 21st century America's as the 20th was.
Obama, as Joseph Lelyveld wrote in a recent New York Review of Books essay, has two major foreign policy achievements: ''Getting American forces out of Iraq and compressing his predecessor's expansive, grandiose-sounding 'Global War on Terror' into a narrowly focused, unremitting campaign against the remnants of the Qaeda network, relying largely on high-tech intelligence gathering and pilotless drones.''
These are sober achievements for sobering times. Economic turnaround is Job 1 for the next president. It will not be fostered by delusion, nostalgia or military overreach.

HEADLINE: Majority in City See Police Dept. As Favoring Whites, a Poll Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Allison Kopicki, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A significant majority of New Yorkers say the Police Department favors whites over blacks, according to a new poll by The New York Times.That view, as widespread now as it was in 2001 during the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is particularly prevalent among black New Yorkers, 80 percent of whom say the police favor one race over the other. A plurality of white residents -- 48 percent -- agree.
Concern about police favoritism comes at a time of intensified scrutiny of the department's extensive practice of stopping, questioning and, in many instances, frisking people on the city's streets. Last year, the police made nearly 700,000 stops; about 85 percent of the stops involved blacks or Hispanics.
The poll found that a majority of black residents said the stop-and-frisk tactic had led to the harassment of innocent people, but most white residents viewed the practice as an acceptable way to improve urban safety. 
Among all New Yorkers, 48 percent said the tactic was ''acceptable to make New York City safer,'' while almost as many -- 45 percent -- deemed the tactic ''excessive.'' Most of those surveyed rejected Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's chief rationale for the practice, saying they did not think that stopping and frisking suspicious people had lowered the crime rate or reduced the use of illegal guns.
''Stop-and-frisk would be a good idea if they did it right,'' Jose Aponte, 64, a retired doorman who lives in the Bronx, said in a follow-up interview after the poll. ''But it's not decreasing crime or guns. There are more shootings every day.''
But Mr. Bloomberg and the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, received high marks on the crime issue: 57 percent of New Yorkers said they approved of the way the mayor was dealing with crime, and 61 percent said they approved of the way the commissioner was handling his job. Even 50 percent of the respondents who said they had been the target of a racially motivated police stop approved of Mr. Kelly's management.
''I live in Brooklyn, in Coney Island, and everybody has guns; 3-year-old kids have guns! It's outrageous,'' said Johnny Rivera, 52, a former foreman at an aluminum company. As for the stop-and-frisk tactic, he said, ''the worst thing they could do is stop it.''
Mr. Bloomberg, who has overseen a significant rise in the number of stops during his nearly 11 years in office, scored slightly lower on his stewardship of race relations, with half of residents saying they approved and one-third saying they disapproved. Just 36 percent of black residents said they approved of the mayor's handling of race relations.
James Westcott, a Bronx resident who has been unemployed for two years, said he had been stopped by the police on three occasions. ''One right after the other, by three different patrol cars,'' Mr. Westcott, who is black, said. He also said the police had become less considerate, adding, ''It started getting bad when Giuliani was mayor, and now it's getting worse and worse.''
''You know it's excessive when you see people get stopped who really don't deserve to be stopped, like kids going to school,'' Mr. Westcott, 44, said. ''The police just jump out, stop them, search them, take their names down, then get back in their car and leave, and the kids don't know what went on.''
But some New Yorkers, while conceding that the police show favoritism for one race over another, said the stop-and-frisk tactic's ends justified the means.
''If that's what it takes, I find it acceptable,'' said Jani Kipness, 58, a special-education teacher from Brooklyn who is white. She said that she thought that officers ''single out minority groups,'' but that ''if you look at the crime in New York, it's less white people; that's just the way it is.''
''I wouldn't want to be stopped and frisked,'' she added. ''But if you look at cities like Detroit and other cities that have a way higher crime rate than New York, I think New York has to be doing something right.''
The stop-and-frisk practice has come under harsh criticism from civil liberties groups and some lower court judges. The issue has become a subject of debate among elected officials and has apparently captured the attention of the public: more than three-quarters of New Yorkers interviewed for the poll said they had heard a lot or some about it.
The criticism has prompted Mr. Kelly, who has argued strongly that the stop-and-frisk practice is an important crime-fighting tool, to pledge changes to ensure the lawfulness of the practice. The number of stops fell by more than 34 percent in April, May and June, compared with the previous quarter.
Crime is not New Yorkers' top concern. But more residents cited crime and violence as an important problem than in a Times poll two years ago. The proportion who would prefer to keep living in the city, rather than move away, is at the highest level in more than a decade.
Opinions about the stop-and-frisk practice are divided by race. Fifty-five percent of whites described the use of the tactic as acceptable; 56 percent of blacks called it excessive. Among Hispanics, 48 percent said it was acceptable, and 44 percent said it was excessive. Republicans, independents and Queens residents generally support the practice; Democrats and Manhattanites generally deem it excessive.
Over all, 64 percent of New Yorkers said the police favored one race over the other, a steep rise from the early years of the Bloomberg administration, when less than half of residents agreed with that sentiment. The last Times poll in which the perception of police favoritism was as widespread was taken in 2001, the final year of Mayor Giuliani's tenure, when race relations were noticeably more tense. (The question has not been asked in a Times poll since 2003.)
These views, in many cases, appear to have been influenced by personal experience. A third of the New Yorkers surveyed, including 37 percent of black people, said police officers had used insulting language toward them. A fifth of the respondents said they had been stopped by a police officer because of their race or ethnicity, and almost all were black or Hispanic, and more likely to be young and male.
''In the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, they will stop and frisk blacks and Hispanics more,'' said Kevon Geanus, 20, a construction worker who is black and lives in the Bronx. ''The way they talk to you, and curse at you, when you're just walking, for example, and say: 'Why are you walking? What are you doing out here at night?' ''
The poll of 1,026 adults, conducted Aug. 10 to 15 using landline phones and cellphones, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The margin is six points for black respondents and seven points for Hispanic respondents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ports Expand, With an Eye On Panama

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ;

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- The four cranes rise grandly over the port here, 14 stories high. Just off the boat from China and now being prepared for operations, the $40 million machines are part of this city's gamble that when supersize container ships start coming through the expanded Panama Canal in 2015, Baltimore will be one of the few ports on the East Coast ready for their business.''We think it's going to be a major win for us,'' said James J. White, the executive director of the Maryland Port Administration.
This sense that the new set of locks now being built to allow giant ships through the canal will bring riches 1,000 miles or more to the north is shared by industry and government officials along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, who have been promoting multimillion- -- and in some cases multibillion- -- dollar port projects for years. The Obama administration has now moved to speed up the review process for developing and deepening the harbors for several of these ports, including those of New York and New Jersey; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Miami. The initiative ''will help drive job growth and strengthen the economy,'' President Obama said in announcing it last month. 
But some who are following the efforts have begun to express skepticism about the hope and money going into dredging mud and raising steel. With so many ports competing for a share of the bounty, experts are questioning how big that bounty will be. ''Everybody is trying to go after it -- there are going to be few beneficiaries, in my judgment,'' said William D. Ankner, a former official of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a former secretary of transportation for Louisiana.
The big ships -- known as ''Post-Panamax'' and even ''Super-Post-Panamax'' -- are already in heavy use worldwide, making up 16 percent of the container fleet but accounting for 45 percent of its capacity, according to a July report by the Army Corps of Engineers. And ''those numbers are projected to grow significantly over the next 20 years,'' said Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh, deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations for the corps, in announcing the report.
In the race that began when plans for the expansion were first announced in 2006, some winners have already emerged. The Port of Virginia, in Norfolk, is ready to receive the big ships today. And New York is also prepared, thanks to a massive dredging project that began 13 years ago.
But nearly every port in the game still faces major challenges and expenses -- including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which plans to spend $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge roadway by 64 feet to allow the giant ships through on their way to to Newark and Elizabeth, N.J.
Baltimore, which already has a 50-foot channel, has a bottleneck on the land side: the Howard Street tunnel, through which trains have to pass to reach the port, and which is too small to accommodate the double-stacked container cars that are increasingly the standard for rail shipping. The rail line CSX has announced a workaround that could cost hundreds of millions, involving a new yard beyond the tunnel filled with containers brought by truck; the port will load the trains with a single container to get through the tunnel, and the trains can be completed at the yard.
Miami is putting $2 billion into improvements to its port; its dredging project was approved by the Army Corps of Engineers in April, and the city is building a tunnel costing an estimated $1 billion to create a crucial link between the port and the Interstate System of highways.
Savannah is preparing to move forward with a $652 million deepening project, while the South Carolina Legislature has committed $300 million to dredging for Charleston. A plan for the two cities to team up on a common port has all but stalled.
The big ships will also come via places beyond Panama: many are expected to come from Southeast Asia through the Suez Canal, and from South America's eastern ports.
But more fundamental questions have been raised about the real benefits of the coming trade, and especially the effects of the new canal traffic.
Moving goods by water is generally cheaper than moving them by land because of the economies of scale of moving so many containers on those big ships, said John Martin, a ports consultant in Lancaster, Pa. So that would suggest canal routes will offer lower-cost shipping to the East Coast and Midwest through the canal.
But, he said, containers loaded on the West Coast, which has built up its container yards and highway and rail infrastructure, can outrun those that travel to the East Coast by water, and that can make the difference when speed and dependability are more important than cost alone. Besides, he added, costs and fees can shift; Panama can be expected to raise rates for canal passage, and ''the railroads are not going to sit idly by'' and let the water route undercut their business.
Scudder Smith, a consultant with the engineering consulting firm Parsons Brinkerhoff, said that a water passage, ''all things being equal, will cause cost reductions -- but all things are not equal,'' he added, and so ''I'm not at all confident in any numbers.''
That could be why J. Christopher Lytle, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, does not sound a bit worried. ''There's just not going to be a huge movement of cargo from the West Coast to the East Coast,'' he said.
His port, and its counterpart in Los Angeles, are already dealing with some of the biggest vessels on the water, capable of carrying the equivalent of 13,000 container units -- vessels too big to pass through the new Panama Canal locks.
After talking up port projects in ways that sound a bit like the overblown economic predictions about new stadiums and convention centers in recent years, some officials are now scaling back their claims. After Hurricane Katrina, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi trumpeted plans for a ''port of the future'' at Gulfport with a 50-foot-deep channel, redirecting some $600 million in federal housing disaster funds on a project he pledged would spur the economy and create bountiful jobs. A state official at the time called it ''the single largest economic-development project in the state's history,'' and officials predicted that it would surpass the Port of Los Angeles.
Today, Mississippi and the port are being more modest. The port recently noted that it is not pursuing the announced plans to dredge the channel to 50 feet, and because of lapsed maintenance, the channel does not even reach the depth of 36 feet authorized by law. The port is now focused on improving what it has instead of expanding greatly, and plans focus more on the cascade effect as smaller ships are crowded out of the major ports by the new superships.
Local critics of the original plan like Reilly Morse, policy director of Mississippi Center for Justice, said the state had been swept up in a national fad ''that promised far more economic benefits than it could deliver and risked far greater burdens on the host community than it could support.''
Other ports try not to overstate their goals. Mark Montgomery, the chief executive of Ports America Chesapeake, the private partner with the state of Maryland in Baltimore's project, said that his port and supporters understand that they are not likely to defeat the megaports of the West Coast, or even New York and Norfolk. Instead, he said, his port will serve Baltimore, Washington and Northern Virginia -- though he also sees it as a potential gateway to the Midwest. ''Our expectations are right-sized,'' he said.
To Robert Puentes, a transportation expert at the Brookings Institution, the problem of whether the ports are overbuilding for a Panama payoff is one of planning. ''We are the only industrialized country on the planet that doesn't have a comprehensive freight policy,'' he said. As for port development, he said, ''I can't see the federal government picking winners and losers'' in such a politically charged environment, but ''they could provide a little more guidance -- where right now they are providing none.''

HEADLINE: Investors In Health Care Seem to Bet On Incumbent

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN;

 BODY:
Who is going to win the presidential election?You might want to ask Mark T. Bertolini. He just bet $5.7 billion on President Obama.
Mr. Bertolini is the chief executive of Aetna, which on Monday agreed to acquire Coventry Health Care, a huge provider of Medicare and Medicaid programs. His $5.7 billion bet makes a lot of sense if you believe that the Affordable Care Act - otherwise known as Obamacare - will not be repealed.
Mitt Romney has pledged to repeal the act "on my first day if elected," so any gamble that Obamacare stays intact could be fairly described as a wager that President Obama will remain in office. 
At a time when so many in the business community appear to be supporting Mr. Romney, it is telling that some businessmen and investors expect a different result - and are wagering more than rhetoric; they are staking their wallet on it.
It may be counterintuitive, but with the Standard & Poor's 500 up 9.5 percent in the last three months and the stock market over all at its highest point since the financial crisis, there is an argument to be made that investors writ large may be helping the incumbent to win. Intrade, an online market that allows investors to bet on political outcomes and other world events, shows that President Obama is favored to win, 57.3 percent to 42 percent.
"The best single predictor of presidential re-election results that we found was the percentage change in the stock market during the three years that preceded Election Day," Deepak Goel of the Socionomics Institute said in February when he released a study that was recently highlighted by Reuters. The study said that recent performance of the stock market was more important than gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment.
At a minimum, the stock market, which is an indicator of future earnings, seems to be in disagreement, at least somewhat, with the steady drumbeat of C.E.O.'s and investors who have said that President Obama's administration, in the words of Daniel Loeb, the outspoken activist hedge fund investor, "is openly hostile to most businesses and unable to articulate or implement policies to spark growth and reduce unemployment."
Mr. Loeb is a frustrated Obama voter who now backs Mr. Romney.
But take a look at some of his most recent investments in the health care field. In the last quarter, he reported in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, he picked up shares of Aetna, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth and WellPoint, among others. All of those companies stand to benefit while Obamacare remains in force; a repeal of the bill could send those shares reeling.
Mr. Bertolini of Aetna insisted on Monday that the deal was not dependent on who wins the White House. But he has to say that. If he believed Mr. Romney was going to win and he still wanted to buy Coventry, he would have waited until after the election and bought it at a sharp discount.
In a note to investors on Monday about Aetna's Coventry deal, an analyst at Barclays explained the rationale of it plainly as a way of "strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on further gains which may arise as a result of the election and health care reform."
Aetna is not the only company to make a bet on the White House. WellPoint agreed to acquire Amerigroup for $5 billion in July, just a little over a week after the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. Before that, Cigna paid $3.8 billion for HealthSpring in another bet on the expansion of Medicaid and Medicare.
Companies like Aetna, WellPoint and Cigna have all gravitated to rivals with a foothold in government-sponsored programs because the prevailing view is that margins for private customers are going to steadily erode. According to Aetna on Monday, the acquisition of Coventry will "substantially increase Aetna's Medicaid footprint, creating more opportunity to participate in the expansion of Medicaid and to pursue high acuity positions as they move into managed care." Aetna's revenue from the government will jump to 30 percent from 23 percent.
In fairness, it is possible to argue that the election will be immaterial to the future of the Affordable Care Act. Even if Mr. Romney wins the presidency, depending on which parties are in the House and Senate, the act may be impossible to roll back.
"Some will argue that with the election just over two months away, the company could have been more prudent in its timing," the Barclays analyst wrote. "Our take is that the election, reform and other potential legislative issues will have little impact on this transaction."
David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital recently made the contrarian case that companies like Cigna would actually do better if the law were to be repealed, ostensibly because of the margin compression that is likely as a result of the new law.
"While the stocks are already cheap, there is the additional unpriced upside in the possibility that the election changes the political landscape, resulting in a possible modification or repeal of Obamacare," he wrote in a letter to investors last month.
Still Mr. Einhorn, through smarts or luck, made a big investment in Coventry in the last quarter. With the sale to Aetna, irrespective of his investment thesis, Mr. Einhorn's firm just made about $72 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Look Inside China's 'Club Fed'

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Gu Kailai's death sentence for the murder of a British businessman has been suspended, but she's headed for a long stretch in prison, most probably at Qincheng, the notorious facility for political prisoners and larcenous officials that some are calling China's "Club Fed." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - A Chinese court has suspended Gu Kailai's death sentence for the cyanide murder of a British businessman. But Ms. Gu, the wife of the disgraced Communist Party boss Bo Xilai, is headed for a long stretch in the can, the clink, the hoosegow, the pen, the joint, the slammer, the Big House. 
Ms. Gu, 53, is probably bound for Qincheng Prison, the notorious facility that seems to have housed almost every corrupt party crook and major political dissident in the history of modern China. 
Qincheng, for all its notoriety as a maximum security prison, is hardly Robben Island or the Supermax facility in Colorado. Some are even calling it China's "Club Fed," a reference to the relative comforts at some U.S. federal prisons for white-collar criminals. 
A New York Times story in 1992 described Qincheng as "one of China's most comfortable penitentiaries." 
The Shenzhen Economic Daily published a story in May about Qincheng, located on the outskirts of Beijing. (The Web site eChinacities.com did a translation into English.)
The prison was built in 1958 as a secret project - Project No. 156 - with assistance from the Soviet Union, the paper said. It is reportedly the only prison operated by the Ministry of Public Security; all other prisons are overseen by the Ministry of Justice.
Until the 1960s, the paper said, "most prisoners were old Manchu officials, Japanese prisoners of war, and KMT nationalist war criminals of Major General rank and above." During the Cultural Revolution, leading "counterrevolutionaries" filled the cells. 
Li Lisan, a prominent Communist revolutionary and Politburo member, was arrested by Red Guards in 1967, and he and his Russian wife were sent to Qincheng. Her seclusion was so total that "I almost forgot how to speak Russian," she said in a Times story in 2000. 
From the late 1970s through the '80s, "most prisoners were those associated with Lin Biao and the 'Gang of Four,' " the paper said. When Jiang Qing, Mao's wife, was arrested soon after his death in 1976, she was sent to Qincheng. Her early years at the prison certainly didn't break her: At her trial in 1980, unrepentant, she told the court: "I was Chairman Mao's dog. Whomever he told me to bite, I bit." The government said while still imprisoned in 1991.
More recently, corrupt senior officials, high-profile student leaders and antigovernment writers have been sent to Qincheng. Ordinary criminals are sent elsewhere.
"That is to say, not just anyone can serve their sentence at Qincheng Prison - it is therefore perhaps the final 'privilege' given to corrupt officials."
China's most famous political prisoner, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, spent 18 months in Qincheng, starting in 1989. A subsequent conviction reportedly has landed him "in a cell with five common criminals at Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning Province" about 300 miles from his home (and his wife) in Beijing. 
Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the Tiananmen Square student protests, recalled his detention in Qincheng "along with several hundred other students and intellectuals." 
"On a particularly cold winter morning," he wrote in The Times in 2010, "I sat on my bed and picked up my copy of The People's Daily, the government newspaper we were allowed to read, and saw that Nelson Mandela had been released from prison." 
The original Qincheng Prison had cells in three-story brick units, simply referred to as Buildings 1 through 4 - Jia ([#x7532]), Yi ([#x4e59]), Bing ([#x4e19]) and Ding ([#x4e01]). In 1967, six more blocks were added, numbered 5 through 10.
"The guards are carefully selected," said Wei Jingsheng, the former dissident and political prisoner, in a scathing critique of what he called "the 20th century Bastille." "One criterion is age; prisoners report never seeing guards over 20. They are replaced at regular intervals." 
According to the Shenzhen paper, "The walls of cells for major criminals are specially padded with rubber to ensure that the prisoners cannot commit suicide by running into the walls. The only furniture in each cell is a small bed set about a foot off the ground, and when a prisoner wants to write a 'confession,' a school desk will be provided."
The doors are iron-plated "with a peephole at toilet level and at eye level," and guards "monitor the rooms constantly."
At one point, during the 1960s, the quality of prisoners' meals was based on their rank. "The person responsible for cooking for the 204 high-level prison cells was a Class B chef that had been transferred to Qincheng Prison from the Beijing Hotel," the paper said. "The dishes he served included shark's fin and sea cucumbers."
Mr. Wei said the Qincheng guards were "ingenious" in using food to manipulate prisoners: "Food is withheld as a means of punishment. One of the lightest and most common punishments is first to starve the prisoner and then give him or her a bowl of very greasy noodles as 'compensation.' " 
"According to descriptions given by those who have visited in more recent years," the paper said, high officials still receive special living conditions at Qincheng Prison." Their prison cells are larger, and some have desks, bathrooms, sit-down toilets and washing machines. They are allowed time to read books and People's Daily, and they get two hours of TV at night.
High-level inmates also may receive visits, clothing and private medical care from family members. "Although prisoners are given uniforms," the paper said, "they are generally not required to wear them."
An excerpt, slightly condensed, from Mr. Wei's essay:
The inmates' lives are governed by all sorts of irrational regulations. They have to sleep facing the door. To turn one's back to the doorway is not permitted, and if one happens to do so while sleeping, he is awakened, over and over if necessary, until the prisoner learns to face the glass pane. There was a Tibetan who, after sleeping on one side of his face for more than 10 years, developed a swollen ear that became infected and numb. 
Sanitary conditions are poor. Soap is not provided, and bathing is permitted only once a month, regardless of the season. A few privileged prisoners are given semi-annual physical examinations. 
Qincheng is enough to strangle one's will. The place could almost be called a dungeon, or a psychiatric institute. In Qincheng, even those who were once imprisoned by the enemies of the Communists are victims of modern techniques to destroy body and mind. 
The Shenzhen newspaper said a new facility, Yancheng Prison, is being phased in as the default prison for senior officials convicted of nonviolent "duty crimes" or malfeasance and corruption. 
"Once Yancheng Prison is fully operational," the paper said, "it is likely that Qincheng Prison will 'retire' and be changed into a common lockup for prisoners awaiting trial."

HEADLINE: The Woodward Dream Cruise Rediscovers Its Strut

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The event, which was threatened with extinction in 2009, put on a show of strength last weekend in Detroit. 

 BODY:
ROYAL OAK, Mich. -- As the 18th annual Woodward Dream Cruise got under way on Saturday morning, I drove south on Woodward Avenue accompanied by my wife, Marlene, and son, Erik, in our 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air. Our immediate goal was a breakfast of sliders at the venerable Hunter House in Birmingham, a nutritionally suspect Dream Cruise tradition for the Stenquist clan.
The blue sky and mercifully dry air delighted the smiling and waving spectators in their lawn chairs at the side of the road. I switched on the radio just as an announcer on WOMC-FM, the longtime broadcast partner of the Dream Cruise, gushed that the cruise was not only the world's biggest single-day automotive event but the world's biggest party.
Though the first claim is regularly echoed beyond metro Detroit, the second is obviously hyperbolic. But given the celebratory atmosphere building all week here, the announcer's enthusiasm was understandable. According to the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, roughly 1.35 million people drove, danced, cheered, barbecued and watched an odd mix of classics, customs, hot rods, buses, wheeled bar stools and various other contraptions parade along the 16-mile route.
Like the automotive industry it celebrates, the Dream Cruise has come a long way since 2009, when the mood was such that many wondered whether that year's event would be the last. Underpinning that fear was the not altogether remote idea that a city synonymous with the rise of America's auto industry might also bear witness to its death. In 2009, I wrote that Woodward Avenue was "a place where car folk can go to dream about the way things were and hope for better days."
On Saturday, with Detroit's major automakers in relative health and the local economy having achieved at least a modest recovery, Woodward was a place where car folk gathered to celebrate the way things are.
Among the smiling cruisers encountered during a one-mile walk down Woodward was Phil Caruso of Utica, N.Y., who toured Woodward in a 1951 Lincoln Lido two-door coupe. Mr. Caruso said a Michigan friend persuaded him to come out for the cruise in 2005, and he has returned every subsequent year.
"Every year we get more and more people to come out from New York," he said. "We love it."
Though Mr. Caruso and his friends traveled a long way for the cruise, they didn't come close to qualifying for the long-distance award. That recognition would probably go to Sven-Erik Mattsson and Kenneth Rooslund. According to an article in Sunday's Detroit Free Press, the Swedish duo shipped Mr. Mattsson's 1968 Chevrolet Corvette across the Atlantic for the event.
Dave Krueger and his wife, Sharon, of Flushing, Mich., drove to the cruise in their 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk. Mr. Krueger's first car was a 1956 version of the same car, but he parted with it many years ago when he and his wife were planning a family. They bought the Golden Hawk in 1991. Mr. Krueger said the car was originally ordered for the wife of a Studebaker dealer in California and subsequently used in a film produced by MGM. One of fewer than 5,000, the swoopy Studebaker was equipped with a 275-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine.
"We drive it all over," Mr. Krueger said. "We recently followed the Lewis and Clark trail to Spokane, Wash., along with 19 other Studebakers."
Farther down the street, another uncommon car caught my eye: the 1955 Hudson Rambler Cross Country station wagon of Jim and Dave Rouleau. Among Hudson's last efforts, the diminutive wagon featured reclining seats, the stuff of drive-in-theater legend. The Rouleaus' car is equipped with an optional camping tent and factory air-conditioning. It's one of fewer than 7,500 produced.
I am a sucker for Chevrolet Impala Super Sport models from the mid-'60s. As a teenager, I lusted for one, so Mike Baublitz's stunning black 1965 Super Sport set off a double-take. That second glance revealed a 409 badge on the fender. Most students of the Chevrolet brand know that the more modern but less celebrated 396-cubic-inch V-8 engine replaced the 409 in 1965, three years after the Beach Boys immortalized it. So a 409 in a '65 model had me scratching my head.
Mr. Baublitz explained that Chevrolet built 742 Super Sports from the 1965 model year with the 400-horsepower, 409-cubic-inch V-8 before replacing it with the 396 midyear. Like other full-featured Super Sports, Mr. Baublitz's nicely restored machine was equipped with the console-mounted tachometer and wood steering wheel. Giddy-up 409, indeed.
I saw many dream machines on the avenue, including what appeared to be a Stutz Bearcat that I couldn't quite catch; a Cadillac of '30s vintage; Packards representing every decade of that company's existence; and a plethora of Corvettes, including at least one from each of that car's 60 years.
At 9 p.m., as planned, the police closed Woodward and directed traffic onto connecting roads that could handle the volume. Soon, the cars were gone but the smiles remained. For the first time in several years, it was easy to believe that Detroit would be making cars, even models that may be considered dream machines, and partying on Woodward for many years.

HEADLINE: Globalization and the Income Slowdown

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: In my exchanges with economists so far, globalization is among the most commonly cited factors for the income slowdown. American workers today face vastly more competition from foreign workers -- especially foreign workers who earn much less money than the typical American -- compared with past decades. 

 BODY:
Derek Thompson of The Atlantic offers a thoughtful response to our list of 14 potential causes of the great American income slowdown:
When I write about income stagnation apart from the Great Recession, I typically rely on a trio of explanations: Globalization, technology, and health care.
Competition drives down costs. Shoppers understand this, intuitively. One reason that flat-screen TV prices have fallen so much in the last ten years is that so many electronics companies have gotten efficient at making them. Similarly, competition for jobs in tradable goods and services -- manufacturing that could be done in China; retail that's simpler on Amazon -- competes down the price employers pay workers in those industries. It makes many workers and nothing borderline-replaceable is expensive. Those forces drove down wages, and employer-side health care costs gnawed at the rest of it.
In my exchanges with economists so far, globalization is certainly among the most commonly cited factors for the income slowdown. American workers today face vastly more competition from foreign workers -- especially foreign workers who earn much less money than the typical American -- compared with past decades. 
Benjamin Friedman - a Harvard professor and the author of the ambitious economic history "The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth" - told me that he would put global competition and technological change at the top of his list of causes, with the education slowdown (which, he noted, interacted with technological change) and cultural norms not far behind. Mr. Friedman pointed to Lucian Bebchuk's research on soaring executive pay as an example of how much norms had changed.
In his next bucket of importance, Mr. Friedman listed health costs, an innovation plateau, the minimum wage, family structure and immigration. Immigration, he said, largely affects workers at the bottom end of the income spectrum.
Stephen S. Roach, the longtime Morgan Stanley economist and China expert who now teaches at Yale, offered a list with some strong similarities to Mr. Friedman's. Mr. Roach put global competition, the educational slowdown and the innovation plateau at the top of his list, followed by automation, deregulation, rising health costs, immigration and the falling minimum wage.
He also said that the supply chain explosion -- "rapid growth of integrated global production platforms that squeeze labor income at all stages of the production process" -- deserved a place on the list. I'd probably argue that the supply chain was a subset of either globalization or automation, but I see why someone else might list it as a separate factor.
Mr. Thompson, in his post, included a chart -- of employment by sector -- that underscored the importance of globalization:
Employment by Industry Since 1939
As he notes, only one line defies the business cycle and just keeps going up: education and health care. He writes:
What do those sectors have in common? They're all local. You can't send them to Korea. As Michael Spence has explained, corporations have gotten so good at "creating and managing global supply chains" that large companies no longer grow much in the United States. They expand abroad. As a result, the vast majority (more than 97%, Spence says!) of job creation now happens in so-called nontradable sectors -- those that exist outside of the global supply chain -- that are often low-profit-margin businesses, like a hospital, or else not even businesses at all, like a school or mayor's office.
This chart measures jobs, not incomes. I think it's possible that parts of other sectors have delivered big average pay gains (most likely, the high-skill jobs) even if overall employment in those sectors hasn't grown as fast as in education and health care. I also wonder how much technological innovation explains these lines: education and health care are notoriously inefficient sectors. But no matter how you look at the picture, globalization seems to be one of the biggest changes that has accompanied the great American income slowdown.

HEADLINE: For Growth, Better Coordination Is Needed on Bank Regulation

BYLINE: MOHAMED EL-ERIAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author writes that regulatory agencies can avoid further deterioration of the financial system by working together for the benefit of the public and the economy. 

 BODY:
It is happening once more. For the third time in less than a decade, inadequate coordination - among government entities, as well as across national borders - means that the United States may again strike the wrong balance between financial soundness and economic growth.
The first costly episode is well known by now. In the run up to the 2008 global financial crisis, lax regulation and sleepy supervision fueled a leverage-driven bank quest for greater profits, including through the large-scale shifting of activities to unregulated and undercapitalized areas. 
Profits rose, compensation packages soared, and analysts took for granted abnormally high returns on bank capital. In the process, the banking system fell into the trap of believing that the exchange of an ever-expanding universe of structured products constituted a sustainable business model. It forgot that it is part of a financial service industry whose raison d'être is to finance productive activities in the real economy.
The resulting explosion of "shadow banking" and proliferation of "too big to fail" institutions helped push the world to the edge of an economic depression. And while enormous human suffering was averted by unprecedented policy actions, which substituted the public balance sheet for a rapidly deleveraging banking system (thus socializing huge losses after the enormous privatization of gains), society suffered nevertheless - including through the rise in unemployment and mortgage delinquencies.
Taxpayers - especially in finance-dependent countries like Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Spain, and the United States - were encumbered with enormous bills. Weak growth and a dismissal job situation made things worse, tipping some European countries into a vicious spiral of economic, financial, political and social dislocations.
The second episode is less well known yet also consequential. Widespread bank bankruptcies were averted by more than just the aggressive use of public finances. Banks also benefited from "unconventional monetary policy" that artificially lowered the cost of and increased access to stable financing.
The beneficial impact on bank profitability was accompanied by insufficient safeguards - from lax conditionality to astonishingly little appetite to tax banks' windfall profits. Not surprisingly, banks quickly reverted to some unfortunate old habits - the most visible being the re-emergence of large compensation packages. And as bankers regained their swagger, hubris resurfaced, together with tone deafness and too little appreciation for the scale and scope of exceptional public support.
The result was another blow to what remained of bank credibility. Popular anger was exacerbated by the perception that, rather than lend to credit-rationed firms, banks were happy to simply deposit their excess reserves with the Federal Reserve, especially now that the Fed was paying interest.
We are now in a third episode characterized by regulatory catch-up. This is a good thing overall; but it is insufficiently coordinated and is yet to be accompanied by sufficient measures to offset the reluctance of banks to lend to the real economy.
With banks involved in the scandal involving the London interbank offered rate, allegations of money laundering, lax risk management and inadequate disclosures, regulators are getting better at countering shortfalls in banking activities - some that have threatened the integrity of the market system, others that have distorted price discovery, misallocated capital and undermined national security.
But these efforts appear poorly coordinated among regulatory agencies, as well as across national borders. Moreover, greater oversight and enforcement are not the only factors deleveraging banks. Markets are also imposing greater discipline, if only because they realize that the public sector now has limited willingness and ability to again bail out the banking sector.
In this context, banks' natural reaction will be to retrench further, de-globalize more and curtail credit to an even greater extent. As a result, new investments in plant and equipment will be insufficiently financed, as will hiring.
This does not mean regulators should allow bank lapses. But it does point to the need for much better coordination, including in establishing robust credit pipelines. Some involve just the private sector. Others encompass public-private partnership and, in some areas (particularly pockets of basic infrastructure financing), the public sector needs to take the lead.
It is not too late to avert a third mistake through a major interagency effort, pushed by both the administration and Congress, and better international coordination. Lacking that, America would again strike the wrong balance between bank soundness and economic growth. And society would suffer once more.

HEADLINE: New Ads Attack the Koch Brothers

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Patriot Majority USA, an outside political group allied with Democrats, is spending $500,000 on ads that attack the billionaire Koch brothers and donations to conservative causes. 

 BODY:
As patrons of conservative groups, the billionaire Koch brothers have bankrolled plenty of negative ads, but now they are a direct target of one.
With a $500,000 ad purchase on Tuesday, an outside political group allied with Democrats said it was beginning an effort to tie the industrial executives to their agenda. 
"Billionaire oil tycoons Charles and David Koch and their special interest friends are spending $400 million to buy this year's elections and advance their agenda," a narrator says in the 30-second version of the ad, by Patriot Majority USA, running on CNN and MSNBC. That "greed agenda," the ad contends, includes cutting taxes for the rich, eliminating the minimum wage, cutting education financing and subsidizing oil companies.
The Kochs are "hiding in plain sight," said Craig Varoga, the president of Patriot Majority USA. The group commissioned polls that found that most Americans were not aware of them, Mr. Varoga said.
"Our goal is to increase their name ID and tie it to their actual causes," he said. 
However, Mr. Varoga refused to identify the backers of his group's effort. As a tax-exempt "social welfare" organization, Patriot Majority USA is not required to disclose its donors.
A top Koch official dismissed the effort by "the president's allies" to "attack and demonize private citizens and job creators who disagree with them on the direction this country is going." 
In a statement, Philip Ellender, president of Koch Companies Public Sector, also called the ads "dishonest" and an "attempt to shut down free speech," adding, "Koch has a long history of standing firm for the principles of economic freedom, and we will continue to do so, in spite of the ongoing attacks." 
Mr. Varoga said his group's goal "is not to demonize them whatsoever; our goal is to talk about their agenda."
Though the "Stop the Greed Agenda" effort coincides with high election season, it will extend beyond November, Mr. Varoga said, adding that Patriot Majority USA plans to spend millions of dollars on the push through "the end of next year and beyond." New spots are coming in September, he said, and direct mail and ways for people to participate online are also in the works.
"The Koch brothers have been doing this for more than two decades," Mr. Varoga said. "Their agenda is not going to get undone or stopped in two weeks."

HEADLINE: Celebrate the Farmer!

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: To give more people access to our bounty of fresh food, we need to support real farmers, not businessmen riding half-million-dollar combines. 

 BODY:
I was at a farm dinner in Maine the other night, a long table of 60 people eating corn, chicken, salad, a spectacular herb sorbet and other goodies. When one of the hosts arose to ask someone to describe the first course on the table - huge marrow bones from the farm's cattle- she introduced not the chef but the farmers. Similarly, at a fund-raiser on Cape Cod a week or so earlier, the talk was all about the provenance of the produce and meat rather than the cooking technique. The most popular guy was the oyster grower.
This is a fine trend. With all due respect to my chef friends (many of whom will agree with this statement), most cooking is dead-easy and pretty quick: it takes 20 minutes to roast a marrow bone, and an ambitious fifth-grader can get it right on the first try. A more complicated dish, like the seared corn with chorizo that was served a bit later, might consume an hour and require a bit of skill.
But raising and butchering the cows and pigs that produced the marrow bones and meat for the chorizo? Growing the corn? These are tasks that take weeks, if not months, of daily activity and maintenance. Like anything else, you can get good at it, but the challenges that nature (ask the corn farmers of Kansas) and the market (ask Tyson Foods, whose profits just fell 61 percent) throw at you are never even close to being under control in the same way that a cook controls the kitchen.

What a cook doesn't control is ingredients, and that's where the debt to farmers comes in. In the last 10 or 15 years, we've seen the best New York chefs scouring the Greenmarket weekly and setting up exclusive relationships with farmers throughout the Northeast; that kind of behavior is nationwide. And even before that, Alice Waters hired people full-time to make sure the ingredients her people cooked with were the best.
Since late summer brings more real food to more people than other times, right now the rest of us can eat as well as if we had our own chef. Whether it's a salad of raw tomatoes, peaches and basil, a dish of roasted eggplant with nothing more than soy sauce, a real chicken smeared with a paste of fresh herbs, it's all right out there. In much of the country, even some conventional supermarkets purchase from nearby farms. On my recent trip through New England, I saw a bin of corn being filled from burlap sacks by a guy (a farmer, I presume) who'd driven up in a pickup; there was a similar scene involving cucumbers. Big deal, but it shows it can be done.
The cry will ring out: Not everyone can afford fresh fruits and vegetables, especially from farm stands! And, sadly, it's true. But this is precisely why we need to support a herd of actions that will make it possible for more people to have access to real food:

        
We need to reduce unemployment and increase the minimum wage (including that for farm and restaurant workers). This (obviously) goes beyond the realm of food, but it's key to improving the quality of life for many if not most Americans. (Here's a strong argument for that.)
        
We need to not but the amount of support we give to recipients of food stamps. A good example is New York City's Health Bucks program, where food stamps are worth more at farmers' markets (which don't, as a rule, sell sugar-sweetened beverages!).
        
We need not only to attack the nonsensical and wasteful system that pays for corn and soybeans to be grown to create junk food and ethanol, but to support local and national legislation that encourages the birth of new small-and-medium farms. We need to encourage both new and established farms to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables, to raise animals in sensible ways and, using a combination of modern and time-tested techniques, treat those animals well and use their products sensibly.
In short, we need more real farmers, not businessmen riding on half-million-dollar combines. And if you haven't seen a real farmer, go visit a one- or two-acre intensive garden; it's a mind-blowing thing, how much can be grown in a relatively small space. Then imagine thousands of 10-, 20- and 100-acre farms planted similarly: the vegetables sold regionally, the pigs fed from scraps, the compost fertilizing the soil, the cattle at pasture, the milk making cheese .
The naysayers will yell, "this mode of farming will not produce enough corn and soy to feed our junk food and cheeseburger habit," and that's exactly the point. It would produce enough food so that we can all eat well. It'd produce enough food so we can slow the hysteria about our inability to feed the expected 9 billion earthlings. After all, we're not doing such a great job of feeding the current 7 billion. Why? Largely because too many resources go into producing junk food and animal products.
The Northeast, where everything but dairy farming was left for dead a decade ago, and where many dairy farmers hold on for dear life, was once its own breadbasket; sometimes it feels as if it can become that again. Local food grown by local farmers is a wonderful thing; more food grown by farmers who sell regionally brings a level of practicality to the system. Boats and trains from all over the Northeast once supplied New York City (obviously incapable of producing much in the way of truly "local" food, unless you envision re-converting Westchester, Nassau, Bergen and Fairfield counties to farmland) with food that was picked during the day, shipped at night, and sold the next day. By comparison, the parsley sitting in your supermarket right now is at least a week old and probably older, barring some incredible good fortune.
Real farmers, like gardeners, take pride in every tomato. And while agribusiness continues to try to find a way to produce a decent-tasting tomato (there's a new scheme now; it won't work), anyone who wants to can buy tomatoes and other fantastic produce until Thanksgiving, and - in much of the country and without much effort - well into the early winter. The thrill of seasonality - not only real tomatoes but firm eggplants and cucumbers with super flavor and minimal seeds, arugula that demonstrates why it was once called rocket, peaches with loads of fuzz and so on - reminds me why I don't often buy those things out of season.
But to get these beautiful veggies, we need real farmers who grow real food, and the will to reform a broken food system. And for that, we need not only to celebrate farmers, but also to advocate for them.

HEADLINE: Concerns About Al Qaeda in Syria Underscore Questions About Rebels

BYLINE: DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: The question of what Al Qaeda is doing in Syria has recently moved to the forefront of the West's debate over how to respond to the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. 

 BODY:
What is Al Qaeda doing in Syria?
That question has recently moved to the forefront of the West's debate over how to respond to the uprising against President Bashar al Assad of Syria -- the bloodiest, most protracted and most explosive revolt of the Arab Spring. 
Reports from Western officials, militant Islamist Web sites, neighboring countries and, to a limited extent, inside the Syrian opposition indicate Al Qaeda and homegrown militants are joining the fight and competing for influence. And that poses a vexing question for American policy makers and politicians. So far all sides of the debate in Washington have called for supporting the insurgency and the only question is how much. The Obama administration talks of diplomacy and economic sanctions, while some Republicans push to provide weapons to the insurgents. Is the United States acting side by side with Al Qaeda? 
The short answer is no. A group as numerically tiny as Al Qaeda could never by itself steer a movement as large as the Syrian revolt. And even if Al Qaeda or other anti-Western militants are seeking to exploit or direct the Syrian uprising -- why wouldn't they? -- that merely makes them rivals to the West for influence over the course of the revolt. 
The West, for its part, is eager to deprive Iran of its principle regional ally, the Assad government. It is dominated by the Assad's Alawite sect of Islam, an offshoot of the Shiites who govern Iran. 
The question of Al Qaeda's presence in the Syrian uprising, though, is also a kind of shorthand for the larger conundrum of how to understand the composition, ideology and ultimate vision of the fighters of the so-called Free Syrian Army now driving the uprising. 
The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood - the franchise of the pan-Arab Sunni Islamist group that won Egypt's presidential election - has long been considered the principle opposition under Mr. Assad and his father before him. The father, President Hafez al-Assad, killed tens of thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members in his efforts to crush the group.
But in the context of the democratic uprisings of the Arab spring, Sunni Islamists are a broad spectrum, engaged in their own debate over the objectives of their movement. They range from the relatively secular and Western-friendly leaders of Turkey and Tunisia to the more conservative but pragmatic and nonviolent Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt. 
There is also its stricter and more militant offshoot, Hamas, in Gaza, and so on along the spectrum from moderation to radicalism. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood is considered more conservative than its Egyptian counterpart; the Syrian Brotherhood also had more history of violent resistance to the Assads. But not much more is known about the current internal dynamics of the group.
Where the Islamist components of the Syrian insurgency might ultimately end up along that spectrum could determine the coming stages of the conflict. More radical or militant Sunni Islamists are most likely to see Mr. Assad's supporters, the Shiites or Alawites, as dangerous heretics, fueling their determination to fight on or face reprisals. Nor would a prominent role for Sunni militants make Syria's Christian and other religious minorities eager to join the fight. 
On the other hand, more moderate or pluralistic Islamists are more likely to hold out the promise of a new government of national unity, enticing former Assad supporters to join them. Further down the road, if the Assad government collapses, militant dominance in Syria could also pose a threat to neighboring Israel and trouble the West in other ways as well.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta publicly acknowledged the question as far back as May. "We do have intelligence that indicates there is an Al Qaeda presence in Syria, but frankly we don't have very good intelligence as to just what exactly their activities are," he said, adding, "They are a concern, and frankly, we need to continue to do everything we can to try to determine what kind of influence they are trying to exert."
The New York Times is also attempting to answer those questions. One recent article focused on Al Qaeda's ambitions, the views of the Shiite government of neighboring Iraq (where an Al Qaeda branch has flourished among the Sunni opposition and the border is increasingly porous) as well as the assessments of Western analysts.
Another article attempted to look more closely at the dynamics on the ground among the Syrian rebels, including their internal debates over what kinds of Islamist symbolism and ideology they want to embrace.

TOP STORIES
Investors in Health Care Seem to Bet on Incumbent | Who is going to win the presidential election? You might want to ask Mark T. Bertolini, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. He just bet $5.7 billion on President Obama.
Mr. Bertolini is the chief executive of Aetna, which on Monday agreed to acquire Coventry Health Care, a huge provider of Medicare and Medicaid programs. His $5.7 billion bet makes a lot of sense if you believe that the Affordable Care Act - often referred to as Obamacare - will not be repealed.
Mitt Romney has pledged to repeal the act "on my first day if elected," so any gamble that Obamacare stays intact could be fairly described as a wager that President Obama will remain in office.
At a time when so many in the business community appear to be supporting Mr. Romney, it is telling that some businessmen and investors expect a different result - and are wagering more than rhetoric; they are staking their wallets on it.

Examining the Ponzi Scheme Through the Mind of the Con Artist | Maybe "Ponzi scheme" should have its own spot in the Dewey Decimal System. Along with biographies of the schemers, a growing stack of scholarly references, legal tomes and articles aims to collect knowledge about this age-old crime.
But the latest entry in the category, "The Ponzi Scheme Puzzle: A History and Analysis of Con Artists and Victims" by Tamar Frankel, takes a different approach. While Professor Frankel is a legal scholar who has been on the faculty of the Boston University Law School since 1968, her book explores the psychology of the financial criminals and what makes them tick. She was inspired by a colleague who referred to them as "those mimics of trustworthiness: con artists."
Professor Frankel spoke with DealBook about the mind-set of the con artist, as well as the role that victims and society play. Her conclusions will not comfort Ponzi victims; she faults them for their gullibility and failing to "do their homework." She finds, too, that society has a profound ambivalence toward con artists despite the vicious nature of their crimes - which, she notes, on rare occasions have even included murder. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Focus of Presidential Campaign Shifts Away From Economy

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: A campaign that Republicans wanted to be focused relentlessly on President Obama's job-creation record seems, at the moment, to be about almost everything else. 

 BODY:
 Actually, it's not the economy. At least not this week.
 A presidential campaign that Republicans wanted to be focused relentlessly on President Obama's job-creation record seems to be about almost everything else at the moment.
 In part that's the result of a monthslong effort by the Obama campaign to shift attention to Mitt Romney's wealth and business record. 
In part it's the result of what now appears to be a strategic shift by Mr. Romney, who had spent much of this year hammering home his credentials as Mr. Economic Fix-It. His choice of Paul D. Ryan as his running mate has elevated conservative approaches to Medicare and budget cutting to the forefront of the election debate, crowding out a more direct focus on jobs and economic growth. It suggests that Mr. Romney is more interested in motivating his base than winning an economic argument for the allegiance of a dwindling number of undecided and independent voters. 
His current advertising appeal to frustrated middle-class voters is primarily the charge, much debunked by fact-checkers, that Mr. Obama is trying to make it easier for the poor to get welfare checks and escape work requirements. He has chosen to engage in a debate with the White House about campaign tactics, another diversion from what had been his core message.
And in part the shift away from the economy is the result of self-inflicted problems by Republicans. 
Representative Todd Akin's statements about rape and pregnancy injected social issues more deeply into the campaign on terms advantageous to Democrats and put the Republican Party's hopes of holding down the substantial advantage held by Democrats among women voters that much further out of reach. And disclosure this week of skinny-dipping and other antics by House members during a trip to Israel last year undercuts the idea that the latest crop of Republicans came to Washington to change business as usual.
Liberals can hardly believe their good luck. Conservatives are starting to express concern.
"There's no question that some events outside the Obama campaign's control and some within it have allowed them to change the subject," said Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, the conservative economic policy advocacy group. "They're adept at seizing every opportunity not to talk about jobs and the economy."
The Romney campaign, Mr. Chocola said, should intensify its focus on core economic issues, in part by tying them directly to entitlement reform and reining in government spending.
"The Romney campaign has to be very focused at linking everything to the economy, and I'm not sure they are doing that all day, every day," he said.
August is often a silly season in politics, when the campaign equivalent of Shark Week can get outsize attention. Presidential campaigns almost always air a full range of topics at various stages before reverting back to the big issues facing the nation as Election Day approaches. And for all the attention that the latest tactics and gaffes get in Washington and among partisan obsessives, there's no evidence that voters are any less concerned about the economy than they have been for the last five years.
Still, the dissipation of focus on what Republicans believed - and Democrats feared - would be a lethal issue for Mr. Obama's hopes of a second term has been striking. Mr. Obama got only a single question about it at his news conference on Tuesday - after talking about Medicare, Mr. Akin's comments and Mr. Romney's tax returns - and he deflected it by suggesting that it was up to Republicans in Congress to act on his proposals to help homeowners and address the budget standoff.
"In terms of the economy, I would love to say that when Congress comes back - they've got a week or 10 days before they go out and start campaigning again - that we're going to see a flurry of action," Mr. Obama said. "I can't guarantee that."
Even if his economic message is no longer front and center, Mr. Romney continues to press his case on the campaign trail that his business experience qualifies him to get the economy creating jobs again and that Mr. Obama does not understand private enterprise. 
"I've had the experience of working in the real world, if you will, the private sector, and seeing how enterprises get started and how they change the lives of people when they're successful - and how, by the way, they're not successful and how we lose jobs," Mr. Romney told a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire recently. 
The Republican convention next week will give Mr. Romney a chance to bring the spotlight back to the economy, even as he presses a broader case against Mr. Obama. Monthly unemployment reports coming out the first weeks of September, October and November will amount to impartial scorecards of progress on job creation, or lack thereof, before Election Day. And the presidential debates in October will no doubt provide ample opportunity for both candidates to make their economic stewardship arguments.
But heading into the formal start of the general election, Mr. Obama and his allies have shown that with a little luck they are capable of redefining the terms of the campaign even in the face of a lackluster economy.

HEADLINE: Obama to Focus on Education in Campaign Swing Through Ohio and Nevada

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: The president will attend rallies on Tuesday at colleges in Columbus, Ohio, and Reno, Nev. 

 BODY:
President Obama set off Tuesday on a two-day campaign swing through Ohio and Nevada, with plans to continue etching sharp differences with his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney - this time on education policy.
Mr. Obama, his campaign advisers said, will speak about his administration's investments in education through tuition tax credits, a doubling of the Pell Grant program, and incentives for colleges to keep a lid on tuition costs.
The president will attend rallies at colleges in Columbus, Ohio, and Reno, Nev., on Tuesday, and he will speak at a high school in Las Vegas on Wednesday before flying to New York City for fund-raisers on Wednesday evening.
Ohio and Nevada loom large as swing states in this election, though for somewhat different reasons. Both campaigns view Ohio as a must-win state, while Mr. Romney views Nevada, which Mr. Obama won by nearly 12 points in 2008, as a target of opportunity because of its wounded housing market and growing Mormon population.
It is Mr. Obama's eighth visit to Ohio this year. In May, he and his wife, Michelle, unofficially started his general election campaign with a large rally at Ohio State University. The president has traveled to Nevada five times in 2012, though this is his first purely campaign swing through the state.
In Nevada, which has some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, Mr. Obama is likely to hammer Mr. Romney again on his statement during the Republican primaries that the housing crisis should be allowed to run its course without a government bailout. But Mr. Obama's own cautious response to the housing crisis will also come under scrutiny.
On education, the Obama campaign will seek to draw a contrast with the policies of Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. It said in a statement that Mr. Romney's "advice for students trying to pay for college is to either 'borrow money from their parents' or 'shop around.' " The Romney-Ryan budget, the campaign said, would slash investment in education.
The Romney campaign countered that the Obama administration's policies had resulted in a "lost generation" of young people whose access to college was hindered by spiraling tuition that left them with a crushing debt burn, and whose job prospects after school were dim because of the president's poor stewardship of the economy.
The campaign pointed to a question Mr. Obama was asked during an interview with a New Hampshire television station, WMUR, over the weekend, about why financially straitened college graduates should support his bid for re-election.
"Well, they can look at my track record," he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Attacks Romney's Proposals for College Financing

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama criticized Mitt Romney for advising financially strapped young people who want to go to college to "shop around and borrow more money from your parents." 

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio - President Obama, adding another verse to his litany of differences with Mitt Romney, promoted his record on education here Tuesday and assailed his Republican challenger for advising financially strapped young people who want to go to college to "shop around and borrow more money from your parents."
Mr. Obama, who portrayed himself as the fortunate product of affordable education, said Mr. Romney's educational policies were conspicuously lacking in the student loans, grants, work-study programs and emphasis on lower tuition rates that put higher education within reach of millions of middle-class Americans.
"He said, 'the best thing I can do for you is to tell you is to shop around,' " the president told a crowd of 3,500 in a sun-dappled quadrangle at Capital University, in the Columbus suburb of Bexley. "That's it. That's his plan. That's his answer to young people who are trying to figure out how to go to college and make sure they don't have a mountain of debt."
It was Mr. Obama's first rally in a two-day campaign swing to Ohio and Nevada focused on education. And it was the latest chapter in what has become a methodical drive by the president to make the election a stark choice between him and Mr. Romney: on taxes, Medicare, education - on anything, it seems, but the gasping economy.
The president recited what he said was his administration's unstinting record in support of education: a $10,000 tuition tax credit for families, a doubling of the Pell Grant program, incentives for colleges to keep tuition increases down and Mr. Obama's push to prevent rates on student loans from rising sharply this summer.
To underscore his support, the president stopped earlier in the day at Sloopy's, a 1950s-style diner at Ohio State University, where he acted as a one-man welcoming committee for arriving freshmen.
"The only problem with seeing you guys," he said to three young women was that they were a reminder that his daughter, Malia, who is starting high school this fall, would be leaving home in a few years. 
"Are you ready?" Samantha Williams, of Lima, Ohio, asked.
"No," he replied. "I don't want them to leave yet." 
The Romney campaign dismissed Mr. Obama's education offensive, saying his policies had yielded a "lost generation" of people whose access to college was hindered by spiraling tuition that left them with a crushing debt burden, and whose job prospects after school were dim because of the president's inept stewardship of the economy.
The Romney campaign also derided Mr. Obama's answer to a question in an interview over the weekend with WMUR, a New Hampshire television station, about why financially burdened college graduates should support his bid for re-election.
"Well, they can look at my track record," he said.
Surrogates for Mr. Romney also promoted his record as an educational reformer, particularly as governor of Massachusetts.
In a statement, Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, a Republican, said, "Unlike President Obama, Mitt Romney will provide the choices students need to enroll in good schools, the information parents need to hold districts accountable and the jobs graduates need to be successful in the global economy."
For Mr. Obama, political analysts say, every day that the two campaigns are discussing issues other than the job market and the economy is a victory for the president. Mr. Obama did not address the furor over remarks about abortion made by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri. But the swirling tempest also distracted from what Mr. Romney hoped would be a focus on the economy.
In addition to the rally here, Mr. Obama was scheduled to speak at a college in Reno, Nev., later Tuesday. On Wednesday, he is to speak at a high school in Las Vegas, before flying to New York City for fund-raisers, including a basketball skills clinic in which the president is expected to play with some N.B.A. stars.
Ohio and Nevada loom large as battleground states this election, though for somewhat different reasons. Both campaigns view Ohio as a must-win state, while Mr. Romney views Nevada, which Mr. Obama won by nearly 12 points in 2008, as a target of opportunity because of its wounded housing market and growing Mormon population.
It is Mr. Obama's eighth visit to Ohio this year. In May, he and the first lady, Michelle, unofficially began his general election campaign with a large rally at Ohio State University. The president has traveled to Nevada five times in 2012, though this is his first purely campaign swing through the state.
In Nevada, which has some of the highest foreclosures rates in the country, Mr. Obama will most likely hammer Mr. Romney again on a statement he made during the Republican primaries that the housing crisis should be allowed to run its course without a government bailout. But Mr. Obama's own cautious response to the housing crisis will also come under scrutiny.

HEADLINE: Romney's Attack on Clean Energy: True, With an Asterisk

BYLINE: MATTHEW WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Many green energy projects were started under the Bush administration. 

 BODY:
This week, Mitt Romney echoed an accusation made by various conservative bloggers against President Obama -- that his administration has spent $90 billion on green energy.
"Do you know how much money he invested in so-called green energy companies?" Mr. Romney asked during a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H., on Monday "Ninety billion. Ninety billion!"
But is it true?
Roughly, yes. In fact, the number appears in a document on the White House Web site and represents the financing available in the 2009 stimulus package. Not all that money has been spent; the Energy Department, for example, received $35 billion under the act but has spent only $26 billion thus far, according to Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman.
Yet not all of the money was for Obama administration projects.
Some funds for green energy were appropriated during the administration of President George W. Bush, but not spent until Mr. Obama took office. And some of the stimulus money -- for green energy -- went to programs signed into law by Mr. Bush, but were not actually financed until Mr. Obama became president.
Such spending overlap between administrations is common, particularly on energy initiatives. "Very few energy things actually get spun up quickly,'' said , the associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin.
Ms. Stutsman of the Energy Department said that the money for the programs was appropriated by Congress, and that the administration was spending it. "We're following Congressional direction very well," she said.
Republicans have been arguing, though, that the money was not well spent. One example is the solar equipment manufacturer Solyndra, which also shows the overlap in spending between administrations.
Solyndra had a clever design for lightweight, easy-to-install solar arrays, and received a $535 million loan guarantee under a program that was approved for financing in the Bush administration. Energy Department officials turned down the loan application as incomplete shortly before Mr. Obama took office; the same officials later approved a revised application. The company went bankrupt, though, because the price of solar cells was plummeting.
Another example is theAdvanced Research Projects Administration - Energy, or Arpa-e, modeled after the better-known Defense Research Projects Administration, or Darpa, which was credited with helping to create the Internet. The Arpa-e program was signed into law by Mr. Bush in 2007 but got no money until the stimulus was passed. It gives fairly modest grants to energy projects that are judged very risky but also highly promising.
The White House breaks down the $90 billion om green energy projects in the stimulus bill like this:

        
$29 billion for energy efficiency, including $5 billion for improvements in the homes and apartments of low-income households

        
$21 billion for renewable electricity generation, including wind turbines and solar panels

        
$10 billion for grid modernization, including millions of "smart meters" that read themselves, eliminating the need for meter readers

        
$6 billion to help establish factories to make batteries for electric cars and other components of advanced vehicles

        
$18 billion for fast trains

        
$3 billion for research and development into capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide

        
$3 billion for job training and scientific advances in green energy

        
about $2 billion to help build wind turbines, solar panels and similar "green" products
The success of these investments is not yet clear. The economics of wind and solar have been hurt by another development, the crash in the price of natural gas, which is a competing fuel for the production of electricity. The electric car has not yet emerged as a mass-market product to put a dent in oil consumption. The "smart grid" would be especially useful in helping manage a system with large amounts of wind and solar power, which vary in production over the course of the day, but such generating technologies have yet to adequately penetrate the market.
The politics of spending money on green energy are somewhat scrambled.
"There are now so many jobs in the clean energy world, you have Republicans who come to bat for clean energy,'' Mr. Webber said. "A lot of these jobs are in rural, Republican districts,'' he added, citing wind farms and ethanol production, which are big in Iowa, a swing state. "You have rural Republicans teaming up with urban Democrats to push for more wind,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With Abortion in the Spotlight, a Challenge for Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his party's base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over. 

 BODY:
4:07 p.m. | Updated HOUSTON -- The decision by Republican convention delegates to oppose abortion without explicit exceptions for rape and incest poses a tricky political challenge for Mitt Romney as he prepares to accept the presidential nomination in Tampa, Fla., next week.
The vote puts the Republican Party at odds with Mr. Romney, who supports rape and incest exceptions, at a time that controversial comments by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, have increased national scrutiny on the divisive social issue.
Mr. Akin said over the weekend that women's bodies will resist getting pregnant from a "legitimate rape," comments that have been widely condemned, including by Mr. Romney who called for Mr. Akin to withdraw from the race.
"Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race," Mr. Romney said in a statement, citing former Missouri senators like John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent.
But Mr. Akin on Tuesday refused to step down from his race despite loud calls from his party's leaders to abandon his bid.
Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion. Calls and e-mails to a half-dozen advisers on the subject were not returned on Tuesday.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that "this is the platform of the Republican Party, it is not the platform of Mitt Romney."
The reluctance to talk about the platform reflects the delicate position that Mr. Romney is in when it comes to abortion policy.
A supporter of abortion rights early in his political career, Mr. Romney later switched his position. This year, he captured the nomination of a party whose hard-core activists remained suspicious of Mr. Romney's late-in-life conversion to their cause.
But as he prepares to accept that nomination next week in Tampa, Mr. Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his party's base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over.
The vote on the platform is an important part of the Republican Party's outreach to its conservative base. Mr. Romney and his aides have worked hard to ensure that social conservatives at the convention -- and the voters they represent -- do not feel left out.
The party platform -- and the positions taken on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues -- are a key part of that effort.
If Mr. Romney were to reject the party's tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House.
There could also be a flurry of conservative outrage at the convention, which could distract from the carefully choreographed event Mr. Romney's strategists are planning.
But Mr. Romney's campaign is also trying hard to make sure that the convention projects an image that swing voters in battleground states will find appealing. Aides did not expect to be focusing heavily on the party's abortion positions this week.
The campaign has already chosen in the last several weeks to move off its core message about jobs and the economy. The convention is intended to return the campaign's message to one of how Mr. Romney will get the nation's economy back on track.
In the current political environment involving Mr. Akin's comments, a decision by Mr. Romney to accept the party's abortion plank will open his campaign to attacks from his rivals that he is out of step with moderate, independent voters.
Democrats have already pounced. Officials with the Democratic National Committee quickly called the Republican abortion position the "Akin plank" and scheduled a news conference to denounce it.
"American women know that Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the party they lead are the wrong choice for women and their families," a statement from the Democratic committee said. "Mitt Romney should do the right thing and denounce this dangerous language."

HEADLINE: Profits in G.M.A.C. Bailout to Benefit Financiers, Not U.S.

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The rescue of G.M.A.C. is a case study in how bailouts can linger and profits, when they do come, flow not to the government but to the Warren E. Buffetts of the world. 

 BODY:
Among the companies that were bailed out by the federal government during the financial crisis, perhaps the most intractable is proving to be the company formerly known as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. It's a case study in how bailouts can linger and profits, when they do come, flow not to the government but to the Warren E. Buffetts of the world.
G.M.A.C. was the financial arm of General Motors. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, it was also G.M.'s most profitable unit, which tells you something about the auto industry at the time. The company earned more profit from lending money to customers than in selling cars.
In 2005, desperate to raise cash, General Motors sold a 51 percent stake in G.M.A.C. to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus beat out a rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for the privilege, spurring BusinessWeek to writethat Henry R. Kravis's loss "has to sting."
 During the financial crisis, however, the sting was felt on the other side, as G.M.A.C. staved off collapse thanks only to a government infusion of $17.2 billion. The company was renamed Ally Financial - you have probably seen its catchy commercials on television. The Treasury Department owns 73.8 percent of Ally, with Cerberus retaining an 8.7 percent stake.
Almost since that time, the Treasury Department has wanted to rid itself of its Ally stake. Ally filed for an initial public offering in March 2011, but it has so far languished in the face of a weak market and concerns over Ally itself. The Treasury Department has been paid back about $5.7 billion and still controls the company through its stock ownership and appointment of a majority of Ally's directors.
Despite lingering concerns about Ally, the automobile sales market is recovering and Ally's auto finance operations turned a profit last year. But Ally is still suffering from legacy debts, primarily concentrated in its ResCap unit. While you might think that with a name like G.M.A.C., the company financed only automobiles, but the company was also one of the largest subprime housing lenders through its ResCap subsidiary.
ResCap, a wholly separate entity owned by Ally, is the fifth-largest mortgaging servicer and origination unit in the nation, serving 2.4 million mortgages with a principal of $374 billion. The business has lost billions since the financial crisis, and the never-ending stream of losses has made investors fearful. They should be. Ally has lent ResCap $1.2 billion and has provided an infusion of $10.3 billion since Jan. 1, 2007.
Ally's chief executive, Michael A. Carpenter, has stated that his priority is to repay the American taxpayer rather than support ResCap. In 2011, ResCap disclosed a loss of $845.1 million and its financing has been drying up as the market realized that Ally would no longer be ResCap's sugar daddy.
It's still unclear why Ally didn't put ResCap into bankruptcy instead of providing billions in support. One explanation may be that Ally wasn't stable enough at the time to risk the market reaction to a bankruptcy and the possibility that Ally's own financing might dry up as a result. In addition, ResCap turned a profit in 2010, but has since been overwhelmed by litigation and bad subprime loans.
Whatever the reason, Ally finally bit the bullet and put ResCap into bankruptcy in May this year, presumably hoping that this would make Ally more attractive itself for an I.P.O. or sale.
ResCap filed for bankruptcy with a huge $1.25 billion loan from Barclays and up to an additional $220 million available from Ally. The initial bankruptcy plan was for ResCap to split up, with the mortgage servicing business being sold to Fortress Investment Group for about $2.3 billion. A legacy portfolio of $5.2 billion in mortgage loan principal would be sold separately. At the time of the bankruptcy, Ally announced its intention to serve as a stalking horse bid for the legacy portfolio, bidding from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.
Enter the greatest investor of our time.
One of Ally's biggest creditors at that time was Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which held more than $500 million of ResCap's unsecured bonds and $900 million in ResCap's junior secured bonds. Berkshire has since sold the unsecured bonds but has also joined the fray. It announced in June that it would bid for the mortgage servicer, and offer $1.45 billion for the legacy loan portfolio. The investment firm Lone Star Funds has also stated its interest in buying one or both.
Ally has now bowed out and Berkshire has replaced it as the stalking bidder for the loan portfolio. This fall, a bankruptcy court will hold an open auction for both businesses. We don't know who will buy these businesses, but it won't be Ally, which has left the scene after losing billions.
When asked for comment on why it was no longer bidding, an Ally spokesman expressed the intention for Ally to focus on its core businesses where Ally has a "leading position and competitive strengths, and that includes the auto finance and direct banking franchises."
Ally's initial gambit as a stalking horse bid has succeeded in bringing bidders to the table and maximizing the value of ResCap. But it's hard not to think that if Ally were not a ward of the government, this might have turned out differently. Having come so far and invested more than $10 billion, Ally might want to bid for those assets, using its prior ownership to gain an advantage. After all, now there appears the potential to profit.
But the costs and uncertainties of continuing in the mortgage business are significant, and Ally does not appear to want to take that risk. At the time of the bankruptcy, the Treasury Department stated that its "objective today is to exit in a manner that balances speed of recovery with maximizing returns for taxpayers" and that it believes that the ResCap bankruptcy will "put taxpayers in a stronger position to maximize the value of their remaining investment in Ally."
That's the problem with companies being bailed out. They're no longer as entrepreneurial or risk-taking as they might be, and instead have to balance gains against a need to pay back the government. Now that housing is in a fitful recovery, smart financiers are returning to this market. Ordinarily, this would be a good situation for Ally to buy back the assets in bankruptcy. But it will be private investors - and potentially Mr. Buffett - who will profit from ResCap's carcass.
And with the Treasury Department still in the hole for more than $11.5 billion with Ally, it is already facing a significant period before the government is paid back in full. The Treasury Department expects that it will be repaid a substantial portion of the government's investment in Ally, if not the full amount.
Though Ally operates independently, the Treasury Department, as Ally's owner, is not likely to have the patience to wait longer for ResCap. When the government is your lender, paying back the money is your first goal.

HEADLINE: After Afghanistan, a New Great Game

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER COOLEY. 
Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College, is the author of ''Great Games, Local Rules: The New Great Power Contest in Central Asia.''

 BODY:
SINCE 9/11, America's priority in Central Asia has been to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. But as the United States and NATO pull out, there is a new danger: that the West could become entangled in regional rivalries, local strongman politics and competition with Russia and China.Central Asian governments have sought for years to manipulate foreign powers' interest in the region for their own benefit. In the summer of 2005, the United States military was evicted from its facility at Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan after American officials criticized the Uzbek government's slaughter of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators in Andijon; Russia and China, which have both been expanding their footprints in the region, publicly backed the crackdown.
In 2009 Kyrgyzstan's kleptocratic president, Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, drummed up a bidding war between Washington and Moscow over the fate of the Manas air base, the main staging facility for American troops in Afghanistan. Following Mr. Bakiyev's ouster in an April 2010 revolt, Kyrgyz officials claimed that many of these payments had been laundered through a complex network of offshore bank accounts controlled by the former first family. 
As America begins withdrawing from Afghanistan, the Central Asian states are likely to increase their demands for tacit payoffs for cooperation. Currently, the United States pays the Kyrgyz government $60 million a year to lease Manas and funnels hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel contracts to local suppliers and intermediaries.
The United States also pays roughly $500 million annually in transit fees to ship equipment and material via the Northern Distribution Network, a set of road, sea, railway and air routes that traverse the Central Asian states, which was opened to provide an alternative to Pakistani supply routes.
In June, NATO reached agreements with Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan for taking equipment out of Afghanistan. Uzbekistan, which effectively controls rail shipments out of northern Afghanistan, has already announced that it will charge up to 150 percent of the distribution network's prevailing transit rates, and American officials expect to be further squeezed as neighboring states bargain hard during the West's rush to the exits.
Most controversially of all, NATO and the Central Asian states are still negotiating over the potential transfer of military equipment, used by coalition forces in Afghanistan, to Central Asian governments' security services, which have a bloody human rights record.
In January, the Obama administration lifted a ban on foreign military sales to Uzbekistan, on national security grounds, to allow for sales of counterterrorism equipment. American officials insist that such future transfers will include only nonlethal items, but the Uzbek government has long sought items like armored personnel carriers, helicopters and drones, which could be used to suppress protests.
Withdrawal from Afghanistan also elevates the risk that the United States, together with other external powers, will be drawn into a number of local disputes and escalating regional rivalries. Over the last decade, Central Asian leaders have consistently invoked the specter of insurgents' spilling over from Afghanistan to justify their own counterterrorism efforts and the need for security cooperation with Russia, China and the United States. Western withdrawal will encourage local elites to stoke these fears, justifying domestic crackdowns, rendition of political opponents and escalation of border tensions with neighbors.
The Tajik government recently cracked down on local militias in the remote town of Khorog near the Afghan border. Though the government claimed that it captured Afghan-trained fighters in its crackdown, locals view the action as an attempt to take over lucrative smuggling routes along the Afghan border and finally bring the autonomous region under full state control.
Russia seems keen to reinforce this narrative to justify extending its military basing rights throughout the country, which, in all likelihood, Tajik officials will then use as leverage to demand more Western assistance.
Washington's ''new silk route'' strategy, an attempt to promote sustainable development in Afghanistan by linking its infrastructure, energy transmission grids and pipelines to Central Asia, may lead to further corruption and enrichment of top officials. Promoting big-ticket projects and labeling them in grand terms has already provoked suspicion in Beijing and Moscow about the West's long-term regional ambitions.
Moreover, Russia continues to push for the inclusion of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the new Moscow-led customs union, while China continues to build new infrastructure and energy pipelines. Far from promoting increased regional trade and commerce, the Central Asian states now seem to be using external economic initiatives to extract new revenue.
After 11 years of pressing the Afghan government to improve its governance and create democratic institutions, Washington has failed to effectively promote these same goals in neighboring countries. Now withdrawal from Afghanistan risks dragging the West even further into a hotbed of domestic power struggles and regional rivalries.

HEADLINE: Disney World on the Hudson

BYLINE: By JEREMIAH MOSS. 
Jeremiah Moss is the pen name of the author of the blog Vanishing New York.

 BODY:
WHEN the first segment of the High Line, the now-famous park built atop an old elevated railway on the West Side of Manhattan, opened in 2009, I experienced a moment of excitement. I had often wondered what it would be like to climb that graffiti-marked trestle with its wild urban meadow. Of course, I'd seen the architectural renderings and knew not to expect a wilderness. Still, the idea was enticing: a public park above the hubbub, a contemplative space where nature softens the city's abrasiveness.Today it's difficult to remember that initial feeling. The High Line has become a tourist-clogged catwalk and a catalyst for some of the most rapid gentrification in the city's history.
My skepticism took root during my first visit. The designers had scrubbed the graffiti and tamed the wildflowers. Guards admonished me when my foot moved too close to a weed. Was this a park or a museum? I felt like I was in the home of a neatnik with expensive tastes, afraid I would soil the furnishings. 
But the park was a hit. Fashion models strutted up and down. Shoppers from the meatpacking district boutiques commandeered the limited number of benches, surrounded by a phalanx of luxury clothing bags. I felt underdressed.
That rarefied state didn't last, though. As the High Line's hype grew, the tourists came clamoring. Originally meant for running freight trains, the High Line now runs people, except where those people jam together like spawning salmon crammed in a bottleneck. The park is narrow, and there are few escape routes. I've gotten close to a panic attack, stuck in a pool of stagnant tourists at the park's most congested points.
Not yet four years old, the High Line has already become another stop on the must-see list for out-of-towners, another chapter in the story of New York City's transformation into Disney World. According to the park's Web site, 3.7 million people visited the High Line in 2011, only half of them New Yorkers. It's this overcrowding -- not just of the High Line, but of the streets around it -- that's beginning to turn the tide of sentiment.
Recently, an anonymous local set off a small media storm by posting fliers around the park that read: ''Attention High Line tourists. West Chelsea is not Times Square. It is not a tourist attraction.'' A local newspaper talked to a 24-year-old who reported that young people who once met for dates at the park now say, ''How about doing something that doesn't involve the High Line?''
But the problem isn't just the crowds. It's that the park, which will eventually snake through more than 20 blocks, is destroying neighborhoods as it grows.
And it's doing so by design. While the park began as a grass-roots endeavor -- albeit a well-heeled one -- it quickly became a tool for the Bloomberg administration's creation of a new, upscale, corporatized stretch along the West Side. As socialites and celebrities championed the designer park during its early planning stages, whipping community support into a heady froth, the city rezoned West Chelsea for luxury development in 2005.
The neighborhood has since been completely remade. Old buildings fell and mountain ranges of glassy towers with names like High Line 519 and HL23 started to swell -- along with prices.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation published a study last year stating that before the High Line was redeveloped, ''surrounding residential properties were valued 8 percent below the overall median for Manhattan.'' Between 2003 and 2011, property values near the park increased 103 percent.
This is good news for the elite economy but not for many who have lived and worked in the area for decades. It's easy to forget that until very recently, even with the proliferation of art galleries near the West Side Highway, West Chelsea was a mix of working-class residents and light-industrial businesses.
But the High Line is washing all that away. D&R Auto Parts saw its profits fall by more than 35 percent. Once-thriving restaurants like La Lunchonette and Hector's diner, a local anchor since 1949, have lost their customer base.
Hardest hit have been the multigenerational businesses of ''gasoline alley.'' Mostly auto-related establishments that don't fit into Michael R. Bloomberg's luxury city vision, several vanished in mere months, like species in a meteoric mass extinction. Bear Auto Shop was out after decades; the Olympia parking garage, after 35 years, closed when its rent reportedly quintupled.
Brownfeld Auto, on West 29th Street near 10th Avenue, lost its lease after nearly a century. Today it's another hole in the ground. Its third-generation owner, Alan Brownfeld, blamed the High Line for taking away the thriving business he'd inherited from his grandfather. ''It's for the city's glamorous people,'' he said.
Mr. Brownfeld is right, for now. But just as the High Line's early, trendy denizens gave way to touristic hordes, Chelsea's haute couture moment may be fleeting. As big a brand as Stella McCartney is, she can't compete with global chains like Sephora, which are muscling into the area's commercial space.
Within a few years, the ecosystem disrupted by the High Line will find a new equilibrium. The aquarium-like high rises will be for the elite, along with a few exclusive locales like the Standard Hotel. But the new locals will rarely be found at street level, where chain stores and tourist-friendly restaurants will cater to the crowds of passers-by and passers-through. Gone entirely will be regular New Yorkers, the people who used to call the neighborhood home. But then the High Line was never really about them.

HEADLINE: As Decision Nears on Gas Drilling, Ad War Heats Up

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration finishes up new regulations on where and how to allow hydraulic fracturing in New York State, groups on both sides of the issue are turning to the airwaves in a late-inning effort to press their cases.The advertisements are appearing in the Southern Tier region, just north of the Pennsylvania border, where the Marcellus Shale rock formation is rich in natural gas, and where communities may have to give local approval for drilling to be allowed in their area under a plan being pursued by the administration.
The State Department of Environmental Conservation, which received tens of thousands of submissions in a public-comment period that ended in January, has not revealed just when it will release its rules on hydraulic fracturing. But opponents of the technology, also known as hydrofracking or fracking, are working with an increased urgency amid speculation that Mr. Cuomo's administration could finish its work soon. 
''Certainly there's a feeling that a decision is on the horizon here, and we want to make sure that folks are educated,'' said Seth Gladstone, a spokesman for Food and Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group sponsoring a new television ad scheduled to appear on Wednesday. ''There's no time like the present to be vocal on this.''
The television advertisement opens with an image of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and concludes with a plea for New Yorkers to call his office and, in the words of the narrator, ''tell Governor Cuomo there's no safe fracking.''
Hydrofracking involves injecting large amounts of sand, water and chemicals deep underground at high pressures to extract natural gas from rock formations. Opponents argue that the process risks contaminating the water supply with toxic chemicals.
The New York Times reported in June that Mr. Cuomo's administration was developing a plan that would limit hydraulic fracturing to parts of several Southern Tier counties, and would permit it only in communities that support the drilling technology. The Times said the plan would limit drilling to the deepest areas of the Marcellus Shale in an effort to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Emily DeSantis, said Tuesday that the department intended to release its regulations this year. ''Our review of high-volume hydraulic fracturing is continuing, and no decisions have been made,'' Ms. DeSantis said in an e-mail.
Voters remain divided on the issue. In a new poll released by Siena College on Tuesday, 39 percent of likely voters said they supported allowing hydrofracking; 38 percent opposed it. That was virtually unchanged from when Siena last asked voters about hydrofracking, in May.
''These kinds of decisions are a politician's worst nightmare,'' said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena pollster. ''No matter what the governor decides here, half the people in the state are not going to like his decision.''
Still, both sides continue trying to build pressure on Mr. Cuomo and to influence public opinion.
Hydrofracking opponents, some dressed as cows, demonstrated last week outside a gathering Mr. Cuomo held to discuss the state's growing yogurt industry. Protests are planned at a policy conference he is hosting in Manhattan on Wednesday and at the opening day of the State Fair near Syracuse on Thursday. And a group of artists that opposes hydrofracking -- led by Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon, and including Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney -- is planning to begin its efforts in Manhattan next week.
Two coalitions of landowners and businesses that support hydrofracking began a new advertising campaign last week, arguing that fracking would be an important source of new jobs and economic activity. Those groups are running an advertisement in newspapers in the Southern Tier, as well as 30- and 60-second radio ads in Albany and the Southern Tier, that focus on President Obama's support for expanding natural gas production; the ads are scheduled to continue for several weeks.
The radio advertisements include Mr. Obama saying, at an appearance in Cincinnati last month, that ''there are a lot of folks right now that are engaging in hydraulic fracking who are doing it safely.''
''We agree with you, Mr. President,'' a voice says. ''Governor Cuomo, please listen to the experts: issue clear, statewide guidelines for safe natural gas development now.''
By contrast, the new television ad by Food and Water Watch focuses on the possible environmental risks from hydrofracking, like groundwater contamination. The group said it was spending tens of thousands of dollars on the ad campaign -- a modest amount, but money that will go further in the relatively inexpensive media markets of Binghamton and Elmira. It said the ad would be broadcast hundreds of times over two weeks.

HEADLINE: Internet Moves by India to Stem Rumors and Panic Raise Questions

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- The Indian government's efforts to stem a weeklong panic among some ethnic minorities has again put it at odds with Internet companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter.Officials in New Delhi, who have had disagreements with the companies over restrictions on free speech, say the sites are not responding quickly enough to their requests to delete and trace the origins of doctored photos and incendiary posts aimed at people from northeastern India. After receiving threats online and on their phones, tens of thousands of students and migrants from the northeast have left cities like Bangalore, Pune and Chennai in the last week.
The government has blocked 245 Web pages since Friday, but still many sites are said to contain fabricated images of violence against Muslims in the northeast and in neighboring Myanmar meant to incite Muslims in cities like Bangalore and Mumbai to attack people from the northeast. India also restricted cellphone users to five text messages a day each for 15 days in an effort to limit the spread of rumors. 
Officials from Google and industry associations said they were cooperating fully with the authorities. Some industry executives and analysts added that some requests had not been heeded because they were overly broad or violated internal policies and the rights of users.
The government, used to exerting significant control over media like newspapers, films and television, has in recent months been frustrated in its effort to extend similar and greater regulations to Web sites, most of which are based in the United States. Late last year, an Indian minister tried to get social media sites to prescreen content created by their users before it was posted. The companies refused and the attempt failed under withering public criticism.
While just 100 million of India's 1.2 billion people use the Internet regularly, the numbers are growing fast among people younger than 25, who make up about half the country's population. For instance, there were an estimated 46 million active Indian users on Facebook at the end of 2011, up 132 percent from a year earlier.
Sunil Abraham, an analyst who has closely followed India's battles with Internet companies, said last week's effort to tackle hate speech was justified but poorly managed. He said the first directive from the government was impractically broad, asking all Internet ''intermediaries'' -- a category that includes small cybercafes, Internet service providers and companies like Google and Facebook -- to disable all content that was ''inflammatory, hateful and inciting violence.''
''The Internet intermediaries are responding slowly because now they have to trawl through their networks and identify hate speech,'' said Mr. Abraham, executive director of the Center for Internet and Society, a research and advocacy group based in Bangalore. ''The government acted appropriately, but without sufficient sophistication.''
In the days since the first advisory went out on Aug. 17, government officials have asked companies to delete dozens of specific Web pages. Most of them have been blocked, but officials have not publicly identified them or specified the sites on which they were hosted. Ministers have blamed groups in Pakistan, a neighbor with which India has tense relations, for creating and uploading many of the hateful pages and doctored images.
A minister in the Indian government, Milind Deora, acknowledged that officials had received assistance from social media sites but said officials were hoping that the companies would move faster.
''There is a sense of importance and urgency, and that's why the government has taken these out-of-the-way decisions with regards to even curtailing communications,'' Mr. Deora, a junior minister of communications and information technology, said in a telephone interview. ''And we are hoping for cooperation from the platforms and companies to help us as quickly as possible.''
Indian officials have long been concerned about the power of modern communications to exacerbate strife and tension among the nation's many ethnic and religious groups. While communal violence has broadly declined in the last decade, in part because of faster economic growth, many grievances simmer under the surface. Most recently, fighting between the Bodo tribe and Muslims in the northeastern state of Assam has displaced about half a million people and, through text messages and online posts, affected thousands more across India.
Officials at social media companies, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid offending political leaders, said that they were moving as fast as they could but that policy makers must realize that the company officials have to follow their own internal procedures before deleting content and revealing information like the Internet protocol addresses of users.
''Content intended to incite violence, such as hate speech, is prohibited on Google products where we host content, including YouTube, Google Plus and Blogger,'' Google said in a statement. ''We act quickly to remove such material flagged by our users. We also comply with valid legal requests from authorities wherever possible.''
Facebook said in a statement that it also restricts hate speech and ''direct calls for violence'' and added that it was ''working through'' requests to remove content. Twitter declined to comment on the Indian government's request.
Telecommunications company executives criticized the government's response to the crisis as being excessive and clumsy. There was no need to limit text messages to just five a day across the country when problems were concentrated in a handful of big cities, said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India.
''It could have been handled much more tactically,'' he said.
Others said the government could have been more effective had it quickly countered hateful and threatening speech by sending out its own messages, which it was slow to do when migrants from the northeast began leaving Bangalore on Aug. 15.
''It has to also reach out on social networking and Internet platforms and dismantle these rumors,'' Mr. Abraham said, ''and demonstrate that they are false.''

HEADLINE: Meles Zenawi, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Dies at 57

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Josh Kron contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia's repressive prime minister, who lifted his country from the ruins of civil war and transformed it into one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and one of the United States government's closest African allies, died on Monday, state television reported. He was 57.The Ethiopian authorities said he had died just before midnight in a hospital ''abroad'' -- a European Commission spokesman told reporters that it was in Brussels -- after getting a secondary infection. His failing health had been a matter of secrecy for months.
A former rebel leader who had dropped out of medical school in the 1970s to fight Ethiopia's former Communist government, Mr. Meles was lauded for his shrewdness and intelligence. He was known to be a voracious reader, able to digest mountains of statistics rapidly and quote Shakespeare at length. He worked closely with Washington to combat Muslim extremism in the Horn of Africa, though there were growing complaints, even among his backers, about his penchant for violence in quashing dissent. 
In the 1990s, Mr. Meles was widely hailed as a pivotal member of the ''new generation'' of African leaders who had overthrown dictators and would usher in democracy. But while he was praised for his development efforts, he was accused of concentrating power after becoming prime minister in 1995, boxing out rivals and creating a fearful atmosphere in which criticism was not tolerated and journalists and opposition politicians were jailed.
Hailemariam Desalegn, the minister of foreign affairs and deputy prime minister, will become the new premier, the government announced on Tuesday. It was considered unlikely that he would command the same authority as Mr. Meles, and some were sure to see him as little more than a figurehead for a government that remains controlled by Mr. Meles's Tigrayan ethnic minority group from northern Ethiopia.
Many analysts said they did not expect drastic policy shifts and predicted that Ethiopia would remain a close American ally.
Mr. Meles vanished from public view in June, and Western officials had said he had liver cancer. But in mid-July the government's chief spokesman, Bereket Simon, scoffed at the notion that Mr. Meles was seriously ill, saying that ''his health condition is very good and stable'' and that he was just ''taking some rest.''
Meles Zenawi was born on May 8, 1955, and grew up in the northern town of Adwa. He moved to the capital, Addis Ababa, on a scholarship. He is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, a member of Parliament, with whom he had three children.
Ethiopia is widely considered one of Africa's most repressive governments, though it continues to receive more than $800 million in American aid each year. American officials have said that the Ethiopian military and security services are among the Central Intelligence Agency's favorite partners in fighting Muslim extremism in Africa.
Last year, the Ethiopian government sentenced two Swedish journalists to 11 years in prison after they were caught inside the country traveling with a rebel group. This year, it jailed a prominent Ethiopian journalist on vague terrorism charges.
In the past few months, the Ethiopian government has been accused of killing and displacing members of traditional groups who live in the Omo River valley in southern Ethiopia so that the government can build a large hydroelectric dam and lease land to foreign sugar companies.
Mr. Meles was seen as the mastermind behind many of his government's plans. While human rights groups vilified him, some development experts celebrated him, saying Ethiopia had vastly better famine-prevention programs than it did when Mr. Meles's insurgent group seized power in 1991.
Under Mr. Meles, Ethiopia has invested heavily in public infrastructure and branched into competitive businesses like flower farming.
Ethiopia has been one of the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent economies in the developing world, with the economy expanding above 7 percent last year. Though the country remains poor, with a per-capita income of a little more than $1,000, some credited Mr. Meles with making strides toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Others have complained that food aid, jobs and other social benefits were often withheld from farmers, teachers and other people who supported the opposition.
Mr. Meles played an outsize role in the region, recently trying to help broker peace between Sudan and the newly independent nation of South Sudan.

HEADLINE: In Toll of 2,000, New Portrait of Afghan War

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and ANDREW W. LEHREN; Eddie Goldberger contributed reporting, and Jack Begg, Alain Delaquérière and Jack Styczynski contributed research.

 BODY:
His war was almost over. Or so Marina Buckley thought when her son Lance Cpl. Gregory T. Buckley Jr. told her that he would be returning from southern Afghanistan to his Marine Corps base in Hawaii in late August, three months early.Instead, Lance Corporal Buckley became the 1,990th American service member to die in the war when, on Aug. 10, he and two other Marines were shot inside their base in Helmand Province by a man who appears to have been a member of the Afghan forces they were training.
A week later, with the death of Specialist James A. Justice of the Army at a military hospital in Germany, the United States military reached 2,000 dead in the nearly 11-year-old conflict, based on an analysis by The New York Times of Department of Defense records. The calculation by The Times includes deaths not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan and other nations where American forces are directly involved in aiding the war.
Nearly nine years passed before American forces reached their first 1,000 dead in the war. The second 1,000 came just 27 months later, a testament to the intensity of fighting prompted by President Obama's decision to send 33,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in 2010, a policy known as the surge. 
In more ways than his family might have imagined, Lance Corporal Buckley, who had just turned 21 when he died, typified the troops in that second wave of 1,000. According to the Times analysis, three out of four were white, 9 out of 10 were enlisted service members, and one out of two died in either Kandahar Province or Helmand Province in Taliban-dominated southern Afghanistan. Their average age was 26.
The dead were also disproportionately Marines like Lance Corporal Buckley. Though the Army over all has suffered more dead in the war, the Marine Corps, with fewer troops, has had a higher casualty rate: At the height of fighting in late 2010, 2 out of every 1,000 Marines in Afghanistan were dying, twice the rate of the Army. Marine units accounted for three of the five units hardest hit during the surge.
Suffering the most casualties was the Third Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment out of Camp Pendleton, Calif. Twenty-five of its Marines died and more than 180 were wounded, many with multiple amputations, during a bloody seven-month deployment in Helmand that began in fall 2010.
The analysis also shows that Army casualties during the surge fell heaviest on two bases with frequently deployed units: Fort Campbell in Kentucky, home to the 101st Airborne Division, which recorded the most Army deaths in the surge, and Fort Drum in New York, home to the 10th Mountain Division.
The summer remained the peak season for fighting, with the single highest period for American deaths being July, August and September 2010, when at least 143 troops died. And as has been the case since at least 2008, improvised explosive devices, known as I.E.D.'s, remained a leading cause of death and injury, along with small-arms fire, the analysis showed.
But this year, a new threat emerged: attacks by Afghans dressed in the uniforms of Afghan security forces. In just the past two weeks, at least 9 Americans have been killed in such insider attacks, and for the year to date, at least 39 non-Afghan troops, most of them American, have been killed by men dressed as members of the Afghan security forces, the most since the war began.
Those insider attacks have increased concerns about NATO's ability to turn security operations over to Afghan forces by 2014, the deadline set by President Obama for withdrawing the remaining American forces. For families, the deaths have raised hard questions about whether the Pentagon is doing enough to protect its troops from their own allies.
Though Afghanistan is now considered the nation's longest war, at 128 months and counting, the number of dead is fewer than half the total in the Iraq war, where more than 4,480 died in eight years. More active-duty and reserve soldiers killed themselves last year, 278, than died in combat in Afghanistan, 247.
None of that brings solace to the families of the dead. For the Buckleys, of Oceanside, N.Y., their son's death so near the end of his tour, so late in the long war and possibly at the hand of a purported ally, was uniquely anguishing.
As Mrs. Buckley recounted things her son loved -- basketball, girls, movies, the beach -- bitterness choked her words.
''Our forces shouldn't be there,'' she said. ''It should be over. It's done. No more.''
A Unit Hit Hard
The Third Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment out of Camp Pendleton, Calif., was emblematic of the surge. Sent into Sangin, Afghanistan's opium-producing heartland, in 2010, the battalion faced a formidable enemy expert in the use of I.E.D.'s., losing 25 Marines in a seven-month tour, the second most of any American unit in the entire war, a Times analysis shows.
Mark Moyar, an independent national security analyst who has studied the battalion's operations, said that the British who had preceded the Marines in Sangin, a district in Helmand, focused on economic development and political outreach to undermine the insurgency. But the Taliban also operated with near impunity in parts of the district, he said.
The battalion took a different approach, pushing into Taliban-dominated villages. Fighting was intense, with civilians often getting caught in the middle, and casualties piled up fast.
On Oct. 8, barely two weeks after the battalion landed, it lost its first Marine, Lance Cpl. John T. Sparks. Five days later, four Marines of the battalion died when their armored truck was destroyed by a powerful bomb. Three more died the next day when they stepped on a mine during a foot patrol.
The rapid-fire deaths prompted calls in Washington for the battalion to pull back. But senior Marine commanders -- including the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Jason Morris -- prevailed on Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates to leave them in place.
''Everyone was shocked, including me, that we lost that many guys that quickly,'' Colonel Morris said. ''But honestly, me and most of my Marines would have rather come home in body bags than let the Taliban claim a victory.''
Deanna Giles, the mother of a squad leader from the battalion, remembers those days all too well. Amid the blur of casualty reports, Ms. Giles began watching for strange cars in her neighborhood in Kankakee, Ill., fearing the next one would bear horrible news.
Anxiously seeking information or solace, she took to Internet chat rooms, forming a powerful digital bond with other families from the battalion, whom she never met in person.
''You began to care about people in a way you could not have before the Internet age,'' Ms. Giles said.
Her son, Sgt. Caleb Giles, came home alive. Patty Schumacher's son, Lance Cpl. Victor A. Dew, did not.
Ms. Schumacher had begged her son to defer enlisting until the war ended. When he refused, she urged him to take a job with a presidential security detail. He again said no, determined to be an infantryman and to go to war.
''Boy, did my heart sink,'' she recalled. ''But I was also proud of him for following his true desires. As a parent you just suck it up, hold your heart and take a deep breath and hope all goes well.''
In late August 2010, Lance Corporal Dew proposed to his girlfriend, then was deployed a month later. Within weeks of arriving in Helmand, he died with three other Marines in a powerful I.E.D. blast. At age 20, he became the 1,259th American to die in the war.
Inside his coffin, his fiancée placed a photograph of herself, wearing her wedding gown.
Ms. Schumacher maintains a Facebook page to keep his memory fresh, and occasionally toasts him at dinner. She still cries, too, though the tears are hard to predict, prompted by stray images and fleeting sounds that remind her of him: a smile, a song, a joke.
''When do you get better? You don't ever get better,'' she said. ''You just get better in your grieving. There will always be something that triggers it. And then you are back on that emotional roller coaster.''
Attacks From Afghans
Staff Sgt. Scott E. Dickinson was coming home early. He was originally scheduled to remain in Helmand until November 2012, but the Pentagon was pulling Marines out of Afghanistan quickly, looking to get the surge forces out of the country by fall and shrink the American footprint to about 70,000 troops. He would be home in Hawaii within a week or two, he told his father early this month.
Not long after that conversation, his father, John Dickinson, saw an article about a soldier who had died just a week before he was to come home. ''I thought, 'He's not safe until he sets foot in Hawaii,' '' recalled Mr. Dickinson, an architect in San Diego.
He was right. Sergeant Dickinson, 29, a supply specialist who had volunteered to help train Afghan forces, died with Lance Corporal Buckley on Aug. 10. They were among six Marines killed that day in two separate attacks by men who appeared to be Afghan security force members.
The Pentagon asserts that most of those attacks have been the result of personal grudges, disputing Taliban claims to have widely infiltrated the Afghan security forces.
But the attacks have also raised anew concerns about the integrity of the Afghan forces that NATO expects to secure the entire nation after NATO troops withdraw in 2014.
More fundamentally, the continued deaths, occurring even as American forces are conducting fewer combat missions, have prompted service members and military families to wonder: has the decade-long American presence in Afghanistan made a difference?
Colonel Morris, the former commander for the Third Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment, has little doubt that it has. After months of fierce fighting, he saw clear changes when he left Sangin in early 2011. Those improvements remain, he asserts, with residents participating in elections and going to school with less fear of Taliban intimidation -- though such intimidation is far from gone.
''Every single Marine in my battalion could see the impact they had,'' he said. ''It was a validation of everything they had sacrificed for.''
Despite his son's death, Mr. Dickinson agrees. Marina Buckley is not so sure.
''He was the most lovable, caring human being,'' she said of her son. ''He wore his heart on his sleeve. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.''
He had wanted to join the Marine Corps ever since 9/11, despite her many attempts to dissuade him. By the time he was in high school a Marine Corps flag hung in his bedroom and her efforts to get him to go to college -- Adelphi University accepted him his senior year -- had failed.
''I'd say, 'Why the Marines?' '' she said, and he would reply with a joke. ''I can pick up a lot of chicks with that uniform,'' he would say.
But his ambition was serious: he wanted to serve, then become a Suffolk County police officer. He came to relish the brotherhood of the Marines and adored his first posting, in Hawaii. But deployment was different. The loneliness, the heat and the Meals Ready to Eat wore on him, Ms. Buckley said.
And he never felt secure living alongside Afghans, she said.
''If they want to kill themselves, let them,'' she said of the Afghan people. ''But they are killing people who shouldn't be killed, who have lives here, and family here, and brothers and sisters here.''

HEADLINE: A $650 Million Expansion of Port Newark Spurs Interest in Its Environs

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
In Newark's Ironbound district, a developer broke ground last month on a $50 million warehouse without a committed tenant -- a bold move and a sign of how much faith there is in the potential for growth in the state's industrial sector and specifically in its ports.Morris Companies, a developer based in Rutherford, N.J., is banking on the site's proximity to Port Newark, which is in the midst of a $650 million expansion, and to New York City to lure prospective tenants to the 337,000-square-foot facility that will be completed next year.
The Port of New York and New Jersey, the third-largest in the country, is a vital industry in the region, supporting nearly 280,0000 jobs. And developers say they believe it is poised for significant growth, thanks to an expansion of the Panama Canal that is scheduled to be done in 2015. The expansion will allow much larger ships to enter New York Harbor, carrying substantially more cargo. 
Because some of the additional goods coming off these so-called super-post-Panamax vessels will have to be distributed to the 100 million American consumers who live within a 24-hour drive of the port, and goods traveling to the ports may also need to be temporarily housed along the way, developers are hopeful that sites along New Jersey's roadways to the port will be primed to become distribution centers.
''This port is going to be hot. It's already hot, but it's going to get hotter,'' says Michael G. McGuinness, chief executive of the New Jersey chapter of the NAIOP, a commercial real estate trade group. ''Anybody that's in the industrial sector is probably in a good mood because they're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.''
To guarantee that the larger vessels will have enough clearance to enter the harbor, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has been dredging the harbor. The agency also plans to raise the roadway on the Bayonne Bridge, a $1 billion project that will begin next year. To prepare for the increased volume, port operators have been upgrading their facilities, like the $650 million expansion at Port Newark.
Expansion of the port will generate as many as 6,900 jobs a year throughout the region, according to a report by Anne Strauss-Wieder, a transportation consultant. The Morris development alone is expected to create about 200 permanent jobs. The new jobs may finally make a dent in New Jersey's unemployment rate, which was 9.8 percent in July, its highest level since 1977 and well above the national average of 8.3 percent.
Despite the changes on the horizon, the industrial real estate market is still recovering from the recession, and few developers have been optimistic enough to build speculative properties again. In the second quarter of 2012, the availability rate for industrial properties in New Jersey was 16 percent, down from its 2010 peak of 18 percent, but still a far cry from the prerecession rate of 11 percent, according to a report by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.
''It's definitely been a slow, very gradual recovery,'' said Mitchell B. Katz, a managing director at Newmark.
Companies, however, are moving into industrial space again. Amazon.com plans to build two one-million-square-foot distribution centers in New Jersey. And in an industrial park in Robbinsville, N.J., about an hour south of the port, the IDS Group recently moved into half of a one-million-square-foot facility that has been vacant since the now-defunct furniture company Seamans-Levitz shut its warehouse there in 2007.
The distribution center is so large it stretches for nearly a quarter-mile, visible from the New Jersey Turnpike. On a recent afternoon, IDS workers were assembling boxes, dwarfed by the vast ceilings. Another tenant, the Global Equipment Company, signed a lease for the remaining 500,000 square feet in March.
So far this year, the developer, the Matrix Development Group, has leased 2.5 million square feet of industrial warehouse space in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, a big improvement from 2011, when Matrix signed new leases for fewer than 500,000 square feet. Matrix manages a total of 10 million square feet of warehouse space, with tenants ranging from industrial suppliers to distributors of household goods. Despite the influx in new tenants this year, the company has yet to put a shovel in the ground again to create new space.
''We're waiting to see who's going to pull the trigger and go,'' said James R. Murray, a vice president at Matrix.
Close to the port, there are few large facilities like the Matrix properties. The vacancy rate for 500,000-square-foot warehouses near the port is less than 1 percent, according to Mr. Katz.
The Morris development in Newark is 15 minutes from the port. The development sits on a 17-acre lot with parking for 123 tractor-trailers and with a 40-door loading dock, and could bring a train line to the warehouse. The site also qualifies for the New Jersey Urban Transit Hub tax credit program.
Formerly a paint facility for Sherwin-Williams, the site had been contaminated. The company has nearly finished a $11.25 million environmental cleanup, clearing the way for construction. Morris is financing the $50 million project with a construction loan and expects to sign a tenant for the space before construction is complete.
''It's risky, but it's a sign of the ownership's confidence in the market,'' said Thomas F. Monahan, a broker at CBRE, which is marketing the property to port-related businesses and manufacturers looking for convenient access to the city.
At least one other developer is building a speculative industrial property. Woodmont Industrial Partners paid cash for a $13.25 million distribution center in Clinton, N.J., in January, and is renovating it in hopes of attracting a port-related tenant.
''We're feeling pretty comfortable that it won't be long before we find a tenant,'' said Eugene A. Preston, managing principal of Woodmont Industrial Partners. Woodmont Properties, a developer based in Fairfield, N.J., opened the industrial division last year to buy and redevelop industrial space in seaport markets.
The expansion at Port Newark is already under way. Port Newark Container Terminal, which operates the port, signed a 20-year lease with the Port Authority last year, and is expanding the port to 287 acres from 180 acres. As part of the deal, the Port Authority will invest $150 million in improvements.
Port Newark Container Terminal will spend $500 million expanding and upgrading the terminal, anticipating that its volume will grow by as much as 5 percent over the next decade. Cargo traveling through the port will more than double by 2030, according to Port Authority projections.
Already, the terminal has ordered new equipment and demolished warehouses along the port perimeter to make room for more containers. Earlier this month, newly paved ground was being painted and rows of containers were being moved into the new space. The company is also replacing its repair shop and office building.
James J. Pelliccio, president of Port Newark Container Terminal, said: ''We have to prepare for the path of growth.''

HEADLINE: Poker Is More a Game of Skill Than of Chance, a Judge Rules

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

 BODY:
The game was Texas Hold 'Em. About $300 bought a place at the table in the back room of a warehouse on Staten Island, where waitresses floated around with food and drinks and the play lasted until breakfast.The pot went not to the luckiest among them but to the most deft -- the player who could guess his opponents' intentions and disguise his own, make calculated decisions on when to hold and fold, and quickly decide how much to wager. That, anyhow, is how one federal judge saw it from his chambers in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn. 
In a ruling that goes to the heart of what it means to play poker, Judge Jack B. Weinstein tossed out the conviction and vacated the indictment of the man who ran that gambling business. The judge's reason: poker is more a game of skill than a game of chance, so game operators should not be prosecuted under the federal law the prohibits running an illegal gambling business.
''The most skillful professionals earn the same celestial salaries as professional ballplayers,'' he wrote in the exhaustive 120-page ruling that detailed the history of poker in the United States. The decision comes as state courts across the country are grappling with whether playing poker defies the law. No federal court had ever ruled directly on whether poker constituted gambling. The United States attorney's office, which was reviewing the decision, did not say whether it would appeal the case.
The Poker Player's Alliance, an organization that works to decriminalize poker and that filed an amicus brief in the case, released a statement lauding the decision.
''As we worked for years defending players against vague gambling laws, we have patiently waited for the right opportunity to raise the issue in federal court,'' John Pappas, the executive director of the organization, said in a statement. ''Today's federal court ruling is a major victory for the game of poker and the millions of Americans who enjoy playing it.''
Lawrence DiCristina ran the warehouse where the games took place -- that was not in dispute -- taking 5 percent of each night's pot to cover the cost of his staff and profit for himself. He was arrested last summer, charged with operating an illegal gambling business, of which he was convicted in July. He faced up to 10 years in prison.
But Mr. DiCristina's lawyer, Kannan Sundaram, a public defender, said poker was not a game of chance and therefore not subject to the law. He called an expert witness, Randal D. Heeb, an economist, statistician and poker player in national tournaments, who testified in a special hearing about the skill involved.
Judge Weinstein put off ruling on the issue until after the trial, allowing the jury to render its verdict first.

HEADLINE: Bargains From American Vines

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, I wrote about wines at the coveted intersection of high value and low price. I suggested that the greatest concentration of value, where you could find wines that were not merely palatable, but exciting, was in the $15 to $25 range. And I recommended 20 bottles at $20 that were the kinds of wines I would look forward to drinking any day of the week.Mostly, the reaction was favorable. But several readers were indignant. ''Only 3 out of 20 from North America?'' one wrote in an e-mail. ''Come on, Eric, we can do better than that.''
Finding good values in American wines is not easy. Unlike in the Old World, the wine industry in America did not evolve to make intriguing, inexpensive wines.
The United States does not have a centuries-old history of locally produced wines, so it cannot approach the sheer variety produced in Europe, where seemingly every valley has a local tradition of distinctive wines. When the American wine industry began in earnest in the 1960s, the imperative was national and even international. Grapes were selected on a desire to compete with the world's best and to sell to distant markets. 
That meant, as the midcentury thinking went, Bordeaux and white Burgundy, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. These grapes quickly became the dominant American models for red and white wines, the most popular and most expensive. Success dictated widespread imitation.
Other grapes have joined the cabernet and chardonnay group: pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and a few more. Still, it's a small group of wine types that encompasses the entire price range. Lower-end wines tended to mimic the more expensive models, and so were seldom distinctive and often pretentious. This extended even to zinfandel, once the epitome of good American value. As top versions became expensive, cheap zinfandels often became falsely plush and oaky in imitation, losing their fresh vibrancy.
Obviously, I'm overgeneralizing to make a point. Exceptions certainly exist, and things are changing for the better. A new generation of producers now sees beyond the verities of 40 years ago; consumers, exposed in the last 15 years to the wonderful diversity of the world's wines, are demanding more at home.
Here are 12 great American values, in no particular order, all $20 or less, all a pleasure to drink. Two are cabernet sauvignon, yes, and one chardonnay, one pinot noir and one merlot. But I also have a pinot grigio, a marsanne, a pinot blanc, two rieslings, a field blend and, perhaps surprisingly, a grignolino, one of those locally grown Italian grapes, which was planted in Napa long before cabernet became the dominant grape there. The Heitz family bought an eight-acre vineyard of grignolino in 1961 and has maintained it against all odds. It's that sort of stubborn adherence to tradition that makes for great wine values.
12 Great American Values, in No Particular Order
Palmina Santa Barbara County Pinot Grigio 2011, $17
Palmina is devoted to making wines from Italian grapes grown in Santa Barbara County. This pinot grigio is fuller-bodied than what might come from northeast Italy, but it's lively, vivacious, balanced and properly refreshing.
Qupé Santa Barbara County Marsanne 2011, $20
Bob Lindquist is one of the unsung heroes of California wine, and his Qupé label is consistently overlooked, possibly because he makes wines of little-known Rhône grapes like marsanne. This is actually a blend of two Rhône grapes, 79 percent marsanne and 21 percent roussanne. Pleasantly weighty and harmonious with persistent floral, nutlike flavors.
Au Bon Climat Santa Barbara County Chardonnay 2010, $20
While much of California has veered from making bombastic chardonnays to lean ''no oak'' versions, Jim Clendenen has stayed the course, making wines that are direct, restrained and balanced. The 2010 chardonnay is lively and inviting, smoky and spicy.
Lieb Family Cellars North Fork of Long Island Pinot Blanc 2009, $19
What is it about pinot blanc? It would be easy to dismiss this wine as nondescript, as it doesn't offer a cornucopia of fruity adjectives in a glass. Yet it is simply delicious: dry and creamy with lightly herbal, mineral flavors. The texture draws you in.
Hermann J. Wiemer Finger Lakes Dry Riesling 2011, $17
The label says ''Dry Riesling,'' but in fact it's slightly sweet, like an old-school German kabinett riesling from the days before global warming. Nonetheless, it's superb, with deep three-dimensional flavors, tangy and lightly fruity.
Ravines Finger Lakes Dry Riesling 2011, $15
A perfect contrast to the off-dry Hermann J. Wiemer style. The Ravines Dry Riesling is truly dry and intensely mineral, succulent and lip-smacking. A great house white.
Heitz Napa Valley Grignolino 2009, $20
Grignolino? From Napa Valley? While other producers have converted their Napa vineyards of esoteric grapes into more lucrative cabernet sauvignon, Heitz has held out and continues to make this ruby-colored red, bone dry with dark, spicy flavors and a refreshing bitterness.
Bonny Doon Vineyard Central Coast Contra Old Vine Field Blend 2009, $16
Contra is an old-style blend, reminiscent of the days when Italian immigrants planted multiple grapes side by side, harvesting and vinifying them together. This wine is 55 percent old-vine carignan, a scorned grape worthy of scorn when overcropped but winsome and perfumed when tended with care. This wine, which also has grenache, mourvèdre, zinfandel, petite sirah and syrah in the blend, is dry, fruity and harmonious with a streak of licorice.
Lenz North Fork of Long Island Merlot 2007, $15
I keep hearing that merlot is making a comeback. If more merlots tasted like Lenz's, perhaps it never would have left. The '07 is plummy, earthy and balanced, dry, lively and pleasing.
Montinore Estate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir 2010, $18
Once upon a time, American pinot noirs were known as bridge wines, perfect for restaurant dinners because they were versatile to bridge diverse dishes. Then a powerfully fruity style became popular, which won high ratings but obliterated the dinnertime harmony. The 2010 Montinore reverts to a time when pinot noir could be counted on as fresh, energetic and subtle.
Oberon Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2009, $18
How could good Napa Valley cabernet be this cheap? Prices for grapes in 2009, in the wake of the economic crisis, were down, and the Michael Mondavi family, which produces Oberon, is clever about finding good grapes at low prices. It also makes wines for drinking, not tasting. The '09 offers real Napa flavors and structure without the veneer of artifice that mars many low-cost cabernets. Subsequent vintages will cost more.
Broadside Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon Margarita Vineyard 2010, $20
Broadside teams up Chris Brockway of Broc Cellars, which produces excellent, restrained wines, and Brian Terrizzi of Giornata, which focuses on Italian grapes grown in California. This cabernet, from a single vineyard in a cooler southern part of Paso Robles, is animated by lively acidity and is made in a restrained style that nonetheless is insistently spicy and stony.

HEADLINE: A Politician Whose Faith Is Central to His Persistence

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Reporting was contributed by Monica Davey and Steven Yaccino in Chicago, Jonathan Weisman and Rebecca Berg in Washington, and Alain Delaquérière in New York.

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Throughout his political career, Representative Todd Akin's agenda has been driven by a belief that his mission came from God.As a Republican member of Congress, he has sponsored legislation to name 2008 ''The National Year of the Bible,'' and to promote greater recognition of the Ten Commandments. A member of the Presbyterian Church in America, Mr. Akin has accused liberals of trying to remove God from the public sphere. And as the Republican establishment closed ranks on him Tuesday, trying to force him to withdraw from the Missouri Senate race after his controversial remarks about rape and abortion, Mr. Akin provided divine reasoning as to why he would not quit.
It was ''appropriate to recognize a creator, God, whose blessings of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is the very source of American freedom,'' Mr. Akin, 65, said in a radio interview. ''And that part of the message I feel is missing'' from the campaign, he said, adding, ''That's the reason why we're going to continue. Because I believe there is a cause here.'' 
Mr. Akin's defiance and insistence that even without the establishment's support, he can defeat the incumbent Democrat, Senator Claire McCaskill, in a race that could decide the balance of power in the Senate was indicative of his nearly quarter-century in politics in which he regularly embraced the underdog role, relying on grass-roots support and his faith to power him through.
Outspoken and blunt -- too blunt, some might say -- Mr. Akin, 65, is no stranger to incendiary comments. He has criticized federal spending on things like school lunches and student loans and has been quick to equate government spending to socialism.
'' 'God called me to run' -- that's the way he thinks,'' said Jeff Smith, a former Democratic state senator in Missouri, said of Mr. Akin, a six-term congressman who represents parts of eastern Missouri. ''I think he thinks it's his destiny, and so you're going to have to get somebody pretty high up there -- or, in his mind, pretty close to God -- to push him out.''
Before Sunday, Mr. Akin was favored to defeat Ms. McCaskill. But then a Fox affiliate in St. Louis showed an interview in which he said that women possess a biological mechanism to ward off pregnancy if they become victims of ''legitimate rape.'' Major donors responded by saying they would cut off Mr. Akin's financing. Prominent national Republican officials have asked him to drop out of the race, fearing he could not win.
Mr. Akin was first elected to the Missouri House in 1988 and much of his base in his early years as a legislator came from being a part of a network of parents who home-schooled their children. All six of his children were home-schooled. His election to Congress in 2000 was a stroke of good fortune, local political analysts said. He was seen as an outside candidate in a five-way Republican primary that he won by 56 votes, in part because the more moderate candidates cut into each other's tally.
In the three-person Republican Senate primary this year, Mr. Akin also was not favored, yet he won in part because Ms. McCaskill and her supporters spent nearly $2 million on advertisements highlighting his conservatism. This was part of the McCaskill camp's strategy to help Mr. Akin win the race, as it thought he would be the easiest candidate to beat in the general election.
William Todd Akin was born in New York on July 5, 1947, but grew up in St. Louis, near where his family had a steel business. He is, in some ways, an enigma.
While he home-schooled all of his children and is appealing mostly to a working-class constituency, he graduated from an elite suburban St. Louis prep school, John Burroughs. He got a degree in engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute before earning a master's in divinity from the Covenant Theological Seminary in Missouri.
He worked as a manager at now-bankrupt Laclede Steel, the company his great-grandfather founded and served at as president, succeeded by Mr. Akin's grandfather and father. Mr. Akin's great-grandfather, grandfather and father all attended Harvard.
Mr. Akin chose a different career path, one influenced by his faith.
Rick Mathes, of the Mission Gate Prison Ministry, where Mr. Akin serves on the advisory board, said that Mr. Akin's beliefs drive his political approaches and work. ''He wouldn't violate his beliefs if you shot him,'' said Mr. Mathes, who added that he and Mr. Akin, who participates in Bible studies and prayer groups, were ''far to the right'' of people like Rush Limbaugh.
Mr. Akin, said Mr. Mathes, believed that ''America needs to be returned to its roots, its Judeo-Christian roots.''
Yet officials worry that though Mr. Akin has had success speaking to an evangelical constituency, he would struggle in appealing to diverse groups of voters.
But Jonathan Sternberg, a state Republican committee member, said he was drawn to Mr. Akin by his well-spoken, common-sense economic approach. At one event, Mr. Akin spoke of how he had to tell President George W. Bush that he could not vote for education, Medicare and bailout bills that the Mr. Bush asked him to support because of their budgetary implications.
Still, he acknowledged that Mr. Akin's mouth could sometimes get him into trouble. ''Todd Akin works so hard and tears himself so ragged,'' Mr. Sternberg said, ''that he has the propensity to say things without thinking.''

HEADLINE: A Developer Versus the Gods

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Neha Thirani contributed reporting from Mumbai.

 BODY:
MANALI, India -- To John Sims, the Himalayas, with some of the finest mountain slopes in the world, seemed like the perfect place to build India's first Western-style ski resort.But he got his first clue about the uphill challenge he faced when the local gods -- or at least the holy men who claimed to speak for them -- came out against his project here.
In the seven years since, Mr. Sims, an American hotel developer with years of experience working in India, has encountered seemingly endless setbacks.
Some opponents claimed falsely that the 115-acre project would take over the entire valley. Others complained that the developers had underpaid landowners for their property. The state of Himachal Pradesh, which had once championed the $500 million proposal, moved to scrap it after a different political party took over. Now, a court has allowed it to go forward but has given the developers just six months to secure environmental permits from a government that has repeatedly stalled the project. 
''My fundamental complaint is only this: Why did you invite us?'' Mr. Sims said. ''Why did you take our deposit? Why did you encourage us to spend money and then make a 180-degree turn?''
It is not easy for any company to do business in India, with its mercurial and ponderous decision-making, creaky court system and woeful infrastructure. Witness the immense blackouts of late July, in which the electric grids serving half of the country's population collapsed under the strain of the hot summer and too few power plants. The World Bank ranks India 166th out of 183 economies in the ease of starting a business.
But the story of the Himalayan Ski Village shows the particular difficulties faced by foreign companies.
Indians have a deep-seated distrust of overseas businesses, rooted in more than two centuries of exploitation by the British. For many years after gaining independence in 1947, India restricted trade and foreign investment, nationalized industries like banking and gave licenses to favored domestic conglomerates. In the 1970s, socialist leaders pushed companies like Coca-Cola and I.B.M. out of the country.
After the government began loosening restrictions two decades ago, foreign firms piled into India, and many had great success. The Japanese company Suzuki, for instance, controls nearly half of the domestic car market. But India remains an unpredictable, even hostile, place for many foreign companies.
Parliament passed a retroactive capital gains tax this year on offshore transactions involving Indian assets, overriding a Supreme Court ruling favoring foreign firms. And last year, policy makers deferred a decision to allow foreign mass retailers like Walmart into the country after opposition politicians and shopkeepers protested, even though Indian companies are allowed to build similar stores.
Foreign direct investment was strong last year. But in the first six months of this year, it fell to $16.5 billion, down 18 percent compared to the same period in 2011, according to the Reserve Bank of India.
Some multinational companies have lost patience. Etisalat, a telecom company based in the United Arab Emirates; Eni, the Italian energy giant; and Fraport, a German airport developer, are either withdrawing from India or are said to be considering such a move because of delays and erratic policy changes.
''For foreign investors, a stable and predictable policy environment, along with dependable legal and political institutions, are key considerations in addition to market size and growth potential,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and the Brookings Institution who has advised the Indian government. ''Policy reversals and domestic power plays that turn foreign-financed projects into political footballs are likely to further dampen confidence among foreign investors.''
India's economy is slowing sharply and becoming even more reliant on foreign capital. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has become concerned enough about the disaffection that he has pledged more friendly policies.
Mr. Sims, 60, said any help would be welcome.
He first came to India in 1975 as a follower of the Hare Krishna movement, and still wears a string of Indian prayer beads around his neck. He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit and cut his teeth developing resorts in Key West, Fla. Later, he was a consultant to the Oberoi Group, an Indian hotel chain, among others.
About a decade ago, with the backing of investors like Alfred Ford, a great-grandson of Henry Ford, Mr. Sims set his sights on building a ski resort like Vail or Davos. The handful of existing resorts in India were hard to reach and had few amenities, so there was little competition.
Manali has long been a tourist destination for Indians, but most of the foreigners it draws are backpackers. There are no five-star hotels, and the roads are lined with small shops that sell tea and rent out winter coats.
The resort investors found a seemingly ideal site: a hilltop studded with fir trees, accessible only by a steep, winding path. Though nobody lives on the spot year-round, villagers grow kidney beans and potatoes and graze their cows there. From three sides, there is a breathtaking view of the Kullu Valley, and the fourth side backs up to a mountain on which Mr. Sims planned to build a ski lift that would climb to 14,000 feet.
''It's just about as spectacular as you can get,'' he said after an hourlong hike to the hilltop.
Though the location is a 10-hour drive from the nearest major airport, Mr. Sims was optimistic about creating a winter wonderland. After a gondola ride up to the car-free village, visitors would find luxury hotels, a crafts bazaar, an ice rink and the ski lift.
Himachal Pradesh, then governed by the Indian National Congress party, supported the project at first, agreeing to lease Mr. Sims forest land for skiing and to exempt him from a law that restricts land ownership.
The Ski Village would create 4,000 jobs, Mr. Sims said, and bring hotels like the luxurious Six Senses Resorts and Spas to the valley. Many local residents, especially those involved in skiing, river rafting and other sports, supported the project.
But other residents were apprehensive. Some said lewd, loud Westerners would defile the area, known as ''the valley of the gods'' because many Hindu deities are said to reside here.
The main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, argued that the Indian National Congress had not paid enough attention to local concerns. One B.J.P. politician organized a meeting of the holy men, who said the deities opposed the project.
''We are not against development,'' said Govind Singh Thakur, a B.J.P. leader who represents the area in the state legislature. ''As long as the people's issues are sorted out, they are welcome to come here.''
One landowner, Geeta Devi Katoch, said many people were angry when they learned that the developers had quietly bought some early parcels of land for one-third the price that prevailed once people learned of the project. She said her family, which grazes cows on the hilltop, would not sell. ''This land is all we have,'' she said. ''What will we do if we sell?''
Mr. Sims and his partners acknowledged that some land deals were struck at lower prices -- something they now say could have been handled better -- but said that those prices were reached through negotiations. They added that they offered local residents training and jobs, and even sent 60 young people to Finland for skiing lessons.
Once the B.J.P. came to power, the state appointed a committee to review the proposal. But before the committee made a recommendation, court documents show, the state moved to cancel its agreements with the Ski Village, arguing that the company had not moved fast enough to start the project.
In June, the Himachal Pradesh High Court ruled that the project could go forward and gave Mr. Sims six months to obtain environmental approvals. But the environmental agencies are not obligated to review his application quickly, and the state has vowed to appeal the court decision. The political situation might also change later this year, when state voters go to the polls.
Mr. Sims said he was no longer hopeful and felt that the odds were stacked against outsiders.
''People who do love India or who could easily love India would be very happy to contribute their talents and money,'' he said. But ''it's the robber baron era -- only those strong Indian businessmen who know how to play the game can succeed.''

HEADLINE: Rising Rents Create a Demand For Manhattan Walk-Up Buildings

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
The Benchmark Real Estate Group acquired the 22-unit walk-up building at 156 Sullivan Street in SoHo for just over $6 million last year. It is now in contract to sell the rental building for $12.5 million.''When we bought it, the rent rolls were about $300,000, but after renovating the apartments and pushing up rents, it is now generating $1 million,'' said Jordan D. Vogel, co-founder of the company with Aaron Feldman.
Benchmark is pursuing an increasingly popular strategy in New York City's investment sales market: the acquisition of small walk-up buildings across Manhattan. While walk-ups have never been the most glamorous buildings in the city, demand for and sales of these buildings have reached new highs recently.
There were 71 sales of walk-up buildings in Manhattan in the second quarter of this year, compared with just 33 in the second quarter of 2009, according to data from the brokerage firm Eastern Consolidated. In the first half of this year, sales volume for these multifamily properties reached nearly $640 million, a 205 percent increase from the $210 million reached in the first half of 2009. 
The popularity and rising prices of walk-ups are owed in no small part to Manhattan's incredibly tight rental market. Rents have been surging for the last several years as New Yorkers remain skittish about buying homes and mortgages remain difficult to obtain. In June, for example, the average rent was $3,443 a month, according to Citi Habitats, the highest figure since the firm began tracking data in 2002.
With rents rising, the fact that many Manhattan walk-up buildings have tenants with rent-regulated apartments offers landlords the possibility of a very large increase in profits when these units are deregulated and shift to market rates. There is also upside potential to raise rents in the market rate units if landlords renovate a walk-up building, many of which have not been modernized in decades.
There are about 40,000 rent-controlled and one million rent-stabilized units in New York City, with complex rules regulating them. In the case of rent stabilization, the leases can be renewed and the rent increased at a rate determined annually by the city's Rent Guidelines Board.
In some cases, rent-regulated apartments can be deregulated when a tenant dies, and landlords are not reluctant to gauge a building's prospects by taking note of tenants' ages, said Adelaide Polsinelli, a senior director at Eastern Consolidated. ''A landlord will look at a building and if it has, say, 100 units and 30 of them are occupied by tenants who are in their 50s or 60s, they know the end could be in sight,'' she said.
Lenders, who remain risk-averse in this economy, like buildings with rent-regulated units because ''the rents are already the worst-case scenario,'' Ms. Polsinelli said. She added that mortgage rates for these properties can be as low as 2.9 or 3 percent, compared with as much as 5 percent for offices and 8 percent for new development. She has brokered several of these deals in the last year, including last month, when she represented the seller of two five-story walk-up buildings at 521 and 523 East 12th Street for $10.9 million.
Many of Manhattan's walk-up buildings are also ripe for renovation, work that could allow for substantial rent increases, even among market rate apartments. The Silverstone Property Group, for example, recently acquired two buildings at 162 and 164 East 82nd Street and is completely renovating the common areas and the market rate units to increase the rent rolls.
''We think that there are a lot of potential tenants who are coming out of high-end rental buildings with doormen and elevators that are looking for a similar feel but at a more affordable price,'' said Martin Nussbaum, the company's founder.
To capture this market, Silverstone is renovating the 82nd Street buildings with marble tile, crown moldings, sophisticated intercom systems and amenities like a basement laundry room and gym. It is also upgrading plumbing and electrical work, and providing market rate units with stainless steel appliances and recessed lighting.
''It is very capital-intensive for the first two years or so. Then, hopefully, we will see a significant increase in rent,'' Mr. Nussbaum said, adding that he acquires only buildings that have a minimum of 50 percent free-market apartments and where the leases are to expire within a year of acquisition.
Another reason that investors like buying walk-up buildings is that they ''operate more efficiently and at a lower expense level than an elevator building, while the market rents are not that much less,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman and chief executive of Eastern Consolidated. According to Citi Habitats, a one-bedroom in a walk-up building in Manhattan rented for an average of $2,602 in July, $366 less than a similar size unit in an elevator building.
Buying a walk-up can also be a better alternative than acquiring a small office building, Mr. Hauspurg said. In an office building, the landlord has to provide a new tenant with tenant improvement allowances, pay the brokerage fee, offer some free rent, ''and then if the small business went out of business, you have to replace the tenant with all the same expenditures,'' he said.
In a walk-up rental building, on the other hand, ''there is no brokerage fee because the tenant pays it and no down time because any apartment will rent within 30 days if it is priced right.''
But acquiring walk-up rentals in Manhattan can be very difficult right now because of fierce competition among buyers. ''I have toured 240 properties, made offers on 80 and bought only 16, so my batting average is terrible,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Today there is a plethora of buyers, debt is at its all-time low in terms of rates and it is hard to find deals.''
Michael Forrest, the chief executive of Forrest Partners, started his company in 2007 but has not made an acquisition since 2009. ''I was waiting to see if there was going to be any discounts or deals during the recession, but I never really saw pricing drop, so I sat on the sidelines,'' he said. ''I didn't want to be the guy who bought a property and six months later the prices bottom out.''
Forrest Partners owns six buildings on the Lower East Side with a total of 100 apartments and nine stores, ''and if I want to buy more, I realize I'm going to have to pay up,'' he said.
While interest rates are low, banks are requiring investors to put significant equity into deals. At 156 Sullivan Street, for example, Benchmark invested $8.2 million to acquire the building and complete the renovations, but the bank financed only $2.9 million of that total, Mr. Vogel said.
''In 2007, you would have done that deal and put in just $500,000 of equity,'' he said, adding that in the three years since the company was founded, Benchmark has invested $75 million in equity to acquire and renovate its portfolio of 16 properties.
Still, investors are crowding into this market. ''It is an extension of the enormous capital that wants to be in Manhattan; I have never seen such a flood as in the last few years,'' said Mr. Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated. ''Buying a walk-up building is a way for new investors to dip their toe in the pond without spending hundreds of millions of dollars and still get something with a lot of upside and not much downside.''

HEADLINE: Deciding Whether to Medicate a Child

 BODY:
To the Editor:Re ''Raising the Ritalin Generation,'' by Bronwen Hruska (Sunday Review, Aug. 19):
Inaccurate diagnosis is not limited to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In evaluating children with behavioral or emotional problems, we sometimes forget that youngsters may experience intense unhappiness, sadness, worry and anger that are an appropriate, understandable response to the reality of their lives.
These states are frequently mislabeled as specific psychiatric disorders. Unhappiness is diagnosed as depression; realistic worry as anxiety; understandable anger as bipolar disorder; and nonspecific nervousness as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
The overmedicalization of the problems of children is likely to result in frequent misdiagnosis. Behavioral problems that result from interpersonal difficulties and/or generalized nonspecific reactions to stress, loss, separation, abuse, neglect or adjustment to significant changes in a child's life are labeled major psychiatric disorders, leading to unnecessary use of psychiatric medications.

The writer is a child and adolescent psychiatrist.
To the Editor:
It's terrific that Bronwen Hruska's son is on the honor roll at school and has learned how to ''get organized'' without the help of stimulants. But as the parent of a 17-year-old who cannot focus long enough to read a book without these medications, I deeply resent the implication that we parents are all overreacting to simple immaturity.
Of course, these medications, like so many others, are sometimes misused and overprescribed. But let's have compassion for those children who are helped by drugs like Ritalin.
MARTHA SOUTHGATE Brooklyn, Aug. 19, 2012
To the Editor:
In America, 4 percent of the world's population uses 88 percent of the Ritalin produced worldwide. Among the many factors contributing to our fixation on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Ritalin, two stand out. The first is economic: our nation's continuing relative decline among world players and the growing gap between the 99 and 1 percent. The second is our worry, perhaps excessive, about our children's feelings if they are ''below average.''
The fears about our children and their futures have led to an intolerance of differences or diversity in children's temperaments and talents. Several years ago I predicted that I might have to medicate ''the last normal child.'' Apparently, according to Bronwen Hruska, Manhattan may have gotten there first.
LAWRENCE DILLER Walnut Creek, Calif., Aug. 19, 2012
The writer is a doctor with a behavioral/developmental pediatric practice.
To the Editor:
The dilemma Bronwen Hruska describes -- whether or not to medicate an active child -- is all too common for parents. I applaud the choice she made.
Current theories of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder recognize that symptoms arise from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, but treatment focuses entirely on the individual. Rigorous studies suggest an incidence of about 4 percent. As Ms. Hruska notes, actual diagnostic rates are double that, and more and more children are recruited for treatment every year.
The psychiatric industry argues that this surge in diagnosis stems from better recognition and treatment. One may also suggest that medical fashion and aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies play a role.
Perhaps the best place to look, however, is the educational environment, which has established norms for social compliance, physical passivity, rote learning and an absence of outlets for creative expression that are inhospitable to bright, active children. Decades from now we will look back at our practice of drugging children into compliance and passivity as a national disgrace.

HEADLINE: Islands Reflect Japanese Fear Of China's Rise

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
ISHIGAKI, Japan -- When the flotilla of 21 fishing boats arrived at an island chain at the center of a growing territorial dispute with China, the captains warned the dozens of activists and politicians aboard not to attempt a landing.
Ten of the activists jumped into the shark-infested waters anyway, swimming ashore on Sunday and planting the rising sun flag that evokes painful memories of Imperial Japan's 20th-century march across Asia.
''We feel that they dragged us into an international incident,'' said Masanori Tamashiro, one of the boat captains.
That feeling is widely shared in Japan, where a small number of nationalists has pushed the country to assert itself more boldly to counter China's and South Korea's economic rise and China's quickly evolving territorial ambitions. The conflict with China has raised the specter that the United States, Japan's longtime defender, could be pulled into the fight. 
The nationalists have gained traction for their cause in recent months by taking advantage of the government's political weakness, forcing the governing party to take a tougher stand on the islands west of here, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.
But the activists are also tapping into a widespread anxiety over China, which intensified two years ago during the last major flare-up over the Senkakus. China retaliated then for Japan's arrest of a fishing captain by starving Japan of the rare earths needed for its already struggling electronics industry. That anxiety became more pronounced in recent months as China expanded its claims in the nearby South China Sea, challenging Vietnam, the Philippines and others over more than 40 islands in a vast area, and backing its statements with aggressive moves that included sending larger patrol boats to disputed waters.
There is still little appetite in pacifist Japan for a full-blown confrontation with China. But analysts say consensus is growing on the need to stand up to China as power in the region appears to slip further from economically fading Japan and the United States.
''We are all gearing up for an international tug of war in this region,'' said Narushige Michishita, an expert on security issues at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. ''Whenever the distribution of power changes in a dramatic way, people start to redraw lines.''
That is precisely what is happening in the South China Sea, which has received more international attention than Japan's territorial battles. But experts say the increasingly shrill war of words over disputed islands between Japan and its East Asian neighbors, including China and South Korea, is potentially more explosive. Unlike in the South China Sea, where the frictions center on competition for natural resources, the East Asian island disputes are more about history, rooted in lingering -- and easily ignited -- anger over Japan's brutal dominance decades ago.
Those raw emotions were loosed over the weekend, as hundreds and possibly thousands of Chinese -- in protests that were at least tolerated by the government -- poured into the streets in several cities to denounce Japan's claims over the Senkakus.
''The stakes are much higher in East Asia because you have bigger countries in close proximity, and the conflicts are more direct and emotional,'' said Kent Calder, director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
The ramifications for the United States are also potentially more troubling, analysts said. The United States has been urging Japan and South Korea to pick up more of the burden of defending against China and North Korea, but the countries' latest standoff over islets that sit between them, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korean, contributed to South Korea's decision to back out of an agreement to share military intelligence with Japan.
An even bigger, though remote, risk for the United States, some analysts said, is that it could be dragged into an armed conflict between China and Japan, which it is obligated by treaty to defend.
''There is a real possibility that if diplomacy fails, there will be a war,'' said Kazuhiko Togo, a former career Japanese diplomat who has written on the island issues.
The current row between Japan and China was started by Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, a longtime and outspoken advocate of conservative issues. Last spring, he said he wanted Tokyo to buy the islands from their current owner, a Japanese citizen, to better defend them from China. Under pressure not to look weak in advance of elections, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda quickly said the central government would buy the islands instead.
That set off a tit-for-tat between activists from both countries. First, seven Hong Kong activists landed last week on Uotori, the largest of the disputed islands, and were among 14 Chinese arrested by Japan and quickly deported. Japanese nationalists retaliated with their landing on the same island on Sunday. (In a sign of how small the circle of Japanese activists is, one of the eight national lawmakers who joined the flotilla, Eriko Yamatani of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, was also part of a recent episode that helped set off the latest battle between South Korea and Japan over their disputed islands.)
That flotilla left from here, on Ishigaki island, on the southern edge of the Okinawa chain about 80 miles from the Senkakus.
Yoshiyuki Toita, a 42-year-old member of Ishigaki's city assembly, was one of the few local residents who joined the expedition. ''Japan has come to the point that it must change,'' Mr. Toita said. ''The era of just depending on the United States is over.''
Even so, Mr. Toita agreed with mainstream opinion that Japan should cleave more closely to the United States.
Still, the government has taken at least some actions to show its own willingness to push back at China, most notably redrawing its national defense strategy, which had once focused on the Soviet Union in the north, but now will concentrate on protecting against China in the south. An opinion poll last October conducted by the prime minister's office showed a growing wariness, with more than 70 percent of Japanese saying they do not have ''friendly feelings'' toward China.
Such sentiments have even made inroads here in Ishigaki, a part of Okinawa, where a deep pacifism was born of the anger at the Japanese Imperial Army's forcing of civilians to commit suicide during World War II, as well as the heavy American troop presence after the war.
As Chinese warships and patrol boats have become a more frequent sight near here, some islanders have begun to speak out more in support of the American and Japanese militaries, even as sentiment against United States bases remains strong.
Since the events of two years ago when China cut off supplies of rare earths, Ishigaki's mayor, Yoshitaka Nakayama, began flying the rising sun flag in front of City Hall for the first time since World War II.
At the same time, said Mr. Nakayama, 45, he values his island's growing trade and tourism links to the Chinese-speaking world, especially Taiwan, which also stakes a claim to the Senkakus.
Mr. Tamashiro, the fishing boat captain, expressed similar conflicted feelings, even as he has begun taking more activists to see the islands. ''Basically, fishermen don't want the politics to disrupt their livelihoods,'' Mr. Tamashiro said. But at $4,500 per boat charter, he said, going to the Senkakus ''is not bad money.''

HEADLINE: Ignoring Deadline to Quit, G.O.P. Senate Candidate Defies His Party Leaders: Unexpected Twist in the Election Campaigns

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Pam Belluck and Michael Cooper contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As an orator, Representative Todd Akin of Missouri may stand out for his clumsiness. But as a legislator, Mr. Akin has a record on abortion that is largely indistinguishable from those of most of his Republican House colleagues, who have viewed restricting abortion rights as one of their top priorities.That agenda -- largely eclipsed for two years by a protracted fiscal crisis and the fight over how to manage the federal deficit -- has wedged its way, for now at least, to the center of the 2012 campaign. It is focusing attention on an issue that helped earn Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, a reputation as a flip-flopper, threatening the Republican quest for control of the Senate, and leaving Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Romney's vice-presidential pick, in the uncomfortable position of distinguishing himself from Mr. Akin, with whom he has often concurred. 
It is an agenda that has enjoyed the support of House leaders, including Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, who has called anti-abortion measures ''obviously very important in terms of the priorities we set out initially in our pledge to America.'' It became inextricably linked to the near-shutdown of the federal government last year when an agreement to keep the government open was reached only after it was linked to a measure restricting abortion in the District of Columbia.
Even as Congressional Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, denounced Mr. Akin's remark that victims of ''legitimate rape'' were able to somehow prevent pregnancy, an agenda to roll back abortion is one that House Republicans have largely moved in step with.
In an anti-abortion measure once sponsored by Mr. Akin, Mr. Ryan and scores of other Republican lawmakers, an exemption was made for victims of ''forcible'' rape, though that word was later removed.
On Tuesday, Republicans approved platform language for next week's nominating convention that calls for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion with no explicit exceptions for cases of rape or incest. That is a view more restrictive than Mr. Romney's, who has said that he supports exceptions to allow abortions in cases of rape.
Mr. Ryan's more conservative views, which have been reflected in votes that would restrict family planning financing overseas, cut off all federal funds to Planned Parenthood and repeal President Obama's health care law, have come into sharp relief as Mr. Akin struggles for his political life. Mr. Akin and Mr. Ryan each have voted in this Congress for 10 abortion-restricting measures as well as those that limited other family planning services.
Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney have earned praise for their positions from the National Right to Life group and other anti-abortion organizations. ''The right-to-life Romney/Ryan ticket is now complete,'' wrote Barbara Lyons and Sue Armacost, executive director and legislative director for Wisconsin Right to Life, on the organization's Web site.
It is a legislative theme Democrats plan to highlight, even as House Republicans try to keep the focus on economic issues.
''All you need to know is that the House Republicans were willing to shut down the government rather than fund Planned Parenthood,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, in an e-mail on Tuesday. ''This is in keeping with their efforts -- whether it's Congressman Akin or Chairman Ryan or others -- to deny investments in critical women's health services, weaken the definition of rape, and take away access to preventive care like cervical and breast cancer screenings.''
The House Republican agenda has troubled the half-dozen or so Republican House members whose views differ from those of their colleagues.
''I have time and again spoken out against this to leadership,'' said Representative Robert Dold of Illinois, who is in a tough re-election battle. ''I've tried to talk to them about the issues that we ought to be moving forward on, like out-of-control spending.''
Mr. Dold has voted in favor of half of the abortion restriction measures in this Congress, far fewer than most of his colleagues. ''There is no question that there are times when I may disagree with a vote that's brought to the floor,'' he said in an interview, ''and the majority of my Republican colleagues, but that is just part of what we deal with every day.''
There have long been lawmakers, like Mr. Akin, whose main legislative agenda centers on the abortion issue. They got a boost after the 2010 election when a large group of conservative members joined them.
Mr. Romney's views align with that of the Mormon Church, which opposes abortion except in cases of rape and incest or when the life of the woman is in danger. He has said he is personally opposed to abortion; as a Mormon bishop in the 1980s he attempted to talk a congregant out of terminating a pregnancy after doctors advised her to do so because of a potentially lethal blood clot.
But abortion has proved to be a politically volatile topic for Mr. Romney, whose evolving views have disappointed liberals and stirred distrust among conservatives.
In 1994, when he challenged Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Mr. Romney said he would ''not force our beliefs on others on that matter.'' In 2002, as a candidate for governor, he claimed to support ''the substance'' of Roe v. Wade. By 2005, though, when he was beginning to consider a presidential run, he had reversed course and described himself as a ''pro-life governor in a pro-choice state.'' Now, as a presidential candidate, he refers to himself as solidly ''pro-life.''
Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that ''this is the platform of the Republican Party; it is not the platform of Mitt Romney.''
The idea of outlawing any exceptions for abortion is not new in American political discourse or in legislation, nor are proposals to narrow the definition of rape to distinguish between what some call ''forcible rape'' and cases involving statutory rape or even some types of date rape. Anti-abortion activists have long been concerned that women would falsely claim to have been raped to gain an exemption to terminate a pregnancy.
Historians and other experts on abortion politics say the no-exceptions idea became part of the debate virtually as soon as Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in 1973. ''It has deep roots,'' said Donald Critchlow, a historian at Arizona State University who has studied abortion politics. He added, ''It's appealing to segments within the Republican Party to show that you're pro-life.''
Susan Cohen, director of government affairs for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group in Washington that supports abortion rights, said the no-exceptions idea is ''not new and it's not fringe.''
''It is something that has been part of mainstream anti-abortion movement,'' she said. ''The record is replete with evidence of the fact that there was this no-exceptions attitude, and of course this makes logical sense from the perspective of people who believe an embryo should have the same legal status as you and I do.''
In the 1992 election, the Republican Party included in its platform language opposing abortion, allowing no exceptions and calling for a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal. Similar language opposing any exceptions was included in 2000 and 2004, even though George W. Bush also supported outlawing abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman was in danger.
Four years ago, the Republican Party adopted a platform seeking an unconditional ban on abortion, though its nominee, Senator John McCain, had urged the party in the past to allow certain exceptions. After this year's abortion plank language was approved with little debate, the chairman of the platform committee, Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, praised the committee for ''affirming our respect for human life.''

HEADLINE: Ethiopian Leader's Death Highlights Gap Between U.S. Interests and Ideals

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Josh Kron contributed reporting from Kampala, Uganda, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
LIBREVILLE, Gabon -- There was probably no leader on the African continent who exemplified the conflict between the American government's interests and its highest ideals better than Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia.Mr. Meles, who died on Monday after more than 20 years in power, played the American battle against terrorism brilliantly, painting Ethiopia, a country with a long and storied Christian history, as being on the front lines against Islamist extremism. He extracted prized intelligence, serious diplomatic support and millions of dollars in aid from the United States in exchange for his cooperation against militants in the volatile Horn of Africa, an area of prime concern for Washington.
But he was notoriously repressive, undermining President Obama's maxim that ''Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.''
Mr. Meles was undoubtedly a strongman. Despite being one of the United States' closest allies on the continent, Mr. Meles repeatedly jailed dissidents and journalists, intimidated opponents and their supporters to win mind-bogglingly one-sided elections, and oversaw brutal campaigns in restive areas of the country where the Ethiopian military has raped and killed many civilians. 
No matter that Ethiopia receives more than $800 million in American aid annually. Mr. Meles even went as far as jamming the signal of Voice of America because he did not like its broadcasts. Human rights groups have been urging the United States to cut aid to Ethiopia for years.
So now that he is gone, will the gap between American strategic and ideological goals narrow at all in this complex, pivotal country?
''There is an opportunity here,'' said Leslie Lefkow, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. ''If donors are shrewd, they will use the opportunity that this presents to push a much stronger and bolder human rights stance and need for reform.''
Most analysts do not expect any sudden moves, however. After Mr. Meles's death, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton praised his ''personal commitment'' to lifting Ethiopia's economy and ''his role in promoting peace and security in the region.'' But she made no mention of his rights record and gave only a veiled reference to supporting ''democracy and human rights'' in Ethiopia. She also made it clear that the interest in ''regional security'' had not changed.
One senior American official said Tuesday that ''this does not affect policy in the short term,'' but he added that ''there are a number of unknowns.''
One relative unknown is the man now picked to lead the second-largest country in Africa, Hailemariam Desalegn, who was the foreign minister, deputy prime minister and a Meles acolyte. Though he is from a different ethnic group, the Welayta, he is believed to be a safe choice to protect the interests of Mr. Meles's Tigrayan minority, which has dominated the Ethiopian economy and political scene since 1991, leading many other ethnic groups to complain about being boxed out and some even to take up arms.
Dan Connell, an American author and professor, interviewed Mr. Meles in June and said it sounded as if he was preparing to die. ''He seemed focused on wrapping up a number of major projects as if he were aware the end was near,'' Mr. Connell said.
The projects included the modernization of the country's road network and building big dams; pushing large-scale foreign investment in agriculture (which many rights groups say threatens fragile indigenous groups); and trying to wrap up the war with Eritrea, once a province of Ethiopia that broke away and declared independence in the 1990s.
''Meles knew his days were numbered,'' Mr. Connell said.
It is hard to overstate Ethiopia's role in the region -- it was never a colony, after all, though it was briefly occupied by the Italians -- and the respect Mr. Meles carried around the continent.
''Whether one was a friend or critic of Mr. Meles,'' said Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary for African affairs at the State Department, ''the consensus around Africa is that Africa has lost one of its greatest intellectual leaders.'' Mr. Carson added that ''no question there was a need for greater democratization'' and ''yes, more work needs to be done in that area.''
Recently, Mr. Meles had been pushing the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan to make peace. On Tuesday, the government of South Sudan declared three days of mourning, with flags flown at half-staff. ''His actions will be missed,'' said Barnaba Marial Benjamin, spokesman for the South Sudanese government.
Ethiopia is hardly alone in raising difficult questions on how the United States should balance interests and principles.
Saudi Arabia is an obvious example, a country where women are deprived of many rights and there is almost no religious freedom. Still, it remains one of America's closest allies in the Middle East for a simple reason: oil.
In Africa, the United States cooperates with several governments that are essentially one-party states, dominated by a single man, despite a commitment to promoting democracy.
John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, an anti-genocide effort, said that Mr. Meles's death ''accentuates a vexing policy quandary'' that the United States faces with Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan. ''All of them have served American interests or have a strong U.S. constituency, but all have deeply troubling human rights records,'' he said.
Ethiopia has never been an easy place to rule. It is big, poor, famine-stricken, about half Christian and half Muslim, surrounded by enemies and full of heavily armed separatist factions. Ethiopia's own increasingly outspoken Muslim population is one reason Mr. Meles saw eye to eye with the United States on Somalia next door.
But when the United States and Ethiopia teamed up in late 2006 and early 2007 to oust an Islamist movement that had gained control of most of Somalia, the Islamists morphed into a more dangerous group, the Shabab, getting support from all the Somalis who were furious that Ethiopia had invaded their country.
Donor nations, including the United States, then ended up working with several of the Islamist leaders they previously had been trying to kill or capture, after it became clear that the Islamists had the most popular support inside Somalia.
Seeye Abraha Hagos, a former medical school classmate and rebel colleague of Mr. Meles who later split with him and was imprisoned for six years, said: ''He was, in a way, the law of the land. He was the court of the land. There was no check and balance in the government.''
Mr. Hagos said it was not clear what was going to happen next. ''They can take this as an opportunity for reconciliation, by relaxing the prohibitive environment,'' he said. ''Or they could try to maintain the status quo, and the country could be in trouble.''

HEADLINE: Ignoring Deadline to Quit, G.O.P. Senate Candidate Defies His Party Leaders: Akin Digs In and Defends Stand on Abortion

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Monica Davey and Steven Yaccino contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Todd Akin on Tuesday ignored a deadline to abandon Missouri's Senate race and vowed to remain the Republican nominee in defiance of his party's leaders, including the presidential standard-bearer, Mitt Romney.''I believe the defense of the unborn and a deep respect for life, which underlie all of America, those are important parts of who we are. And they're not things to run away from,'' Mr. Akin said on the radio program hosted by Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor.
Mr. Akin touched off a firestorm of criticism after he said in a television interview on Sunday that in instances of what he called ''legitimate rape,'' women's bodies somehow blocked an unwanted pregnancy.
The congressman's decision to remain in the race against Claire McCaskill, the incumbent Democratic senator, came the same day the Republican Party's platform committee endorsed a constitutional ban on abortion that does not include an explicit exception for rape. 
Less than a week before the national party gathers in Tampa, Fla., to formally nominate Mr. Romney as its presidential candidate, the national conversation has turned sharply to the kind of social issues the party has tried to avoid.
Mr. Akin is no stranger to incendiary comments. ''We can't run from our shadows every time someone says 'abortion,' '' he told Dana Loesch, a conservative talk radio host, on Tuesday.
For months, Mr. Romney has struggled to stay focused on the economy while trying to narrow a deficit that polls show he has with women in the presidential race. But the week's events have set back that effort and ensured a media spotlight for Mr. Akin and his ardent supporters in the social conservative movement.
The Akin showdown has raised fears among Republicans that they could fall short of winning control of the Senate and has magnified the schism within the party between activists nationwide still driven by core conservative values and party leaders in Washington, who are wooing independents and Democrats concerned about the struggling economy.
While virtually the entire party apparatus in Washington and a lineup of former Republican senators from Missouri turned on him, Mr. Akin rallied support among grass-roots voters, and he said that would propel him to victory.
Ione Dines, 72, from Marshfield, Mo., a Republican activist for 45 years and a Missouri state committee member since about 2006, said she was ''just devastated'' by her party's actions.
''I am so disappointed in our national and our state committee when we throw our own under the bus,'' she said.
Party leaders remained just as resolute in their demands for Mr. Akin to leave the race. Mr. Romney ramped up his appeal, saying, ''Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.''
Both Karl Rove, co-founder of the deep-pocketed Republican group Crossroads GPS, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee made clear they would withhold support for his candidacy, even though a loss in Missouri could jeopardize any chance Republicans had for capturing the Senate.
''By staying in this race, Congressman Akin is putting at great risk many of the issues that he and others in the Republican Party are fighting for,'' said Brian Walsh, a Senate campaign committee spokesman.
The political repercussions of Mr. Akin's decision are still unclear, but a race that Republicans need to win and thought they had sewn up had clearly shifted. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report on Tuesday flatly declared Mr. Akin ''unelectable.''
But the Rothenberg Political Report, also nonpartisan, was more cautious, moving its evaluation of the race from tilting Republican to a pure tossup. The Rothenberg report had been prepared to declare the race firmly leaning Republican, had one of Mr. Akin's rivals in the Aug. 7 primary, former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman and John Brunner, a businessman, won the nomination, said Stuart Rothenberg, the report's editor.
Mr. Rothenberg said Mr. Akin would have trouble raising campaign money and appealing to swing voters. But ''more than anything else, we thought, 'We're in the middle of firestorm.' We want to wait to see what it looks like in a couple of weeks.''
Mr. Akin found support among anti-abortion activists and Christian conservatives, in Missouri and around the country. ''Missouri Right to Life supports Congressman Akin's defense of the life of an innocent unborn child conceived by rape,'' declared Pam Fichter, president of the group's political action committee.
''No one is speaking up on his behalf -- this is a travesty,'' said Rick Mathes, executive director of the Mission Gate Prison Ministry in Chesterfield, Mo., and an acquaintance of Mr. Akin's. ''With all this negative publicity, it'll have a reverse spin, just watch. More people will be getting out to vote for him.''
In the radio interview with Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Akin cast himself as ''Braveheart,'' pilloried for ''one word and one sentence on one day'' by a cowardly establishment.
But for an increasing number of Republicans, that one word -- ''legitimate'' -- in that one sentence, ''If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,'' was too much to bear.
Roy Blunt, Missouri's Republican senator, spoke personally with Mr. Akin. Then when his appeals got nowhere, he helped organize a joint statement from himself and four former Missouri Republican senators: John Ashcroft, John C. Danforth, Christopher S. Bond and Jim Talent.
''We do not believe it serves the national interest for Congressman Todd Akin to stay in this race,'' it said. ''The issues at stake are too big, and this election is simply too important.''
More Republicans piled on, including several senators Mr. Akin hopes to join as colleagues: Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine all called for him to step aside.
But the national party's public pressure campaign rankled some Republicans in Missouri. Violet Corbett, chair of the Johnson County Republican Central Committee and a member of the Republican State Committee, said she surveyed her county's central committee on Monday night. The outcome: 31 people wanted Mr. Akin to leave the race; 2 wanted him to stay.
But by Tuesday, she had begun getting phone calls from fellow Republicans in the state who seemed put off by so much pressure from Washington. ''They don't know why we should be letting national tell us what to do here in Missouri,'' she said.
Mr. Akin also received some support from his Democratic opponent, Ms. McCaskill, who used a round of advertisements in the last days of the Republican primary campaign to attack his opponents and boost his image.
Amid the calls for him to step aside, she told a St. Louis television station it would be a ''radical thing'' for the national party ''to try to force someone who had won an election honestly off the ballot just because you think you want to pick another candidate.''
Mr. Akin released an advertisement asking the voters of Missouri to forgive him for saying ''legitimate rape'' does not lead to pregnancy. ''Rape is an evil act,'' the congressman said, speaking directly to the camera. ''I used the wrong words in the wrong way, and for that I apologize.''
Republican Party officials had hoped to push Mr. Akin out by the first deadline, set by Missouri law, at 5 p.m. on Tuesday but it passed with him taking no action. The candidate can still take his name off the ballot up to Sept. 25, but the withdrawal could be contested by Missouri's secretary of state, a Democrat, or any election authority in the state, even one at the city or county level. That is a fight Republicans want to avoid.

HEADLINE: A Romney Attack Line Found Not So Clear-Cut

BYLINE: By MATTHEW WALD

 BODY:
4:41 p.m. | Updated This week, Mitt Romney echoed an accusation made by various conservative bloggers against President Obama -- that his administration has spent $90 billion on green energy."Do you know how much money he invested in so-called green energy companies?" Mr. Romney asked during a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H., on Monday "Ninety billion. Ninety billion!"
But is it true? 
Roughly, yes. In fact, the number appears in a document on the White House Web site and represents the financing available in the 2009 stimulus package. Not all that money has been spent; the Energy Department, for example, received $35 billion under the act but has spent only $26 billion thus far, according to Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman.
Yet not all of the money was for Obama administration projects.
Some funds for green energy were appropriated during the administration of President George W. Bush, but not spent until Mr. Obama took office. And some of the stimulus money -- for green energy -- went to programs signed into law by Mr. Bush, but were not actually financed until Mr. Obama became president.
Such spending overlap between administrations is common, particularly on energy initiatives. "Very few energy things actually get spun up quickly,'' said Michael E. Webber, the associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin.
Ms. Stutsman of the Energy Department said that the money for the programs was appropriated by Congress, and that the administration was spending it. "We're following Congressional direction very well," she said.
Republicans have been arguing, though, that the money was not well spent. One example is the solar equipment manufacturer Solyndra, which also shows the overlap in spending between administrations.
Solyndra had a clever design for lightweight, easy-to-install solar arrays, and received a $535 million loan guarantee under a program that was approved for financing in the Bush administration. Energy Department officials turned down the loan application as incomplete shortly before Mr. Obama took office; the same officials later approved a revised application. The company went bankrupt, though, because the price of solar cells was plummeting.
Another example is the Advanced Research Projects Administration - Energy, or Arpa-e, modeled after the better-known Defense Research Projects Administration, or Darpa, which was credited with helping to create the Internet. The Arpa-e program was signed into law by Mr. Bush in 2007 but got no money until the stimulus was passed. It gives fairly modest grants to energy projects that are judged very risky but also highly promising.
Severin Borenstein, an economics professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, who specializes in energy, said that the Obama stimulus package was different from the Republican approach in the Bush years, which was to send out checks to taxpayers, and cut taxes.
But in the Obama administration's stimulus, the approach was "to buy stuff the country needs,'' he said. A recession is an excellent time to buy needed infrastructure, he said, because the economy is under-utilized, and the spending served an economic purpose of creating activity.
"It may be that the system was not well designed to find the best prospects and to fund them, or that they funded some prospects that they should have known before the fact were bad prospects,'' he said, pointing to the example of Solyndra. "That's the critique one could, from a rational policy point of view pursue, but I haven't seen that pursued,'' he said.He said that spending on the smart grid was "probably a wise thing,'' although it was too soon to tell.
The White House breaks down the $90 billion om green energy projects in the stimulus bill like this:
$29 billion for energy efficiency, including $5 billion for improvements in the homes and apartments of low-income households
$21 billion for renewable electricity generation, including wind turbines and solar panels
$10 billion for grid modernization, including millions of "smart meters" that read themselves, eliminating the need for meter readers
$6 billion to help establish factories to make batteries for electric cars and other components of advanced vehicles
$18 billion for fast trains
$3 billion for research and development into capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide
$3 billion for job training and scientific advances in green energy
about $2 billion to help build wind turbines, solar panels and similar "green" products
The success of these investments is not yet clear. The economics of wind and solar have been hurt by another development, the crash in the price of natural gas, which is a competing fuel for the production of electricity. The electric car has not yet emerged as a mass-market product to put a dent in oil consumption. The "smart grid" would be especially useful in helping manage a system with large amounts of wind and solar power, which vary in production over the course of the day, but such generating technologies have yet to adequately penetrate the market.
The politics of spending money on green energy are somewhat scrambled.
"There are now so many jobs in the clean energy world, you have Republicans who come to bat for clean energy,'' Mr. Webber said. "A lot of these jobs are in rural, Republican districts,'' he added, citing wind farms and ethanol production, which are big in Iowa, a swing state. "You have rural Republicans teaming up with urban Democrats to push for more wind,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Profits in G.M.A.C. Bailout to Benefit Financiers, Not U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Among the companies that were bailed out by the federal government during the financial crisis, perhaps the most intractable is proving to be the company formerly known as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. It's a case study in how bailouts can linger and profits, when they do come, flow not to the government but to the Warren E. Buffetts of the world.G.M.A.C. was the financial arm of General Motors. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, it was also G.M.'s most profitable unit, which tells you something about the auto industry at the time. The company earned more profit from lending money to customers than in selling cars.
In 2005, desperate to raise cash, General Motors sold a 51 percent stake in G.M.A.C. to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus beat out a rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for the privilege, spurring BusinessWeek to write that Henry R. Kravis's loss "has to sting."
During the financial crisis, however, the sting was felt on the other side, as G.M.A.C. staved off collapse thanks only to a government infusion of $17.2 billion. The company was renamed Ally Financial - you have probably seen its catchy commercials on television. The Treasury Department owns 73.8 percent of Ally, with Cerberus retaining an 8.7 percent stake. 
Almost since that time, the Treasury Department has wanted to rid itself of its Ally stake. Ally filed for an initial public offering in March 2011, but it has so far languished in the face of a weak market and concerns over Ally itself. The Treasury Department has been paid back about $5.7 billion and still controls the company through its stock ownership and appointment of a majority of Ally's directors.
Despite lingering concerns about Ally, the automobile sales market is recovering and Ally's auto finance operations turned a profit last year. But Ally is still suffering from legacy debts, primarily concentrated in its ResCap unit. While you might think that with a name like G.M.A.C., the company financed only automobiles, but the company was also one of the largest subprime housing lenders through its ResCap subsidiary.
ResCap, a wholly separate entity owned by Ally, is the fifth-largest mortgaging servicer and origination unit in the nation, serving 2.4 million mortgages with a principal of $374 billion. The business has lost billions since the financial crisis, and the never-ending stream of losses has made investors fearful. They should be. Ally has lent ResCap $1.2 billion and has provided an infusion of $10.3 billion since Jan. 1, 2007.
Ally's chief executive, Michael A. Carpenter, has stated that his priority is to repay the American taxpayer rather than support ResCap. In 2011, ResCap disclosed a loss of $845.1 million and its financing has been drying up as the market realized that Ally would no longer be ResCap's sugar daddy.
It's still unclear why Ally didn't put ResCap into bankruptcy instead of providing billions in support. One explanation may be that Ally wasn't stable enough at the time to risk the market reaction to a bankruptcy and the possibility that Ally's own financing might dry up as a result. In addition, ResCap turned a profit in 2010, but has since been overwhelmed by litigation and bad subprime loans.
Whatever the reason, Ally finally bit the bullet and put ResCap into bankruptcy in May this year, presumably hoping that this would make Ally more attractive itself for an I.P.O. or sale.
ResCap filed for bankruptcy with a huge $1.25 billion loan from Barclays and up to an additional $220 million available from Ally. The initial bankruptcy plan was for ResCap to split up, with the mortgage servicing business being sold to Fortress Investment Group for about $2.3 billion. A legacy portfolio of $5.2 billion in mortgage loan principal would be sold separately. At the time of the bankruptcy, Ally announced its intention to serve as a stalking horse bid for the legacy portfolio, bidding from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.
Enter the greatest investor of our time.
One of Ally's biggest creditors at that time was Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which held more than $500 million of ResCap's unsecured bonds and $900 million in ResCap's junior secured bonds. Berkshire has since sold the unsecured bonds but has also joined the fray. It announced in June that it would bid for the mortgage servicer, and offer $1.45 billion for the legacy loan portfolio. The investment firm Lone Star Funds has also stated its interest in buying one or both.
Ally has now bowed out and Berkshire has replaced it as the stalking bidder for the loan portfolio. This fall, a bankruptcy court will hold an open auction for both businesses. We don't know who will buy these businesses, but it won't be Ally, which has left the scene after losing billions.
When asked for comment on why it was no longer bidding, an Ally spokesman expressed the intention for Ally to focus on its core businesses where Ally has a "leading position and competitive strengths, and that includes the auto finance and direct banking franchises."
Ally's initial gambit as a stalking horse bid has succeeded in bringing bidders to the table and maximizing the value of ResCap. But it's hard not to think that if Ally were not a ward of the government, this might have turned out differently. Having come so far and invested more than $10 billion, Ally might want to bid for those assets, using its prior ownership to gain an advantage. After all, now there appears the potential to profit.
But the costs and uncertainties of continuing in the mortgage business are significant, and Ally does not appear to want to take that risk. At the time of the bankruptcy, the Treasury Department stated that its "objective today is to exit in a manner that balances speed of recovery with maximizing returns for taxpayers" and that it believes that the ResCap bankruptcy will "put taxpayers in a stronger position to maximize the value of their remaining investment in Ally."
That's the problem with companies being bailed out. They're no longer as entrepreneurial or risk-taking as they might be, and instead have to balance gains against a need to pay back the government. Now that housing is in a fitful recovery, smart financiers are returning to this market. Ordinarily, this would be a good situation for Ally to buy back the assets in bankruptcy. But it will be private investors - and potentially Mr. Buffett - who will profit from ResCap's carcass.
And with the Treasury Department still in the hole for more than $11.5 billion with Ally, it is already facing a significant period before the government is paid back in full. The Treasury Department expects that it will be repaid a substantial portion of the government's investment in Ally, if not the full amount.
Though Ally operates independently, the Treasury Department, as Ally's owner, is not likely to have the patience to wait longer for ResCap. When the government is your lender, paying back the money is your first goal.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: We Need a 'Conservative' Party

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There has been lots of talk that Paul Ryan's nomination ensures that we'll now have a ''real'' debate about the role of government. That's actually funny. The bar for this campaign is so low that we celebrate the fact that it might include a serious debate about one of the four great issues of the day, though even that is not clear yet. And even if Ryan's entry does spark a meaningful debate about one of the great issues facing America -- the nexus of debt, taxes and entitlements -- there is little sign that we'll seriously debate our other three major challenges: how to generate growth and upgrade the skills of every American in an age when the merger of globalization and the information technology revolution means every good job requires more education; how to meet our energy and climate challenges; and how to create an immigration policy that will treat those who are here illegally humanely, while opening America to the world's most talented immigrants, whom we need to remain the world's most innovative economy.But what's even more troubling is that we need more than debates. 
That's all we've been having. We need deals on all four issues as soon as this election is over, and I just don't see that happening unless ''conservatives'' retake the Republican Party from the ''radicals'' -- that is, the Tea Party base. America today desperately needs a serious, thoughtful, credible 21st-century ''conservative'' opposition to President Obama, and we don't have that, even though the voices are out there.
Imagine if the G.O.P.'s position on debt was set by Senator Tom Coburn, the Oklahoma Republican who has challenged the no-tax lunacy of Grover Norquist and served on the Simpson-Bowles commission and voted for its final plan (unlike Ryan). That plan included both increased tax revenues and spending cuts as the only way to fix our long-term fiscal imbalances. Give me a Republican Party that says we have to put real tax revenues and spending cuts on the table to solve this problem, and you'll get a deal with Obama, who has already offered both, although not at the scale we need. True conservatives know that both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush used both tax revenue and spending cuts to fix budget shortfalls. Ryan-led G.O.P. radicals say ''no new taxes,'' find all the savings through spending cuts. That's never going to happen -- and shouldn't.
Imagine if the G.O.P.'s position on immigration followed the lead of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of the News Corporation. Bloomberg and Murdoch recently took to the road to make the economic case for immigration reform. ''I think we are in a crisis in this country,'' The Times quoted the Australian-born Murdoch, who's now a naturalized American, as saying last week. ''Right now, if we get qualified people in, there shouldn't be any nonsense about it.'' Regarding the ''so-called illegal Mexicans,'' Murdoch added, ''give them a path to citizenship. They pay taxes; they are hard-working people. Why Mitt Romney doesn't do it, I have no idea, because they are natural Republicans.''
Imagine if the G.O.P. position on energy and climate was set by Bob Inglis, a former South Carolina Republican congressman (who was defeated by the Tea Party in 2010). He now runs George Mason University's Energy and Enterprise Initiative, which is based on the notion that climate change is real, and that the best way to deal with it and our broader energy challenge is with conservative ''market-based solutions'' that say to the fossil fuel and wind, solar and nuclear industries: ''Be accountable for all of your costs,'' including the carbon and pollution you put in the air, and then we'll ''let the markets work'' and see who wins.
Imagine if G.O.P. education policy was set by former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, without having to cater to radicals, who call for eliminating the Department of Education and view common core standards as some kind of communist conspiracy. Mr. Bush has argued that a conservative approach to education for 21st-century jobs would embrace more effective teacher evaluation and common core standards, but add a bigger element of choice in the form of charter schools and vouchers, the removal of union rules that limit new technology -- and combine it all with greater autonomy and accountability for individual principals. When parents can choose and school leaders can innovate, good things happen.
We are not going to make any progress on our biggest problems without a compromise between the center-right and center-left. But, for that, we need the center-right conservatives, not the radicals, to be running the G.O.P., as well as the center-left in the Democratic Party. Over the course of his presidency, Obama has proposed center-left solutions to all four of these challenges. I wish he had pushed some in a bigger, consistent, more daring and more forceful manner -- and made them the centerpiece of his campaign. Nevertheless, if the G.O.P. were in a different place, either a second-term Obama or a first-term Romney would have a real chance at making progress on all four. As things stand now, though, there is little hope this campaign will give the winner any basis for governing. Too bad -- a presidential campaign is a terrible thing to waste.

HEADLINE: For Women, It's Not Just About the Economy

BYLINE: By LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- No doubt, this is Paul D. Ryan's moment. Once he bounded onto the national stage as Mitt Romney's running mate, the precocious 42-year-old Wisconsin conservative has captivated many in the media, fired up the hard-core Republicans and converted some undecided voters.But there's the other side. Mr. Ryan, a married Roman Catholic, would overhaul women's health rights; Medicare, the health program for those 65 and older; Social Security, the old-age, survivors and disability insurance program; and President Barack Obama's controversial health care law. Far to the right of mainstream America on many issues, he has actively fought abortion rights, government funding of family planning and insurance coverage for contraceptives. He wants to impose criminal penalties on doctors who perform what opponents call partial-birth abortions, and he co-sponsored a bill to give a fetus so-called personhood rights -- legislation so extreme that it was rejected by voters in conservative Mississippi. 
It's a wonder, then, why Mr. Romney, who trails Mr. Obama in polls of female voters, chose a No. 2 who seems unlikely to draw women to the Republicans' side, especially single women who in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll favored the president over Mr. Romney by 29 points. (That figure may be partly offset by the Republicans' strength among married women, who in the 2010 midterm elections helped the party win the female vote for the first time in 30 years.)
Making matters worse for the Republicans, Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, a conservative running for the U.S. Senate, might have ruined his chances to defeat the incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, in November after asserting in a weekend television interview that pregnancy from rape was ''really rare.'' He was defending his opposition to abortion with no exceptions.
''If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,'' he said in St. Louis.
Though Mr. Romney denounced the comments publicly and quickly, and Mr. Akin backtracked, the episode was another headache for the campaign and another setback in its goal to win over female voters. It also fed Democrats' message that Republicans are engaged in an all-out attack on women's rights.
''Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan share an extreme ideological commitment to rolling back women's access to basic health services,'' Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, a leading Democrat who is running for re-election in November, said shortly after Mr. Ryan's selection. ''When women see that Congressman Ryan has voted 59 times on reproductive health, and each time he voted against women, it will be clear which candidate shares their values.''
Ms. Gillibrand was voicing sentiments expressed widely last week by women who favor abortion rights.
But the Romney-Ryan camp shows little alarm. First of all, the campaign sees a surge of excitement for the ticket and cites a Gallup national tracking poll, released Friday, that shows Mr. Romney taking a two-point lead over Mr. Obama, 47 percent to 45 percent. Second, the campaign says, jobs and the economy -- not social issues -- are the main concerns of voters, and that includes the majority of women.
''Women are pocketbook voters,'' Mr. Romney's campaign press secretary, Andrea Saul, told me over the phone. ''There are a lot of women who are living paycheck to paycheck. They care about the future we're passing on to their children and grandchildren. Single women can't find jobs, so Governor Romney is talking about the issues that are important to them -- not just creating jobs, but good jobs and good-paying jobs.''
Yet, that's not exactly what I found in casual exchanges last week with middle-class single and married women in the politically crucial 30-45 age bracket.
''For two years my sole income supported my family and kept us afloat,'' a 41-year-old married mother and New York public relations executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''Yes, I'm worried about the economy. But I am also very concerned about many other important issues that affect me as a woman and my family over all, including health care, women's issues and education. Most Republicans are on the other end of the spectrum of where I stand. So to say that my demographic will vote for Romney and Ryan because we are worried about the economy is quite presumptuous.''
Single and employed, Crystal Jareske, 33, a Dallas accountant, has not been hit badly in this economy, but the recession has affected family and friends. Yet, she said in a brief phone conversation, ''I've not been impressed with Romney's leadership, and I don't trust that he will make the changes he's talking about. I'm staying with Obama.''
In Virginia, a battleground state where Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are running head to head (a poll last week gave a three-point edge to the Republican), Annie Parker, 44, a single mother of three, told me: ''As a single mother there is no way -- none -- that I would vote for Romney-Ryan. That pair makes me afraid for my daughter. They make me afraid for my sons, that they will be sent recklessly to war, and they make me afraid for the future of the country.''
Ms. Parker, a freelance blogger and writer, noted, ''As to the economy, I don't think they could've done a better job than the president has.''
Heading into the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, next week, the Romney campaign is going to stay focused on jobs and getting the economy back on the right track, Ms. Saul said. ''And that's certainly what women care about.'' In the week since Mr. Ryan entered the race, the campaign has tallied $10 million in online donations, the campaign said Friday.
''These are grass-roots donors who are excited about the Romney-Ryan ticket,'' Ms. Saul said. ''Obviously, many of those donations come from women.''

HEADLINE: Strong Start On Wall St. Turns Lower

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Tuesday after the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index touched a four-year high but retreated in late trading.The S.& P. index reached 1,426.68, its highest intraday level since May 2008. Volume has been light, as expected in August, and the S.& P. has moved more than 0.25 percent in only 3 of the last 12 sessions. 
''It's not uncommon that you run into some resistance at new highs,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Stocks rose early in the session and the euro rallied to a seven-week high against the dollar, bolstered by talk that the European Central Bank would act to lower Spanish and Italian borrowing costs. But stocks lost momentum after the first hour.
The slow but steady climb over the last six weeks was partly a result of better-than-expected economic data, including payrolls, retail sales and housing numbers.
''The U.S. economy is showing signs of picking up again,'' Mr. Paulsen said, while adding that major indexes would most likely stall until the end of the month.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.06 points, or 0.51 percent, to 13,203.58. The S.& P. 500 index declined 4.96 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,413.17. The Nasdaq composite index lost 8.95 points, or 0.29 percent, to 3,067.26.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32 to 98 13/32, and the yield fell to 1.80 percent from 1.81 percent late Monday.
A Facebook director, Peter Thiel, sold about $400 million worth of shares last week. Facebook shares fell 85 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $19.16 on Tuesday.
Best Buy pared losses after hitting $16.25, a nine-year low. It suspended its profit outlook and share buybacks for the year, and closed down 1.4 percent at $17.91.
The clothing retailer Urban Outfitters rose 18.2 percent to $36.98 after several brokerage firms increased their price targets on the stock.

HEADLINE: Patients Would Pay More if Romney Restores Medicare Savings, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney's promise to restore $716 billion that he says President Obama ''robbed'' from Medicare has some health care experts puzzled, and not just because his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, included the same savings in his House budgets.The 2010 health care law cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and insurers, not benefits for older Americans, by that amount over the coming decade. But repealing the savings, policy analysts say, would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by eight years -- to 2016, the final year of the next presidential term, from 2024.
While Republicans have raised legitimate questions about the long-term feasibility of the reimbursement cuts, analysts say, to restore them in the short term would immediately add hundreds of dollars a year to out-of-pocket Medicare expenses for beneficiaries. That would violate Mr. Romney's vow that neither current beneficiaries nor Americans within 10 years of eligibility would be affected by his proposal to shift Medicare to a voucherlike system in which recipients are given a lump sum to buy coverage from competing insurers. 
For those reasons, Henry J. Aaron, an economist and a longtime health policy analyst at the Brookings Institution and the Institute of Medicine, called Mr. Romney's vow to repeal the savings ''both puzzling and bogus at the same time.''
Marilyn Moon, vice president and director of the health program at the American Institutes for Research, calculated that restoring the $716 billion in Medicare savings would increase premiums and co-payments for beneficiaries by $342 a year on average over the next decade; in 2022, the average increase would be $577.
Beneficiaries, through their premiums and co-payments, share the cost of Medicare with the government. If Medicare's costs increase -- for instance, by raising payments to health care providers -- so, too, do beneficiaries' contributions.
And those costs would be on top of the costs involved with a full repeal of the health care law, which would eliminate expanded coverage of prescription drugs, free wellness care and preventive checkups.
''One can only wonder what's going on inside their headquarters in Boston and among their policy people,'' said John McDonough, the director of the Center for Public Health Leadership at Harvard. ''But there are only two explanations: Either they don't understand how the program works, which is hard to imagine, or there is some deliberate misrepresentation here because they know how politically potent this charge is.''
The potency of the Republicans' charge was evident in the 2010 midterm elections, when they accused Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats of cutting Medicare by $500 billion to pay for new coverage under the health care law. They went on to recapture control of the House.
Led by Mr. Romney, Republicans revived that line of attack for 2012. But Mr. Romney cited a higher $716 billion in the same week that he announced his selection of Mr. Ryan, who had supported the reductions until joining the Republican ticket. The different dollar figures reflect a shifting time frame: $500 billion represented the projected Medicare savings in the decade after the 2010 health care law was enacted; $716 billion reflects savings from 2013 through 2022.
The Romney campaign adamantly disputes the critics' assertions.
''The idea that restoring funding to Medicare could somehow hasten its bankruptcy is on its face absurd,'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. She added, ''Governor Romney's plan is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with patient-centered reforms that control cost throughout the health care system and extend the solvency of Medicare.''
What Mr. Romney proposes to restore to Medicare, however, is not money but additional costs, for higher payments to hospitals, insurers and other care providers. Lobbying groups representing some care providers accepted those reductions during the health care debate, and in exchange they got the law's mandate for nearly all individuals to have insurance, which meant that providers and insurers would have millions of new paying patients and policyholders.
But Mr. Romney's policy director, Lanhee Chen, argued in a memorandum last weekend that reducing provider payments would backfire and hurt beneficiaries -- a concern about the health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act, that is widely shared.
''In the real world,'' he wrote, ''the result will be fewer providers accepting Medicare payments and worse care for today's seniors.''
Mr. Chen cited recent annual reports from the trustees for the Medicare program and from the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Richard S. Foster. The trustees and the actuary each said that the law could well lead to significant savings in the delivery of health care, but both also suggested that over time the scheduled cuts to providers' payments could prove unrealistic.
''While the Affordable Care Act makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its financial outlook, there is a strong likelihood that certain of these changes will not be viable in the long range,'' Mr. Foster wrote.
He added, ''The best available evidence indicates that most health care providers cannot improve their productivity to this degree -- or even approach such a level -- as a result of the labor-intensive nature of these services.''
Mr. Romney has been especially critical of the cuts for insurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage, a popular private-policy alternative to Medicare. ''This is the president's plan: $716 billion cut, four million people losing Medicare Advantage and 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes not accepting Medicare patients,'' he said in a recent campaign appearance.
But Medicare Advantage, which was created 15 years ago in the hope that private-market competition for beneficiaries would result in lower prices, has consistently cost more than standard Medicare -- costs that Medicare beneficiaries must help subsidize through their premiums.
The reductions for Medicare Advantage providers are ''a matter of basic fairness because they've been overpaid for years,'' Ms. Moon said. As for beneficiaries, she added, ''they're guaranteed basic Medicare benefits. They may lose some extra benefits they may have been getting, but in effect you're saying some of the windfall benefits may go away.''
''The bottom line,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, which Mr. Ryan leads, ''is that Romney is proposing to take more money from seniors in higher premiums and co-pays and hand it over to private insurance companies and other providers in the Medicare system.''

HEADLINE: On Trail, Obama Attacks Romney on Student Aid

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Pennsylvania.

 BODY:
RENO, Nev. -- President Obama, adding another chapter to his litany of differences with Mitt Romney, took to the road on Tuesday to promote his record on education and assail his Republican challenger for advising financially struggling college hopefuls to ''shop around and borrow more money from your parents.''Campaigning here and in Ohio, Mr. Obama presented himself as the lucky product of affordable education and his opponent as the enemy of it. Mr. Romney, he said, would cut student loans and grants, and do nothing to curb the tuition increases that threaten to put higher education out of reach of millions of middle-class Americans.
''He said, 'The best thing you can do is shop around,' '' the president said to boos from a youthful crowd of 3,500 in a sunny quadrangle at Capital University in Bexley, Ohio. ''That's it. That's his plan. That's his answer to young people who are trying to figure out how to go to college and make sure that they don't have a mountain of debt.'' 
It was the first day of Mr. Obama's two-day swing through a pair of electoral battlegrounds, and it showcased what has become a methodical drive by the president to make the election a stark choice between him and Mr. Romney: on tax policy, Medicare, education -- anything, it seems, but the gasping economy.
The president said his policies, from a $10,000 tuition tax credit to a doubling of Pell grant scholarships, had helped an additional three million students afford college. Mr. Romney's proposals, he said, would cut investments in education, leaving one million students without scholarships and reducing financial aid to nearly 10 million.
The Romney campaign countered that Mr. Obama's economic policies had resulted in a ''lost generation'' -- graduates burdened by crushing debt, with little hope of repaying it because of the bleak job market. The campaign mocked the president's answer to a question in a television interview in New Hampshire over the weekend, about why struggling college graduates should support his re-election.
''Well, they can look at my track record,'' Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said Mr. Obama's remarks revealed a politician who believes ''the economy is a fixed pie, that there's only so much money, and that it's the government's job to redistribute the slices as the government sees fit.''
''That's not how the free economy works; that's not free enterprise,'' Mr. Ryan said at two rallies on Tuesday, in West Chester, Pa., and near Pittsburgh. ''Our job is to grow the pie so everybody gets a slice of the pie.''
For Mr. Obama, however, every day that he and Mr. Romney are debating something other than the economy is a victory. The president did not address the refusal of Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, to withdraw from his race, after his remarks about rape. But the swirling tempest over Mr. Akin was another distraction for Republicans and the Romney campaign.
After speaking at a community college in Reno and spending the night in Las Vegas, Mr. Obama will speak at a Las Vegas high school before flying to New York City for three fund-raisers. The highlight is likely to be a basketball skills camp, featuring a shoot-around in which the president is expected to join some N.B.A. stars.
Ohio and Nevada loom large as battleground states in 2012, but for different reasons. Both campaigns view Ohio as a must-win state, while Mr. Romney views Nevada, which Mr. Obama won by 12 points in 2008, as a target of opportunity because of its wounded housing market and growing Mormon population.
Speaking to 2,100 supporters at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Mr. Obama steered clear of any reference to Nevada's foreclosure rate, which remains one of the highest in the country. Mr. Obama's cautious response to the housing crisis has been faulted by some economists, who say it hindered the economic recovery.
In Ohio, where he was making his ninth visit of the year, the president went out of his way to identify with his youthful audiences. He recounted how, as newlyweds, he and his wife, Michelle, were saddled with heavy debts from college and law school.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama stopped by Sloopy's, a '50s-style diner at Ohio State University, where he acted as a one-man welcoming committee for new freshmen -- and asked several how they were paying for college.
''The only problem with seeing you guys,'' he said to three young women, was that they were a reminder that his elder daughter, Malia, would be leaving home for college in a few years.
''Are you ready?'' Samantha Williams of Lima, Ohio, asked him.
''No,'' he replied. ''I don't want them to leave yet.''

HEADLINE: Inflammatory Risks of Syrian Intervention Limit Options for U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite President Obama's warning to Syria not to use its arsenal of chemical weapons or allow them to fall into the hands of extremists, the administration's options for intervening remain limited by what its officials have described as a simple calculus: It would make the conflict even worse.American military operations against Syria, officials reiterated on Tuesday, would risk drawing in Syria's patrons, principally Iran and Russia, at a much greater level than they already are involved. It would allow Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, to rally popular sentiment against the West and embolden Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups now fighting the Assad government to turn their attention to what they would see as another American crusade in the Arab world.
Syria's deputy prime minister, Qadri Jamil, made the point in Moscow on Tuesday, dismissing Mr. Obama's warning, and declaring that any foreign military intervention would lead to ''a confrontation wider than Syria's borders.'' 
At the same time, Mr. Obama's remarks underscored the fact that there could be limits to the American reluctance to intervene. But it would require a threat to American interests and values that a civil war inside Syria by itself does not: a nightmarish attack using chemical weapons or the transfer of those weapons to hardened enemies of the United States and its allies, including Israel, which the president mentioned on Monday.
''We say it for deterrence effect, of course, but it's also a reality,'' one official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's internal strategy deliberations. ''The United States is not going to be able to sit it out if Syria starts using chemical weapons on its people.''
The Syrian Foreign Ministry pledged in late July that its stockpile of chemical weapons would be used only against foreign intervention, and that it would ''never, never be used against the Syrian people or civilians during this crisis, under any circumstances.''
Some experts and lawmakers have urged the administration to do more, including prominent members of Congress like Senator John McCain of Arizona, who called last month for increasing intelligence and helping to create ''safe zones'' in rebel-held areas. The White House faces little real public or political pressure to intervene forcefully, though, even as the bloodshed worsens.
Mr. McCain was a frequent critic of what he regarded as the Obama administration's overly cautious policy toward Libya, which did lead to military intervention by NATO. But, the officials said, the conflict in Syria has become far more complicated than was the case in Libya. That country's universally unpopular leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, had neither an effective military nor international backing, and it posed far less risk of ethnic and sectarian strife that could easily spill into Syria's neighbors, including Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Israel.
For now, the legal and diplomatic hurdles to intervention remain insurmountable. In large part because of the intervention in Libya, Russia and China have vowed to block United Nations authorization that could lead to international military involvement, something that European allies from Britain to Turkey insist is a prerequisite for international intervention.
At the Pentagon, commanders continue to draft plans for potential operations -- from establishing a ''no fly'' zone, as in Libya, or sending in special forces to neutralize Syria's unconventional weapons, should they be used or moved out of the Syrian government's control. Pentagon officials have indicated that a worst-case scenario would require tens of thousands of soldiers, something that the officials said would inflame an already roiling region.
Mr. Obama did not explicitly threaten a military response in the event of a chemical weapons attack, though he called it a ''red line'' that would ''change my calculus'' about the American response so far. Such an attack, the officials said, would also change the thinking of other nations, including Russia, and raise the chances of an international reaction.
The administration's current policy involves intensifying diplomatic and economic pressure on Mr. Assad's government through sanctions, offering humanitarian assistance to Syrians inside and outside the country, and providing $25 million in ''nonlethal'' help to Mr. Assad's opponents, including more recently to members of the Free Syrian Army. That aid has paid for communication equipment to enable the armed and unarmed opposition to better coordinate their attacks and plans for taking power.
The administration has also ruled out providing arms to the rebels for broadly the same reason: more weapons, the officials say, would probably make the war only worse.
Some rebels, for example, have asked for portable rocket launchers known as Manpads, which experts say could make a huge difference in the fighting by countering government jet and helicopter attacks. But the officials point to the experience of Afghanistan in the 1980s, when the Central Intelligence Agency provided Stinger missiles to the mujahedeen fighting the Soviet Union, only to spend millions trying to track them down after the Soviets left and the opposition groups gave rise to the Taliban.
''The complexity of Syria today makes Afghanistan in 1985 look very simple,'' said Milton A. Bearden, who helped oversee the C.I.A.'s clandestine support of Afghan fighters in the 1980s, including the Stingers. ''Who is the Syrian opposition? Who would these weapons go to?''
The risk of not doing more is that the United States could lose the support of those hoping to overthrow Mr. Assad -- in contrast to Libya's new leaders, who now view the Americans favorably. There is also a moral argument that the United States and NATO intervened in Libya because it was easy, but not in Syria because it was hard. While some administration officials privately express frustration that the conflict is spiraling ever deeper out of control, they say it only underscores the danger of being drawn into a larger regional or even international conflict.
''The opposition desperately needs weapons if you don't want this conflict to be a grinder, which is the trajectory now,'' Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a telephone interview from Beirut. ''If you're not going to make the choice to intervene, you need to give them the ability to end this conflict themselves.''
The administration maintains it is doing what is feasible to hasten the end of Mr. Assad's rule, while the Pentagon and State Department plan for the political transition that would follow, addressing such questions as the security of Syria's chemical arsenal. Other covert operations are also under way, though their extent remains unknown.
''I reject the zero-sum argument,'' one official said on Tuesday, ''where either you intervene militarily or you're doing nothing.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Worry About Impact of Russia Joining W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- After two decades of negotiations, Russia will finally join the World Trade Organization on Wednesday. The lower trade barriers that come along with membership will open up new opportunities for foreign companies to do business in Russia.But American companies are guaranteed no such advantages -- and may even face higher Russian tariffs than their competitors from other countries.
Because of broader policy concerns about the Kremlin's crackdown on dissidents and its support for rogue governments, Congress has balked at the Obama administration's request to grant Russia permanent normal trade relation status. That status is important since the W.T.O. requires that any country that seeks to benefit from it must apply the same trade rules to all member countries.
Major American exporters to Russia, like Caterpillar, Deere and General Electric, are worried about the potential impact on their business from the Congressional inaction. Across all sectors of the economy, Russia will lower import tariffs to 7 percent, from about 15 percent today, for the 155 countries in the trade organization. Although Russian officials say they do not have any immediate intention of applying discriminatory tariffs against American companies, they could legally do so at any time. 
Russia was the last major economy that was not part of the trade group, and joining is expected to be a boon for Russian consumers and businesses. Exporting companies in Europe, Asia and the United States eagerly await open access to a population of 142 million people with growing incomes and an expanding middle class.
The World Bank estimates that W.T.O. membership will add three percentage points to Russia's gross domestic product once the new tariffs are phased in.
Russia negotiated for membership for 18 years, beginning when the W.T.O. was called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is longer than any major W.T.O. entrant, including China, for which permanent trade status was also a battle in Congress. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama all supported Russia's inclusion, and the country won accession last year, with formal membership coming this week.
After Russia joins the W.T.O., most other countries in the world will have recourse to the global trade group's means for resolving disputes and can demand the lower, favorable tariffs negotiated during Russia's application process.
Whatever the economic implications for American companies, members of Congress have suggested that granting Russia permanent normal trade relations would in effect turn a blind eye to Russia's support for rogue governments, its defiance of Western efforts to isolate Syria and Iran, and President Vladimir V. Putin's crackdown on dissent at home.
''The Obama administration has not articulated a clear and coherent strategy regarding Russia,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said in June. ''Instead, they ask Congress to simply pass permanent normal trade relations and remove Russia from long-standing human rights law, while ignoring Russia's rampant corruption, theft of U.S. intellectual property, poor human rights record and adversarial foreign policies.''
Just last week, Russian authorities sentenced members of the punk band Pussy Riot to two years in prison for holding an anti-Putin concert, and then arrested the chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was protesting outside the court, and accused him of biting a policeman.
To grant the favored trade status, Congress must repeal a cold-war-era trade sanction intended to compel the Soviet Union to allow Jewish and other religious minorities to freely emigrate. Russia has not imposed restrictions on such emigration for about 20 years.
Some members of Congress from both parties, but not the Obama administration, support replacing that restriction with a human rights law addressing current issues of government corruption and police abuse. The proposed law -- named after the whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in pretrial detention in 2009 -- would block visas and freeze assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses.
Mr. Hatch noted that exports to Russia account for only about half of 1 percent of all American exports. American businesses are also protected by a 1992 bilateral trade treaty that guarantees equal treatment with companies from other nations, though this lacks the enforcement mechanism of the W.T.O.
For companies with major Russian exports, an extended Congressional delay could be dire. Earlier this year, several chief executives testified to Congress that their market share in Russia and jobs at factories, research and development centers and head offices in the United States could suffer.
''The United States will be in violation of W.T.O. rules that require every member to grant every other member permanent normal trade relations,'' said Andrew Somers, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia. ''To many congressmen, it looks like they would be rewarding Russia for bad behavior. But in fact, they will not be rewarding Russia at all, because Russia is already in the W.T.O.''
For some goods, the new tariffs take effect immediately. In other sectors, like automotive manufacturing, the tariffs are phased in over up to seven years.
Yekaterina Y. Mayorova, deputy director of trade negotiations at the Russian ministry of economy, said in an interview that the initial drop in tariffs to take effect later this week would not discriminate against American companies. ''We are not preparing any special tariffs for the United States, though legally we are not obliged to offer the same conditions,'' she said.
But several large companies are at risk. G.E. competes with Siemens of Germany to sell medical imaging devices, and the market for Caterpillar's big bulldozers is crowded with European and Asian manufacturers, all with sharp elbows.
Russia, with its heavy dependence on mining and energy industries, is one of the top 10 export markets for Caterpillar, and the company sold $2 billion worth of machines there over the last five years.
After Russia joins the W.T.O. and without permanent normal trade relations, ''American companies like Caterpillar will be at a disadvantage compared to Chinese, Korean, Japanese and European competitors,'' said Jim Dugan, a Caterpillar spokesman. Losing sales in Russia could affect hiring decisions at United States factories, where Caterpillar employs 55,000 people.
The company's gigantic mining trucks illustrate the risks to American exporters. Tariffs on the vehicles will decrease to 5 percent, from 15 percent, under W.T.O. rules.
Depending on their size, these trucks costs $1 million to $7 million, meaning the Russian government could, without risking recourse under the W.T.O., ask Caterpillar to pay $100,000 to $700,000 more in tariffs than its principal Japanese competitor, Komatsu, for each American-made truck sold in Russia.
Caterpillar is also facing mounting competition from a Chinese maker of big bulldozers, Shantui, and an upstart German engineering group, Liebherr, that makes construction cranes but is now competing with Caterpillar for pipe-laying equipment for the petroleum industry.
''This will really help them,'' Bill Pigman, an American dealer of heavy equipment in Moscow, said in an interview. ''Why do you have to play brinksmanship? Congress is threatening Cat's toehold in Russia.''

HEADLINE: Taking On the Billionaires: Ads Turn Focus on Kochs

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
As patrons of conservative groups, the billionaire Koch brothers have bankrolled plenty of negative ads, but now they are a direct target of one.With a $500,000 ad purchase on Tuesday, an outside political group allied with Democrats said it was beginning an effort to tie the industrial executives to their agenda. 
"Billionaire oil tycoons Charles and David Koch and their special interest friends are spending $400 million to buy this year's elections and advance their agenda," a narrator says in the 30-second version of the ad, by Patriot Majority USA, running on CNN and MSNBC. That "greed agenda," the ad contends, includes cutting taxes for the rich, eliminating the minimum wage, cutting education financing and subsidizing oil companies.
The Kochs are "hiding in plain sight," said Craig Varoga, the president of Patriot Majority USA. The group commissioned polls that found that most Americans were not aware of them, Mr. Varoga said.
"Our goal is to increase their name ID and tie it to their actual causes," he said.
However, Mr. Varoga refused to identify the backers of his group's effort. As a tax-exempt "social welfare" organization, Patriot Majority USA is not required to disclose its donors.
A top Koch official dismissed the effort by "the president's allies" to "attack and demonize private citizens and job creators who disagree with them on the direction this country is going."
In a statement, Philip Ellender, president of Koch Companies Public Sector, also called the ads "dishonest" and an "attempt to shut down free speech," adding, "Koch has a long history of standing firm for the principles of economic freedom, and we will continue to do so, in spite of the ongoing attacks."
Mr. Varoga said his group's goal "is not to demonize them whatsoever; our goal is to talk about their agenda."
Though the "Stop the Greed Agenda" effort coincides with high election season, it will extend beyond November, Mr. Varoga said, adding that Patriot Majority USA plans to spend millions of dollars on the push through "the end of next year and beyond." New spots are coming in September, he said, and direct mail and ways for people to participate online are also in the works.
"The Koch brothers have been doing this for more than two decades," Mr. Varoga said. "Their agenda is not going to get undone or stopped in two weeks."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rationing Health Care More Fairly

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Older adults are understandably anxious about the political sniping over the future financing of Medicare. That is precisely the intention of the presidential campaigns.Yet the cross-fire over who will cut Medicare by how much sidesteps a critical issue about the future of our medical care: If we must ration our care to hold down costs in the future, how can we do it in a fair, efficient and transparent way?
Mitt Romney's campaign was brazenly misleading in its charge that the president's health plan would cut medical services to older adults by reducing Medicare spending by $716 billion. The president's savings will come mostly from smaller payments to managed care companies, which provide the same services as Medicare at a higher cost, and from slower growth in reimbursement rates to health care providers.
But the response of President Obama's campaign also aimed to stoke voters' fears. It stressed -- rightly -- that the plan to curb Medicare costs proposed last year by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate, would add thousands of dollars to older Americans' out-of-pocket expenditures. Yet it ignored Mr. Ryan's recent efforts to soften the plan. 
Both campaigns claim they are out to protect future health care. Yet the sniping hides the real issue. Protecting federal health programs over the long term, as the population ages and medical costs keep rising faster than economic growth, will require curbing the programs' spending. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that.
The federal government's spending on health care consumes 4.8 percent of the nation's economic production and is expected to eat up 9.2 percent in 25 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. A vast majority of economists agree that restoring a sustainable budget will mean either cuts in Medicare and Medicaid or a tax increase on the middle class.
Decisions will have to be made about what services are not worth the cost. Yet so far, our political leaders have failed to acknowledge this to voters, offering instead an illusion that we can resolve the matter without any pain.
Recall the political firestorm in 2009 when the Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women start regular screening for breast cancer at age 50 rather than 40. ''This is how rationing begins,'' said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. ''This is when you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician.''
The task force is an independent panel of experts financed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Doctors and private insurers usually follow its recommendations. Still, in 2010 -- after Mr. Obama's health reform legislation passed Congress -- the department said that insurers should ignore its latest findings and instead go back to its recommendation from 2002: that women start screening at 40.
Does it make sense that older adults in their last year of life consume more than a quarter of Medicare's expenditures, costing more than six times as much as other beneficiaries? Are there limits to what Medicare should spend on a therapy prolonging someone's life by a month or two?
It's a tough political call. In light of the difficulties, our political leaders have preferred to punt on the issue, hoping it doesn't have to be decided on their watch. Instead, when they talk about health care, they call rationing by some other name.
Rationing is inevitable in a world with finite resources. We do it in this country, too, and it is still one of the least fair and most inefficient rationing systems in the world. You get care if you have the money to pay for it; if not, you probably won't.
The 30 percent of the population who are the heaviest users of health care account for nearly 89 percent of health care expenditures, according to a government study. But high-income Americans are more likely to see a doctor when they are sick, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the disparity between rich and poor is much higher than in other developed countries.
Meanwhile, tens of millions of Americans -- those whose employers don't provide health insurance, who are too poor to pay for it themselves and yet are too rich to use Medicaid -- get the least health care of all.
A study of hospital emergency rooms in Wisconsin found that victims of severe traffic accidents without health insurance got 20 percent less care. Hospitals spent $3,300 more on average for each victim who was insured. They kept the insured 9.2 days, on average, and the uninsured just 6.4 days. Unsurprisingly, the uninsured were 40 percent more likely to die from their injuries.
Every health care proposal from the right and the left includes some form of implicit rationing device. Mr. Ryan's plan, on the Republican side, would keep spending on Medicare under 4.75 percent of the nation's output until 2050 by giving older adults born after 1958 a dollop of money to buy their own insurance, forcing many to choose cheaper plans or fewer procedures.
The president's health care reform encourages rationing, too, by levying a tax on ''Cadillac'' insurance plans, and in turn pushing employers to seek cheaper options and lower costs. It creates an advisory board to cut costs from Medicare if spending rises above a set rate. And it finances an institute to evaluate which therapies are most clinically effective. Careful to avoid political blowback, the president's plan forbids Medicare to base its reimbursement decisions on the institute's findings.
But neither initiative seems likely to solve our health care financing squeeze over the long term. The cuts proposed by Mr. Ryan -- shifting the risk of health care inflation onto the shoulders of older adults -- are certainly drastic. They also seem politically unfeasible. Under Mr. Ryan's most recent proposals, in 2030 Medicare would spend $2,200 less in today's money on each new enrollee than under the most likely outcome envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office based on current policies. By 2050, it would pay $8,000 less. Voters seem to think that might be too drastic a cut.
The president's plan was more about offering health insurance to all, to end our Dickensian system of rationing by income, than long-term cost control. Savings mandated by the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years will be difficult to maintain beyond that.
It puts a lot of faith on eliminating waste, with potentially large savings. David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard, argues that a third of our health care dollars go to therapies that do not improve our health. A lot of that waste could be slashed simply by no longer paying providers a fee for each service, whether we need it or not, and paying them instead to keep us healthy.
Going after waste seems sensible in a health care system that costs more than almost any other in the developed world, yet delivers lower-quality care. But savings from waste tend to be hard to achieve. Even with the Affordable Care Act in place, federal health spending will eat up almost twice as much of this nation's economic product in 2037 as it does today, according to the budget office.
While it is reasonable for politicians to shy away from rationing -- especially when voters believe no expense should be spared to save a human life -- if the experience of other countries serves as precedent, they will probably get there sooner or later. In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence determines what therapies will be covered by the National Health Service. It generally recommends against paying for a therapy that costs more than $31,000 to $47,000 for each year of life gained, adjusted for quality.
Putting a value on life, as it were, is controversial. The National Institute in Britain has denied or limited coverage of expensive drugs for ailments like pancreatic cancer, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's. But in a world of limited budgets, such decisions must be made.
Similar systems exist in many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, where the government decided not to pay for a universal vaccine against pneumococcal disease until its price fell to 25,000 New Zealand dollars (about $20,000) per quality-adjusted life year.
Though this concept may sound foreign, Washington has been putting a price on life since the administration of Ronald Reagan -- who determined that regulations should pass through a strict cost-benefit analysis, with values placed on factors like life and health. The Environmental Protection Agency values a life at about $9 million today. In 2009, the Transportation Department used a price tag of about $6 million. If safety improvements on a road were projected to cost more than the value of the lives expected to be saved by the improvement, the project would be deemed too expensive.
This approach has been contentious. And it has had an impact on Americans' health. In 1991 an appeals court reversed the E.P.A.'s decision to ban asbestos on the ground that it was too costly. The E.P.A., it argued, ''would have this court believe that Congress, when it enacted its requirement that the E.P.A. consider the economic impacts of its regulations, thought that spending $200 million to $300 million to save approximately seven lives (approximately $30 million to $40 million per life) over 13 years is reasonable.'' The court disagreed.
Medicare could well be forced, one day, to make similar evaluations.

HEADLINE: A Quick End to TARP Means a Smaller Payoff for Taxpayers

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The government is trying to sell its preferred stock holdings of the smaller banks, but the potential losses from the auctions could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 

 BODY:
Quietly, the Treasury Department is engaged in another bailout of the banks. This time, it's America's small banks that are the lucky duckies.
The federal government still holds investments in hundreds of small banks around the country in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, otherwise known as the bailout. In an effort to wind down TARP, the government is trying to sell off its holdings of preferred stock of the remaining smaller banks.
The problem is that the Treasury Department isn't getting great bids on some of the bank paper, even on the shares of banks with strong profits and strong capital. When the government sold its holdings in MetroCorp Bancshares of Houston this month, the bank itself bought back most of it - at 98 cents on the dollar. Wilshire Bancorp of Los Angeles bought back its paper at 94 cents on the dollar. The Treasury Department sold preferred shares of Ohio-based First Defiance at 96 cents, and Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina at 93 cents. All of these are regarded as healthy.
 Who makes up the difference? Taxpayers, of course.
Treasury officials say that is what the market is willing to bear. But the government doesn't have to sell now, and it doesn't have to settle for less than a full repayment.
Why should healthy banks or hedge fund investors get a gift so that the Obama administration can score some political points by raising the number of banks that have left the program? For all the generous breaks that the government gave the gargantuan banks in the bailout, they all at least paid TARP back at 100 cents on the dollar. Why shouldn't the small ones pay 100 cents on the dollar like the big boys?
Sure, the bank portion of TARP has been profitable so far. The Treasury Department estimates that it will make almost $22 billion from its bank support programs. That includes an estimated $3 billion loss from the smaller banks' paper.
"We are winding down the program, at a profit to taxpayers. The program was successful in what it was designed to do," which was to save the financial system, said Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department's point man on TARP. The agency is focused on "what is the way to maximize value, given that it is a temporary program," he said. "The government is not in the business of running an investment fund and is not in the business of owning stakes in private companies."
In the auctions, the government has been mainly selling shares it has left of the bigger and healthier small banks. Given that it has sold these shares at discounts, it bodes ill for the stock of the weaker ones that the government still holds, many of which are closely owned and more difficult to unload. Indeed, the Treasury Department didn't get a sufficient bidfor some the items in its most recent auction.
Unfortunately, this quiet bailout could get worse if the government continues with its plan.
Treasury officials are contemplating a plan to pool a bunch of these small-bank preferred shares in order to accelerate the sales. The ostensible logic is that a pool - akin to creating shares in a bank mutual fund - will widen the number of potential buyers and raise prices.
Instead, however, this is likely to deepen the discounts. Any large potential investor would still not find it worth the time to analyze each bank in the pool. Rather, the bidder is likely to apply a discount to anticipate any losses.
The potential taxpayer losses from selling shares at too deep a discount could be in the hundreds of millions. Granted, that's not huge when measured against the size of the TARP program, the profits it has made already or the federal budget. But it is big as an absolute figure. It seems likely that some of these losses could be avoided.
You have to feel for the Treasury Department a bit here. It has been assailed from every side for the way it has run TARP. Recently, critics have wondered what its plan was for ending the program. Now that it has a program, critics are attacking that, too.
But much of these problems are of the government's own making. The difficulty the Treasury Department faces is a reminder of just how good the TARP terms were for the banks. Everything that makes the bonds unattractive now for investors made the preferred stock wonderful for banks.
The dividend was a comfortable 5 percent. It will soon bump up to 9 percent, but that is still not onerous for many small, privately held banks. Moreover, some banks in the program can skip the dividend payments at any time. If they miss a payment, they have no obligation to make it up. And the preferred shares never expire, so the banks could keep them as long as they want.
It's a measure of how ungrateful the banks were that even on these generous terms, they still howled about the program and wanted out. Mainly that was because of certain restrictions on executive compensation.
So what's going on here with the Treasury Department? Compass Point Research and Trading, a broker dealer that has been analyzing the auctions, put it delicately in a recent note: "The current administration is very motivated to unwind its crisis-related investments."
Translation: The world has moved on, and the Obama administration seems to be counting on being able to run down the program as quickly as possible without too much scrutiny. TARP is one of the least popular government programs these days (and that's saying something). A job managing TARP no longer burnishes résumés, if it ever did.
But it sure is too bad that, after saving the banking system, taxpayers won't get the best returns we can.
An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to the ability of banks to skip dividend payments under TARP. Not all banks can skip the payments; banks that are bank holding companies cannot.

HEADLINE: Is Deficit Spending the Answer?

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Different types of deficit spending affect the economy in different ways, some helping with job creation and others rewarding those who do not work, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Deficit spending comes in several different flavors, each of which varies in terms of its effect on the labor market and the economy.
Deficit spending occurs when government spending exceeds government revenue. By official estimates, the federal government budget deficit has been $1.3 trillion during the last three fiscal years and even larger the year before that, when the financial crisis and bailouts were at their peaks. Previously, the federal deficit had never reached $0.5 trillion.
The alternatives to deficit spending are a balanced budget or a surplus budget, when government revenue is at least as much as its spending.
Economists do not fully agree about the macroeconomic effects of deficit spending, compared with the balanced-budget alternative, but they do agree that not all deficit spending is the same. Deficit spending that is the result of extra government spending is different from deficits that come from tax cuts. Moreover, the forms of the extra spending matter, as do the forms of the tax cuts and how the debt will be repaid in the future.

One form of deficit spending is extra government employment (civilian or military), as during wartime, paid for with extra taxes after the war is over. This type of spending probably increases aggregate employment during the war because the government is paying people to work and, while the deficit spending lasts, not yet taxing them extra for working.
This type of deficit spending is relevant today, because America continues to fight wars in the Middle East and to fight the war on drugs in our hemisphere. However, this type is not much different during the last four years of trillion-plus deficits than it was before.
The more important source of enlarged federal deficits is increased spending on transfers, like food stamps and unemployment insurance, and in-kind subsidies for the poor, like Medicaid. Transfer spending helps poor people, but paying people for low incomes or for unemployment has the effect of reducing the reward to work, rather than increasing it as government employment programs might.
By considering work incentives, I conclude that the contribution of transfer spending to the deficits of the last four years have reduced employment, rather than increasing it as wartime deficits might.
The temporary payroll tax cut has also added to the government deficit over the last two years. The payroll tax is levied on people who work and not on people who are out of work, so the cut had the effect of reducing the tax penalty on work. This helped offset the employment-depressing effect of transfers, although my estimates suggest that the offset was less than 100 percent (more on those in future blog entries).
Deficit spending adds to the government debt, because the government has to borrow to obtain the funds it does not have from taxes. It is sometimes argued that deficit spending reduces employment because of fears over the future repayment of the debt. But future fears can also encourage people to work harder to save more for the bad economic situation that is anticipated in the future and to work harder to take advantage of today's tax rates, which might seem low compared with what lies ahead.
Moreover, the bond market pays dearly for United States government bonds: they may be the most expensive bonds (that is, the bonds with the lowest yields) in the world. If the market continues to value United States government bonds so dearly, much of the United States debt may never need to be paid off.
This may seem like a free lunch, but economists understand it as a "liquidity service," or feeling of safety that the government supplies to the marketplace for which the government is compensated (Milton Friedman's classic argument said low yields on government securities indicate that more of the securities should be supplied to the market).
The secret to understanding the effects of deficit spending on the labor market and the economy is to examine the incentives created by the additional spending and by tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Placing Blame for Middle-Class Doldrums

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A Pew survey asked to what extent various groups were responsible "for the difficulties the middle class has faced in the past 10 years." 

 BODY:
6:06 p.m. | Updated 
We are in the midst of examining the major causes of the income slowdown over the past decade and beyond. As it happens, the Pew Research Center asked a more pointed version of this question in its recent poll on the middle class: Who's at fault?To the 85 percent of self-described middle-class respondents who said that middle-class families were having a harder time maintaining their standard of living, Pew then asked how much people blamed each of the following groups "for the difficulties the middle class has faced in the past 10 years." The possible answers were: a lot; a little; not at all; don't know. 

Below are the percentages for each group that answered "a lot":
Congress: 62%
Banks and financial institutions: 54%
Large corporations: 47%
The Bush administration: 44%
Foreign competition: 39%
The Obama administration: 34%
Middle-class people themselves: 8%
Based on a subsample of 1,093 from a survey of 2,508 adults living in the United States, from July 16 to 26, 2012. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the group answering a question in the Pew survey. It was 85 percent of self-described middle-class respondents -- not 85 percent of all respondents -- who said middle-class families were having a harder time maintaining their standard of living, and were then asked a follow-up question.

HEADLINE: The New Citigroup Isn't Your Father's Citicorp

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, has entered the debate over splitting up big banks. But did he overstate one of his key points? 

 BODY:
Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, has entered the debate over splitting up big banks. But did he overstate one of his key points?
For supporters of separating investment banking activities from more traditional banking businesses, Citigroup makes an attractive target. At the bank, Wall Street and Main Street businesses were brought under the same roof through a series of over ambitious mergers. 
Citigroup entered the financial crisis as a huge, highly complex institution that ended up needing a bigger bailout than any other bank. It has since struggled to regain its footing, not to mention the favor of shareholders. Then, last month, none other than Sanford I. Weill, the executive who cobbled together the Citigroup colossus, called for big banks to be broken up. 
 Mr. Pandit's defense is that Citigroup has streamlined and refocused, and is no longer the unwieldy giant it once was. Instead, it is much more like Citicorp, the entity that Mr. Weill merged with Travelers in 1998 to form Citigroup. 
"What's left here is essentially the old Citicorp," he told The Financial Times for an article on Monday. 
Citigroup still has an entity called Citicorp, which today comprises the businesses that the bank still wants to pursue and in which it feels it has a competitive advantage. Citigroup's "unwanted" businesses and assets, many of which got the bank into hot water, are housed in an entity called Citi Holdings that is meant to be decreased in size over time. 
Mr. Pandit's point is that we should think of Citigroup as being much like the old Citicorp. 
That may be a stretch in at least one important area. Today's Citicorp looks to be much more reliant on often volatile Wall Street businesses than the old one, and it has a huge presence in global capital markets. The Wall Street-focused operations within today's Citicorp had $912 billion of average assets in the second quarter of this year. That is only marginally behind the $952 billion at Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank in the United States. JPMorgan Chase's investment bank trailed far behind Citicorp's, with $841 billion of average assets in the second quarter.
The modern Citicorp's emphasis can be seen in other metrics. In 1998, Citicorp's trading revenue was 8 percent of its total revenue. By contrast, trading revenue last year accounted for 23 percent of the Citicorp unit's total. 
The old Citicorp was still filing an annual report in 2004. In that document, it broke out revenue for a group of businesses that included Wall Street activities. This "capital markets and banking" segment accounted for 13 percent of Citicorp's total revenue in 2004. Today's Citicorp unit has similar businesses grouped together under the title "securities and banking." That group generated a third of the Citicorp unit's revenue last year. 
"Citi has returned to the basics of banking and has streamlined our business around our core areas of strength - global institutional and consumer banking - with a clear structure and a clear strategy," Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Whose Ryan Is It Anyway?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins discuss Paul Ryan, the Ryan plan and whether good parents make good presidents. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, welcome back! You missed so much while you were on vacation. Tim Pawlenty is the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and Michele Bachmann is going to make the keynote speech at the convention, and Donald Trump will be leading the invocation.
David Brooks: Fantastic! All the prayers I made while at Chartres Cathedral have been answered.
Gail: Just kidding. I have been dying to ask you about Paul Ryan. You're a fan of his, right? Wasn't he the one you were hoping Romney would pick for vice president?
David: I was hoping for Rob Portman, actually, mostly for crass political reasons. I think the Ryan pick is a political mistake. The most unpopular group in American politics is House Republicans. I thought it was essential for Romney to distance himself from them. Instead, he picks one. I continue to believe taking on entitlement spending is simultaneously a policy necessity and a political disaster.
That said, I think substantively the pick is a triumph. Ryan and I disagree on many things and have debated them. The American Enterprise Institute even made an e-book out of one of our debates.
Gail: You know that's pretty cool, being an e-book with the vice-presidential nominee. I'm trying to imagine what the equivalent would have been 100 years ago. Publishing your correspondence with James Sherman? Somehow this seems much niftier.
David: I have enormous respect for Ryan and I regard most of the commentary I've read about him by people who've never even interviewed him to be ludicrous.
One thing that people miss is how supple a strategist he is. Two years ago, the Republican Party was dominated by two groups. First, there were the Tea Partiers, who wanted to close down every agency that didn't exist in 1789. Then there were the pols, who didn't see the use in standing for anything controversial. It would be politically easier just to oppose Obama.
Ryan understood that both postures would be bad for the country and he doggedly co-opted both tendencies. He took the Tea Party movement and pulled it behind his mainstream Republican agenda. He got the pols to commit to his politically perilous policy ideas. He did this through sheer determination, canniness and the power of ideas.
It was one of the most impressive political acts I've witnessed in my entire career.
Gail: I was looking forward to seeing what Ryan would bring to the campaign. Right off the bat, I liked the story about him catching catfish with his bare hands and dragging them out of the river by the throat. And everyone was sure he'd turn the political discussion toward hard-core policy issues. Which I liked, since I was getting a little tired of Bain Capital and the tax returns.
But on the policy end, Ryan the candidate has been awful! When he talks about entitlements, he just complains about the $700 billion Obama wanted to cut out of Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers. A $700 billion cut Ryan included in his own budget! But now we're supposed to understand that was some sort of a slip-up at the duplicating machines.
David: To be fair, Obama used his $700 billion to pay for a new entitlement, while Ryan plowed the money back into the system. Still, I take your point. I think Obama is mostly to be praised for having the guts to at least take some money out of the system, even if health care providers will probably just make it back by providing more services.
Gail: What Ryan is doing now is exactly what the Republicans did when Obama brought out his health care plan. All the allegedly serious fiscal conservatives wringing their hands about Medicare costs and taking tough stands. Then when the President actually something about it, instead of complaining that his approach didn't save enough, or that it would be inefficient, all the fiscal conservatives jumped up and howled: "He's taking money away from seniors!"
David: I agree, I completely agree. But to be fair Romney and Ryan do have an incredibly brave and sensible Medicare reform package on offer. It's written down. It's on paper. I don't see anything comparably brave from the Democratic side.
Gail: Obviously both sides have been trying to avoid hard truths by fudging the numbers - I don't think anybody really believes the Democrats can erase the deficit just by raising taxes on the wealthy. But Ryan is supposed to be the champ at forcing us to look at unpleasant facts. Really, if you're eager to cut health services to the poor and food stamps and have a history of sponsoring anti-abortion bills that talk about "forcible rape," you'd better have a whole lot of credentials on the number crunching side.
But instead of hard truths, Ryan wants more tax cuts. Why do we need more tax cuts for the wealthy? And why is it there's no explanation about how to pay for them except the closing of unnamed loopholes?
David: Once again, I mostly agree. He hasn't been specific on some cuts, and he's got a tax-cutting agenda that is implausible in a country with an aging population and huge deficits already. But (and you knew this was coming) it's a little unrealistic to ask politicians in an election year to be super-explicit about who is going to get gored. This is setting up a standard nobody applies to the pols on their own side.
Obama wants to extend tax cuts on 98 percent of Americans. That's completely unrealistic too. Obama seems to operate as if Medicare is a sustainable program, which it isn't.
Gail: I think the health care plan will be able to wrestle down some of the cost of Medicare, if the Republicans will stop yelling about death panels. But I agree on the tax front. Everybody should admit that tax cuts are off the table, period.
David: At least Ryan has a series of proposals that have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Under current policy, C.B.O. has the total public debt soaring from 74 percent of G.D.P. today to over 80 percent of G.D.P. by 2022. Under the last Ryan plan, C.B.O. projects that the debt will shrink to 63 percent of G.D.P. by 2022.
I don't see how anybody can say that Ryan is unserious when, unlike most national pols, he actually has a budget detailed enough for C.B.O. to score.
Gail: Ryan is constantly bemoaning the huge amount of debt the Republicans rolled up during the Bush years, due to unfunded spending and tax cuts. It would be hard for me to take him seriously in any case, given that he did vote for all of it. But the least he could do was refrain from gearing up to do it all over again.
David: You say the Ryan budget would roll up a huge amount of debt, but the C.B.O. disagrees.
Gail: On the plus side, I understand Ryan is a good family man. That seems to be the mantra this year. Nobody on either side is a military veteran, so they can no longer say "I honor his service" as a preface to every insult. Instead, we'll be hearing tributes to their excellent work as husbands and fathers from now until Election Day.
David: Some political scientist should figure out if good mothers and fathers make good politicians. Reagan was a bad father but a good president. Lincoln was an overindulgent father and a great president. J.F.K. was a terrible family man and a middling president. Truman was an overprotective father and a good president. Nixon was a good father (I think) and a bad president who did some good things. I'm not seeing any correlation here.
Gail: Don't give up on the good-family-man line. Otherwise, they'll have to spend the rest of the campaign praising one another's shoes.

HEADLINE: Death of a Strongman

BYLINE: DAYO OLOPADE


HIGHLIGHT: Ethiopians may be mourning the death of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, but they should worry about the legacy of his personality-centric development agenda. 

 BODY:
NAIROBI - After two months of mysterious absence, Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia's prime minister, is finally accounted for: He's dead.
By seeking medical treatment abroad he won admission to the club of African leaders who fled the health systems over which they presided in order to save their own necks.
Perhaps it's fitting, then, that Meles died at 57, the average life expectancy for his still underdeveloped country. More telling still, however, was the paranoid bureaucracy that kept the details of his illness out of Ethiopian newspapers for two months. This, too, is the legacy of a strongman.

Ethiopia, the second most populous nation in Africa, has dizzying economic potential. But its anxiously planned, autocratic governance structure has been jolted by Meles's death. Even as Ethiopians mourn, the coming uncertainty illustrates the danger of a personality-centric development agenda.
Since 1991, Meles had presided over the unapologetic consolidation of state power and regional influence, often by force. Few of the region's affairs unfolded outside of Meles's personal involvement.
Endorsing the Chinese model of state capitalism and central management, Meles was able to launch ambitious projects. These included an electricity grid connecting the rural areas where 83 percent of the population live to hydroelectric power from the Nile River, as well as a $23 billion pipeline to redirect oil from South Sudan to the port of Lamu in Kenya.
Pressing the flesh at the World Economic Forum or global climate talks in Durban and Copenhagen, he spoke for African interests with considerable charm. His cheerleading of food security in Ethiopia and beyond was genuinely refreshing. And, of course, the G.D.P. growth rates for Ethiopia have hovered in the double digits for the last five years.
But Ethiopia, like other "African lions," has work to do before its roaring economy actually reaches its enormous, impoverished population. Indeed, many of Ethiopia's recent successes were undergirded less by the country's inherent promise than by Meles's personal advocacy, ideology and assurances.
Meles's noted fluency with culture, economics and regional politics endeared him to China, Turkey and the warring governments in Sudan and South Sudan -- not to mention major donor countries like the United States and Britain, which bankrolled Ethiopia's development efforts in exchange for Meles's strong hand in regional security policy.
His tenure also saw wars with three of Ethiopia's neighbors - in the case of Eritrea, partly because of a deeply personal struggle with President Isaias Afwerki. And though Meles's diplomatic dexterity kept aid coming - and critiques of his human rights record off the table - as Amnesty International points out, Meles's self-centered reign has left Ethiopian prisons "packed to the seams with suspected political opponents - from urban intellectuals to rural farmers." With increasing fervor, he pulped opposition parties and erected one of the most restrictive media and surveillance environments in the world.
Even as his East African neighbors leaped ahead on telecommunications and Web infrastructure, Meles stoppered conversation. When I visited Ethiopia in March, the queue for a mobile SIM card was days long; this summer, his government sought to criminalize Skype.
Now Meles's successors will need to manage his blueprints without the benefits of his unusual mix of erudition and intimidation.

HEADLINE: New York's City Council Adds Climate Change Panels

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Planning for and adapting to climate change gained more formal status in the New York City Council when two new panels were added to the city's government structure. 

 BODY:
The exodus of City Hall aides has already begun as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's term approaches its end next year, but climate change isn't going anywhere. So in an attempt to continue Mr. Bloomberg's environmental focus long after he's gone, the City Council passed legislation on Wednesday that would make two panels advising the city on the threats of global warming a permanent fixture of government.
The bill, approved 44-0, will "institutionalize and regularly convene" both a panel of scientists known as the New York City Panel on Climate Change and a task force of government agencies and partners from the energy, telecommunications and other private sectors in charge of recommending how the city should adapt to more frequent storms and heat waves. Under current projections by the scientific panel, sea levels around New York will rise nearly five feet by the end of the century, posing an increased risk of major and more frequent coastal flooding.
The two panels, which receive no pay, were convened by Mayor Bloomberg in 2008 to help fulfill the goals of his environmental agenda for the city, known as PlaNYC. James F. Gennaro, who chairs the council's committee on environmental protection, said the legislation creates "an institutional government mechanism to assess the latest climate change science, plan for climate change impacts and implement adaptive strategies" and should serve as a model for other local and state governments.
The legislation broadens the responsibilities of the advisory bodies, including requiring the adaptation task force to create an inventory of potential risks to vulnerable populations like the elderly and low-income residents of industrial areas where flooding also raises the risk of toxic spills. It requires the scientific advisers to meet at least twice a year to review the latest climate change data and to update their projections every three years. The task force is then required to submit its recommendations a year after projections are released.
"We want to make sure that the work of climate change becomes as much a part of city government as repairing pot holes," said Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn. "We also want to make sure that PlaNYC remains a living document and a blueprint for the city."

HEADLINE: Talking Policy and Philosophy

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: At Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's first policy conference, there was discussion of environmental jobs and campaign finance reform. 

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is looking for ideas.
After checking off many items from his campaign agenda during his first two legislative sessions, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, convened his first gubernatorial "policy conference" in Manhattan on Wednesday with the purpose of brainstorming initiatives to tackle during the second half of his term.
Mr. Cuomo, who usually avoids talking about Democratic politics and plans to skip the bulk of his party's convention next month, used the gathering as a moment to philosophize about the role of government.
"Fundamentally, the Democratic Party believes in government," Mr. Cuomo said, adding, "The Democrat is arguing that the government as a vehicle for the collective can make a difference, and that we should try to do that - that it's not enough to strive for individual success, and a series of individual successes. We can do better, together."
The conference, held in a ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Midtown, was co-sponsored by the State Democratic Party; the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal advocacy group; and Third Way, an advocacy group of centrist Democrats. The event stirred speculation that Mr. Cuomo was trying to raise his profile in national Democratic circles, but it ended up being a relatively modest gathering: when Mr. Cuomo spoke, many of the attendees were his own aides. And much of the day's discussion was technical, not political, in nature, centered on PowerPoint slides and peppered with industry jargon.
In the morning, Mr. Cuomo sat with his teenage daughter Cara at a table in the front of the room and observed two panel discussions - one about leveraging scientific and technological innovations from academic research to spur economic growth, moderated by David J. Skorton, the president of Cornell University, and another about environmental-sector jobs, which included among its participants Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico and federal energy secretary.
Two demonstrators opposed to hydraulic fracturing interrupted the energy panel and were removed by the governor's security detail. Scores of hydrofracking protesters also lined the sidewalk opposite the hotel to urge Mr. Cuomo not to approve the use of the controversial form of gas drilling.
Mr. Cuomo left at lunchtime. In the afternoon, John Podesta, the chairman of the Center for American Progress Action Fund and a former White House chief of staff for President Clinton, led a panel discussion on campaign finance reform, which Mr. Cuomo has indicated will be one of his priorities for the rest of his term.
All three panels included a significant amount of praise for Mr. Cuomo, but there was little talk of his future as a possible contender for his party's presidential nomination. The only panelist to break that rule was Mr. Richardson, a former Democratic presidential hopeful himself. On the jobs panel, he highlighted Iowa as a state with a community college system that was training young people for jobs in renewable energy, and then said to Mr. Cuomo, "You'll learn a little bit about Iowa in the future." The audience laughed uncomfortably.

Today's Times

        
Representative Todd Akin on Tuesday defied his party's leaders and ignored a deadline for dropping out of Missouri's Senate race, Jonathan Weisman writes. Mr. Akin's decision came on the same day the Republican Party's platform committee endorsed a constitutional ban on abortion that does not include an explicit exception for rape.

        
Mr. Akin's record on abortion is largely indistinguishable from that of most of his Republican House colleagues, even as members of the House leadership have denounced the lawmaker's remarks, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Restricting abortion rights has been viewed as one of their top legislative priorities, and Democrats are planning to highlight the theme as the campaign season rolls on.

        
The attention and controversy generated by reports that Representative Kevin Yoder, Republican of Kansas, had gone skinny-dipping on a trip to Israel last summer cast an unwanted spotlightonce again on the practice of private groups paying for Congressional trips, Eric Lichtblau and Jodi Rudoren report.

        
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, is locked in a dead heat in the nation's most expensive Senate race, and he is distancing himself from the Republican presidential ticket in an effort to erase the notion of party politics from public consciousness, Katharine Q. Seelye reports.

        
President Obama took to the road on Tuesday to promote his record on education, presenting himself as the lucky product of affordable schooling and his opponent as the enemy of it. Mark Landler reports that the president's remarks showcased his methodical drive to make the election a stark choice between him and Mitt Romney on tax policy, Medicare and education - anything but the economy.

        
Mr. Romney's promise to restore $716 billion that he says President Obama "robbed" from Medicare has some health care experts puzzled, as repealing the savings would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by eight years, Jackie Calmes reports.

HEADLINE: A Virginia Baker Is in the Spotlight at a Ryan Rally

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican ticket has embraced a new small-business hero. On Wednesday, the owner of a bakery who last week turned away Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced Representative Paul D. Ryan at a rally. 

 BODY:
ROANOKE, Va. - Joe the Plumber, meet Chris the Baker. 
The Republican ticket has embraced a new small-business hero. On Wednesday, the owner of a bakery who last week turned away Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced Representative Paul D. Ryan at a rally in this city where President Obama uttered his "You didn't build that" remark. 
Chris McMurray, the owner of Crumb and Get It Cookie Company with his wife, told a crowd at another small business, a hardware store, "We are gathered here today to send a message to the Obama-Biden team that we did build it.''
Mr. McMurray said the Biden campaign approached him to ask if the vice president could drop by his cookie shop while campaigning, and he replied, "Nothing personal, but I just happened to disagree with the president and the vice president on a few things."
The story vaulted from local news to the Drudge Report and conservative blogs, and voilà, Mr. McMurray became the latest small-business owner spotlighted by the Romney-Ryan campaign in a monthlong hammering of Mr. Obama for supposed anti-business attitudes and policies. 
Fact-checkers and the Obama campaign complain that Republicans are willfully twisting the president's remark - he was referring to government investment in infrastructure, not denying entrepreneurs credit for their companies - but the line become just one of many yanked from context in an intensely heated political season. 
Mr. Ryan's account of Mr. Obama's remarks continued the misrepresentation of what the president said on July 13 in front of a Roanoke firehouse. "He did say if you have a small business, you did not build that, someone else did," Mr. Ryan said, after thanking Mr. McMurray for his spirited introduction, which had the crowd chanting "We built it! We built it!" 
"He just gave my speech,'' Mr. Ryan said. "I'm voting for that guy, for Chris.''
It's clear that Mr. Obama's literal meaning is no longer the issue; the line has grown long political legs because for the Romney-Ryan team it is emblematic of the broad choice in November: between Mr. Romney's business success and Mr. Obama's desire to raise taxes on the highest earners, which Republicans say will hamper "job creators.''
"The president makes these comments that kind of reveals his mindset, his philosophy of government,'' Mr. Ryan said. "It tells us that he believes in a government-centered society with a government-driven economy. That doesn't work. It never has worked. That's what Europe has, and look at what it's doing to Europe.''
It was Mr. Ryan's fourth day of campaigning in Virginia, a state Mr. Obama won in 2008, since Mitt Romney announced his selection as his running mate. 
"You deliver Virginia, you save the American idea,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Akin Remarks Push Gender Issues to Center Stage

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Todd Akin's refusal to step aside in the Missouri Senate race has forced gender issues back into the political conversation, just as Mitt Romney was hoping to refocus it on his personal story and the nation's struggling economy. 

 BODY:
Just days before Mitt Romney formally assumes the leadership of his party, he and his Republican colleagues are once again confronting the party's long-standing difficulty attracting the support of women - a demographic reality that could cost Mr. Romney the White House.
Representative Todd Akin's refusal to step aside in the Missouri Senate race in the wake of his comments about rape and pregnancy has forced gender issues back into the political conversation just as Mr. Romney was hoping to refocus it on his personal story and the nation's struggling economy.
And the Republican Party's decision this week to endorse an anti-abortion plank at its convention - without an exception for rape - raises new questions about whether, and how, Mr. Romney and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, can close the party's gap in support among women.
In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, President Obama leads Mr. Romney among women by 10 percentage points, 51 percent to 41 percent.
In the last 24 hours, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have all but ignored the broader issues of abortion and gender politics on the trail. The subject did not come up at a joint town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire on Monday morning, and Mr. Ryan did not bring up the issue at a rally in Roanoke, Va.,Wednesday morning.
Mr. Ryan, who co-sponsored a bill with Mr. Akin that aimed to restrict the definition of rape, was pressed on Mr. Akin's comments in a television interview Wednesday morning. Mr. Ryan declared that "rape is rape, and there's no splitting hairs over rape." He defended his record on abortion but said Mr. Romney would set policy as president.
"I'm proud of my pro-life record. And I stand by my pro-life record in Congress," Mr. Ryan said on Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV. "It's something I'm proud of. But Mitt Romney is the top of the ticket and Mitt Romney will be president, and he will set the policy of the Romney administration."
Democrats have seized on the Akin comments - which have been condemned by Mr. Romney and most Republican leaders - much the way they did when the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called the contraception activist Sandra Fluke "a slut." Democrats announced on Wednesday that Ms. Fluke would speak at the Democratic convention in Charlotte next month.
The president's team had already been running ads aimed at convincing women that Mr. Romney would undermine abortion rights and cut funding for contraception and women's health services. Now, the Democratic campaign is hoping those messages have even more impact.
In one Obama ad, a woman says: "I've never felt this way before, but it's a scary time to be a woman. Mitt Romney is just so out of touch."
Emily's List, a campaign group that promotes Democratic women, sought to link a host of House Republicans to Mr. Akin's views. The group singled out 13 House Republicans - including one freshman woman, Vicky Hartzler of Missouri - who are all being challenged by a Democratic woman who favors abortion rights. The 13 Republicans all co-sponsored anti-abortion legislation last year that sought to narrow the exemption for federal funding from rape to "forcible rape."
"I wish Todd Akin's backwards thinking made him an outlier," said Emily's List president, Stephanie Schriock. "But the truth is, he's totally in line with today's Republican Party."
Top aides to Mr. Romney have criticized the abortion ads as inaccurate and misleading, noting that Mr. Romney has always supported keeping abortion legal in cases of rape and incest. But after Mr. Akin's comments and the party's platform actions, it is not clear whether Mr. Romney's campaign plans new efforts to reach out to women.
Republican aides declined to discuss Mr. Akin's situation or the party platform, referring questions about Mr. Akin to the public comments Mr. Romney has made in interviews. In a statement issued Tuesday, Mr. Romney called on him to step aside.
"Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong, and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country," Mr. Romney said. "His fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race."
Other Republicans, who are keenly aware of the damage that Mr. Akin's comments on rape could do to the party's support among women, have been quick to condemn his choice of words. Representative Jo Ann Emerson, a nine-term Republican from Missouri, came out strongly against her House colleague.
"Todd Akin made a reprehensible, inexcusable and dangerous comment," she said in a statement. "He was wrong to say what he did about rape, and the ignorance of that view has no place in our party, in our culture or in our country."
The issue of how to narrow the gender gap was always going to be difficult for Mr. Romney, whose passed up an opportunity to put another woman on his ticket by picking Mr. Ryan, the House budget chairman, as his running mate.
Instead, Republican convention planners are hoping to present a series of leading women as speakers when the convention starts in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. Chief among them is Ann Romney, whose popularity easily exceeds her husband's and who is scheduled to speak on Monday evening.
Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, will each have prominent speaking roles at the convention, officials announced this month.
"They are some of our party's brightest stars, who have governed and led effectively and admirably in their respective roles," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said.
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the party's 2008 vice-presidential nominee, will not speak at the convention. But in an indication of how little support Mr. Akin has, even among conservatives, Ms. Palin called on Mr. Akin to step aside Tuesday.
"We have to think, well, what's another option? Is a third party another option?" Ms. Palin saidon Fox News's "On the Record" program. "If it is, let's go. The status quo has got to go."
But Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan has also complicated his campaign's outreach to women by adding Mr. Ryan's record in Congress to the list of positions that Mr. Romney must explain and defend.
In addition to the bill he co-sponsored with Mr. Akin that would have restricted the definition of rape, Mr. Ryan also voted for dozens of bills that sought to oppose or restrict abortion rights, earning him high marks with groups that advocate against abortion.
Now that Mr. Ryan is part of the Republican ticket, Mr. Romney and his campaign strategists must find a way to incorporate his record on gender issues into the campaign's broader message aimed at women.

HEADLINE: Romney Returns to His Mainstay: The Economy

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: During a campaign stop in Iowa on Wednesday, Mitt Romney said President Obama had failed to deal with deficits and unemployment. 

 BODY:
BETTENDORF, Iowa - With the unwanted distractions of Representative Todd Akin's "legitimate rape" comments still swirling in the background on Wednesday, Mitt Romney returned to his political mainstay during a campaign stop at LeClaire Manufacturing here - hitting President Obama over the economy.
From the signage in the backdrop ("We Did Build It!") to the shirts the company's employees wore (navy blue T-shirts, courtesy of the campaign, saying "Government didn't build my business - I did"), Mr. Romney's rally in Iowa was designed to return attention to comments Mr. Obama made last month, when he said, "If you've got a business - you didn't build that."
The president was referring to the government infrastructure that he said helps businesses thrive. But the Romney campaign quickly pounced, seizing the remarks as a convenient shorthand to explain why, in their view, the economy is not growing as quickly as it should.
Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds, who helped introduce Mr. Romney, said that he understood what went into creating a successful enterprise.
"Isn't it exciting to have someone running for the president who understands what it takes to build a stronger economy?" Ms. Reynolds said. "Mitt Romney understands that this economy runs on and was built by individual entrepreneurs pursing the American dream. President Obama's naïve economic policies have failed us."
Mr. Romney also wasted no time before tearing into Mr. Obama.
"President Obama, bless his heart, has tried to substitute government for free people, and it has not worked, and it'll never work," Mr. Romney said. "I mentioned he said he'd cut the deficit in half - he doubled it. He said he'd get people good jobs. Instead, we've gone 42 straight months with unemployment over 8 percent. Twenty-three million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work. It's inexcusable."
He also echoed a point that both he and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, have previously made on the trail: that individuals are not empowered by their government.
"That insight of the power of the individual is what led the founders of this country, in the founding documents of this nation, to write words that changed the world," he said. "They said that our rights came from God, not from government, from God."
Mr. Romney urged the crowd to be skeptical of government investments. 
"We're finally going to have to stop spending at the government level more than we take in," he said. "Let me tell you, you've got to beware of government bearing gifts because you're paying for those gifts."
At one point, roughly midway through his speech, Mr. Romney was interrupted by a heckler. 
"I'll answer your question in a moment, but if you'll sit down and let me speak, then I'll let you ask your question," Mr. Romney told the rowdy man. "You know there is always an occasion to ask me questions. I'm happy to answer those questions, but only when we come to question-and-answer time."
As the crowd drowned out the heckler with chants of "U.S.A.," Mr. Romney added: "If that gentleman wants to wait outside, and ask me a question, I'm happy to answer it."
After the event, however, Mr. Romney headed to a private area to do some local television interviews, and the heckler had already left the property, having been escorted out of the event by the police.

HEADLINE: Obama Promotes His Education Credentials, Putting Down Romney's

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: At a rally at a Las Vegas high school, President Obama said: "I've got a question for Governor Romney: How many teachers' jobs are worth another tax cut for millionaires and billionaires?" 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - It's back-to-school time, and President Obama has been all but handing out three-ring binders and pencil sharpeners this week, as he promotes his education credentials and slams those of his challenger, Mitt Romney.
Speaking to a raucous rally at a high school here, Mr. Obama accused his Republican opponent of dismissing concerns about crowded classrooms. Mr. Romney, the president said, would impose deep cuts on education funding, as part of the favor-the-rich Republican budget drafted by his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan.
"I've got a question for Governor Romney: How many teachers' jobs are worth another tax cut for millionaires and billionaires?" he said. "That's not who we are. That's not how we built the greatest economy and the strongest middle class in the world."
Earlier, the president held a round table with three teachers at Canyon Springs High School, where one, Lori Elizabeth Henrickson, told him that she worried that teeming classes deprived students of the attention they need to learn. Clark County, where Las Vegas is, has the largest average class sizes in the nation, Mr. Obama said.
"Governor Romney says we've got enough teachers; we don't need any more," he said. "The way he talks about them, it seems as if he thinks they are a bunch of nameless government bureaucrats that we need to cut back on."
The teacher-heavy crowd of 2,720, packed into a gymnasium draped in basketball banners, was one of the most enthusiastic of Mr. Obama's campaign so far. But he was also interrupted by a protester, whose angry questions were drowned out by chants of "four more years," as security guards bundled him out of the room.
"That young man probably needed a good teacher," Mr. Obama said.
On the second day of Mr. Obama's education swing, he shifted focus from higher to secondary education, but kept up the combative tone. The president promoted his administration's granting of waivers to states from the testing requirements of the Bush-era education law, No Child Left Behind. He said he had tried to allocate federal money to rehire laid-off teachers, but had been stymied by House Republicans, including Mr. Ryan.
When the audience erupted in catcalls, he said, "Don't boo. Vote."
To reinforce the president's education message in other states, the campaign released a new 30-second commercial called "Children," which features an interview with parents in which they talk about the importance of smaller classes, while a narrator condemns Mr. Romney. It will be broadcast in Virginia and Ohio on Thursday. 
The growing intensity of the campaign is evident in Mr. Obama's schedule, which will put him on the road next week, in the battleground states of Iowa, Colorado and Virginia, during the first two days of the Republican National Convention. 
In elections past, candidates laid low during the conventions of their rivals. But such niceties have largely vanished in the last couple of cycles. Next week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will campaign in Tampa, Fla., even as the Republicans gather there. Mr. Obama is not scheduled to campaign on the day Mr. Romney accepts the nomination.
The president will maintain his back-to-school theme. His destinations -- Ames, Iowa; Fort Collins, Colo.; and Charlottesville, Va. -- are home to Iowa State University, Colorado State University and the University of Virginia.
It was Mr. Obama's 6th visit to Nevada this year, and the 11th since he took office, symbolizing how fiercely he is fighting to hang on to its 6 electoral votes. He won Nevada over Senator John McCain by 12 points in 2008.
By rights, say some analysts, Mr. Obama should be in trouble here: the state has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and is a national leader in foreclosures. Few places have been harder hit by the housing crisis, the lingering nature of which was illustrated by a billboard on the route of Mr. Obama's motorcade in Reno on Tuesday.
"Mortgage Forgiveness Ends in 2012," said the advertisement, promoting RenoShortSales.com, a company that specializes in liquidating houses with delinquent mortgages. It was referring to the expiration of a government program that allows homeowners to avoid paying taxes on loans forgiven by lenders, when they sell their homes.
On two previous visits to Nevada, Mr. Obama highlighted his response to the crisis, meeting with struggling homeowners and announcing a program to help people with good credit to refinance mortgages at low interest rates.
On this visit, though, Mr. Obama conspicuously failed to mention housing, aside from an oblique reference to Nevada's having "been through tougher times than most states." The Obama campaign, it was clear, was intent to stick to its message of education.

HEADLINE: Has Obama Made the Job Situation Worse?

BYLINE: ROBERT MCELVAINE


HIGHLIGHT: The facts on job creation do not support the Republican case against the president. 

 BODY:
"Without a doubt President Obama inherited a difficult situation. Here's the problem. He made it worse," Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has been saying in his stump speech.
Ryan's statement consists of two parts; the first is gross understatement, the second gross misstatement. It is the misstatement that is the essence of the case Republicans are putting before American voters: That President Obama has made the economy worse. Getting voters to believe that assertion is probably the Republicans' only hope of winning the election. 
In the latest poll (a Wall Street Journal and NBC News survey released on Tuesday), respondents favor President Obama over Gov. Romney - generally by wide margins - in almost every category other than improving the economy. On "caring about average people," for example, Obama is favored by an extraordinary margin to 52 percent to 30 percent.
So the argument that President Obama has made the economy worse is not only central to the Republicans' case, it's pretty much all they have. But the facts do not support their claims.
The following graph, which I put together using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, traces the annual rate of job creation under Democratic and Republican administrations from Harry Truman to Obama - with 2009 separated out as a year in which any fair-minded person would agree that the "difficult situation" Obama inherited was the main driving force. It dramatically illustrates just how wrong Ryan's assertion is.
Republicans who are wondering how Obama could be polling as well as he is with unemployment above 8 percent might want to take a look at this graph. It makes two points very clear.
First, jobs have historically, without exception, been created at a much faster rate under Democratic presidents than under Republicans.
Look at the 64-year period from the start of Harry Truman's presidency to the end of that of George W. Bush (1945-2009).
During the 28 years of Democratic administrations in that period, 57.5 million new jobs were created, an average of 2.05 million per year.
During the 36 years of Republican administrations in that period, 36.2 million new jobs were created, an average of 1.0 million per year.
The bottom line is that over the 64 years leading up to the inauguration of President Obama, jobs were created more than twice as fast under Democrats as they were under Republicans.
Even a glance at the graph shows that Barack Obama and his policies did not make the "difficult" - disastrous would be a more accurate term - situation he inherited worse.
Here is a second graphic illustration of what has happened in job creation under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It also uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In the eighteen months from the beginning of 2008 through the middle of 2009, a period fully shaped by the Bush economic program to which Republicans now want to return, (but before the Obama stimulus had a chance to take effect), approximately 7.5 million jobs were lost.
Over the most recent 18 months of the Obama administration, approximately 2.8 million jobs have been added.
That means that the average monthly job loss during the "difficult situation" before Obama's policies took effect was 417,000. Over the last year-and-a-half, the average monthly job gain has been 155,000.
If Rep. Ryan and Gov. Romney see that as making a bad situation worse, it should tell us something about their "vision."

HEADLINE: All the Single Ladies

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: After listening to Republican politicians and their proxies on TV and radio, I'm left wondering why any women vote for Republicans. 

 BODY:
The noxious "legitimate rape" comment by Todd Akin, Missouri congressman and Senate candidate, has me once again pondering a simple question: Why do women vote Republican?
The Republican establishment rushed in to pressure Akin to drop out of the race - something that he refused to do - in part because they want to win the seat, win control of the Senate and win Missouri for Romney. A SurveyUSA poll earlier this month - before "legitimate rape" - found Romney and Obama in a statistical tie in the state.
But as The New York Times pointed out Wednesday:
As a legislator, Mr. Akin has a record on abortion that is largely indistinguishable from those of most of his Republican House colleagues, who have viewed restricting abortion rights as one of their top priorities.
In fact, as this story reverberated through the public discourse, the Republican National Committee's platform committee passed what one committee member told the Washington Times "appears to be the most conservative platform in modern history." Among other things, it calls for a "human life amendment" with no exemption for rape or incest and praises "informed consent" laws.
Republicans are worried about the political fallout from Akin's comment, though.
Rush Limbaugh, who famously called the former Georgetown law student and women's birth control advocate Sandra Fluke a "slut," said that Akin's comment was "stupid" before adding:
I've seen all of the things that you've seen, people telling him he should go. He needs to get out for the good of the party, for the good of the country, for the good of the presidential campaign, and we gotta defeat Obama. I agree with that, by the way. I think there are a lot of things here larger than single individuals.
That's the point. As the former governor of Alaska put it: "take one for the team." (That's right, I'm still not using her name. You can't make me.)
The Republican Party already has a problem with women voters and can't afford to make it worse by having them focus on this issue. And that deficit is among single women, not married ones.
As Shaila Dewan pointed out in The New York Times earlier this month:
Single women are one of the country's fastest-growing demographic groups - there are 1.8 million more now than just two years ago. They make up a quarter of the voting-age population nationally, and even more in several swing states, including Nevada. And though they lean Democratic - in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, single women favored Mr. Obama over his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, by 29 points - they are also fickle about casting their ballots, preoccupied with making ends meet and alienated from a political system they say is increasingly deaf to their concerns.
On the one hand, the Republican establishment wants to battle the perception that the party is waging a war on women - which it is - by claiming that women's economic interests are separate and distinct from their health interests. But that's a false argument for many women because the two, particularly when it comes to reproductive control, are inextricably intertwined. Children dramatically affect one's financial bottom line.
Self-sufficiency is tied up in self-determination. Family planning is essential to career planning. This is particularly true for single women.
On the other hand, there are those on the fringe of the party who are less beholden to the establishment and constrained by convention. They air the party's frustration with these single women voters and don't try to disguise their disdain.
Earlier this month, the rhetorical bomb-thrower and media-monger Ann Coulter commented on the influence of Sandra Fluke in a Fox News interview:
I think it's probably a good sign that Obama is so desperate just to get the base Democratic voter - stupid, single women - to vote for him.
Then, in another Fox interview, Coulter, speaking this time about Republicans wooing the women's vote, said:
Ronald Reagan managed to win two landslides without winning the women's vote, but it is as you say, it's striking, it's not the women's vote generically, it is the single women's vote. And that's because single women look to the government to be their husbands and give them, you know, prenatal care, and preschool care, and kindergarten care, and school lunches.
The Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson - who has made a number of appearances on Fox News, founded a Tea Party group in California and is also the founder of a group called BOND (Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny) - recently gave a speech (I hope it wasn't a sermon), in which he said:
One of the primary reasons that it is over for America is because women are taking over, women are taking over, they're in high so-called powerful position, they're now running companies, they're making decisions.
He then pointed out that he was not referring to all women:
The are some, a few out there that are logical women and can make sound decisions, but most cannot.
He prattled on nonsensically for a while, adding that "women cannot handle power, it's not in them to handle power in the right way" and "women have been degraded, women are now degraded, they have no shame."
I'm getting upset just transcribing this, so let me just get to the meat of it. Here's the part of his speech I wanted you to see:
I think that one of the greatest mistakes that America made was to allow women the opportunity to vote. We should've never turned it over to women.
Why? Because "they're voting in people who are evil."
Now, on BOND's website, both Sean Hannity and Dennis Prager, another conservative radio host, are listed as members of BOND's advisory board. The Web site attributes the following endorsement to Hannity:
BOND has played an instrumental role in helping young men and women build lives which will help inspire the next generation. BOND continues to fight the good fight standing for the values of God, family, and country, and are deserving of our support.
And it attributes an endorsement to Prager that reads in part:
Whatever the issue, Jesse seeks truth and speaks with courage. Even on the few matters that I may not entirely agree with Jesse, he forces me to think a second and third time. He is so morally grounded and fearless that when we differ, my first reaction is to ask myself, 'Where did I go wrong?'
This brings me back to my original question: why do women vote Republican? Even if you are personally pro-life you don't have to be universally anti-choice. This is the party that attacks reproductive rights and limits women's health options - which has the effect of limiting women's economic liberty - and whose proxies on the radio and TV openly show disdain for women, especially those not hitched to a man.
Even if you're married now, you weren't always. You too were once a single lady.

HEADLINE: Many at Fed Ready to Act If Necessary

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY. 
David Pogue, whose State of the Art column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Many Federal Reserve officials at their most recent policy meeting pushed for further actions to support the economy if the recovery failed to strengthen over the summer, an official account released on Wednesday showed.''Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,'' according to the minutes of the meeting, which ended Aug. 1.
After that meeting, the Fed issued a statement that included stronger language to signal its commitment to helping the recovery. The minutes revealed that the committee had carefully chosen to say it ''will provide additional accommodation as needed.'' In June, it used softer phrasing, saying that the committee ''is prepared to take further action as appropriate.'' At the time, economists and analysts noted the change as a sign that the bank was more likely to act. 
The next chance for the Fed's policy-making committee to introduce measures is in September. The committee is to meet Sept. 12-13, and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, is also scheduled to hold a news conference.
With few signs of a substantial and sustainable strengthening evident this summer, the minutes solidified the expectations of investors that the central bank would undertake additional measures to support the recovery sometime in the coming months -- even if the unemployment rate dropped and growth picked up modestly.
For instance, Capital Economics, a consultancy, described another significant round of asset buying as a ''done deal'' in a note to clients Wednesday afternoon. It ''doesn't look like the Fed will be persuaded to hold fire in mid-September unless we see a dramatic improvement over the next couple of weeks,'' the consultancy said.
In response to the release of the Fed minutes, which usually come three weeks after the meeting, the dollar dropped relative to the Japanese yen and the euro. Stocks, which are near their highest prices in four years, rallied on the news after drifting lower in morning trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad index of the stocks of large publicly traded companies, rose 0.32 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,413.49.
After great anticipation ahead of its last meeting, the Fed's policy-making committee decided against taking action to bolster the economy, even as it said that the pace of the recovery had weakened through the first half of 2012. It repeated its pledge to support the economy if necessary.
''The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability,'' it said.
In the meeting, Fed officials discussed a ''number of policy tools'' that the central bank might use to stimulate the economy.
Keeping the federal funds rate near zero for a longer period than currently indicated is one option, the minutes showed. The Fed has said it will keep that rate low through 2014.
''It was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed,'' the meeting notes said.
''A few'' members suggested ''replacing the calendar date with guidance that was linked more directly'' to the economy, or removing any guidance as to when the rate would be increased.
The committee also discussed undertaking a new round of aggressive asset purchases to push down interest rates and spur investors to spend.
''A few participants'' expressed concern that new measures might ''increase the risks to financial stability or lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations.''
But ''many participants'' said that such a program would help the recovery by pushing down long-term interest rates and easing financial strains. ''Some'' participants also argued that new measures would bolster confidence.
The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent amid weak economic data in the spring and summer on manufacturing, consumer sentiment and industrial production. Persistent headwinds identified by the Fed and other economic analysts include high unemployment, a still-depressed housing sector and financial market strain emanating from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
In June, the Fed cut its official forecasts for growth both this year and next. It said it expected the economy to expand 1.9 to 2.4 percent in 2012, down from the forecast of 2.4 to 2.9 percent growth it made in April. In 2013, it expects growth of 2.2 to 2.8 percent, down from the 2.7 to 3.1 percent it forecast in April.
The Fed is already engaged in ambitious programs to support demand, bolster employment and support the wan recovery. It has cut its short-term interest rates to close to zero and held them there to encourage investment, and has said it will keep interest rates low at least through 2014. It is also engaged in a bond-buying program through the end of this year to bring down long-term interest rates.
Many market participants are betting on a big new round of bond buying -- called ''quantitative easing'' by central bankers and known as QE3, since the Fed has taken that action twice before.
But some Fed officials have expressed doubt about whether another such measure will work. The so-called hawks -- those more concerned with the specter of rising inflation -- have also argued that the Fed should abstain.

HEADLINE: Nina Bawden, 87, Author of 'Carrie's War'

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Nina Bawden, a writer for children and adults whose work included books born of personal tragedy, died on Wednesday at her home in London. She was 87.Her son, Robert, announced the death, The Associated Press reported.
The author of more than 40 books, including novels and volumes of nonfiction, Ms. Bawden (pronounced BAW-din) was celebrated in Britain as a writer for young people. Critics praised her finely drawn characters and her keen, sympathetic understanding of those characters' inner lives.
Her best-known title for children is ''Carrie's War,'' published in 1973. The story of an English girl's evacuation to a Welsh mining village during World War II, the novel was based on Ms. Bawden's own wartime evacuation. 
''Carrie's War'' was adapted twice for British television; the most recent adaptation was broadcast in the United States on the PBS series ''Masterpiece Theater'' in 2006.
Ms. Bawden's adult novels were often called comedies of manners, though an undertow of melancholy was rarely far from the surface. In these books, too, she examined a spate of breakdowns -- of communication, of relationships, of families, of sanity -- and the often turbulent psyches that lay beneath her characters' calcified British middle-class exteriors.
Reviewers sometimes chided Ms. Bawden for her plotting -- some novels had too much plot, they said; others too little. But she was, critics agreed, a master of realist description.
''Poll was the naughtiest one of the family,'' she wrote in her 1975 children's novel, ''The Peppermint Pig,'' ''and the dreadful thing happened on one of her naughty days; a dark day of thick, mustardy fog that had specks of grit in it she could taste on her tongue.''
Ms. Bawden's descriptive gifts were perhaps nowhere more evident than in two later books: the novel ''Circles of Deceit,'' a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1987, and the memoir ''Dear Austen,'' published in 2005.
In the novel, Ms. Bawden wrote of a troubled young man -- a character based on her son Nicholas, who had battled schizophrenia and committed suicide. In the memoir, she recounted the death of her husband in a railway accident that also left her badly injured.
Nina Mary Mabey was born on Jan. 19, 1925, in Ilford, near London. When she was 14, she and her schoolmates were evacuated to the countryside; she spent the war with a series of families in England and Wales.
As a young woman she studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford. After graduating, she married Harry Bawden, with whom she had two sons.
Her early novels, published in the 1950s, were mainly adult gothics and mysteries. By the middle of the decade, her marriage had ended in divorce; she wed Austen Kark in 1954, and they had a daughter.
In the early 1980s Nicholas Bawden, 33, left home and was never heard from again. His family learned months later that his body had been pulled from the Thames.
''If my son wanted to leave I should have left too,'' Ms. Bawden wrote her 1994 memoir, ''In My Own Time: Almost an Autobiography.'' ''This is what it feels like when pieces of you fall away.''
In 2002, on their way to a party in Cambridge, Ms. Bawden and her husband boarded a high-speed train from London. The train derailed in the Hertfordshire town of Potters Bar; Mr. Kark was killed instantly. Ms. Bawden awoke in the hospital with multiple broken bones to learn her husband was dead.
The Potters Bar crash, which killed seven and injured more than 70, was widely seen as a consequence of the privatization of Britain's railways. It was commemorated in ''The Permanent Way,'' a 2003 play by David Hare that featured a character based on Ms. Bawden.
Though Ms. Bawden suffered post-traumatic stress after the crash and was unable to write for several years, she eventually produced ''Dear Austen.''
''I refuse to feel badly done by in life,'' she told The Evening Standard of London in 2002. ''I could have been in a concentration camp or been born a paraplegic. My family have been so loving and supportive it is my duty to recover and get on with things for them.''
She became an outspoken advocate for train safety, lobbying for a full investigation into the accident. (Last year, a British court fined the company that operated the track at Potters Bar £3 million for safety violations that led to the derailment.)
Ms. Bawden was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1995.
Besides her son, Robert, Ms. Bawden's survivors include two stepdaughters, nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her daughter, Perdita Kark, died in March.
Though Ms. Bawden's fiction could spring from personal history, it nonetheless took liberties -- perhaps much-needed ones -- with sheer hard fact. In ''Circles of Deceit,'' the character based on her son vanishes, just as Nicholas did.
In the novel, he comes home again.

HEADLINE: Justice Department Joins Suit Against Poll Company

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Justice Department has joined a lawsuit accusing the Gallup Organization of filing false claims on contracts with the United States Mint, the State Department and other government agencies. A fired Gallup employee who became a whistle-blower, Michael Lindley, asserts in the lawsuit that he discovered that the polling company had engaged in widespread fraud against the government. The lawsuit, filed nearly three years ago and unsealed Wednesday in federal court, says Gallup routinely submitted inflated cost estimates.

HEADLINE: South Africa: Labor Unrest Spreads to More Platinum Mines

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Labor unrest in South Africa's platinum belt spread on Wednesday, raising concerns that anger over low wages and poor living conditions could generate fresh violence just days after 34 striking miners, many wielding machetes, were shot dead by the police.The world's top platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum, said Wednesday that it had received a demand for a pay increase from its South African workers, while Royal Bafokeng Platinum said a labor action by about 500 miners interrupted work at a shaft at its Rasimone mine. 
At Marikana, where the miners were killed, a somber-looking President Jacob Zuma, at right, visited Wednesday, standing under a parasol held by an aide to address around 2,000 subdued miners. ''This is painful to all of us,'' he said. ''It is not acceptable for people to die where talks can be held. But I do feel your pain.'' The Marikana strike has stoked worries about investing in Africa's biggest economy, where chronic unemployment and income disparities threaten stability.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Rose in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Americans bought more homes in July than in June and prices rose, a private industry group said Wednesday, evidence that the housing market is slowly recovering.The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes rose to 4.47 million in July, a 2.3 percent increase from the previous month. It was the first increase in three months.
But the recovery has been slow and uneven. July sales were below the 4.6 million pace reached in April and May. And the annual sales pace is below the roughly 5.5 million that economists consider healthy.

HEADLINE: Pop Stars Join Growing Effort To Aid the Poor

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
If there is such a thing as a prodigy in the world of philanthropy, Hugh Evans fits the bill. At 14, after visiting a Manila slum with the Christian humanitarian group World Vision, he returned to his middle-class home outside Melbourne, Australia, and announced to his mother he wanted to dedicate his life to ending extreme poverty. She laughed.''Like any mom, she said, 'Yeah, whatever,' '' he recalled with a chuckle. ''I said, 'I'm serious.' ''
He kept his word. While still a teenager he worked for a year at a South African orphanage. In college he started the Oaktree Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has raised millions for third-world schools and education programs. Then he helped lead a successful campaign to get Australia to double its foreign aid. That campaign kicked off in 2006 with the Make Poverty History Concert in Melbourne, which was designed to coincide with the G20 meeting of world financial leaders. 
Now, at 29, Mr. Evans, the co-founder of the Global Poverty Project, is organizing a similar concert on the Great Lawn in Central Park on Sept. 29 to call attention to crippling poverty in developing countries, just as world leaders converge on New York for their annual session at the United Nations General Assembly. He hopes to build a movement among the expected 60,000 concertgoers that will pressure world leaders to commit an additional $500 million for reducing poverty and eradicating diseases like polio and malaria.
A benefit concert on that scale is a tall order for any nonprofit organizer, much less one working in a new country. Yet in the space of 18 months Mr. Evans and his team not only persuaded city officials to grant a permit for one of the park's most hallowed spaces, but also persuaded executives at the concert promoter Goldenvoice to produce the show for no fee. And he cajoled several high-profile acts to donate their time: Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Foo Fighters, the Black Keys, Band of Horses and K'naan.
Pop concerts have long been used to urge the privileged to address the problems of the impoverished, going back to George Harrison's 1971 concert to help refugees from Bangladesh and Bob Geldof's 1985 Live Aid concert for victims of the Ethiopian famine. But the model for Mr. Evan's event is the Live 8 concerts that Mr. Geldof organized two decades later to pressure industrialized nations to cancel third-world debt and increase foreign aid. Those concerts were aimed at getting governments to act, rather than at collecting money.
Mr. Evans and his organization face significant hurdles. For starters a worldwide downturn has put pressure on budgets everywhere, making politicians averse to spending more on good works abroad. And if history is a guide, it is difficult to transform excitement over a concert into a coherent social movement.
''Celebrities are great for calling attention to a cause, but then you have to follow up to generate continued support or other kinds of involvement, and that's where these things usually fall short,'' said Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University.
Mr. Evans says the answer lies in harnessing the Internet and social media. And since the city required that 54,000 of the tickets be distributed free through a lottery, he is using the lure of tickets to generate support for the cause.
To get the free tickets to the show, Global Festival 2012, fans must sign up at globalcitizen.org and take some action, or at least what passes for action in the digital age. They get into the ticket lottery by watching videos about extreme poverty and disease around the world, posting information on social media, signing digital petitions or donating money to charities, among them Unicef and Rotary International. Mr. Evans said the intent is to ''gamify the whole experience'' and create a ''sustainable movement.''
''Instead of people going to Ticketmaster,'' he said, ''they actually have to earn their way into the concert. It's not just a one-off event. You are building a movement from the outset.''
More than 32,000 people have registered, and 7,000 of those have already received tickets.
Mr. Evans acknowledges that the concert will raise little money directly. The production costs are being underwritten by grants from philanthropic institutions like the Sumner M. Redstone Charitable Foundation and the Pratt Foundation. The organizers' approach stands in contrast to last year's Black Eyed Peas charity concert in the park. That event raised $4.8 million for the Robin Hood Foundation through the sale of 6,000 high-priced V.I.P. tickets.
The idea of using the concert to spur activism rather than raise money was a major selling point for the bands that signed on.
''I've never heard of anything like it really,'' said Patrick Carney, the Black Keys' drummer. ''It seems appropriate. Money doesn't go a super long way, most of the time. If we were to sell tickets to this thing, I don't know what that will accomplish, but getting 60,000 people aware of the organization, being involved in some way, is more valuable than generating a couple million dollars.''
Asking the audience to take action before the concert even started also appealed to Neil Young, who has a long history of social activism, his manager, Elliot Roberts, said.
''We get asked to do a lot of things for a lot of various reasons,'' he said. ''This one just feels like it was going to go past the event. That the event was the starting point.''
In conversation Mr. Evans comes across a true believer, a churchgoing crusader who is sometimes earnest to a fault and has tendency to slip into speechmaking. Asked why he and his new wife decided to move to New York City two years ago when neither of them had ties to the United States, he said, as if stating the obvious, ''America has a critical place to play in the end of extreme poverty.''
A few minutes later he bristled at the suggestion that he was asking people to take a political stand on foreign aid to get tickets to a public event. ''This transcends politics,'' he said.
Putting together the concert has required every ounce of Mr. Evan's considerable skills as a fund-raiser and organizer. The original idea for the Central Park concert was not his, but came from Ryan Gall, who founded the HOPE Campaign, a California group that raises money for projects in East Africa through the sale of albums and art. They met during a conference at Columbia University and agreed to work together.
The first step was persuading Bill Fold, a partner in Goldenvoice, a division of AEG Live, to back the project, Mr. Evans said.
''When I met him in person, I was instantly sold,'' Mr. Fold, 43, said. ''He's got a charisma, transparent and genuine. I'm pretty mesmerized by what he's done at such a young age.''
Mr. Fold brought in three veteran rock promoters in his company -- Brian Murphy, Rick Mueller and Mark Shulman -- who had influence with bands and knew how to navigate the city's permit process. While they set up meetings with band managers and city officials, Mr. Evans reached out to the artists through other channels, activating a network of celebrity supporters and sending emissaries to make entreaties.
Mr. Murphy said it became easier to persuade the musicians to sign on once Mr. Evans obtained permission in March to use Central Park. But in the end it was Mr. Evans's rhetorical skills that won over the band's managers. ''He just bleeds the cause, like it is his sole being,'' Mr. Murphy said.
Foo Fighters was the first major band to sign on, after Mr. Evans and Mr. Gall made a face-to-face appeal to the group's manager, John Silva, in Los Angeles last year.
''I think we caught him on a great day,'' Mr. Gall said. ''He did say the Foos have very few places on their bucket list to play, and Central Park is one of them.''
In May the Black Keys agreed to do the event after one of Mr. Evan's supporters, the supermodel Erin Heatherton, lobbied Mr. Carney, the drummer, whom she knew socially. Mr. Young and his band Crazy Horse were the last piece of the puzzle to fall in place, agreeing in July, Mr. Evans said.
''There were definitely times when you think to yourself, 'How on earth are we going to pull this off?' '' he said. ''It's not because people don't have good will. They do have good will. It's the fact you are juggling hundreds of different elements simultaneously.''

HEADLINE: Changes to Money Market Funds Stall

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER; Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Attempts to make sweeping changes to a popular type of mutual fund that played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis have been derailed.The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro, wanted to bring her vision for regulating money-market mutual funds to a vote as early as next week. But Ms. Schapiro acknowledged Wednesday evening that three of the five commissioners opposed her plan and said she was calling off the vote.
While opposition was certain from the two Republican members of the commission, the crucialswing vote, a Democratic commissioner, Luis A. Aguilar, said in an interview on Wednesday afternoon that he would feel comfortable voting only after significant further study of the industry.
Ms. Schapiro wanted the $2.6 trillion money market fund sector to start holding cash reserves or to let their share prices fluctuate, instead of promising to pay investors $1 for every $1 they put in, among other changes. 
After being informed of Mr. Aguilar's comments, Ms. Schapiro said Wednesday evening that she had given up on trying to sway her colleagues. Her decision is at least a short-term victory for the financial industry, which has sunk millions of dollars into lobbying against her plan.
''It's a tragedy that serious thoughtful proposals to shore up a major weakness in the financial system and protect American taxpayers from the potential need to bail out this industry can't even receive public comment and debate,'' Ms. Schapiro said in an interview.
Until the financial crisis, money market funds were considered a dull, low-return corner of the markets. But now, most of the nation's top financial regulators view the sector as one of the most vulnerable parts of the American financial system.
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, which supported Ms. Schapiro's plan, had been preparing for the possibility that the financial industry might prevail in stopping the S.E.C. regulations. The officials have discussed the possibility of using new powers to move regulation of money market funds to the Federal Reserve, according to people with knowledge of their thinking.
Ms. Schapiro said that she would now support efforts by other regulators to force reform on the industry.
''The issue is too important to investors, to our economy and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away,'' Ms. Schapiro said.
Officials have not used the new powers that were delegated to a body of top regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. It is unclear what they could mandate and how long the process would take.
Ms. Schapiro had the support of one of the S.E.C.'s two Democratic commissioners, Elisse B. Walter. But Mr. Aguilar, who was formerly the general counsel for Invesco, an asset manager that operates money market funds, said Wednesday that Ms. Schapiro and the S.E.C. staff had not adequately studied the issue before pushing for a vote.
''There's a lot that we know we don't know,'' said Mr. Aguilar, who had not talked about his views publicly for months. ''It would make sense for us to get a handle on those before we do a proposal.''
One of the Republican commissioners who had previously stated his opposition to Ms. Shapiro's proposal, Daniel M. Gallagher, said Wednesday that Ms. Schapiro and the S.E.C. staff had been unwilling to consider alternatives that he and others presented.
Ms. Schapiro said that she had seriously considered numerous proposals since the financial crisis, but had eventually decided it was time to act.
''This has been a very thoughtful and deliberative process that's taken two and a half years,'' said Ms. Schapiro. ''When regulators identify problems and don't speak up, you get financial crises. That's why it was so important to speak up about this issue.''
Regulators view the funds as vulnerable because they act like banks by taking in money and promising to return every dollar that investors put in. Unlike banks, though, they don't have to pay deposit insurance or keep capital buffers to protect against defaults.
The funds, which provide short-term loans to banks and other borrowers, grew wildly over the last 30 years because they typically offered a higher return than bank accounts and at their peak held $3.8 trillion.
Most investors have used the funds like low-risk bank accounts from which money could be immediately withdrawn.
But in the financial crisis the vulnerability of the funds was laid bare. In September 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund suffered losses on $785 million of debt issued by Lehman Brothers and fell below $1 a share, known as ''breaking the buck.''
Investors fled the Reserve Primary Fund and a panic ensued in which they withdrew about $300 billion from money market funds in one week, contributing to the credit freeze that gripped global markets. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department stepped in to bail out the money market fund sector with a guarantee and a special loan facility.
The S.E.C. voted in 2010 to introduce several new rules aimed at making the funds more stable. The most significant change forced fund managers to hold more assets that could be easily sold for cash.
The financial industry has said in recent months that the 2010 rules were successful in improving the safety and soundness of the industry, making further reforms unnecessary.
But Ms. Schapiro and other regulators have frequently said that the 2010 rules were only a first step and that more significant changes are still needed. In late 2011, she presented two reforms that have remained at the center of her efforts since.
One would require the funds to stop pricing their shares at a stable $1 value and instead use a so-called floating net asset value. Critics of the $1 share value have said it leads investors to believe that the value of a fund's holdings don't fluctuate and that their money is guaranteed.
The other potential reform would require fund managers to put aside an insurance buffer of capital that could be used to absorb losses. This could also be combined with some restrictions on the amount of money that investors could withdraw.
Ms. Shapiro presented her reforms to the other four S.E.C. commissioners in June and had intended to hold a vote on Aug. 29 on whether to release the proposal for public comment. That would have come before a final vote on the rules.
Major fund managers including Fidelity, Federated and Charles Schwab have rallied allies to oppose Ms. Schapiro's proposal. An industry group, the Investment Company Institute, said the supporters include 67 regional chambers of commerce, 105 House members and 10 state treasurers.
To counter the lobbying, leaders of the nation's top financial regulatory agencies voted unanimously in July to support Ms. Schapiro's ideas. Since then, the heads of several regional Federal Reserve banks have spoken publicly about the need for action.
Advocates of reform have said it is urgently necessary because the measures used to rescue the funds in 2008 were outlawed by the Dodd-Frank law. If the funds faced a run, regulators have said that they would have no way of stopping it.
''Money market funds effectively are operating without a net,'' Ms. Schapiro said.
Mr. Aguilar and Mr. Gallagher both said on Wednesday that they are not opposed to further reforms. But they said that they worried that the rules proposed by Ms. Schapiro would cause many investors in the funds to immediately withdraw their money.
Mr. Gallagher said that the process of the Federal Reserve assuming oversight of the funds would take too long and was a ''false threat.''
A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, said Wednesday night that the funds still pose a risk to the financial system.
''This was a key source of stress during the financial crisis, and it must be addressed,'' she said.
